"hafeez-2","9","429","569","26 January 2006"," Depth and detail - with no sides taken
","This movie relates more than just a story of ""Vengeance"". Besides proving that killing begets killing - it consists of numerous fine details that reveal the hard work done at getting to the depth of things:<br/><br/>For instance, only characters that get shot in the head slump to the ground. The rest take time to die - they walk a few steps, spurt blood and express a look of helplessness and inevitability before going out. Yes its horrifying to look at, which is the point, but it is also real. <br/><br/>Every character is different, and though common in their desire for vengeance, their temperaments are clearly distinguishable in the way the hit men approach their task. Even the terrorists are not stereotyped into hysterical, screaming lunatics. They range from the visibly nervous to the cool Abu Salameh with the movie star style. They are poets, intellectuals and guerrillas each with his story of the conflict. They speak passionately about home - a recurring theme, along with ""family"". Moreover, Spielberg does not attempt to mitigate the grotesque manner of their deaths, for the blood of the targeted men flows as freely as that of their victims - and when they are blown up, their body parts dangle from ceiling fans. You are not here to feel satisfaction over anyone's death, Spielberg says to the audience. Or as Caine would say in Kung Fu: ""The taking of a life does no one honour.""<br/><br/>There are no easy ""shoot-em-dead"" eliminations. There are neighbors, bystanders and obstacles that must be avoided and protected - with variable success. Innocent people may be harmed - and one has to live with that.<br/><br/>There are no mathematical certainties about the potential damage a bomb will cause. <br/><br/>Perspectives and convictions can change, sometimes regrettably. ""Don't think about it - just do it"" says Avner at one stage when a member of the team expresses doubts about a target's guilt. But at the end he wants evidence that the men he despatched were justifiably killed. Implausible? No; it is only when he has been reunited with his family and experiences the affection of wife and child that he allows himself to reflect from a different perspective - their targets had families too - what if he had killed the wrong men?<br/><br/>The paranoia that permeates the world of spies and assassins is built up gradually - to the point where every survivor mistrusts everybody else. One is doomed all one's life to walk with ears strained for following footsteps. The length of the movie creates the right atmosphere for this idea. <br/><br/>The end dissatisfies many because they would like a reassurance, a note of optimistic finality - but Spielberg rightly offers none. It would be dishonest of him to offer a false but comforting illusion.<br/><br/>It is interesting to contrast this movie with ""Paradise Now"" that has no violence, a modest budget, and views the conflict from the Palestinian camp. Both narrate completely different stories - yet, in their respective ways, both humanize their subjects, defuse myths about glory, and arrive at the same conclusion: ""There's no peace at the end of this."""
"jon.h.ochiai","10","249","341","7 January 2006"," Justice or Vengeance?
","Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?"" <br/><br/>At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.<br/><br/>In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything"" <br/><br/>Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","108","149","14 July 2006"," Spielberg may be out-of-touch with the masses in terms of entertainment today (WOTW)  but when he sticks to serious topics, he carves out sensational fares like this one
","Munich may just be Spielberg's greatest accomplishment ever and it isn't a sweeping epic like you'd expect, but a patient psychological thriller that sneaks up on you and takes you and shakes you. It not shy away from blood, politics or nudity in its portrayal of events and this makes it extremely intense, absorbing and occasionally very violent. <br/><br/>The first half of Münich is not altogether different from a heist drama; a group of diverse men with different skills team up to accomplish a mission. They get to travel across Europe, make deals, infiltrate suspect facilities and manufacture explosive devices. Unlike heist films, however, their mission is not for personal gain, but for the government. They are to assassinate eleven Arabs who were alleged to be behind terrorist attacks like Münich 1972. So the more accessible part of the film sees Bana and his men botch their way through a hit-list as inexperienced hit-men, fumbling and trembling with the weight of this somber new task.<br/><br/>This part is so extraordinarily well-handled and engaging with a tone so tense and shadowed by politics and ethical dilemmas that every slight pause is mistaken for humour. It is also an excellent portrayal of an era - the 1970s - with great eye for detail, all carefully sewn together by a master tailor (Spielberg). It is a fantastic piece of film-making.<br/><br/>While Munich keeps you interested throughout, it gradually loses its fresh thriller edge by opting for more typical scenarios. Eric Bana's character goes through emotional struggles because he finds it too hard to kill people. He thinks about his family--his wife has just had a baby girl. He wonders if he is doing the right thing. He starts sympathizing with the Arabs. He wonders if they killings will stop once he has completed his mission. Everything is classic and you saw it coming. It needs to be present in the film for a balanced portrayal but the hackneyed formula with which it is expressed is disappointing. It started so promising, after all.<br/><br/>Sadly, the culmination of this slightly hackneyed recipe manifests itself in the final scene of the film and it is absolutely dreadful and drags the whole film down by at least one star - but overall this is superb quality that is carried by a strong ensemble cast (Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig) although it is ultimately Bana's show. He captures the inner turmoil and hesitation of his character in the most believable way, making Munich into a worthwhile adventure for its performances alone. But most importantly, it dares to asks questions.<br/><br/>8/10"
"mlg-2","10","213","305","23 January 2006"," An extraordinary filmriveting, involving, challenging
","I am not a big Spielberg fan, and find he often goes for cheap emotional manipulation in his films, especially his endings. I was there fore amazed at the unflinching control he exercised in Munich, his utter unwillingness to flinch at complexities, his ability to dissect the ideological and moral sureties of all sides within the natural rhythms of the thriller genre. There is so much to praise in this film, because it is utterly seamless film-making with a keen eye for every little detail that never reveals the intense precision behind its construction.<br/><br/>While some have found the film ""disengaged,"" I found that it pulled at the viewer's conscience through the central characters, not only Bana's Israeli agent Avner and his cohorts, most of who slowly find themselves gnawed by doubts of their mission's morality and effectiveness, but also smaller characters as well, drawn with indelible deftnessthe weary ex-French Resistance fighter now a trader in deadly information to stateless agents because of his cynicism about recurrent corrupt regimes replacing each other, or the PLO operative who debates Palestinian strategy and justification with Avner, who he wrongly believes to be a German left-wing terrorist who is ""soft"" on Jews because of the Holocaust. The economy of Spielberg's film-making is breathtaking in hindsight, so that what at first seems a relatively flat and emotionless exercise in historical recreation slowly seeps into one's subconscious and then moves upward, in quick bursts of sudden bursts of emotional and intellectual recognition by the viewer. These are real human beings, these are fighters in a war they believe in desperately and whose people have suffered terribly yet can find no real peace.<br/><br/>For this Kushner and Roth's screenplay must get much credit, the crisp narrative development intertwined with intellectually rigorous set pieces and flat-out armrest-clutching actions sequences. John Williams, who has managed to be understated in the past, is equally adept at building (or feinting) tension and subtly commenting on character development. Check out the slightly dissonant piano in the last scene to see what I mean. Longtime Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski creates some amazing framing devices, especially as the action sequences are about to unfold and during moments of intimate conversations imbued with tension. Michael Kahn's editing is crisp and occasionally startling, as in the way the conclusion of the horrifically bungled Munich ""rescue"" is related. The retelling of the entire event from break-in to conclusion is doled out in bits and pieces in what seems at first an attempt to soften its impact but in the end, entwined as it is with all of the complicated issues, is finally revealed as a masterful means of achieving the fully deserved emotional impact within a complexly rendered ideological, moral and strategic matrix. There is not a false note in any of the acting, and the casting is uniformly spot-on.<br/><br/>About the politics. The radicals on either side will reject the film out of hand because it dares to render both sides as human and worthy of understanding. But attempting to understand choices of violence and vengeance as strategies does not in any way mean condoning them. Certainly, anyone who feels that the film somehow allows a viewer to walk away thinking that Black September was justified in its attack is probably projecting his or her fears about how some imagined uninformed viewer might react. Instead, the film demonstrates that whether one feels either or both sides justified it doesn't mannerneither side can win through violence at this point. This was Yitzhak Rabin's great insightyou don't make peace with your friends, you make peace with your enemies. His Israeli Jewish murderers wanted violence to continue, believing that only a continued state of war would keep Israel from giving back land they saw as bound up with their faith but which international law, historical study and the basic ""facts on the ground"" reveal to be bound to be returned to the Palestinians. Ariel Sharon, of all people, came to understand this, though without the larger vision and magnanimity of spirit that his fellow warrior Rabin discovered. Spielberg's message is clearthe extremists will choose war over peace, but must so many of us side with the extremists because of our fear of appearing weak or ""giving in""? A last note on politicsthere is clear relevance to the United States' current predicament post-9/11. One can almost here Cheney or Bush making the speech made by Israeli premier Golda Meir in the film (an extraordinary piece of recreation that transcends mere imitation), only probably with more moral surety and less sense of resignation. Anyone paying attention to world reaction to Guantanimo, Abu Gharib, the bombing of Afghan and Iraqi villages and the spiriting away of suspected terrorists through ""rendition"" for torture in ""friendly"" nations must be aware that whether one leans hard or soft on such matters, there is going to be a price to be paid. The hardliners believe we will just keep punching and slugging and eventually the bad guys will go down; that they will not reproduce themselves like the many-headed Hydra or germinate and reproduce by the thousands in the fetid waters of our perceived hypocrisywhether you think it justified or not it doesn't matter. As Spielberg makes clear in this film, all that matters in the end is peace or violence, and whoever ultimately desires the former had better be damn sure that their use of the latter is measured by the awareness that it use will create debts that will need to be repaid in the end, and the debtors will most likely be the generations to come on all sides."
"Rathko","9","348","514","10 January 2006"," An Outstanding Thriller
","'Munich' is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only 'Munich' is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of 'Munich' are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.<br/><br/>What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller, is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography  'Munich' is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with 'Munich', created perhaps the first truly adult movie of his career. We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With 'Munich', he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi.<br/><br/>'Munich' is an intelligent and gripping thriller that is a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so. An outstanding achievement."
"marcosaguado","8","463","695","23 December 2005"," A Half Cooked Masterpiece
","Steven Spielberg has absolutely everything at his disposal, he can make an epic in no time at all. But, even he must know that films, most films have a soul and that can't be rushed. Why the need to rush this film into screens? For Oscar consideration? If there was a film that needed nurturing and thought was this one. The length is a flaw in itself. It makes it appear self indulgent and, quite frankly,annoying. If one could, and one should, put that aside, ""Munich"" is a remarkable experience. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth deal with people in all its complexity - a welcome new detail in a Spielberg film - and that gives ""Munich"" its most powerful aspect. Eric Bana is extraordinary and the humanity of his gaze is confusing and recognizable at the same time. His crying at hearing his child's voice over the phone is as real as his hardness when he massacres his targets. The controversy raising after the first public screenings seems pre-fabricated by a marketing machine. The questioning of Bana's character and the appalling nature of revenge can't be controversial it's at the base of human nature. To call Spielberg ""no friend of Israel"" is as absurd as it is suspicious. No, this movie is a thriller, based on actual events, directed by the greatest craftsman of the last 30 years in a record amount of time. Go see it."
"lavatch","Null","356","548","23 December 2005"," Mr. Spielberg's ""Prayer for Peace""
","In an interview given shortly before the release of ""Munich,"" director Steven Spielberg discussed his film in the context of world terror today, as follows: ""Somewhere inside all this intransigence, there has to be a prayer for peace."" <br/><br/>I personally recall the tragic events of the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, as I had just graduated from college and was following closely the moving and graphic images on television, as described so vividly by newscasters Jim McKay and Peter Jennings. The opening scene of ""Munich"" recreates the attack on the dormitory and the subsequent killing of the athletes at the airport. Those were ten minutes of taut and riveting drama.<br/><br/>But the main dramatic impetus of ""Munich"" is the retaliation on the Palestinian planners of the ""Black September"" massacre. The strike force is led by the character Avner, a zealous and patriotic member of Israel's Mossad. Along with Eric Bana in the role of Avner, the entire cast of ""Munich"" is superb. Geoffrey Rush is a standout as the Mossad handler of Avner, and in an all-too-brief scene, Lynn Cohen turns in a charismatic performance as Golda Meir.<br/><br/>But ""Munich"" is not a film to discuss in terms of star performances, and much credit should go to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth for the thoughtful ensemble screenplay. The most memorable moments in the film are those involving the hit team led by Avner. In the planning and carrying out of the assassinations by a small group of men, it becomes clear that the participants are no more than ordinary people who become obsessed with killing. Thus Avner, who would prefer the domestic world of living with his wife and newborn daughter, descends into a virtual state of madness as a result of the killing frenzy.<br/><br/>The Greek poet Aeschylus wrote one of the most expressive works of literature on the theme of ""an eye for an eye"" in the revenge trilogy ""Oresteia."" That epic work dramatizes the culmination of the long cycle of murder within the ill-fated House of Atreus in Greek mythology. The killings finally end when the goddess Athena establishes the law court in Athens to provide human justice, as opposed to blood vengeance. Orestes succumbs to the pursuit of the furies and spirals into madness. That was the precise tragic journey of Avner, as depicted in ""Munich.""<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg's concept of ""intransigence"" gets to the heart of the matter in our own modern tragic experience. In the Oxford English Dictionary, the word intransigence is defined as ""uncompromising hostility; irreconcilability."" Like the ""Oresteia,"" the film ""Munich"" provides a balanced and powerful commentary on the human impulse of ""an eye for an eye"" revenge. The ancient Greek concept of justice meant something like ""scale"" or ""balance"" used to resolve a seemingly irreconcilable conflict. The thoughtful and powerful film ""Munich"" offers us the opportunity to meditate on this concept, not for the 5th century B.C. world of Aeschylus, but for our own."

","Another dip in the Spielberg pool and I come away drenched in emotion. I was a freshman in high school in Texas during the Munich games. I was stunned by the events and understood little.<br/><br/>Today, I am still stunned by Munich and every terrorist act that followed, but I understand so much more and grieve. Spielberg gives us a powerful glimpse into the meaning of home, family, honor, history, ethics, and faith. The movie is not about the Jews and Arabs. It's about human beings. It's about us.<br/><br/>The narrative is driven by our connection to Avner. We watch as Eric Bana opens himself up in a way that the likes of a George Clooney in Syriana only dreams of.<br/><br/>This is a must see."
"steph-oakley","7","16","20","16 February 2006"," How not to end a film.
","Putting history to one side and viewing it purely as cinematic entertainment, the first two hours are quite thrilling. With good story telling, realistic acting (apart from some dodgy accents) and big explosions, it's all quite compelling.<br/><br/>Without going into the story too much, 5 Jewish hit men are assigned to assassinate the 11 perpetrators of the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage disaster. All the hits are styled in a hand held camera fashion, which adds great tension and realism in true Spielberg style. Yes, the action is exceptional. There are two fantastic scenes where the hit men themselves get caught up in their own hit i.e. explosives and being too close when it goes off.<br/><br/>Although Munich plays accurately to the tragic 1972-hostage situation (so I believe), it's still a ham-fisted film. Some scenes don't knit together well and confuse cinema-goers, especially after the two-hour mark. That's when the film really goes down hill, but I'll get to the crap ending soon...so please be patient The overall style of the film plays like a documentary at times, especially the start. When story kicks in, it's all very typical of Spielberg and his limited view of outer USA. In a way this isn't a criticism, more of a observation i.e. when in Paris we see the Eiffel Tower, when in Amsterdam everybody rides push bikes, and so on. Clichés like this are always prevalent with American filmmakers. I was disappointed when in London we didn't see the Tower or Big Ben, although it was raining.<br/><br/>Now to the big issue, and it is big my friends. This is a big spoiler so stop reading now if spoilers aren't your thing. The ending, apart from being 30 minutes too long is awful. The camera splits between Eric Bana (Avner) having sex with his wife and the final act of the hostage talking where the hostages are brutally shot and blown up in a helicopter all synchronised with Avners almighty orgasm. It was truly sickening. Spielberg's a master filmmaker with yes men for editors who can't keep his films under two hoursbut hey, that's just me."

","Reading over the comments and message board postings for Munich on this site, I get the impression that at least 75% of the people here are less interested in discussing the film and its message than the Arab-Israeli conflict in general.

The ones who have actually seen the movie, that is.<br/><br/>This film was a masterpiece, and it's refreshing to see such a heavy, thought-provoking film released by a major studio.

I don't know that a masterpiece is necessarily perfect, so, viewers will undoubtedly find faults in this movie, some of which have already been expressed in the comment section. But masterpiece or not, I really liked this movie. It told a particular side of the story and told it well. And if you witnessed any of the tragedy of Munich in the summer of 1972, you feel a connection to the events portrayed in this movie. We, the audience, become a member of the hit squad able to empathize with the angst in becoming assassins with consciences, as collateral damage does matter. But the trouble with trying to maintain a conscience is that each notch on the belt is another slash of your humanity ripped from your soul. You squirm from living in the uncertainty of trusting people you are suspicious of in order to fulfill your mission. You nervously plan the pathway to the next target. You seethe with the frenzy of the kill. You perpetually twitch in the paranoia of becoming the hunted, ""sleeping"" with one eye open and a finger on the trigger. In the beginning you are swept away by your sense of duty to God and country above all else. In the end you are cynical, angry and afraid about what you have done and what you have become.<br/><br/>There are many other sides of this story. It is left to other movies or media to tell those versions. I won't take this one as a definitive history lesson on the subject. Instead I'll take it as a captivating tale of a struggle of life and death played on a complex stage of geopolitics."
"nycritic","10","84","130","30 January 2006"," Terrorism, Then and Now
","What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.<br/><br/>This led to the Israeli government to have the Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- track down and kill every terrorist responsible for the killings. For this they hired one of Golda Meir's bodyguards, known as Avner, put him in a special ops team, and gave them minimal information about these terrorists. Avner on his own is able to strike back at the ""supposed"" terrorists via the appearance of a shady Parisian named Louie, but as the assignments become more and more difficult, he wonders if it is all worth it, and once his own team gets decimated by counter-agents, he wonders if behind every terrorist there is a even more dangerous one just waiting in the wings with ways to get back at him and his family.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is at his best when not directing sci-fi movies. The world of 1972 hasn't changed a bit then from now: when one sees the events of September 11, 2001 (and the World Trade Center inserted into the New York City skyline right at the final scene), and the political interests which led to their horrific unfolding on American soil -- once a concept thought unthinkable -- it becomes food for thought if behind every Saddam, every Osama, there aren't tens, if not hundreds, waiting, with more reasons to hate the Western world for butting their heads in their business. Avner, while a minion of Israel, ponders these things, and is himself terrorized when he comes to America to live a life away from the madness he was involved in: namely, the never-ending conflict between Israel and Palestine, both fighting for what they consider home. As one PLO member effectively says: ""Home is all we know."" <br/><br/>No right, no wrong, but a grey middle is the prevalent tone in MUNICH. While re-enacting a swift retribution against those who destroy order would be the thing to do, what does it solve? Spielberg doesn't say. What he does do is create an increasing, nail-biting suspense that Hitchcock himself would have loved -- and this film, reminiscent itself of SABOTAGE, is proof that terror and mayhem at the hands of subversives is still a thing of now as much as then and that innocents are always on hand to pay with the intended victims. One sequence, as the foursome wait for their first target to pick up the phone but find that his young daughter has not left the house yet, is incredibly powerful. Another one is when Avner waits for a bomb to go off in the room beside him. Nothing is ever clean and easy in the real world, and even bombers can never really know what to expect from their toys, and all one can do is wait and wait and wait.<br/><br/>MUNICH has strong performances all throughout. Eric Bana is tortured as Avner, a man who only wants to be with his wife and young daughter and cannot escape the horrors he has seen. Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz, Lynn Cohen, Hans Ziechler, Michael Lonsdale, and Mathieu Amalric all supply great support in a well-rounded cast and flesh out great characters in this excellent, if morally ambiguous story."
"tieman64","Null","100","158","20 May 2008"," Another silly Spielberg fantasy
","""Munich is serious, adult film-making at its most nugatory, and America will never produce political movies of any depth if we reward work of this calibre."" - Alan Dale<br/><br/>""Munich"" begins on a strong note, Spielberg's documentary camera capturing Black September gunmen as they break into the Olympic dorms and mercilessly gun down a group of Israeli athletes. Like ""Schindler's List"" and the best bits of ""Saving Private Ryan"", Spielberg's camera dispassionately and objectively records what it sees. There's no forced storytelling or clunky moralising.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's all downhill from here, as Spielberg turns what would could have been a riveting docudrama into a simplistic morality tale. Everything about Munich reeks of bad art. Its dialogue is didactic, its pacing is awkward, its flashbacks are jarring, its politics are sanitized, its music is hokey, its characters are cardboard, its plot is completely ahistorical and its ""family metaphors"" are tedious. Throw in Avner's (the film's lead assassin) forced ""moral tragedy"", the obligatorily ""child in peril sequence"", comedic sex and countless needlessly long scenes, and you have Spielberg's most annoying ""serious project"" since ""AI"".<br/><br/>When promoting the film, Spielberg said: ""The thing I'm very proud of is that Tony Kushner and I did not demonize anyone in the film. They're individuals. They have families."" <br/><br/>Yes, there's no evil in Spielberg's world. There's no complex motivation, judgement, ambivalence or scepticism. No understanding of how the world really works. Spielberg doesn't deal with irrational motivation, passionate beliefs, unforgiving rage- all facts of life commonly found in the Middle East. Instead it's all ""lets just get along"". As a result, there's no real understanding of why the athletes were kidnapped, no talk of Palestinian oppression, or how ideologies are bred and mismanaged. <br/><br/>Not once did I believe that this was how real assassins act, look, talk or behave. The real Avner faced no moral dilemma nor did he question whether or not killing 11 Palestinians was the same as killing 11 Israelis. George Jonas, the guy who wrote Vengeance, even disliked the film. His book was written to justify counter terrorism by showing the evil of, not the Palestinians, but the elite who used patriotism and islamofascism to breed hate among their own people. ""Munich"" washes it's hands of all that. It's simply content to regurgitate the same clunky message preached in Adam Sandler's ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"". IE-""violence breeds violence"" and ""everyone has a family, so lets chill out baby, because deep down we're all the same!"" <br/><br/>But of course if everyone were equal, there would be no conflict. It is precisely inequality and injustice that is the problem. But no, Spielberg romanticises everyone. Far from being an oppressed minority, the Palestinians are portrayed as educated intellectuals and sexy hit women. Similarly, the Israeli's go to great lengths to prevent collateral damage. When they do accidentally kill innocents it's only because the French (those pesky French!) intentionally gave them the wrong explosives. And of course Spielberg's Israeli's aren't stone cold killers and trained professionals. No, they're toy makers and accountants with silly moral dilemmas.<br/><br/>It's all well and good to paint everyone in a falsely positive light, but if you're not going to examine the roots of anything, at least show the evil on both sides. Show some sort of truth. Spielberg says that counter terrorism is just as bad as terrorism, but you can morally justify between counter terrorism and terrorism, the same way you distinguish between war and war crimes. It is possible to say that the Palestinian cause is as honourable as the Israeli cause, but it's not possible to say that terror is as honourable as resisting terror unless the initial terror is portrayed as being rational resistance.<br/><br/>And so the film pretends to be critical of Israel, but in actuality it dare not show the true horrors of Israeli violence. We can see the brutal horrors of the Munich massacre, but we are denied the Israeli violence that instigated it. The end result is that Spielberg turns Avner into yet another Jewish victim, an object of sympathy in a situation in which he is precisely not the victim. In contrast, the Palestinian Other is denied a voice, denied any context, history or motive. The symbolic necessity, as Sartre argued, of targeting the Olympic Games, is thus completely ignored.<br/><br/>The reason Spielberg takes his silly ""we're all the same"" stance is because he can't bare to paint either side in even the faintest of bad lights. He thinks he's chosen the moral high road, when in fact, by ignoring all truth he's chosen no road at all. The high road is cold objective truth, but Spielberg has always been more interested in sanitizing history by avoiding painful traumas.<br/><br/>But ignoring the philosophy of the film, ""Munich"" still fails as basic entertainment. It becomes tiresome and repetitive, utilizing an obvious and predictable narrative progression which attempts to show that Avner's growing doubt is proportional to each assassination. Too slow to work as a thriller, the film also fails as a personal tragedy, Avner's inner turmoil never convincingly explained. Thin Spielberg characters are usually not this bothersome, but here their sign posted, theatrical moral monologues come across as obvious and lowbrow. <br/><br/>There are other problems too. Why would a hit-man be so traumatised? Why would he ""recollect"" events he didn't witness? Of course, by showing the massacre in flashbacks, Spielberg hopes to build to a horrific death/sex crescendo. But it all feels silly. Spielberg's handling of sex and adult relationships has never been good.<br/><br/>4/10- A superficial, safe and self-important fantasy movie, churned out without much intelligent thought. ""Paradise Now"", ""Z"" and ""The Battle of Algiers"" tackle similar material in a much better way. Similarly, see ""Day of the Jackal"" or ""Black Sunday"" (anything by mid-period Frankenheimer and Costa Gavras) for Spielberg's ""70's thriller"" aesthetic done right."
"filmforum1","8","24","34","15 January 2006"," A fine effort indeed
","Just because this film has been attacked by pols and shills, here's my 2 cents. Spielberg manages to set the agenda, and sets it correctly. It is indeed about the antecedents to 9/11, and bravo to Spielberg for taking it on, but not somewhere in Afghanistan, but at its genesis, the squalor of Palestine. <br/><br/>Spielberg's film is an essay on revenge and how hopeless and self-defeating that ancient temptation is. It's brave of Spielberg to say it to us now; brave, too, to paint the avenging Israelis as somewhere below the Angels. Let's be candid: There are harsh sentiments expressed here, by some Israeli characters, that the Evangelical Lobby simply doesn't want aired. <br/><br/>Spielberg's handling of the Bana character is masterful. Noteworthy is how uncompromising it is: this is a man whose identity has collapsed. It's entirely right that his Israeli handler should refuse the Sabbath-meal invitation at the end, realizing that the bonds of the older religion (and pre-Zionist identity) are shattered and meaningless.<br/><br/>Spielberg might have improved this product (some of the dialogues are horribly wooden). But that's not important. That a mainstream US film should go where this film goes is significant. This is a major-minor event in Spielberg's long and luminous career."

","If you ask me who was the most talented director working in film today, I'd hesitate for a while. Then I'd look at you and say, ""Probably Steven Spielberg'. A lot of film directors in Hollywoodwho are well-known are overrated (Oliver Stone, Sofia Coppola, Anthony Minghella, etc), but one that is not overrated at all is Spielberg. The man is obviously a cinematic genius who thrilled and enthralled us with his grim but unimaginably powerful WWII epic 'Saving Private Ryan', his still-frightening 'Jaws', his severely underrated 'Amistad' and of course, his heart-breaking masterpiece that still remains one of the twenty best films of all time 'Schindler's List'. I can't even begin to describe to you how jazzed I was about the controversial vengeance drama 'Munich', which was Spielberg's first Oscar-contending movie in seven years. After viewing it I have to say I was a bit let down, but I still got what I predicted I'd get going into the theater -- the best film of 2005. Spielberg challenges our beliefs on justice with his intense but painfully realistic bone-chilling masterpiece. You have to see this movie.<br/><br/>Almost around the age of 45-50 remembers the 1972 Olympics incident that happened in Munich. On a gloom September day, eleven innocent Israeli athletes were abducted and taken prisoner by a mob of Palestinian terrorists. The terrorists held them hostage at the Munich airport, then based on a mistake by the Munich police department many terrorists were killed and took all of the unfortunate hostages with them. The film starts after these events when Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), secretly decides to start a small mission to find the Palestinian's responsible and murder them. She hands the case down to case officer Ephraim (Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush - Shine) who hands it over to Meir's ex-bodyguard Avner (Eric Bana - Troy). Avner must leave his family to undergo this mission and form a team to help him complete it. The team is; Steve (Daniel Craig - Layer Cake), the trigger-man, Carl (Ciarin Hinds - HBO's Rome) the clean-up man, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz - Birthday Girl), an ex-toy maker turned explosives expert, and the elderly Hans (Hanns Zischler - Undercover) who is a forging expert. They five go on a mission of vengeance, but are soon faced with unexpected problems in the process and feelings of guilt which lead some to believe maybe what they are doing isn't righteous.<br/><br/>When creating 'Munich' Steven Spielberg could have sided one way or the other on issue 'revenge killing', but he doesn't, and I strongly admire that. Instead, Spielberg does what any intellectual would do, he presents situations and historical truths and makes you decide for yourself. That's something you can't expect nasty politically-slanted morons like Michael Moore to do. Spielberg provides us with the best film directing in two years with his quiet stroke of genius that is Munich. Spielberg's directing is both electrifying during the action sequences and beautiful during the poignant and thought- provoking scenes like when Kassovitz's Robert questions Bana's Avner about the good of what they are doing in a subway station on the way to assassinate another target. Munich's film editing and cinematography both should win Oscars, while the acting (which isn't getting much acclaim from award mediums) is frightfully close to perfect. Eric Bana gives the performance of his career as Avner that will no doubt impress you, while Kassovitz, Zischler and Craig exceptional also. Rome's Ciarin Hinds turns in an outstanding performance as the ultra-cool clean-up guy Carl that should also win an Oscar nomination, while Geoffrey Rush does wonders with a small role as Avner's case officer (so does Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir). <br/><br/>If Spielberg's 'Munich' doesn't tug at your chest at the end, I would question your humanity. Spielberg doesn't butter this up so it goes down easier, he aims straight for the gut with his razor sharp realism and rubs salt in the wound. 'Munich' isn't a fun film, but there is no question it is a riveting and nearly flawless one. You will have a lot to talk about after the film has ended. With 'Munich', Steven Spielberg gives us one hell of a history lesson. Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 1/7/05)"
"jprochazka","1","112","185","6 March 2006"," Huh? Did we see the same movie? I have a ton of questions.
","Americans helped get terrorists over the fence? This is so irresponsible. It's the first of many contrived scenes.  One Jewish athlete holds off eight terrorists at his door so Spielberg can set up tension? He didn't look like the 300 pound gorilla that was historically at that door.  We're supposed to believe that the terrorists were watching the news. The news was US and in1972 there was no Cable, no satellite. What news were they watching? German? We're supposed to believe that the Germans actually broadcast vital sniper positions to the terrorists? Eric Bana's character, Avner, is told he may have to leave Israel for years to finish his mission. Why did Avner move his family to NewYork? There was no good reason except to get his World Trade Center shot.  Jews were not mad at Golda Meir for not negotiating with the terrorists. It's preposterous to even make that claim in the film. Why put American money in a box? Wouldn't they use Deutsch Marks? He was in Germany. In 1972, there was no way to spend US dollars in Europe  Why 6 boxes? Couldn't the money fit in one? Why is his German friend at the lunch meeting where he is going to ask for the names of the people responsible for Munich? Dialogue was so stupid, ""If you tell anyone . . . I don't know what I'll do.""  Why in the first killing of the terrorists do they look nervous? Wasn't Avner Mossad? He was also a former bodyguard to the prime minister. Now he looks like a scared school boy. What?  No one heard those shots? I've been to Europe; those high arches would have echoed that sound for miles.  Why are they celebrating or rejoicing their killing? These are trained Mossad agents. No?  Why is Avner haunted by the Munich games and have these visions? He wasn't there.  Why would an affluent Parisian Arab like Mohammad Hamshari not have a phone at his desk?  That whole scene with the girl coming back is not only a cheap plot device to pull at our heart strings, it also is totally unrealistic and messed up. If you look closely, it's so messed up they had to drive the car backwards to arrive back in front of the house, otherwise they would have been spotted by Ciaran Hines. I am supposed to believe that the bomb expert, Robert, had to remove two pieces of tape and give Ciaran Hines enough time to run to the car and stop him? Wouldn't he have the key ready to go?  He returns to Israel for his child's birth. Why can't he go home? Obviously, he did. So, what's the drama? Again, why make his wife leave?  His Dad was a war hero, but in prison for his birth? What's going on?  When they have the scene with the hotel bomb, why does he have to be in the next room? The bed spring bomb device tells you when the victim has lied down?  Why does the Arab say he looks like a Swede? Don't Swedes have blond hair and blue eyes? Did I miss a joke?  Bad enough he is in the hotel room next to the bomb, why would he switch off the lamp so close to the door. Wouldn't a trained Mossad agent take precautions?  Why is the only damage to the Couple next door the woman's eyes? How did that happen?  What's up with Louis and Papa? They say they don't work with governments. Who else would want names of the people responsible for the Munich Massacre? Rich Americans? Why? This is RIDICULOUS!!  Why does he want to go to Beirut? Why are they not allowed to go to Arab countries? In Beirut, in the dress in drag scene o Why does everyone get shot in sequence o This scene is full of problems. Why do all these Mossad agents run down stairs in a single file? Why don't any of the Arabs shoot these guys as they are running down the stairs in a single file line?  Why would Louis have the PLO and Avner's team shack up in the same safe house?  Why do they yell their terrorist affiliation to strangers? Why speak English and then German?  Language is all messed up.  Avner's conversation with the PLO guy was terrible. In Greece, why does Hans bring an extra grenade, especially after Robert tells them that they are all old and should be thrown away? Robert says, ""I am trained to dismantle bombs, not to make them."" THINK ABOUT THIS!!! HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DISMANTLE A BOMB AND NOT KNOW HO TO MAKE ONE! Why in the middle of the film are all these trained Mossad agents now questioning what they are doing?  Am I the only one that found a Mossad agent sniffing the air for the scent to Carl's door as absolutely ridiculous? He says ""I saw her first,"" walks away, and then, I guess his Mossad secret agent senses kick in, and he comes back to the door. Why did they use Zip air pump guns to kill the Dutch woman? Why not sue guns? o Also, why is it when they're screwing and loading their zip guns, instead of pulling the gun out of the drawer and shoot them, she instead flashes her right breast. This whole scene is ridiculous  Why after Hans is missing do we find him sitting on a park bench? How did we get there?  The rest of the film descends into total chaos with him going crazy, and by this point, I just can't believe this film got a nod for best picture."

","I like to swim more deeply in film than Spielberg. So although he makes somewhat effective films, they leave me wondering why they were made.<br/><br/>Well, we know why this, ""Schindler"" and ""Ryan"" were made. Its because after skimming a gazillion dollars by amusing us, this man wants to be seen as a weighty, ""real"" filmmaker. A Kubrick that likes to occasionally have fun. We all know these films to be made on ostentatiously weighty material, so they must be deep. <br/><br/>I had the highest hope for this one, because I know he was stung by how poorly the others were received by people he trusts. So here, he goes back to his method of ""Close Encounters"" which was supposed to use New Wave techniques and to circumnavigate what was then new ideas about noir. I liked it. It took chances and where it failed it did so interestingly, even in the more ambitious later cut.<br/><br/>This uses standard (meaning later) Spielberg techniques. Despite his vaunted cinematic storyboarding technique, all the emotional content here is spoken. All the emotional reference is off screen. There are violent acts, but these seen deliberately bloodless, like an Indiana Jones movie would have then, something abstract to talk about. The intended effect was to haunt by the reality that punches through the rationalization. The reality here never gets a chance because its all so movieworld.<br/><br/>That's the problem. He wants to make a film that resonates because it hurts, because it ties knots in us. He just cannot. Its still just a script. Consider the last scenes. These are powerfully written. There are a dozen other filmmakers who could have made them work.<br/><br/>We've been through an entire story to set up the haunting ambivalence in our hero. He is finally able to be with his wife and as he makes love to her, the only think he can see are the hostage deaths not fully shown until this moment, charmed into their horror by human touch. This is followed by her gently caressing the face of her man, accepting all that has come before. If I read this by a good writer, I would be crippled for weeks.<br/><br/>But see how Steven has rendered it. All the pieces are there but the cinematic machine isn't assembled. We have gone all this time, and been set up so well for nothing. I am reminded of ""Monster's Ball,"" which is constructed the same way. Its value is all in the very end, where we have Berre sitting on a stoop in a state of bewildered acquiescence. This could have been more. It was far less, a remote poster.<br/><br/>Good script. I intend to read it and imagine the film that could have been.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","I lived in Munich in 1972, so I wanted to see this movie. I understand that the movie is only loosely based on actual events and the rest is based on a fictional book. I understand that Spielberg wanted to give us a message that violence against violence will create more violence.<br/><br/>But did he have to make that movie so boring? I do not like to see violent movies but in some instances it may be necessary to make a point. But I see no point in showing a bleeding completely naked woman as long as possible, but for some sick gratification. I also found the copulation scene at the end a step in the wrong artistic direction. There was really nothing in the movie which could hold my attention. And I should have been fascinated because I practically knew every location they showed. Maybe Spielberg should think about retiring? I heard that no attempt was made by Spielberg or Kushner to contact anybody who was actually involved in Israel. Why make a movie and use on one side actual material and then make no attempt to try to portray the truth and facts? At least this movie did not get much attention at the Oscar nods."

","Having been instructed to sit down and view this film by one of its admirers I prepared myself to be told a good story about an historical event. As the movie unreeled, however, I found I was treated to a shameful falsification of history and what looked more like a propaganda tool for the Israeli government than a true story.<br/><br/>Mr Spielberg began his tale by eliminating a rather telling point: the reason why these militants decided to do what they did at Munich. That reason being the continued unrelenting bombing of innocent civilians in refugee camps by the Israeli military. When people see their innocent loved ones blown to bits they tend to get a little upset and want to have vengeance.<br/><br/>The dehumanizing way the Palestinians are depicted in this film, as if they are nothing but dirt under the fingernails, is sharply contrasted by the hilariously ""noble"" depictions of the Israeli assassins, even showing their concerned wives and children (do not the Palestinians have wives and children?). After awhile it was simply too much to bear and I felt sullied by having to sit through such rubbish, complete with sex and violence, made by a director who has never been known for taste, subtlety, story-telling ability or good judgment.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie to anyone at all, certainly not to anyone who is interested in the truth of this matter."

We always see things on the news about the fighting and the hatred, but this movie shows us a glimpse of the actual people who are affected and their emotions. It's not a typical Hollywood movie, at ALL. I didn't even know that it was a Spielberg movie until the very end, and I'm glad I didn't know. It was just such a ""real"" movie, not fake or dramatic or forced. It was like you were watching a real man going through real experiences, and you never feel like you're taking sides, you just get lost in the hopelessness of it all. Although you feel like the situation is hopeless, you don't feel like the movie was a waste of time, because this is a real conflict in the world, and you just feel a little more informed, and thankful for that.

I believe that when making a film about an historical event the director has an obligation to either portray that event as faithfully as possible or to clearly state that it does not. The film begins with the words ""Inspired by real events"" which is merely a disingenuous muddling of the fact that this film is a complete fiction. It is not only dishonest but damaging to Hollywoodize history in this way, for both the real people touched by these events and the people who will come away from this film believing it to be the truth.<br/><br/>There were two documentaries about the post-Munich events shown recently on British TV.

After struggling to prevent myself leaving the cinema within the first ten minutes I found myself repeating just that line in my head as I struggled through the unwieldy and overblown three hours that make up the ""Munich"" ""epic"".<br/><br/>The length is pretty incomprehensible and completely unjustifiable as Spielberg goes in for innumerate lengthy pans on the characters faces which reveal precisely nothing (the worst scene being a completely comical flashback scene as Azner has sex with his wife whilst being ""haunted"" by the events in Munich he didn't actually see) and includes gratuitous panoramic views of nearly every city in the world.<br/><br/>With a terrible script to work from (speaking other languages I wasn't spared from the awfulness of the dialogue in German or French) the actors managed to match it with their delivery. Identification with any of the characters was completely impossible as Spielberg regularly and cringe-worthily tried to dip into the ""buddy movie"" genre with dialogues between the ""crack team"" of Israeli operators (about as crack as a WI reunion).<br/><br/>The dinner they enjoyed together with awful banter flowing across the table about being toy-makers or furniture dealers sat very awkwardly with feeble jokes about receipts and the role of the South African (I don't look forward to the next James Bond film if that performance is anything to go by) was a mystery to everyone including the actor himself.<br/><br/>Well, I can't even begin to emphasise how boring, how much of a waste of time and how completely unengaging this film was, but if you liked Troy (also starring Azner as Hector) and other abominations of movies of a similar ilk then run to the cinemas, throw over your money and take in yet another slice of Hollywood tripe masquerading as an artistic and thought provoking work."
"WeeWillC","7","61","104","25 December 2005"," Spielberg's back with a vengeance
","Munich is getting extremely mixed reviews -- from a coronation by Roger Ebert to a trashing from Anthony Lane. My response is somewhere between the two. As a thriller, it is a little predictable for three hours, I accept that. Nevertheless, I've rarely shared a character's (Bana's character's) sense of being hunted before in a movie. Yes, it's a little heavy hitting on the sermonic/moralising side -- but it is Spielberg, and you expect a little didactic direction there. The last scene, with the appearance of the World Trade Center (it's 1972) hammers the 9/11 commentary in a little too much for my liking. For minutes leading up to it, it was obvious that the two characters would end their dialogue with the twin towers in view. I was sitting in the theatre thinking, okay, pan a little more to the right, bring them in ... that's it ... there you go! And then there's the much discussed final sex scene between bana's character and his wife. inter-cut with images of the Munich killings. I interpreted this to be a comment on the endless cycle of violeve: go forth and multiply, the biblical Israel is told, and with every new child is born another subject of generational hatred and the need for vengeance. Others have interpreted this scene more ""redemptively"" -- new life entering the world, the morning after the darkest night, etc. Overall, it's a good, possibly important, film which misses some opportunities for subtlety and implied comment. Tony Kushner's role seems to have been to polish -- and he had literally only weeks to do that. An original screenplay from Kushner would have improved this considerably. That's not to give the movie a slating: i'd recommend it to anyone, and it has to be considered for some awards. The inevitable controversy in the U.S. about anti-semitism in the film is simply beyond stupid and beyond contempt."

Probably the most important member is the bomb maker so who do Mossad employ ? Someone who strangely has no experience of making bombs ! He's such a liability he almost kills a fellow agent , fails to kill a target during another operation due to his lack of bomb making experience and eventually blows himself up a farm house . I guess the rest of the team had so little faith in him that's the reason they weren't around when he was making bombs ? <br/><br/>Mossad uses a secretive unnamed French organisation to find the whereabouts of their targets . In reality this organisation almost certainly doesn't exist but makes a good cover story . Unfortunately as it plays out on screen you find yourself questioning the logic of it all . It's even brought to the audience's attention when Avner suggests it may be a cover for Fatah to liquidate PLO rivals . There's no suggestion or hint what the organisation is . Would Mossad even think about dealing with an organisation if they're on a top secret mission that can't fail ? <br/><br/>Avner himself has doubts about the mission , so much so that he suffers a paranoid breakdown and is mentally scarred for life . There's also the notorious sex scene at the end with Avner and his wife intercut the Munich massacre . What's the point of this ? Is there moral equivalence ? Are we to think that if a democratic government surrounded by murderous foes on all sides takes part in assassinations this makes them no better than terrorists ?<br/><br/>The production team could defend themselves on the last point by saying it makes for a more dramatic film because the protagonist has an inner turmoil and this is what drama is all about but there was no need to do this . From what I've read about Operation Wrath Of God none of the Mossad hit team had any qualms about assassinating terrorists . What Spielberg has done is make a film believing because "" good people are doing bad things "" they must be traumatized by it when in fact this isn't the case in life .

However, as discussed, poor editing, an unrealized story and poor casting, particularly Bana as Avner, leaves much of Spielberg's ideas unrealized (in contrast, Jar Heads made me think much more about lots of issues than this movie which had an easier subject matter to challenge the viewer on).<br/><br/>Here are a few of the drawbacks of the movie: 1. Two hours into the movie Avner and his posse have only killed three of the eleven terrorists on their list. I leaned over to my buddy and said My Lord, there are eight more killings to go - when will this movie end?.<br/><br/>2. Avner's prophetic downward spiral into paranoia highlighted by storming the Israeli consulate in New York City and sleeping in the closet - not only was it awful, Bana's poor acting stripped it of all credibility.<br/><br/>3. The Australian/South African kick asser Israeli crack teammate - this guy was cool, but cast completely wrong for the movie - he seemed more Lethal Weapon than Munich.<br/><br/>4. As already discussed, the final sex scene where Avner sweats up a storm and does his stuff while visualizing the final seconds of the Munich massacre.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this movie was not all bad. Geoffry Rush was excellent as Ephraim. However, the movie was stolen by Louis and his beloved Papa and their family business that provides global intelligence at a price but not to any government and complete infiltration into the world of international espionage. While it made completely no sense for Avner, who had just lied to Louis about not working for a government and then traveled to Lebannon and blown away dozens of soldiers on a hit-run on the basis of Louis' information to then voluntarily attend Papa's house, this was the highlight of the movie. Papa's admiration of Avner's loyalty to his own papa and need to provide for his family were great because of their simplicity and universality. Further, the dialog between the family members particularly at the dinner table over grace was dynamite.<br/><br/>However good Papa and Louis were, unfortunately, their performance was overshadowed by a very forgettable movie."
"Dr_Dmitri-Yuriev","Null","17","26","1 February 2006"," Incredible film with a beautiful message
","The film starts off at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. A group of Arab terrorists capture and later murder 11 Israeli athletes. The Israeli community is outraged with the murders and they set out to investigate who planned the massacre, in order to send assassins to settle the score. Eric Bana (who plays Avner) is chosen as the lead assassin and the film takes us on a thrilling, violent and heartbreaking ride watching how Bana and his team accomplish their morbid task and the dangers they go through in order to finish it.<br/><br/>After the film ended, I thought about the reviews that complained it was too cold and detached for their taste. I Don't know why some critics felt nothing because I did care for Eric Bana and his family. At first it's hard to like him for what he's doing, but after we see his remorse, guilt and paranoia(nightmares, trouble sleeping, fear of being murdered) start to kick in as why he's doing what he's doing and if his actions will accomplish anything, I began to care for him. The film also offers great suspense and the haunting score adds depth to it. We know Avner (Bana) is an assassin, he has to kill people and the film builds an unnerving suspense around this; anything can go wrong with the operations and we fear for the life of innocent people such as the target's family or innocent bystanders who have nothing to do with the events in Munich.<br/><br/>Another complain I've seen from a few people is that the film had no point. My guess is they weren't paying attention since Avner (bana) had two discussions with other characters, which clearly show what the film is ultimately about; the discussion with Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) at the end of the film and the discussion with Ali (Omar Metwally) outside the safe-house. I thought the film was made to show how pointless and absurd revenge can be, that violence cannot bring about peace. Group A kills people from Group B and vice versa, but it doesn't stop there, the slain people are replaced the endless cycle of killing continues. This in effect made the film thought-provoking, it makes you think about subjects you wouldn't normally think of or discuss with other people. Thinking about it fills you with sadness since the events in it are in reality still happening and it's sad to see how the two groups (Jews AND Arabs) don't realize that death and violence will continue if they don't learn to listen and forgive others and let the authorities decide what punishment people should get."
"batleh","8","14","21","7 February 2006"," Spielberg's Journey
","Ever since he has journeyed into serious films (starting with ""Empire of the Sun"" and then ""Schindler's List""), Steven Spielberg has been searching for a method of making violence unattractive to moviegoers. ""Schindler's List"" was, of course, shocking, but this first attempt at strong violence did not quite have the intended effect. I know that a lot of people (including me) feel saddened by the film, but SL's violence could seem distant at times, like the audience was merely an observer. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the second great attempt at making moviegoers detest violence, but this seemed easily dismissed as a war film, showing events that would probably never happen again, like showing violence in a distant universe. Munich is his latest effort, and it shows Spielberg's feeling that his previous films, although progressive, had not quite 'hit the mark'. <br/><br/>The violence shown in Munich is, perhaps, the most brutal realistically intentioned violence ever shown on film. I say 'realistically intentioned' because, like the average moviegoer, I have not witnessed people getting shot or blown up, so I don't know what those events would actually look like. There are many signs in the film that Spieberg is trying to improve on his earlier efforts. The guns in the film are REALLY loud when fired. This has the effect of putting you in the fight, making it more intimate when someone IS shot. The bullet wounds and remains after explosions are quite gruesome. When someone dies in this film, no matter what side they are on, you feel no happiness, no relief or awe. You feel a sense of death, nothing dramatic, just blank and empty. For this reason, Munich is one of the most important films to have come out, and perhaps it is Spielberg's best ('Raiders' is too superhuman to be included on that list). Spielberg deserves the best director for this one."

Are you not offended that there is a lot of money being made from this? Isn't anyone else bothered by the Hollywood-esq ""action-assassin-character"" formula used to portray the Isralies? Each one has ""their own specialty and they are back with a vengeance to give those other murderers what they asked for..(insert rest of cheesy trailer voice-over line here."" These are real people being killed off, and I felt that there was no insight aside from obvious things like the WTC in the background at the end. The only thing Steven Spielberg made clear is that this violence will continue forever.<br/><br/>I thought it was offensive to make an action movie out of this subject matter, SS is making $$ off of these people's tragedies!! How can you say this movie is a masterpiece???? It's garbage, and I am sorry that I gave my 10 dollars towards this. Next time I will research a bit more before going to see a movie because my fiancé wanted to.<br/><br/>And the scene at the end when he is screaming while having sex his wife and flashing back to people being massacred, GIVE ME A BREAK. That was the stupidist thing I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This whole movie is all about real people dying, and both parties are at fault. Both parties are murdering in each other; I already knew that about the situation in the Middle East. How about some insight into why the hostage crises took place and what went on before it? Also, all of you saying this has ""great action"" should really think twice about what exactly you are watching. If they made an ""action"" movie about Sept 11th you all would be throwing bottles at the screen."
"The_Void","5","11","16","14 February 2006"," Simple thriller dressed up in impressive technical details
","It's been eight years now since Steven Spielberg picked up a 'Best Director' Oscar for Saving Private Ryan, and a massive thirteen since he snagged 'Best Picture' with Schindler's List. I'm sure that Spielberg had these things in mind when he decided to take on Munich; as it becomes obvious while viewing this film that so much time has been spent on trying to ensure that everything is professionally done, that Spielberg has forgotten to actually make a film. Munich is about the tragedy at the Munich Olympics, which saw eleven Israeli athletes lose their lives to Arab terrorists. This plot, obviously, is very relevant these days with all the hype surrounding terrorism; and Spielberg has made a film with the central idea being that 'violence breeds violence'. This is an admirable base for any film, especially given the fact that this film follows a plot that is grounded in real events; but in order for the story to carry any weight, the audience really needs to be involved in it. And this is where Munich falls flat on its face.<br/><br/>By making the central character a terrorist, Spielberg puts us at the centre of the action. The director tries to make us believe that the lead is a complete character, by showing us scenes where he's blowing people up, as well as sequences with his wife and new born child; but this is far too black and white. Thrillers have got by with far less characterisation, but if you're going to make us believe that your lead is more than a cardboard cut-out, you're going to need to do a better job that that. At its base, the film is a list of assignments that need to be carried out by the Mossad agent at the centre; but these are caught up in far too much waffle, and while the murder sequences themselves are beautifully stylised - tension is stripped from the film by the way that the plot goes from exciting to achingly boring. As mentioned, technically the film has no problems at all. The cinematography is great, as is the direction and Eric Bana, as ever, does an excellent job of leading the film; but like Schindler's List before it, Munich just feels like nothing more than an attempt to win an Oscar. Personally, I'd rather see the award go to 'War of the Worlds'. It might not be as critically friendly, but at least it sees Spielberg doing what he does best."

","If you would like to see a good movie about the Munich tragedy I recommend Sword of Gideon. Made in 1986 for HBO it beats this movie hands down. I really cannot believe that Steven Spielberg directed Munich. He is capable of a much better movie. This movie drags. Good set decoration is no substitute for a good show. The film broke twice while we were trying to watch this thing. Turned out that was the best part of the movie. We anticipated this show for weeks as we live in a backwater. It did not open here until January 27, 2006. Glad we went to see it as now we know and don't have to guess, but we were really disappointed.

","Real events translated into images by one of the most powerful filmmakers the world has known since Cecil B De Mille. Spielberg is to admire, really. He keeps his energy in top gear there is no sign of sluggishness in his work. ""Munich"" in many ways, is his most grown up movie. The characters are fully fleshed out and that is unusual in a Spielberg film. A change that I applaud because that's what I miss most in his movies. Real characters, multi-dimensional. That's why when that is achieved, something memorable follows. Remember Ralph Finnes in ""Schindler's List"". Here Eric Bana makes us run the gamut of emotions provoking questions in our minds. Who are we rooting for? The answer is clear and yet we fight it. The scene with the bomb, the young girl and the telephone (I won't say more than that) is truly cinematic brilliance. All the sequence in France, although I agree is a part of the puzzle, thought it added unnecessary minutes to an already overlong movie. But that is a tiny criticism to a movie that may very well be consider one of the best in its genre and an almost perfect thriller."

"Maciste_Brother","4","13","20","28 January 2008"," A disingenuous film made 30 years too late
","MUNICH is a film that was made and released 30 years too late. Back in the 1970s, gritty spy/police dramas were all the rage. Films like THE FRENCH CONNECTION, 3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR, THE YAKUZA or ""Black Sunday"" were popular, with moviegoers and critics. Those film were just like standard spy or police dramas of previous decades but reflected the times they were made which is really what them memorable: they were very violent, realistic and the no-nonsense use of foul language. Films became realistic in the 1970s because of shocking real life events like the Vietnam war or tragedies like what happened in Munich, or the Speck or Manson massacres. Movies had no choice but to become more violent and gritty in order to compete/reflect the then mores . Spy/police thrillers are still being made today but the style is completely different than from those in the '70s: they're not very realistic and are more flashy. <br/><br/>Now here comes MUNICH, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, who, in the 1970s, was busy doing harmless blockbusters like JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or 1941. As you know, the state of movie-making and movie-going forever changed when JAWS or STAR WARS, made by Spielberg buddy, George Lucas, became massive hits. People weren't looking for gritty violent dramas anymore but wanted escape from the cruel world out there. Fast forward 3 decades and practically every movie today is escapist in nature. Realism is far gone from movie screens. And we have Spielberg and Lucas to thank for that. Which is why I find MUNICH so bizarre and ironic. The film is well made (though typically over-directed) but it feels completely out of place in our current state of cinema. MUNICH would have made more sense if it had been made and released in the '70s not now. The whole project is a contradiction in itself. The gritty movies of the '70s became virtually extinct because of Spielberg's ""sense of wonder"" style of film-making, which has now become the norm, and yet 30 years later, Spielberg (who's clearly channeling John Frankenheimer or William Friedkin here) dabbles in the same type of film he helped eliminate? There's something truly disingenuous about all of it. Spielberg is either completely out of touch or this is a genuine heartfelt mea culpa of sorts.<br/><br/>MUNICH is not really a story or even a movie but a slavish recreation of what Spielberg thinks the 1970s were. Every shot (excellent cinematography btw) wants us to notice every little detail about the production values or about the story. For example, sex scenes. Sex scenes or nudity in movies from the 1970s were pretty common. Today, they are mostly gone because most films are rated PG-13 (nevermind those unrated version made available on DVD). So seeing those sex scenes or even the nudity in MUNICH was surprising, mainly because of what I just wrote but also because I don't think Spielberg has ever included nudity or sex scenes in ANY of his previous films. So why now? To buck the PG-13 trend he directly created? Is Spielberg finally admitting that he helped to create a stiffling monster that's taken over creativity in Hollywood? I doubt it. Just look at all the numerous cutesy projects he has line up on his IMDb profile.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, aside from a few standout scenes and Daniel Craig actually giving a good performance, MUNICH should be viewed as an Oscar-bait oddity."
"sol-","Null","9","13","30 January 2006"," My extended review of the film
","The word limit unfortunately limits how much I can say here, and I'm sure that there is more to say. These are however some thoughts of mine after seeing 'Munich' for the second time in a cinema after a friend invited me to see it again with him.<br/><br/>'Munich' has been criticised by some for its ambiguity, but if anything, I think Spielberg's refusal to take sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflicts is the best aspect of the film. It is not condoning the actions of Palestinian terrorists, but neither is it supportive of the way in which Israel reacts. There is hardly any bias in the film, which should satisfy those who thought that 'Schindler's List' was not ambiguous enough. According to some reviewers, Spielberg's film is too ambiguous this time round though. Personally, I do not agree to either of those charges. Sometimes the pettiest of reasons are used to badmouth a film. Then again, I'm sure some will regard my supportive comments as petty. So, I will not call 'Munich' the second best film that I have seen this decade, even though it feels that way to me. I'll just take this opportunity to provide some thoughts on why I believe it to be very good. The plot of the film is best discussed when one knows everything that happens in the film. Therefore, I would advise to not read ahead if you have not already seen 'Munich'. My discussion from this point forth, contains spoilers that may ruin a fresh experience.<br/><br/>It is hard to condense what the film is about to just one issue, but ultimately it is about the futility of the violence between Palestinians and Israelis. Spielberg does not try to argue who is right or who is wrong, as the reason why the conflicts have started is not important, and this idea is mirrored in the five men unofficially hired by the Israeli government. The assassins do not have any proof of the guilt of those who they are going after, which leads them to at times question whether they are doing right. The one thing that they seem to all fall back on is that even if their targets were not responsible for Munich, they are responsible for other acts of terrorism against the Jews, a point emphasised at the end by Ephraim. But is that good enough reason?<br/><br/>Something I find interesting is that none of the killings go as planned, except for one. With the first killing, they are nervous, with the next couple the explosions are too big, and the list goes on. Also, they meet innocent bystanders or other people who may indirectly suffer at every killing scene except the first. The only assassination that they get right, and do not meet any possible indirect sufferers at, is the Dutch woman who was hired to kill Carl. The whole temptress subplot involving her is significant. The reason why they are able to do such a good job killing her is because there is no doubt to her guilt, and they were directly affected by her actions. Avner experiences twice the effects of the others though, because not only did the temptress make him think about cheating on his wife, he was also the one who recommended her to Carl.<br/><br/>The film is also about how involvement in conflicts can have everlasting effects. Each of the five assassins experiences suffering as a result of their work. The characters are all very human - not at all like the typical image one has as a hired assassin. They come close to mucking up their very first job, and they dash frantically out afterwards. They are insecure and doubtful about how much of the truth they are being told. As for the actual effects that they suffer, the details are unimportant. It does not matter whether Robert and Hans decided to kill themselves or whether they were assassinated (Spielberg leaves this question hanging). Their involvement in the conflict killed them. Carl died too, and Avner emerges paranoid. We do not see the detrimental effect on Steve, but we still understand it to exist. Steve is strong on the outside, but who knows what he is like inside.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are excellent. The camera-work is stunning, with plenty of movement, both following the characters around, and dollying to get close up to television screen and important details. The editing is brilliant, with scene changes including papers being shuffled on a desk turning into papers flying in the street, and the editing in of actual footage flows perfectly. The film actually balances two plot lines that are weaved in thanks to clever editing. At certain times, the actual hostage happenings at Munich are shown, almost like flashbacks - they fade in and out, with matching colour designs. The colour and lighting work is general is great too.<br/><br/>There is no doubt something to admire in the art direction also. The backgrounds are mood setting, and it is really interesting to look at the contrast between set up between children in swimwear, running around when Ephraim and Avner first go for a walk, compared to the stillness of the New York backdrop at the end. John Williams' music score includes some drum work this time round, and it is most effective in keeping up the suspense and intensity of certain scenes. It goes without saying that Spielberg does a good job in the director's chair, so the last thing to mention is the acting. Eric Bana is probably the best of the cast, as a man who loses any innocence that he might have once had forever, but all of the supporting cast do fine. Overall, it is a very impressive piece of cinema with plenty that can be looked into in finer details. I would consider say some more here, but IMDb's word limit plays a limiting factor there."

","MUNICH (2005) **** Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zorer, Geoffrey Rush, Gila Almagaor, Michael Lonsdale, Matheiu Amalric, Lynn Cohen, Marie-Josee Croze. Excellent depiction of the aftermath of the 1972 Olympics terrorist plot and ruthless murders of Israeli athletes and their managers and the plan initiated for swift retribution by a covert force of Mossad (led by a fiercely superb Bana proving to be an actor to watch) in the attempt to assassinate the 11 members of ""Black September"" responsible for the heinous acts. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg does a masterful job in balancing the high stakes tension not unlike Hitchcock with precision timing, pacing and editing (kudos to ace cutter Michael Kahn) and the cleverly canny and sharply smart screenplay by acclaimed playwright Tony Kushner and ace screenwriter Eric Roth (based on the account by George Jonas' ""Vengeance"") that does the damn near impossible: show both the conflicts within the corps group and Palestinians and the ongoing struggle of the Middle East that rings true throughout and doesn't whitewash the harsh, horrific bloodshed and the means outweighing the necessary eye-for-an-eye retaliations. One of the year's best films and most important as well."

Within 24 hours, September 5/6, 1972, during a tense and nail-biting stand-off all eleven Israeli captives and their eight Palestinian captors are killed in a shootout and grenade assault between the German police and Black September terrorists.<br/><br/>Back in Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir,Lynn Cohen, gets the heads of the Mossad and IDF, Israeli Defense Forces,to plan what to do in the aftermath of the murdered 11 Israeli athletes. Even more important Premier Meir wants to show that actions like that in Munich will not go unavenged and unpunished. <br/><br/>Trying to distance herself and her government Premier Meir has a secret group of Israelis assassins lead by her former bodyguard Avner, Eric Bana, get all the money and assistance that they need in finding the Munich 11, the Black September members who planned the Munich attack, and bring them to justice; instant justice with Avner and his men being judge jury & executioner.<br/><br/>The movie ""Munich"" has Avner and his fellow covert Israeli Government assassins track down most of the Black September killers terminating seven of them including scores of accomplices by the time Avner's group was finally disbanded by Prime Minister Meir in June 1973. Still the Israeli hit team was unable to find and terminate the Big Salami and leader of the bunch who's name ironically is Ali Hassan Salameh, Mehdi Nebbon; were told at the end of he movie ""Munich"" that Ali Hassan Salameh was indeed killed by the Israeli Mossad in 1979.<br/><br/>Penetrating and thought provoking real life thriller that shows the fine line between the Israeli hunters and Palestinian hunted. We also see how they suddenly switch later in the movie when the Black September terrorists start to turn the tables on the Israelis by tricking and trapping three of their agents, with the help of a beautiful but deadly Dutch femme fatal Jeanette(Marie Josee-Croze),leading to their deaths.<br/><br/>Avner who was so eager and determined to do his job later started to get sick of killing and even felt a bit of sympathy for the hated Palestinians seeing that they, like himself an Israeli Jew, have a right to live in a land of their own. There's a very emotional exchange between Avner and Black September member Ali, Omar Metwally, who didn't know that he, Avnar, was Jewish and a Israeli covert agent out to kill him, which he did. This talk with Ali seemed to open Avnar up to seeing things beyond what he'd been exposed to as an Israeli, or native born Sabra, all his life. <br/><br/>The movie ends with Avner together with his wife Daphna, Ayelet Zorner,and new born daughter living in Brooklyn New York unable or not wanting to return back to his native Israel and having nightmares over what he did and went through as a Israeli assassin. Avner now feels that he may well be terminated himself by the very people, the Israeli Mossad who he so secretly and effectively worked for. The reason Avner felt that way may have been because he couldn't keep what he did locked up within the four corners of his troubled mind."

From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography  'Munich' is a visually fascinating movie. Except no scene was actually shot in Rome nor Athens. We were clearly in Hungary and Malta. And it showed.

Enough already with the remakes. People want to see original stories with fresh new ideas and writers. Why are independent films so successful, because the ones that are well made and tell a good story are box office darlings. It's amazing some Hollywood films have budgets north of 100 million.

","It helps when you aren't overly-hyped on a movie before seeing it. I wasn't that interested in seeing this, for some reason, but did....and, wow! This is a fine movie, one of the Steven Spielberg's best efforts. Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.<br/><br/>Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she. It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.<br/><br/>That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.<br/><br/>Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks? Hopefully, the film can lead to some intelligent discussions. I have read where the Israelis were not happy with Spielberg's position on the matter. Since they have dealt with that issue for many years, I would listen to them carefully but be open for any viewpoint on this crucial issue. See the movie yourself and see what you think. Overall, Spielberg went out of his way to present both sides, so kudos to him for doing that.<br/><br/>The bottom line, as far as the film goes, is that it is simply good entertainment. The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended."

","I wish I could use my wife's one-word description of this dreadful film: Boring. But since I can't, MUNICH is about the killing of the Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, and the deadly aftermath as the ""eye for an eye"" Israel government sends out a hit squad to kill those involved in the massacre. All too quickly, the squad starts killing people not on its list. Then the squad itself is decimated. And in the end the squad leader starts having second thoughts about killing anybody else and even those he has killed. Each time he successfully kills a terrorist, the terrorists undertake much larger-scale retaliations. And to top it off, some terrorists are portrayed sympathetically! The movie ends on a very sour, open-ended note. Jews everywhere must have loved this one -- that is, assuming they or anyone else saw it. MUNICH is very long, very boring and confusing. And in his attempt to make the film ultra-realistic, Spielberg manages to make us not care about anybody. There are no good guys, no bad guys. I have no idea what he thought he was doing when he undertook this project. Certainly, it was not to entertain or enlighten the masses, which are the things a good movie does. I suspect Spielberg made MUNICH for his own private purposes, the audience be damned. As for the actors, I would have preferred someone like Viggo Mortensen in the lead, but then we would have had a distinctive, charismatic character with whom to identify, and Spielberg apparently did not wish this. He instead gives us the very bland, nondescript Eric Bana. The very detailed early 1970s look is wasted on a movie that never should have been made. You know how bizarre Hollywood has become when it nominated MUNICH for five Oscars and a best director nom for Spielberg. Unbelievable. Skip this one, big-time."
"WriterDave","9","41","82","2 January 2006"," Spielberg, the Apologetic
","In the opening scene of Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" a group of friendly American athletes help a small army of Palestinian terrorists who they mistake for fellow Olympians over the fence into the Olympic village where they later take hostage and massacre the entire Israeli Olympic team. It's a great and knowing way to begin the year's last political thriller in the year of political thrillers. ""Munich,"" helmed by one of film's modern masters ends the year of politics in populist entertainment with a bang.<br/><br/>There's a confusing sense of anarchy in the first twenty minutes of yet another bloated run time where Spielberg cuts back and forth between archival news footage, viewer reactions, and the graphic reenactments of the terrorist act that overshadowed the 1972 Olympiad. Shortly after the tragedy, a covert arm of the Israeli government plots their retaliation. You don't get much back story on those involved, with the exception of the character played by Eric Bana (best known as the ""Incredible Hulk""), and it wasn't until after the plot was set into motion that I even realized the stately elderly woman heading it all up was the Prime Minister. Those not well versed in the actual events that shape the film may get lost here.<br/><br/>Once the team of ""ordinary"" assassins is assembled (among them the excellent Ciaran Hinds best know as Julius Caesar in TV's ""Rome"" and future James Bond, Daniel Craig), the thriller mechanizations are set into place. Spielberg and his normal cohorts, composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kaminksi, are firing on all cylinders during the meatiest part of the movie and clearly at the top of their games. Spielberg does a lot of crafty dissolves (that are both artistically beautiful and revoltingly gritty in some of their excessive violence and gore), as he weaves his haunting tale. As the assassins pick off targets and go from one scenic European locale to the next, we are treated to pacing that matches the best of Hitchcock's thrillers, and plot points that mirror the best characteristics of a John Le Carre spy novel.<br/><br/>Of course, what we have here is Spielberg at his most self important. For all its rote thriller aspects, this is a political time bomb of a movie with a lot of things to say about terrorism. Though told from the point of view of Israelis acting out of a sense of vengeful justice, it really takes no sides, and shows how all involved think their cause is worth fighting and dying for, and all surrender their values once caught up into the international terrorist machine of bombings, assassinations, retaliations, and double crossings. Still, you also have to give credit to Spielberg, who even at his most austere is still a giddy populist. Who else would have the foresight to team up Julius Caesar (Hinds), the Incredible Hulk (Bana), and James Bond (Craig) as a team of merry assassins? <br/><br/>To mirror the winking opening scene, there is a great closing scene as well, where one character tries to painfully resume a normal life in New York City. The camera lingers on a pretty skyline shot along the river with the World Trade Center looming large and reminding us that terrorism knows no boundaries and has the power to consume us all."
"jbustin","10","26","49","24 December 2005"," Thought Provoking...Movie of the Year
","I just got back from watching this movie a little while ago. I wasn't too familiar with the Munich olympics and the murders of the Israeli team since I wasn't born for 10 years after that. I had heard some things about it and also did some research leading up to the movie. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it has pushed right to the top of my favorite movies for 2005.<br/><br/>Eric Bana as Avner was an amazing choice in casting. First of all, I saw him in Hulk and wasn't impressed seeing as it wasn't that kind of movie. I will be watching for him in future movies. The depth of his character was developed so well to the point where I could feel his fear, regrets, and other emotions by just looking into his eyes.<br/><br/>The violence and blood was very tasteful and I really liked the way that some of the sequences were shot (not going to post any spoilers). Steven Spielberg really impressed me seeing as I never would have expected this kind of movie to come from him. <br/><br/>A lot of people have said to me that they thought this movie was boring. I don't know how this movie could be boring. I asked those same people if they thought Traffic was boring (seeing as its the only long dramatic movie that came to my mind at the time) and they said yes. In conclusion, if you are not a fan of dramatic movies that tend to be long...then you don't deserve to be called a movie watcher."
"KidColtOutlaw","10","9","14","6 February 2006"," This was a fantastic movie
","Just thought I would chime in since there seems to be so much negativity about this movie on these boards. I really thought it was fantastic--one of Spielberg's best, if not _the_ best. He took a really difficult topic and made it thrilling, compelling, exciting, and totally engrossing. The acting is top-notch and the set design, costumes, etc. really blew me away. Everything looks so authentic that you really feel like you walked straight into Rome or Paris circa 1973. Eric Bana, all the character actors--everyone completely became their characters.<br/><br/>I see that some people complain that Spielberg didn't completely get the facts straight, but this movie never purports to be a documentary--it is ""inspired by true events."" Really what it is about is how difficult it is to kill another human being, and the price we often pay for fighting for what we believe in. Is it worth it? Spielberg doesn't provide a clear answer--in this movie he simply asks the question, and I don't have a problem with that..."
"drjimmycooper","5","42","86","11 December 2005"," Impressive film-making, but superficial and heavy-handed
","I saw this movie at a screening and I'm very mixed about it. In a way, it was kind of bad, and yet also admirable...<br/><br/>It was great to be seeing a big budget film tackle political subject matter. And the film takes great care to present a balanced point of view: there is a strong effort to humanize many of the characters, Arab and Israeli.<br/><br/>But I felt hit over the head with the film's ""unbiased"" message of peace. Once again, Spielberg buries potentially interesting & adult subject matter with his slick film-making skills and his heavy-handed, ""soul of a child"" sensibility.<br/><br/>There are some great things here. The acting is pretty great. Eric Bana gives a fine, understated performance. Daniel Craig is magnetic, and several of the supporting actors are excellent and surprisingly authentic, notably Michael Lonsdale.<br/><br/>The production design, sets and cinematography all work together superbly to re-create the early '70s. There aren't many films lately which can truly evoke a specific period. Munich does it almost flawlessly. I really felt transported by the sets, costumes and lighting, it was if I were watching some 30-year old French thriller. The only thing that gave it away were the smooth, dynamic camera moves, many of which, by the way, involved extremely complicated choreography.<br/><br/>There is a visceral excitement to some of the film. YES, it's extremely violent, but a good portion of it is devoted to the suspense and thrill of international spycraft, always a crowd-pleasing subject.<br/><br/>But, as the characters carry out their harrowing missions, the film starts to feel hollow. Considering the fascinating nature of the subject matter, it feels like there's too much slick film-making in place of ideas and/or character development.<br/><br/>There's some good dialogue here and there, but several times, I felt the actors were explaining too much, as if the filmmakers didn't trust the audience to ""get it."" Once these realizations set in, the film starts to feel way too long...<br/><br/>When the film, later, clumsily reaches for meaning and character depth, it feels forced and too late. Though Bana is very good, the script doesn't give him enough to flesh out his character. There is one scene in particular which is SO OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD, it doesn't even seem like the same movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there's no real emotional tug here, and one gets the sense that the same story could have been told more effectively in a shorter film which focused more on the main characters.<br/><br/>But, yet, the film did affect me, mostly for the way it convincingly transported me, through its look and some visual sequences, into its world, evoking thoughts and memories of historical events and the state of our world today."
"janelle90210","9","50","105","11 December 2005"," So close to perfect . . .
","Personally, I have always believed that a long movie isn't always a good movie, but this film is the exception to that rule. At the end of the film I was shocked at how long I was in the theater; time just flew by. This film has everything I was looking for, action-wise, and a fantastic storyline that kept me at the edge of my seat. I loved the drama and the history--this wasn't just another story that someone dreamed up. It was interesting because these events happened before I was born. It was fascinating to see how the world was at that particular era. Hopefully, it will be advertised more so the public will be attracted to it. Because of the action and drama involved, I would say this is one of the best films of 2005, without a doubt. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!"
"michela","7","38","78","6 December 2005"," 1972 comes to life
","Everyone is a victim in Steven Spielberg's latest - the Olympic athletes, the Palestians who take them hostage, the Israelis who devote their lives to avenging the incident. Everyone wants their home and family. Spielberg takes his familiar themes into new territory, striving hard to maintain a neutral tone even while depicting horrifying carnage. The film-makers may succeed in raising the debate about peace in the Middle East with strong performances revealing awkward and arbitrary responses to bloodshed. Eric Bana leaps off the screen and leads an ensemble cast in perhaps his meatiest role since Chopper. His Mossad agent character becomes more and more believable as his smooth veneer is quickly worn down. Jumping from city to city, the film credibly holds the period in focus with over a hundred speaking parts and convincing accents from the International cast. I heard one Israeli viewer questioning whether Aussies Bana and Rush were dubbed (the answer was no). 1972, sideburns and all, comes to life in the film through newsreels and exquisite production design. If there is anything that holds this back from being a great film, it's a few uncertain shifts between awkward humour, boys own action and noble, but somewhat blatant, efforts to balance Israeli and Arab concerns. The film works best as a fascinating tribute to the law of diminishing returns from the Arab-Israeli conflict without any suggestions of how the conflict as a whole could be resolved. Munich is not what you would call entertainment, nor is it 100% clear who its audience is, but a good film nonetheless. The case for the State of Palestine has a new celluloid chapter and a surprising ally."
"tongue-3","1","21","40","8 April 2007"," Unconvincing and morally misguided
","Laughably fake, brimming with inexcusable factual errata and poorly written dialog. Case in point - Spielberg expects us to believe a ragtag, inept, guilt-ridden group of Mossad agents who rely only on a third party informer. In real life the agents were well-organized professionals who used no outside information, were more than willing to do their assignment and never regretted it.<br/><br/>The film's morals are as lacking as its historic and dramatic integrity. It refuses to make any distinction between the violence of terrorists and the violence by which justice is enforced. It completely disregards the preventative, defensive end of terrorist-hunting and portrays it as mindless vengefulness. This film makes one wonder if Spielberg would rather see murderers left to their devices."
"super1397","1","20","38","15 January 2006"," Munich - what a rip off
","Save yourself the money and just watch a documentary about that tragic event. Very little in the movie revealed anything that I had already seen in a free documentary on TV. While some of the way the assassinations were carried out revealed some new insights there was very little else that was surprising. It might be a good movie for someone who is not familiar with the Olympic tragedy, it could be equally confusing for them. Take my advice just watch the documentary. Spielberg really dropped the ball on this one. If you compare it to Schindlers List this one fails big time in comparison. I had big expectations for this movie but walked away feeling utterly disappointed as did others in the theater."
"laker083234","10","13","23","8 January 2006"," A dark haunting Masterpiece! Not for everyone
","I have seen every big Oscar contender this year except for Capote and none have stuck with me like this. I must say this is not every ones type of movie: The violence is realistic and gruesome and the movie is politically charged but still is universal.<br/><br/>I have seen Brokeback Mountain and it is very good but Munich is I believe harder to forget and just as good in the acting. I do want to comment on one thing, I saw Brokeback Mountian and this is why a movie of that type is important. I was verbally attacked by my father for seeing it. He joke with words of ashamed and disowned and started questioning my sexual preference. I am with out a doubt straight but it is because of people like my father movies like Brokeback must be made. It is an important movie and I hope people go see it to really see what an Ignorant society can do.<br/><br/>But none the less movie wise Munich to me stands alone this year. The sad part is it could be knocked out of the Best Picture race because of how dark and off putting it is. Spielberg has told a story with unbelievable cinematography and at times a beautiful and painful score(music). The movie is made with such detail you can not help but admire the direction that went into this movie. Spielberg also takes the most risk he has ever taken with his movies. The subject matter is a hard sell, his violence is done in a gruesome and realistic way, his characters are not hero's and even hard just to like, the cast is not well known, he shoots it in an old fashion way with a lot of zooming, and he uses a sex scene to also reflect on the finale of the Munich massacre. All these risk are why the movie has been getting mixed reviews and the fact that no movie could live up to the expectations it had. These risk though is also why I love it so much, this is film making at it's bravest.<br/><br/>The scene I referred to as a risk is probably the biggest punch in the whole movie. Avner the leader has been pulled out of the field and returned home to his wife. He is tormented and through out the film has had flash backs to the Munich massacre. He has sex with his wife who he has not seen in a long time. During it he is picturing the final massacre of the 9 remaining athletes at the airport. This is very powerful because it shows the torment of the main character while also hitting the audience with the spark that caused the mission. The unforgettable music playing during this heartbreaking scene makes it one I will remember for ever. The first time I saw it I felt numb and heartbroken. The second time a teen of my age either 18 or 19 years old laughed which really ruined this incredible scene.<br/><br/>This is not a film for every one but if you are willing to go to the theater and see something new and important then I advise you too. It is informative and unforgettable.<br/><br/>My personal top ten of the year excluding Capote 1. Munich 2. Good Night and Good Luck 3. King Kong 4. Syriana 5. Brokeback Mountain 6. Cinderella Man 7. Crash 8. Walk the Line 9. A History of Violence 10. Jarhead"
"CheshireCatsGrin","9","13","23","3 January 2006"," Surprisingly good
","I went to see Munich last week. This movie is about one of the teams in the the Israeli secret operation now known as Wrath of God"". Originally their mission was to kill 11 men who were involved in the terrorist group Black September's murder of the athletes during the Olympics. However, as time goes on, and they remain isolated from society the men begin to stray from their original mission.<br/><br/>I was surprised I liked this film. I've been following it since last year. When I first discovered Eric Bana was cast as Anver I was concerned. I am a fan of his but did not think he would pull off this role. How quickly I had forgotten his performance in Black Hawk Down! Another concern I had going into the theater was the fact this was a Spielberg film. I hate Spielberg films. I hate them with a passion. They are preachy and dumbed down. They are as sweet as saccharine. At best, they are artsy-fartsy and play with the truth like toys. However, Munich was none of these. It was a hell of a film.<br/><br/>Although the movie is political, and I can't think of one person who comes into the theater looking for flaws will be happy with it, this movie was great entertainment. It isn't pretty entertainment, but it is entertainment all the same.<br/><br/>It was a great way to pass a couple hours. The only problem is, I can't shake the final hour.<br/><br/>That is what makes a good film a great film."
"quinnwalton","10","17","32","7 January 2006"," The best
","The reasons why I gave this film a 10 are simple. This is single handedly the best film made in the last 10 years. The editing was impeccable, the direction was above and beyond and the cinematography was untouchable. The fact that they used a rough grain film and used it well in anything other than a war film should confirm my previous statement. This film ran the gamut of emotions. I felt sad, happy, tense, sick and incredibly excited all in the same few hours. The acting, well i won't waste your time (you already know my opinion). It's great that Stephen got such a large crew to make this films, because to be honest, it could not have been done without them. Eric Roth and Tony Kusthner are the most amazing writers, the foreshadowing and other literary devices they used in this masterpiece were impeccable. The metaphor they use such as ""We have butcher's hands and sensitive souls"" make for a very dynamic movie. The ""political"" parts, were political enough that at first glance you do not understand, but as they progress, it becomes a very fathomable. John Williams once again proves he is the best film scorer in the history of the industry. Well, that's my two-cents, i hope you enjoy the film, but if your looking for the political points and not enjoying the movie as a whole, than don't bother seeing it. Oh, and by the way, this very instant, i'm wearing an awesome hat. Just to let you know."
"lamer76","8","5","7","23 May 2006"," Spielberg was brave to do this one.
","Writing a review of Munich independent of my personal experience during the war proved a difficult task. After all, I did have nightmares of Israeli operatives targeting all my family members ruthlessly and without any remorse the night I saw it. This says something though, that the movie got to me and for that, I have to give Spielberg credit. I also have to give him credit for being courageous enough to do it. Despite my countless reservations on his so-called objectivity, he did criticize the Israeli revenge policy, advocating the premise that violence only begets violence.<br/><br/>The movie recounts the events of Operation Bayonet, the Mossad's retaliation to the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. On the surface, it is an action-packed thriller with good guys and bad guys. The good guys are Israeli agents who speak English to each other while the bad guys are overweight Arabs who only speak in a language the average American will not understand without subtitles (which were not always provided for some reason). But Spielberg manages to sneak in a few scenes that instill doubt in both the viewer and the agents (at least some of them) that maybe the unquestionable morality of the operation is in fact questionable.<br/><br/>Munich is highly entertaining, despite its long runtime. It has its cheesy moments but also its confrontational and thought-provoking ones. Although I was expecting a movie that is highly biased  don't get me wrong, it is biased  I felt it sent a strong message to Israelis and to the rest of the world. The best way to describe it is in Carl's (Hinds) words: ""I knew guys like you in the army. You do any terrifying thing you're asked to do, but you have to do it running. You think you can outrun your fears, your doubts. The only thing that really scares you guys is stillness."""
"psychobitchua","10","9","15","5 February 2006"," A thin line between executioner and a victim to be executed
","I'm giving it all the stars possible because it was the best film of a few years of my life. I got interested with the poster which appeared online long ago, where a man with the gun, the executioner, looks like a victim to be executed. The dose of despair in ""Munich"" is breathtaking. The biggest contradiction of human nature is shown clearly: human-beings don't want to be killed, but a machine of violence following violence following violence is working and even with all understanding and diplomacy it's barely possible to stop it. And audience is helplessly watching the way those pinions inside the machine moving and affecting each other. Spielberg showed the sequence of a human-being breaking under the weight of God's duties he was given: to take lives away. ""Munich"" is strong enough to affect every viewer. It had an impact on me, it had an impact on part of audience who came to see ""Hector of Troy without a beard"". They stopped to giggle and grow serious after first 10 minutes. Movie is powerful when no one can open a mouth and start making silly jokes."

"Mitski007","Null","9","15","18 January 2006"," MUNICH IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC with a couple of fallacies
","I am definitely a fan of Spielberg's/Kaminiski's/Bana's so while I must say that this film is not flawless, it is terrific. A person must understand a few things before going to see this movie. First, it is is too long. I was surprised by Kahn's editing mainly because the length can be felt at the end, not throughout. The movie gets long and the scene where Bana is having sex/ thinking about the Munich murders made little sense to me. Also, a person must remember that this is still Hollwyood and so any movie, even one made by Spielberg will not be completely factual. This is no exception.<br/><br/>Having made these comments, I can give the film the praise it is due. First of all, I think that a very complicated issue is displayed excellently in a film. Why? Because it doesn't focus on all the issues that are present between the Israeli Palestinian conflict so much as it deals with a small group of individuals battling their own morals as they do something that they know is wrong. Munich often presents the Palestinian targets in the middle of daily activities. Criticism of the film suggested that this was the filmmaker's attempts to create a moral equivalence for Jews and Palestinians. I disagree. I think that the events in the film merely illustrate how it could be hard for the assassins.<br/><br/>There is something about the way Spielberg and Kaminski film. Though it is a small detail, whenever they depict scenes with gunfire, you feel as if you are standing in the room filmed. It's not like watch a John Woo or even a Bryan Singer film. You can feel the weight of the guns that make you detest their violent nature. The filming is like this throughout. <br/><br/>The performances were also terrific. Eric Bana, (with the exception of Hulk, which I don't even think was his fault), continues to impress and this is no different. His actions are subtle and believable and you want him to succeed. Ciarin Hinds was absolutely phenomenal (watch Rome!), Matthieu Kassovitz repeats his excellence from Amelie and Daniel Craig was so good, it even made me think that he might be a pretty good Bond. <br/><br/>Munich is an ideal historical piece not because it is completely factual (its not) but because it presents the information as accurately as it can, and when it simplifies, you do not feel as if you are missing important information. Head's up on the last shot when Kaminski and Spielberg purposefully (I believe) leave the Twin Towers in the shot. The US wanted revenge too."
"moutonbear25","9","9","15","15 January 2006"," But about the movie ...
","MUNICH Written by Tony Kushner & Eric Roth Directed by Steven Spielberg<br/><br/>It is a gray day. Avner (Eric Bana) meets with his former employer from the Israeli government in a park in Brooklyn, New York. He has nearly lost his mind to paranoia, always wondering when someone will end the hunt and finally find him. During his unofficial employment with the Mossad, Avner headed a team of five men whose mission was to track down the members of Palestinian terrorist group, Black September. This group was behind the tragedy at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, Germany, where 11 Israeli athletes were murdered after being held hostage. It has become abundantly clear that he can and likely will suffer the same fate as the men on his hit list and he needs reassurance that he can at the very least trust the people of his homeland, the people that trusted this mission to him in the first place. His former liaison, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), dismisses his concerns, allowing Avner a moment to breathe. Ephraim then declines Avner's invitation to break bread and two large buildings in the background of the frame catch your eye while Avner stands still and puzzled. These two buildings are the twin towers destroyed on September 11, 2001 in what has been described as one of the most devastating terrorist attacks ever to take place on American soil. This moment, I apologize, comes at the very end of the film and stretches the issue of justification past the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, finding Spielberg asking his audience if there is ever any true resolution to any ongoing violent conflict between nations or between peoples. <br/><br/>Spielberg's film interpretation is not specifically about the Munich killings but more so about what came afterward, while always paying mind to what came before and led up to the event. In telling this story, he is walking a fine line trying not to offend while remaining authentic. I don't doubt Spielberg's genuine interest in remaining objective here. In fact, it was imperative he do so to successfully force his audience to question the usage of violence as a means to resolve conflict. Had he shown the Jewish retaliators as nothing more than a beaten people unquestionably right in their quest for revenge, than he would have created nothing more than a sympathy inducing manipulation. Of course there is something of a sympathetic element for these assassins who see themselves as soldiers but that's inevitable as their people were undeniably wronged in Munich at the hands of murderers. Only these five men are not your typical soldiers. They're toy-makers, antiques dealers, expecting fathers. They are regular men with one common dedication among them, Israel. Their convictions can only take them so far as when it comes time to actually pull the trigger or detonate the bomb, the awareness that they are about to take someone's life becomes a painful curse they hadn't realized their beliefs might not be able to carry them through. The lack of experience as well as the naïve approach become visible as Avner corners the first name on the list. He fumbles as he pulls his gun from his pants and almost lowers it while the condemned begs for his life. Is this really going to help change the future for the better? No. However, the alternative is to take the Munich injustice sitting down.<br/><br/>MUNICH is not just a moral conflict story about the nature of right and wrong despite watching heroes become detached from the brutality of their lives. It is also an energetic thriller. Spielberg has delivered so many solid, enjoyable popcorn movies in the past and here he brings his knowledge and applies it to the tragic underbelly of humanity. The unofficial Mossad kill team are natural underdogs because of their small, humble lives and not because they're Jewish. They travel from one European city to the next, gathering information on the locations of the names on their list and carrying out their duty to kill these men. Spielberg brings so much humanity to these hunts. Innocent bystanders' lives are often threatened or ended and even the men they are meant to kill have families and fragility. The heroes also make small, potentially disastrous errors on their missions. This all leads to the paranoia and confusion over whether they're making these mistakes or are outsiders setting them up to make them. In some, the paranoia leads to guilt while in others, the guilt leads to insanity. And as if the viewer weren't in enough despair already, Spielberg doesn't show the Munich massacre at the beginning of the film to charge the audience behind the Israelis. Instead he reveals the developing details at different intervals throughout the film to remind the viewer how this particular mission began. And as we are wrapped up in the intrigue and morality of this mission, these violent flashbacks serve also as reminders to the team of a reality they had long left behind out of necessity.<br/><br/>Of course the Israel/Palestine conflict did not begin with the Munich Olympics killings. And Spielberg does not tell the story of the mindset behind the men who carried out that mission. If he did though, I would imagine there would be just as much torment in the minds of those killers as the killers who are this film's heroes. MUNICH does not pass judgment on nations but on mankind, asking us to find the better way. As the Israel/Palestine conflict is not over, nor the numerous other needlessly violent world conflicts, MUNICH makes a powerful and intelligent argument for immediate change."
"mfsbluto","9","8","13","5 February 2006"," If you see this film, be prepared
","This film is Steven Spielburg's best work since Saving Private Ryan. The story is simply amazing and the performances given are breathtaking and full of honest emotion. Quite frankly I had begun to doubt Spielburg's skills in this age of CG film making, but this film shuts me up. The story is perhaps one of the best Spielburg has brought to the screen at least since Private Ryan, it may be better. I will give one warning about the film though, don't go in and expect to leave feeling good. The film is to honest about the world for that to happen, you have to realize that what Spielburg shows you here, is not the world of the movies where their is absolute good and evil, it is more like the real world, full of its shades of gray."
"jacksflicks","8","8","13","8 January 2006"," Terrific production, problematic story
","There are truly powerful scenes in Munich. The massacre, which unfolds episodically by flashback throughout the movie, is stark but not lurid. The individual scenes of retribution are beautifully executed (no pun intended). And I particularly like the mysterious French family, whose precise role remains ambiguous if not sinister. Which brings me to the wonderful Michael Lonsdale, who plays the family patriarch or Godfather, if you will. Lonsdale is in the same role here, that of ""enabler,"" as he had in the De Niro thriller Ronin. All the other players are quite good, especially Ciaràn Hindes, whose face reminds me of a porcelain mask. I was sorry to see him as Caesar, in HBO/BBC's Rome, because he was so good I didn't want him to meet Caesar's fate. Well, I was frustrated again here, because Hindes's Carl also comes to a bad end.<br/><br/>A problem I have with this movie is that I'm not convinced of the plausibility of an assassination team's holding ethics seminars between jobs, which is what the story seems to be about. Is it really plausible that for such a ruthless, brutal job the tough Israeli generals, politicians and Mossad would choose Avner (Eric Bana), a conscience-ridden yuppie with a young, pregnant wife, someone who apparently has never killed before, who needs on-the-job training to do so? Furthermore, this ingénue is appointed the team leader! I'm not sure if Avner is based on a true-life character. If he is, then I must question Israel's wisdom in sending this Hamlet to do a job better left to a less scrupulous operative, like team member Steve (Daniel Craig), who says, ""The only blood that matters to me is Israeli blood."" <br/><br/>Another problem is Spielberg's introduction of a subplot, the conflicted relationship between Lonsdale's Papa and his go-between son, Louis (Mathieu Amalric). Papa's disappointment is met by Louis's resentment. When a double-cross is suspected by Avner's team, has Louis gone freelance? When, near the end, Papa assures Avner that no harm will come to Avner's family from him, Avner is left to conclude that the threat is from Mossad's cleaning house. But then we are assured that it's not Mossad. So again, has Louis gone freelance? Unfortunately, we're not given enough for more than conjecture. The same can be said about Papa's family, which is made fascinating by an elaborate sequence, in which other characters are briefly introduced, but with no follow-up, leaving us to ask ,""What's going on here?"" If Spielberg didn't have enough time or didn't want to digress, then his adding this complexity without developing it seems gratuitous.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a scene in the denouement, where the traumatized Avner, back from his mission, is copulating with his wife, while the final act of the Munich massacre plays out in his head. Spielberg seems to be playing it like the scene from The Godfather, in which Coppola crosscuts between the Corleone baptism rite and the slaughter of Corleone's enemies. As the Munich massacre reaches its climax, Avner reaches his. I'm not sure exactly what the juxtaposition is supposed to signify, the haunting of conscience or the confrontation between the act of destruction and the act of creation, or perhaps the carnality of both.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the tormented Avner and his team's between-hit seminars are Spielberg/Kushner creations which, as valid as they may be polemically, fail to serve the story dramatically or even historically. That said, I was relieved that Spielberg didn't succumb to the cultural relativism he's been accused of in other reviews. In the final scene, Avner's control (Geoffrey Rush), refuses to be swayed by Avner's display of scruples, and there we are left."

","i thought this movie was excellent! another great movie by Steven Spielberg...wonderful acting, great cinematography. my only complaint about Munich is that the movie felt a little long towards the end, but otherwise it was packed full of action and drama. this event took place before i was born, but i was truly taken into the story and now have a better understanding of this historical event and the conflict between these two cultures. i have seen Eric Bana in other movies, but thought he did an excellent job of portraying Avner Kaufmann's inner turmoil and the commitment he felt to his country and his family.

"NanoFrog","3","2","2","14 April 2020"," The Speilberg has no clothes
","A take on the Emperor has no clothes. This is a sad, propaganda, contrite and over wrought film. The problem: Spielberg. Maybe I am the only one, but I find Spielberg to be just terrible at films. His ego is out of control. His actual sensitivity to real and actual people is none. This is such an important story, and by all means it should have been made. Perhaps it is time to remake it, with a different group. We are supposed to believe that regular people from off the street organized, stalked and killed the terrorists who planned the killings and kidnappings of Israeli athletes in Munich. There is an underlying falseness to this work, as there is to almost everything Spielberg touches. Spielberg is famous for making stories like this that set us all up for the accusation that we must be anti-jewish if we do not like his work. That is such nonsense. Spielberg, simply, is just a terrible teller of stories. He is a poser with money, and somehow, because of his ""influence"" he makes works of absolute mediocrity that get awards, that get parised but are almost all absolutely forgettable. This track them down and blow them up movie is tired, boring and not really believable. Like many people, I thought the events depicted in this film were horrific and yes, Israel should have done all it could do to bring the perps to justice. But a self-serving, over wrought film like this is not justice for anyone. It is sadly a product by the most over-rated film maker of my lifetime. Yes, you should probably watch this film for its historic significance but not for any truth it could have told, because it does not tell any truths, it only tells us about Spielberg and his massive ego."

","This Steven Spielberg movie tells a haunting and compelling story, based on a terrorist attack during the Olympic Games in Munich. Spielberg manages to tell a story about violence, who eventually takes a brutal turn of those who gets involved. You don't have to be interested in politics to watch this movie, but it can be an advantage. The casting is good, but I have to say, that this is Eric Banas movie.What a performance! He portraits the main character with wisdom, depth and is really convincing. This is also a film you may recommend to friends who like a real compelling story in films,and like films with a important message. I highly recommend it.

","This movie isn't about who is right or who is wrong. It doesn't condemn any side, it doesn't offer any particular solutions, it forces you to think about the horrible conflict between Palestinians and Israelis from both their points of views.<br/><br/>In fact, the dilemma's as shown in Munich, can also be translated to other tragic situations in the world, such as Azaad-Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir for example.<br/><br/>There are no real good guys and bad guys. You try to understand why these people do the horrible things they do. What motivation(s)do they have? I was interested in watching this movie from the moment I heard it was being made and Spielberg said in interviews he wouldn't be taking any sides, but try to show the human side, the tragedy of the killings on boths sides. He did an excellent job there.<br/><br/>The actors were also well chosen, they all played their parts very well and the dialogues were perfect. After the ending, you do wonder what further happened to Avner and his family, did they live on in the US, did they return to Isreal, did Avner still get killed? But then again, the movie isn't to tell us about their live, it's about hte aftermath of Munich '76 and the hearts of all the people involved.<br/><br/>I was very disturbed though by a scene near the ending. I thought the sex scene mixed with the tragic massacre in Munich '76 was inappropriate. I don't understand why ti was necesary to mix those two scenes!

","First of all, I do not know when the Hollywood guys would get the point, that in France and above all in Paris we do not listen to Edith Piaf while driving cars. <br/><br/>The funniest part of the movie was the scene where the Mossad guy while making love to his wife thinks of PLO terrorists getting killed. Makes me think of supposedly Woody Allen's advice : « To forestall an orgasm I think of my bills ». <br/><br/>As a action movie, this was better than Minority Report and the War of the Worlds. The latter, I suspect was made by the CGI guys while Steven was taking a nap in his ranch.<br/><br/>The action scenes were wonderfully shot and some night scenes made me think of Collateral. <br/><br/>Well that's it. It just stays as a a good thriller. Political message ? You must be kidding.

"Quinoa1984","10","17","34","23 December 2005"," Not your typical 'revenge/action' movie, but an absorbing, potent look at the cost of taking lives
","Steven Spielberg has here his best film- or at least the best in his 'gritty' sort of tradition that was hinted at in the Indiana Jones films, went full bloom in Schindler's List, and matured further with Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report- in many a moon. He uses his perfected skills at maneuvering the mis en scene, using some manipulation, but dealing as seriously as possible with a tense, haunting subject. I've seen many reviewers say the film is haunting, has a haunting quality. Indeed this is true, and it is certainly a running theme in many of Spielberg's best films. And much as it was as well with his two films which he won best director Oscars for, here he deals with not so much the difficult, intensely emotional, and seemingly un-ending power struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but about the increasingly horrifying existential crisis for a man who to the government that hired him does not exist.<br/><br/>This man is Avner, played with the utmost conviction by Eric Bana. Spielberg must have seen something in his eyes that could make him work in this role, and he does- when one looks at him, one can see the conflict that only grows deeper and darker as the film reaches its third act. He's been hired to track down and kill, with his team (which includes great character actors like Matthieu Kassovitz and Daniel Craig), the eleven Palestinian terrorists who killed the hostages in the 1972 Olympics massacre. Things go well, at first, at least under the circumstances, as Avner also gets a little close with his 'source' giving him the names of targets for hefty sums. But as they close in closer, and as the tension is consciously squeezed tighter into paranoia, things aren't going quite as planned.<br/><br/>What makes a film like this work so brilliantly really is not what could be turned by another director into something more routine, and, indeed, condescending. Spielberg, when working with his rare R-rating to the maximum, doesn't shy away from giving us the full lot of what goes on in these raids, these bombings, shootings, plans of killing and striking back. But along the way he also gives some food for thought, so to speak, like an intriguing scene of dialog between Avner and a man in Athens (not to say too much about it, though Al Green is playing in the background). And certain scenes rank with Schindler's List showing Spielberg with a full grasp of what he MUST show the audience, however some might find it to be eye-widening or cringe-worthy (as it was for me). With his usually intuitive cameraman Janusz Kaminski, he creates this world as hellishly vivid as possible with a hand-held camera, and different color saturations for scenes (plus the lighting, which has now become Spielberg/Kaminski's trademark for the past decade).<br/><br/>And, in the end, it comes back down to what we care about with the character(s), and the protagonist's story. Avner knows he has a job to do, getting paid immensely for something (much like the Kurtz job in Apocalypse Now) that does not 'exist'. But the questions raised about what may or may not come of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict of course cannot be answered in the course of the film, only raised to a certain extent. If there is any message to the film- and I'm sure being it a Spielberg one there is (and perhaps I didn't fully comprehend it on the first viewing, being wrapped up in the pure film-making aspect of it all)- it may be that killing, taking life, even if it is OK'd by certain interested parties, will affect the soul, and the souls of those around you. That the message coincides with a taut precision with the characters, and the impeccable storytelling, makes it all the more worthwhile. The controversy around the film may be more from people who haven't see the film than those who have. Once seen, and the initial ideas of what the film might be about are gone, the story can be watched on its own terms."

","Greetings again from the darkness. We never really know which Steven Spielberg is going to show up. Will it be the incredible storyteller of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""? Or will it be the fun loving, mushy, sometimes too-cute-for-his-own-good director off ""AI"" and ""Catch Me if You Can""? No question, the famed storyteller and master technician brought is A game for ""Munich"".<br/><br/>We get the sickening story after the tragic story of in the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. SS crafts a dramatic reenactment amidst the the real-life newsreels featuring sportscaster Jim McKay and Howard Cosell thrust into unfamiliar territory. For those of us old enough to remember, this became a moment like Kennedy's assassination and the walk on the moon ... we recall where we were at when McKay informs ""They're all gone"".<br/><br/>What Spielberg has done is concentrate on the aftermath. The story of the original terrorists is almost secondary. Watching actress Lynn Cohen reincarnate Prime Minister Golda Meir is very creepy. She really captures the spirit and power of the woman. As the Israeli government organizes an assassination team to take care of the terrorists involved, we realize the goal of revenge is pretty hopeless and that bloodshed could go on forever with these tactics.<br/><br/>The leader of the team is Avner, played excruciatingly well by Eric Bana. Bana has come along way from ""Hulk""! We feel his pain and moral conflict throughout. This process leads him to the brink of losing touch with reality. What a sad result of a bad idea. Although, Bana is the main actor, it is interesting to note that Daniel Craig offers up another performance making it all but impossible to imagine him as a wise-cracking international spy known as Bond.<br/><br/>Is there any hope that these two lands can reconcile and live peaceably? Spielberg does not really answer. The real sadness is that this clash of ethnic, cultural and religious differences offer no real hope for change in the present or future. This is stunning visual storytelling and remarkable film-making that will touch you and frustrate you."
"RockBiter","9","9","16","17 January 2006"," One Man and the Vortex
","This is a highly provocative film replete with graphic images and high tension. It is not an easy film to watch in very many ways. It has two dimensions to it - a political/religious conflict on the surface and a human conflict underneath. Spielberg takes on an incident of living history and delves beneath its 'black and white' news story veneer: the 1972 killings of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics.<br/><br/>I must be honest here and confess that I was too young to remember this incident first-hand and that my prime motivation for watching it was to see Spielberg's take on it (a la Schindler's List). Indeed at times this film got on a par with that previous film of his in terms of its intensity.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Eric Bana's performance as Avi, the loyal, unassuming Mossad agent (whose wife is expecting their first child and who has visions of quietly providing for his family and really no further expectations or ambitions) who finds himself closeted in a room with generals, political officers, and even the Prime Minister and prevailed upon to accept a mission unlike any he could ever have imagined or expected: the hunting and assassinating of 11 Palestinian operatives who were each responsible for the Munich incident. He accepts because of his sense of obligation not just to the State of Israel but to the overall backdrop of the historical struggle and suffering of the Jewish People. The film is essentially about the transformation of Avi's world view and of the torment of his soul which result.<br/><br/>Avi's entering the wider conflict between Israeli and Palestinian and between Jew and Muslim even snags him and never lets him go. It is like a vortex from which he can never fully escape and Spielberg uses the transformation of Avi to illustrate the full repercussions of the wider conflict in human terms we can understand.<br/><br/>Poignant moments that really bring this out in the film are: - Golda Meir stating matter-of-factly that 'all civilizations at one time find themselves having to negotiate their values' and later solemnly concluding 'I have made the decision. The responsibility is mine.' - Ephraim casually declaring that Avi is officially 'unofficial' after signing himself into the ultra-secret netherworld of clandestine assassination - Hans? telling Avi that he is like those military men he has met who do the things asked of them - especially the dark things - 'on the run' thinking that it is all okay and that they are in control of their heads - another comrade telling Avi that 'righteousness' is what defines a Jew and that if it is lost so is the soul. - when he returns to Israel Avi is greeted by young Israeli soldiers as a hero even though he is stone-faced and utterly changed<br/><br/>The last scene was perhaps the best of all. In it Avi demands proof that the men he killed were involved in 'Munich' and Ephraim downplays the significance of such a necessity to the objectives that were reached. He juxtaposes the specific deed (the killings of the 11 men by Avi and his group of assassins) with the general endeavour (the future saving of the lives of Jews from the hands of Palestinian terrorists) and considers the giving of such proof irrelevant in the final analysis. Avi rejects this and finds that he has to turn his back on his homeland and remain in the United States. He defies Ephraim to put their faith as Jews and their personal working relationship above extremist political agendas:<br/><br/>""Break bread with me. Doesn't it say somewhere that if a Jew asks another into his home to break bread the other must come? Break bread with me, Ephraim."" To which Ephraim replies blandly, ""No."" and walks away. Spielberg brings it home very nicely in this film."

","Did Steven Spielberg personally direct this movie? I hope not because if he did then maybe it's time for him to move on to something else. Munich has to be one of the worst, if not THE worst movie ever made. Now, Hollywood makes a lot of clunkers, which are pretty bad, but nobody is trying to peddle them off as being anything but what they are - crumby, stupid, poorly made movies. Well, Munich is all that, but what makes it particularly atrocious is its overbearing pretentiousness. This is a three-hour exercise in gratuitous violence, poor acting, unbelievably inane scenes and a muddled political message. For instance, the scene where Israeli commandos attack a terrorist stronghold - dressed in pantyhose! Or the laughable portrayal of Golda Meir as a Jewish grandmother-type surrounded by all her ""boys"" (it may be of interest to know that Golda Meir led Israel through two wars and was one of two women to have signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence); or the premeditated and cold-blooded assassination of a beautiful young sexy woman, dressed only in a negligee, by three heavily armed Israeli men on the PRESUMPTION that she was responsible for someone's death; or the idea that an Israeli agent could pass himself off as a German; or ... well by now you should get the point. This movie is one of those Hollywood clunkers that belong with all those other pretentious pieces of claptrap that strive to convey an ""important"" message, but instead inspire the warning: ""Beware - you are entering a cinematic mine field. Watch this movie at your own risk.

If you are old enough to remember the Palestinian terrorists attack during the 1972 Munich Olympics you will remember the emotions you felt when you see this film. The filmmakers have put up on the screen the world of 1972. Rick Carter, Janusz Kaminski, Joanna Johnston and their teams have once again created a world the actors can inhabit, can live and die in. The sound design was breathtaking. The audience and I were fully involved in the film. I looked around a few times and saw a lot of people sitting literally on the edge of their seats leaning towards the screen. As to it's political content I am sure it will inspire a lot of conversations. Steven Spielberg once again seems to have allowed his crew's to do their jobs and what we get to see up on the screen shows his trust was well placed. I am personal so glad to see Mr. Spielberg and the rest of the producers take a chance on a film that will be controversial and will make people think and talk, thanks."

He should go to see ""Missing"" by Costa Gravas or any number of great political art films. Hey, Steven, anyone can make the Nazis look bad!

Just one of many cinematic/historical problems: For me to believe that there was any moral uncertainty by members of the Mossad in carrying out retribution for those who planned and carried out the killing of THEIR NATION'S OLYMPIC TEAM is patently absurd! Spielberg looks at '72 Munich through 2002 intifada glasses and he goes blind. Tony Kushner, lead him down the path of Jewish guilt and self-loathing. To Spielberg's detriment, he followed him.

"DICK STEEL","9","8","14","26 February 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Munich
","The Munich 1972 Olympic games will forever go down in infamy for the killing of Israeli sportsmen by a terrorist group known as Black September. If you wish to know more about the motives and happenings on that fateful day, including the ineptness of the Germans to manage the entire situation, resulting in the deaths of almost all the perpetrator and the victims, do check out the documentary One Day In September. But not to say that Steven Spielberg's Munich fares any less. My recommendation is to watch the documentary first if you wish to understand more of what happened before, then to follow up with Spielberg's movie for the tale of what happened after when the Mossad went after the mastermind planners. So that you'll not be as irritating as the bimbo sitting behind me asking her equally clueless boyfriend ""what happened? Why like that?"" Spielberg's movie is as every bit, Spielberg. It grips you from the beginning and never lets go until the end. For those who did not heed my advice above, don't worry, there's a re-enactment of the terrible event from the point where they entered into the Olympic Village, and various scenes thereafter en route to the airport are edited in between the movie. As mentioned, the movie places focus on the Mossad's attempt to wipe out the terrorist masterminds, and we follow the journey of their appointed leader, Avner, played admirably by Eric Bana, who now probably has cornered roles for the tough yet sensitive guy, like Hector in Troy, or Bruce Banner in Hulk.<br/><br/>And it's this spy-versus-spy game, that this movie excels in. We take the usual peek into government organizations sponsoring clandestine operations, and assembles Avner with a team that looked straight out of Mission: Impossible's IMF. We follow them through the missions so carefully planned ala Ocean's Eleven, aimed at sending signals to the Israeli oppositions that force will be met with force, and violence with violence. Indeed violence begets violence, and what goes around comes around, but at what cost? Information brokers are all set to profit from violence, and in the world of secret agents, so long as the price is right, you get your information, regardless of what you want to do with it.<br/><br/>But the movie also takes a more personal look into the life of Avner, who started off with gusto and with a deep sense of patriotism in their missions, before we slowly see the toil being taken on a family man who can't be with his family, or his home and country, and the degeneration of Avner into paranoia. When you're playing hunter for so long, and you find yourself one day being the prey, that's the effect it'll have on you, of over suspicion on the pretext of playing it safe.<br/><br/>John Williams is at his element here in providing a soundtrack that is intense and fits the movie perfectly. During mission scenes, you'll feel just as tense as the characters planning and executing (pardon the pun) their hits. Avner's team comprises of folks who are not exactly field experts, but their camaraderie on screen is at its finest. I was paying attention to Daniel Craig's highly volatile character Steve, and I'd still think he doesn't have what it takes to become Blond, I mean, Bond. And besides Craig, the only other peculiarly minor letdown I have was the final bed scene between Avner and wife. I thought the editing was done in a very distasteful manner, though I understand what it was trying to get at with the inter-splicing of the Munich massacre. Somehow it could have been done better.<br/><br/>It's a controversial film, but only for the controversy surrounding the subject matter, and of Spielberg's roots. It doesn't glorify either side, or try to make a statement which side is right. Two wrongs never made a right, and the movie's narrative plays it that way.<br/><br/>On a normal year, this film would be a strong contender for Best Picture, given all the predictable ingredients required for a win. However, Brokeback Mountain would probably snag the trophy for its more intimate feel as compared to standard fare of a crowd pleasing film. But the message in Munich is nonetheless clear, as hinted so subtly at a small scene of tuning a radio."

When Israel tried to retaliate, all 11 were killed. This is the true story of what happened next. 5 men were given one order; to kill all 11 people who were involved in the Munich massacre.<br/><br/>Going back to The Godfather, Munich was lighted very much the same.

"tjcclarke","9","8","14","3 February 2006"," Spielberg Strikes a Balance
","Just before I watched Steven Spielberg's Munich, there was a documentary on Channel 4 that followed the first half of the movie almost shot for shot. Apart from allowing me to brush up on my distinctly hazy knowledge of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this also provided a clear lesson in distinguishing between political history and intelligent film-making.<br/><br/>And, yes, there are discrepancies in the two accounts. Of course there are. But even assuming the documentary was rooted firmly in fact (and remember, it WAS on Channel 4  never an organisation to favour balanced reporting over controversial muck-raking), I would suggest that Munich is close enough to the truth to discredit the nay-sayers and educate the neutrals without compromising its entertainment remit.<br/><br/>Set in the immediate aftermath of the 1972 Olympic Games hostage crisis, the film charts the Israeli response to Palestinian terrorism. Keen to eliminate members of the Black September group who carried out the atrocity but equally reluctant to outrage the international community, Security Service agency Mossad employs a secret hit squad to do its dirty work and then distances itself from the whole operation.<br/><br/>The team is led by Avner (Eric Bana), the son of an Israeli hero, and contains an eclectic bunch of bomb-makers, fixers and heavies. And it is here that the film starts to distance itself from fact (or at least the documentary). Spielberg humanises his hit squad. They are fallible and conscience-driven and a world away from the unapologetic, bristling assassins depicted in the Channel 4 film where surviving members are interviewed and come across more in the traditional mould - their faces in shadow, but their distaste for the enemy very much apparent. Only Daniel Craig's brawny South African mercenary comes anywhere near the clinical coldness of these testimonies, but Avner and the others are perpetually questioning their motivation.<br/><br/>Spielberg purposefully omits any personal links between the innocent athletes cut down in Munich and those who seek retribution. There are no tearful widows or blinking, wide-eyed orphans. Avner and his team are not on a vendetta  they are merely following orders. Himself Jewish, Spielberg never glosses over the shady nature of Israel's response to the kidnappings, but he doesn't side with the Palestinians either. The terrorists are shown as brutal chancers and the other victims of the hit squad are simply targets, not martyrs.<br/><br/>If you look past the challenging material, this is intense human drama, perfectly captured by Bana's superb depiction of a patriot torn between his family and his country. Despite the risk of melodrama in the scenes where he justifies his job to his wife, he is strong enough to carry Spielberg's intrinsic message that conflict of this nature is futile: Victims will simply be replaced and the cycle of violence is endless.<br/><br/>There are some annoyances  The squad moves from inept amateurism to polished assassination machine in the time it takes to pepper an elderly gentleman with bullets in a Rome elevator shaft  but one cannot really fault the casting, especially, the spellbinding Ciaran Hinds who has gone from ham-actor extraordinaire in the bloated TV series Rome, to this terrifically controlled performance as ""cleaner"" Carl. Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale round off a mature ensemble and, despite the nature of the film, the violence and the gun-toting, the emphasis is not on gung-ho action, but on its consequences.<br/><br/>You cannot make a film like this without accusations of bias or glib preaching, but Spielberg has managed to counter these with a balanced, dignified endorsement of peace. That he has also made an enormously entertaining and challenging movie is a considerable achievement.<br/><br/>9/10"

I thought to myself: there goes one more director I'm fond of down this road and it felt like I was going to lose an old friend. Let me introduce myself first in context. I am a Palestinian who grew up with Spielberg's films, which helped keep the child in me alive. When you grow up to be happy that Steven is around cuddling your inner child every now and then, the prospect that your ways may separate soon is not a happy thought. For a while I truly tried to ignore this movie release. But after stumbling over what was happening in the media all around this movie, my initial success in keeping away all but vanished. So there I stood tonight and with a heavy heart at the box office of a Munich theater buying tickets for Munich showing at 9:45 p.m.<br/><br/>I stalled as long as I could before going in talking in the hall with my friend, getting a drink, then peanuts and a Mars Bar well, when we finally made it in the ads were done, the lights were going out and the movie was starting. As I saw the Amblin Entrainment clip, I thought to myself: this is not right... the boy in the moon and the subject at handthis does not fit together well. But before I could continue the though, something strange happened once the first scene of the movie started I got involved and I couldn't tell you why. The director got my attention, not by a trick but rather by something which is more complex. This is what I will attempt to convey through this review and which is at the heart of this movie and it is there in the first scene.<br/><br/>Outside of the Olympic City before closed gates stands a group of young men (in a totally believable seventies outfit) with the intent of getting in. Shortly after I was almost caught off guard when I find out that they are in fact the perpetrators. In hindsight I notice that there was no psychological distancing applied in the scene. In fact this is a stance throughout the movie... simply put: its up-close and personal. If you should feel any distance to any character in the movie it is your own, for those who made the movie have gone to great length to eliminate this distance. This is the first ingredient to this complex work of art.<br/><br/>Next comes the characters of whom we get introduced to Avner first I like to call him the loving one, for he is introduced through the love he hold for his family and is saved by it. In the course of the movie there will be the righteous, the skeptic, the technocrat, the charmer, the Zealot and many more. Avner is a young Mossad Agent, a Sabra (born in the state of Israel) and son of an Army Hero. He is expecting a child with his young wife and is faced with a mission in the aftermath of Munich. The events hit him hard and he is willing to take on this mission of retaliation. At this point two other qualities of this movie are revealed: The characters are not defined by their respective roles in the movie, but are separate from them and thus become even more real; and the ability of the script to get to the point very efficiently.<br/><br/>Pivotal messages are conveyed with a directness seldom seen in a movie, especially when dealing with a subject matter which is so delicate as the conflict at hand. In the war room scene with Golda Meir the rational behind retaliation is introduced juxtaposed against response. In a very short scene light is shed on the political reasons for doing what is then to ensue in the course of this story. And this scene opens the way for the fourth and most important element employed in this movie; namely: questioning.<br/><br/>Munich questions all involved and involves you in the process. The movie stirs you up, not because it is throwing issues at you, but because it is asking you questions up-close and personal involving real people and conflicts. The movie does so without taking sides. Here I need to point out that one should not mix-up taking sides with perspective. A story needs to be told by some kind of protagonist, in our case it is the Mossad agent Avner. Relating the story from his perspective did not, in the case of this movie, entail taking his side.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and his team produced a masterpiece, where craft is employed to achieve the effects needed in order to maintain the delicate stance the makers have taken, all the while remaining human. This movie is not trying to be balanced in dealing with the subject matter. It is rather bringing us closer to the inner child, which without bias nor hate, with naivety without ignorance puts the questions forth which need humane answers.<br/><br/>So the boy remains in the moon and Steven, my friend, may our one God hear your prayer and mine for peace tonight."

","Having seen this film only yesterday, all I can say is that without a doubt I'm seeing it again next week. Having been disappointed with Brokeback Mountain I entered the cinema with low expectations, have not been treated to a masterpiece since Crash. Munich did not disappoint me.<br/><br/>The story follows 5 top secret Israeli assassins hired to hunt down and kill 11 Palestiniens who had a hand in planning the Munich killings. The story is superb, and is conveyed in a really convincing manner. While some parts may feel a little confusing, simply sticking with it is rewarding.<br/><br/>Eric Bana does indeed steal the show as the team leader for the deadly five, and is well supported from Daniel 'Bond' Craig, who puts on a more than convincing south African accent. Not a single hollow performance is turned in, and they all seem to be heavily affected from the job they are carrying out. It is superbly crafted how with all these brutal murders, their mindsets begin to change and the harsh reality of war hits them all.<br/><br/>The action scenes shot in this movie are brutally real. The action shots covered the actually killing of the Israeli Olympic team feels hauntingly real, as does some of the bombings which take place.<br/><br/>While some may be turned away by the 164 minute run time (which I know my friends were) I feel this is a great film, and definitely one of Spielberg's best. Definitely does deserve some recognition.<br/><br/>10/10"
"noilie","4","8","14","2 February 2006"," South-African accents !! (& other observations)
","There seems to be a lot of blathering about this film's topicality... Yes, Hamas won, YESYESYES the world is going to end..... Well done to Steven Spielberg for releasing the film now (obviously a calculated box-office move) My critique is - slightly - different (I am not going to bore you with questionable information or ""leaked"" documents about the ""FACTS"" or with some tired pro-or anti- Israel rant).<br/><br/>Spielberg was either confused, thoughtless or lazy with the Daniel Craig character, a South-African-Afrikaans-Blonde-Blue-Eyed-Zionist-Assassin (phew!). EXTREMELY improbable. With a film that claims to be as resonant and is as ""messagy"" as ""Munich"" does, he can't afford to make (BIG) mistakes like this.<br/><br/>I think it comes down to this: Americans (for whom this film was primarily made) don't know what a ""Jewish South-African"" would look or sound like. Nor would most of the world. They might have SOME (vague) idea of what a ""White South-African from the 1970's"" looks like: a blonde haired- blue eyed, violent, chunky lookin' fella with a thick, gruff Apartheidy-type ""Afrikaans"" accent. Jewish South-Africans were classed as ""White"" in South-Africa under the old dispensation.<br/><br/>So, in my view, Spielberg merely subsumed ""South-African Jewishness"", an entirely unknown type in the realm of the International Cineplex, under the International Stereotype of ""White Oppressive Afrikanerdom"", a recognizable, almost ""parodic"" category. This is troubling for reasons I won't get into here but which should be obvious. Spielberg has sacrificed sense in favour of easy intelligibility or, rather, recognizability for his audience.<br/><br/>Or maybe Daniel Craig is just a rubbish, crass, nuance-less actor who, here, gives a broad, obvious performance? No, this is harsh. I think it calamity is the fault of Steven Spielberg, an arch-enemy of nuanced cinema. This is a calculated, but lazy, move on his part.<br/><br/>Same goes for the accents, generally, in this film. Wouldn't Israeli Jews (Avner, his wife, P.M. Golda Meir & her officials, etc.) speak in Hebrew amongst themselves & not in broken English? (But subtitles for monolingual Americans is box-office poison, right?) Anyway, to start on this would drag into question a number of (improbable & impossible) things about this film that irk me These include that senseless flashback to the massacre from Avner's perspective. He wasn't there, so Spielberg has to make a narrative booboo in his quest to FORCE us, to COERCE us into caring. He exonerates and whitewashes all of Avner's ethical self-questioning - that we've had to sit through for the duration of the movie - by showing us the disparity between the Israeli group's ethical action, their patriotic, hence ""necessary"" crimes, as opposed to the ""Arab"" group's heinous, brutal, senseless crime. Why does doesn't Spielberg ""flash back"" to some of Avner's sins? Because that would tarnish his ""hero"" status and Spielberg wouldn't have a -RA-RA-, rousing ending. In Spielberg's worldview, it seems, there needs to be a hero. For all the film's ""Violence is not the right way"", ""violence begets violence"" rhetoric, for all Spielberg's claims to equivalence, to ""showing both sides"", we are never in any doubt as to who is RIGHT, morally and ethically justified. And anyway; ""Homely"", self-searching assassins who dine and laugh with one another; their common, self-less cause? Ahem... Assassins need to be clinical, exacting, to negate conscience. That wouldn't fit in with Spielberg's project: we HAVE to like them, we MUST care for them, believe in their JUSTNESS & it it is they that are invested with conscience & high-mindedness, not the other side (Avner's shakiness on the first kill; they only kill their targets & there's a big, sweaty, tense moral cadenza when this goes wrong; the ""What have we done"" speeches, etc.<br/><br/>If you haven't guessed by now, I HATE this film: It is far too shallow and insubstantial; its argument is simplistic (witness ""Golda Meir's"" ""grandmotherly"" proclamations & the silly scene between Avner and a Palestinian); its message is clunky and hollow; its perspective on ""THE SITUATION"" is utterly conventional & bland. It is not nearly as controversial as some people seem to think it is (or it wouldn't have been nominated for a ""respectable"" Oscar).<br/><br/>It DOES contain a few nice cinematic touches, amongst other details, but on the whole: ""so what?"".<br/><br/>This is a conventionally thrilling ""Boy's Movie"" badly melded onto a ""real life"" or ""topical"" situation. The film shows the limitations of Hollywood's narrative conventions (finely honed & market researched ""frivolous entertainment"") when dealing with ""serious"" global, political subject matter.<br/><br/>Anyway, suffice to say that Spielberg is cleaver to explicitly preface his film with a ""BASED on real events"". He should start, if he can, making films for grown-up people."

","Spielberg is the last person you'd expect to be the director of this movie - no good against evil story, no happy end, no glorification of anyone... You would not even expect it to come from Hollywood. This is not the Saturday night popcorn entertainment kind of film, it's very dark and gripping and will keep your brains busy for a while after you've seen it.<br/><br/>Some people in this forum find the movie too long, some suggesting that the makers did not take enough time to cut and edit it. But in this case the length of the film is a tool to make a point: pointlessness.<br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS: The Israeli ""assassin team"" receives a list of 11 people to execute in various places all over Europe, all of them are supposed to have some sort of connection with the Munich attack 1972. After the 3rd or 4th kill, the film is getting harder and harder to watch. Not only that there is no bright moment anymore to smile about or to make you feel easier, the feeling of senselessness grows and the graphic violence is getting more intense by each ""chapter"" of the story. You want it to stop, you want the guys to finish or to give up, but they keep going. You start counting down the kills, but then they even start killing people not on the list, like other assassins that got ""in their way"", or people replacing people they already have murdered. And then you get it: this is never going to end. It will continue for as long as people respond to violence with violence, and it will get worse.<br/><br/>Apart from the great directing and writing, I have to mention the awesome performance of Eric Bana as the main character Avner, he is extremely believable at all moments. In the beginning he is that smiling, shining young man, ready to take on the world, and in a slow, almost unnoticeable process he becomes a paranoid, twisted and depressed wreck.<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies that do more than just entertain, and if you can take the strong graphic violence: go and see it. 10/10"

","A mesmerizing presentation of Israel's inquiry to the massacre of its athletes in Munich Olympics 1972. It's a film of uncommon depth and sensitivity without any political bias. The movie starts with the Palestinian terrorist attack on Israel's athletes.If you don't know what the movie is about, you should try to read some background about it before you watch it. Speielberg absolutely takes you in 70s time. Events are unfolded in natural and flawless manner without any manipulation. It surely expresses the dual state of mind of a man who is serving his country carrying out the assassinations ordered by the Prime Minister of Israel herself, in response to the terrorist attack, exhibiting the power and keeping the peace process aside . He surely understands what he is doing is nothing but an act of vengeance and igniting more terrorism than causing peace and resolving problems that should be resolved. Spielberg leaves you deciding it on yourself what the movie wants to tell. All are fighting for their own homes, but at the cost of other's. A must watch portrayal of courage and conscience."
"Norwegianheretic","10","20","43","16 December 2005"," Another Spielberg Wonder
","Out of the gate, political questions aside, this picture is directed brilliantly and, to my continuing amazement regarding Spielberg, with new methods of displaying action and pictorial picture telling. Years ago, it took a while for me to be impressed with Spielberg. In recent years, he seems as though he can do little wrong. His maturity as a story teller and his development of endless methods of telling his stories visually makes each of his movies a fresh experience. <br/><br/>MUNICH is a sobering picture about a weighty topic and manages, with few exceptions (and those exceptions could easily be cut), to deal with moral and ethical questions with an artful minimum of intellectuality. The implications of being involved in a political war are always brought to a personal level, where they should be. And doing it this way, without any solid answers, leaves the situation in the middle east, as far as the story goes, an open question. Spielberg doesn't attempt to put any exclamation point on the moral justification of what we see in this movie."

Based on George Jonas' book 'Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team' this movie tells about how one group of men enacted Israel's retribution and the prices they had to pay.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is awesome in the film as a man who undergoes a dramatic change after what he does for his country, a country that cannot afford to acknowledge his existence. I also liked seeing Michael Lonsdale as Papa. People might remember him as Hugo Drax in Moonraker (my favorite Bond villain).<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies I have seen all year.

"dbborroughs","6","11","21","3 January 2006"," Okay but not great retelling of the aftermath of the Munich Olympic tragedy
","This is a movie that looks and feels unlike any other Steven Spielberg film. Its a well made and mostly well acted story about the Israeli hit squad sent out to kill the plotters of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics. The problem for me was that I was never emotionally engaged except when we see the recreation of the attack. I never really felt any connection to any of the Israeli agents taking revenge. A large part of the problem is that Eric Bana seems completely out of place in the film. He's much taller and much too good looking not to stand out in a crowd, which struck me as odd since he was chosen to lead the team in part because he didn't look Jewish. Bana also seemed to have only one expression through most of the movie and I wondered whether he was actually Buster Keaton in disguise. This isn't to say the film is a bad movie, its not, Its just not a particularly engaging one. For my money I would rather see the 1986 version of the same story The Sword of Gideon, or better yet the excellent documentary One Day in September again since at least I would actually feel some connection to the events rather than just an admiration for the film making skill."

","""Munich"" is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seats for the first hour or so. It is fast-paced, slickly done (but then what else would you expect of Spielberg), and the editing is taut. The acting is competent without being exceptional. The script puts more emphasis on incidents than characters. With all these good things going for it, the movie still fails to deliver the killer punch that will make you remember the movie a month from when you watched it and cause you to think. The killing of the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the Munich Olympic Game massacre is a matter of faith with this devoted group. However, after the first few killings, I lost the point behind it. A few gripping scenes yes, a few bloody scenes yes, but where is the narrative that strings all these together. The movie to me loses its message in its overemphasis on style. The human element, the one thing that I absolutely insist on in a movie, is there but again without the punch. The protagonist echoed my feeling when he said they have killed a bunch of terrorists yes, but only for each one to be replaced with someone more bloodthirsty. This is where the good guys lose their moral legitimacy and ultimately their ability to carry the audience (ok, I am speaking for myself but maybe not)."

Although being too long, this tale of retaliation and revenge is very well executed. I do not know how accurate this story is, and I appreciated it as an action movie and not a political one actually. The screenplay remains as neutral as possible, as usual in a Hollywood production, with characters questioning their methods and realizing that they are acting in the same despicable way as the other side; that for each of their action, there is a reaction; further, like a chimera, when they eliminate one leader, immediately there is a replacement.

"thomas-e-williams-1","1","12","24","26 August 2009"," Joseph Goebbels eat your heart out.
","Steven Spielberh here directs a glorifying homage to revenge and violence. Which is fine if your making fiction, but is this a responsible way to deal with an important issue?<br/><br/>Some directors, Quentin Tarantino for example, get away with making films which bear no clear relationship to the morality or social laws which help society function on a daily basis. They do this by making it obvious that the film is a film, and is set in a separate (and in QT's example highly stylised) world, inconsistent with ours but relatively consistent with itself. This allows the presentation of violence in a somewhat positive light without the director being suceptible to accusations of moral vacuosity.<br/><br/>Spielberg here does not benefit from such a protective screen. Setting the film in the real world yet also presenting pre meditated violence as a brilliant virtue of Mossad is dubious to start with. But why present one type of violence (violence and terrorism with an emancipatory based legitimacy argument) as totally senseless, and another (A world wide romp of revenge and pre meditated murder) as the wholesome redemption of the Israeli international pride? It seems Spielberg may not have approached this from an independent perspective.<br/><br/>This would be fine, if he wasn't convincing other viewers of its Documentary like unbiased depth. This is a film which is designed wholeheartedly to promote the Israeli world view, and based in a mindset of hate, revenge and a lack of dialogue, which would be great entertainment if it didn't try and pretend it was a fair and realistic presentation of fact."
"ramlabile","4","6","10","6 June 2007"," Not impressed.
","The film in general was objective in a sense that it attempted to explain (at least verbally) the two sides and the cycle of violence involved in the conflict. However, when considering the implicit nature of images, the film did injustice to the presentation of both sides. The biggest thing that I noticed was the subtle racism towards the Arabs. All the Palestinian characters were either completely fobs (so the audience could not relate to them at all), or they were wealthy pigs (so the audience was annoyed with them). They spoke broken English and were presented as emotion-driven fanatics. The exception was perhaps the Italian-Arab poet who translates 1001 nights. <br/><br/>This representation happens all the time actually, and this is perhaps why it is easier for Americans to relate to Israelis over Palestinians. People always associate Israel with ""the west,"" those who are like Americans and Europeans while the Palestinians are just backward folks who are nothing like ""us."" The psychological affect of this is that people pick sides and align themselves with the people who resemble them the most.<br/><br/>Another thing that I noticed was that the Israel assassins were presented as noble characters. The main character is this soft-hearted, beautiful man who cradles his child and says fluffy things to his wife whom he clearly adores. You cannot help but be charmed by this character. The hit-men do everything in their power to avoid killing civilians (esp. the scene when the little girl goes back to her house and they go out of their way to stop the bomb from going off). The same is not done with the Arab side, which is fine since this is not necessary true. However, it is also true that the state of Israel does not differentiate between fighters and citizens, between old and young, between women and men, or between child and adult. Towards the end of the movie, the group kills a woman who seduced and murdered their colleague. This murder is done with tremendous guilt and much difficulty. So this ultimately makes them appear as individuals with sincere personal conscience (and good men with good intentions). On the contrary, the Arab violence is illustrated as senseless brutality and the audience is never really able to understand the Palestinian cause. <br/><br/>Another interesting thing was the fact that the Israeli authorities never provided evidence of guilt to the assassins (as far as the men who they were to kill). So periodically, the audience sees the charming fellow described above struggle with this issue and question the officials for the information. Again, this makes him appear like a man with a firm sense of justice. How cute. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was better than I actually expected, but it was in many ways, exactly what I expected. I will admit that at one point, it is conveyed that little attention was given to the 200 and some Palestinians who were killed after the Munich tragedy. No one mourned for these people and the world remained fixed on the Munich event. This is true, and the addition of this clip was a sign of an attempt on the film makers part to be ""neutral."" <br/><br/>Finally, films about supposed Arab terrorism are usually filmed from the viewpoint of the victims and not the terrorist, interestingly, this film was shot from the perspective of the Israeli assassin team leader and not from the view of the victims of this tragedy. So naturally, the audience found itself rooting for murders.<br/><br/>Oh... and the film was not really about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict... at least in my opinion."

At this point, I feel like I know his face better than one of my family members.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is a powerful story done by a powerhouse group, as it is directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. It's the story of a young Israeli, Avner (Eric Bana), who is asked to head up a team with the mission to eliminate the men responsible for the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The situation is re-enacted but real television news clips are used throughout the beginning of the film. Though he has a wife and their first child is on the way, Avner accepts the assignment, which takes him all over the world tracking down and killing the miscreants. When his assignment comes to an end, he finds he is unable to shake his experiences.<br/><br/>""Munich"" demonstrates, in the form of Avner and his team, the disintegration of those qualities that make us human beings in the first place. These men believe in what they're doing but become disillusioned - can they all be trusted? Whom can they trust? What is the point of, as one of them puts it, ""all this blood"" when the people they kill are replaced with worse people? In the beginning, Avner clearly has no affection for killing - he watches, horrified, as it goes on. The team is careful not to hurt civilians - for instance, they protect a little girl, the daughter of one of the Black September planners, from a bomb intended for her father. Later, Avner's orders are ""just do it,"" and there are bodies of innocent victims everywhere. Avner pays a man named Louis huge money for information on the whereabouts of the Black September men - and then begins to doubt him - is he in turn telling the other side his whereabouts because he has become a target? I agree that Spielberg does not take sides in the film and shows how everyone suffers in any violent conflict, and that after a time, people hate for the sake of hating and kill for the sake of killing, often forgetting what started the whole cycle.<br/><br/>Eric Bana gives a fantastic performance as Avner. He looks so different at the end of the film than at the beginning, as he becomes increasingly more paranoid. He is particularly frightening in the scene where he is making love to his wife and reliving what he's been through. One really feels the harrowing experiences he's had and what it has done to his spirit.<br/><br/>A thought-provoking and sobering film."

","This is the story of a mission that wasn't acknowledge initially when it happened in 1972,Golda Meier(Lynn Cohen) pulled together a number of government officials and members of the Mossad(Geoffrey Rush) and they decided to put together a list of people that they felt were responsible for what had happened in Munich.And they made the decision to try to go after those people.It's told there was a committee of 10 people decided to,sort of,try and sentence to death as many as 11,possible more,possible less but it was probably around 11 Palestian men .Some of the people that were targeted were definitely part of a terror network and some of the people that were targeted were political leaders,intellectual leaders.The idea was to call attention to the world that Israel would no allow this to happen again.And the mission Golda send them on,it's almost an eye for an eye.Golda Meier took the responsibility on her own shoulders.The main dramatic agents are five guys who are assassinating people,the guys are working for intelligence agency and they weren't sociopaths,they were doing their job.The guys are vulnerable,doubtful with no falling into all the obvious clichés of the hit-man with the doubt.The 5 guys(Bana,Daniel Craig,Matthew Kassovitz,Cirian Hinds,Hans Zischler) are all very different,age,background,upbringing,some have been bringing up in Europe,some have been in Israel,they have been selected for their different qualities.We might say it's like a quintet,a musical quintet,they are very sharply defined characters in themselves and sometimes their hesitations look like.They have different ways of speaking ,of behaving ,but they know they are are forged together.They are committed to the cause of Israel and they are ready to fight for his land.Avner(Eric Bana) doesn't really know why he's chose but for some reason he was chosen as the leader though we really know why the others were chosen.<br/><br/>It's a totally intelligent movie about hatred and revenge,there is no glory or outcome but pure destruction.It was really no the story of the massacre itself but the aftermath.And this very murky,problematic,complicated story about the policy of targeted assassination.The picture is produced by Barry Mendel using actual locations,he was working on the movie for eight years and he assembled every book and documentary on the subject that he could find including all news footage and then he along with Spilberg who gives his own point of view on the story ,they went to work on the script for the next year and a half and eventually writer Tony Kushner came on at the end of the last year.Tony gave to Spielberg a total immersion into the politics and policies with a point of view coming from both sides,not just one side.When Steven Spielberg first got involved in this project and it was called ¨Vengeance¨,then he hired to Eric Bana when he saw ¨Incredible Hulk ¨,but he saw a warmth and a strength and even a little tickle of fear behind his eyes which humanises people,no matter what their jobs and he was very determined to humanise the characters.In the film intervene the usual and excellent technicians Spielberg as Rick Carter(production design),Michael Kahn(edition),Joanna Johnson(costume designer),and of course the cameraman Janusz Kaminski and the master John Williams with an evocative score musical."

","Many viewers will remember the events at Munich as they unfolded. I remember Jim McKay announcing the deaths on television. Others should know about it just by keeping up with recent history. For those who don't know about it, Spielberg gives us a summary of what happened at the beginning of the film, mostly through TV news clips. The shootout at Munich airport is outlined in the first ten or fifteen minutes, after which the story turns to the organization of the Israeli response.<br/><br/>My reaction was one of pleasant surprise because, by all the laws of commercial narrative, that horrifying, violent event should have been saved for the climax. (Eg., ""In Cold Blood."") Not only should it have been saved, but the deaths should be gone into in gory detail with exploding heads and mushroom-like fireballs. And here was Spielberg treating us like grown ups, trusting the audience enough not to feel the terror of those moments must be put on the stage and spelled out.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Spielberg, now a charter member of the Hollywood community, couldn't entirely disregard the demands of conventional structure, and we get an explicit flashback -- brief and powerful, but still unnecessary -- near the end, and while the protagonist is making love to his wife. Fantasizing about a bloody tragedy while making love is probably not what most people do, depending on one's partner, I suppose.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is far above the usual standards of the international action genre. There is in fact no more blood and guts than is called for. John Williams' music tells us more than what we need to hear about suffering, but the photography and location shooting by Janusz Kaminski are nearly flawless. The lead player, Eric Bana, not only performs well but looks the part of someone plucked out of an office and suddenly transformed into a dedicated assassin. His most routine expression changes from boyish surprise to dismal disillusion at the end.<br/><br/>As a director, Spielberg doesn't make a false step. The action scenes are sometimes a little confusing but it seems to make them all the more effective. The most graphic death on screen is that of an attractive young Dutch woman who has murdered (or caused to be murdered) on of the team of assassins. Naked, shot in the chest with two small bullets, dripping blood from her lips, she slowly walks away and fondles her cat absent-mindedly.<br/><br/>The tale, ""inspired by real events,"" is presented with all its moral ambiguity intact. Guilt is brought up, but only briefly, and there is only one speech (by an Arab nationalist) that sounds written deliberately for the screen. But the script is full of observations that violate everyday standards of deference. One of the Israeli assassins backs off on a killing, saying, ""Thousands of years of suffering doesn't make you virtuous. We are supposed to be righteous. That is what I was taught."" So much for the power of victimhood. Just because you've been stomped on by history -- abused as a child, persecuted by the state, unjustifiably blamed for something, born with some socially devalued characteristic like dark skin -- it doesn't necessarily make your actions or your views morally superior to others'. That's a pretty bold statement, the kind that can be made only by Jews, blacks, abused wives, or displaced Palestinians.<br/><br/>I was grateful too, for the way the film ended. The conventions require the demoralized hero to join his family in Brooklyn, sulk for a while, then return to his homeland while triumphant music swells in the background and his mother greets him with a hug. It doesn't happen. That's what I mean when I say the film is ""adult."" There are higher authorities than the bureaucracy one works for.<br/><br/>There are no easy ethical answers because who knows why we fight and kill one another? Each of us has a personal excuse for what we do, and groups have collective excuses for what they do. Conflict might be based on ethnicity, religion, race, pride, or territory. And if we could somehow take away all THOSE reasons for murdering one another I'm afraid some others would emerge as overnight replacement. ""Your grandfather once insulted my grandfather."" By now, Spielberg has made a couple of genuinely good movies, and his talent is on display in this one."

","A Mossad agent (Eric Bana) and his team of assassins (Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler) are hired by Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) and the Israeli government to seek out and kill 11 Palestinian terrorist syndicates who directly and sometimes indirectly had a hand in the tragic killings of Israel's Olympic Team in the summer of 1972. ""Munich"" is an unyielding political thriller that becomes more psychological as it advances. Bana and his partners have bouts of conscience, total fits of despair and constant motivational dilemmas. Shady characters galore (Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric) and Bana's female connections back home (wife Ayelet Zorer and mother Gila Almagor) add to the film's depth and wide-reaching personal network. Geoffrey Rush nearly steals the show in limited screen time as the Israeli liaison and seductress Marie-Josee Croze tantalizes and torments. Steven Spielberg does his best work since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and does arguably his most complex work since ""Schindler's List"". While not his best film by a mile, it is still probably his most interesting and intriguing. Though a bit long and at times difficult to follow, ""Munich"" definitely takes a place with the better films of 2005. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"JimSDCal","9","15","32","27 December 2005"," An intelligent film
","""Munich"" is not Steven Spielberg's masterpiece; that would still be ""Schindler's List"". But, it is Spielberg's most intelligent film. Without providing answers, Spielberg accomplishes what most great artist do, uses his art to make his viewers consider the real world. In this case that is by posing the question, ""what is the most effective way to deal with terrorism?"" There are two basic choices, avenge terrorism with violence against its perpetrators, hoping it will deter future acts or accept that violence begets more violence and vengeance merely further fuels the anger that spurs terrorism. These questions are mostly posed in the last 45 minutes of ""Munich"", the first hour and 45 minutes is a very good thriller.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics of 1972. Israeli PM Golda Meier decides on the first tack in responding to the terrorism, saying at times a nation must compromise its values and that Israel must appear strong before the world. Avner (Eric Bana) is recruited to lead the team that is assigned to locate and kill the 11 leaders of Black September that planned the attack on Israel's athletes. Avner is provided with a team of 5 with various skills, such as bomb-making, clean up and documentation. The team starts upon its mission and begins to kill the terrorists. (not said, but note-worthy is in appearance the Palestinians killed all appear to be middle-class, middle-aged men. It is possible by killing these people, Israel inadvertently allowed younger, more radical and violent men to take their place).<br/><br/>It is after about 1 hour and 45 minutes that the movie changes from mostly straight-forward thriller to questioning the effect of the killing. Various men of Avner's team have various reactions to participating in killing others. Then, having attracted attention, members of Avner's team start to be killed. Avner becomes almost paranoid about his own safety. By film's end, Avner fantasizes that he is both a member of the Black September attack and a member of the doomed Olympic team.<br/><br/>Spielberg also portrays both Israeli and Palestinians as defending their actions due to their desire to have a home. This is a familiar Spielberg team. The unanswered question, which having seen the film one must consider is: What do you do when 2 people want the same home. Can they ever reconcile these desires and find a way to live in peace? The Cold War, South Africa and, hopefully, Norhtern Ireland found peaceful resolutions, maybe one day this can also happen in the Middle East."

","Steven Spielberg's treatise on middle-eastern violence ranks alongside his Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan as a towering achievement. Part electrifying thriller, but heart-wrenching tragedy, this is likely to provoke more thought and debate than any other film this year, and has all of the hallmarks of a master storyteller at the peak of his form. Rather than criticizing Israel, as some have suggested, or vilifying Palestine, as others have complained, Spielberg observes the cost of violence on nations and individuals. Working from a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, Munich asks difficult questions and doesn't provide easy answers. The cast, including Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds, give excellent, understated performances. The recreation of the Munich massacre is as devastating in it own way as Spielberg's take on the D-Day landing, but the quiet moments where the Mossad assassins question their own righteousness are perhaps even more effective.<br/><br/>Munich is one of the bravest films ever made, and Spielberg deserves to join the exclusive club of three-time Oscar winning directors on this one."
"patrick_bateman_esquire","7","13","27","23 December 2005"," The Price of Revenge
","Once again, Steven Spielberg follows one of his ""Hollywood"" blockbusters with a more dramatic and more serious film. Most people over the age of 40 or so can remember with some clarity the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, West Germany. Sadly, many Americans seem to remember most America's basketball team getting ripped off by the Soviets. However, the greatest tragedy was the kidnapping and murders of the Israeli Olympic team (coaches and athletes alike). It was a horrific event, made worse by the complete incompetence of the West German officials (who handled the crisis as poorly as anybody could). It was that poor mishandling by the West Germans, and the escape from any kind of justice by the assassins, that motivated the Israelis into deciding that something more had to be done. And that ""more"" was getting revenge against anybody that bore any responsibility. So, the Mossad (secret police) put together a hit-list of people they feel were involved in the plot and killings. Were these people on the list all legitimate targets worthy of assassination? That is a question each person, depending on their own motivation and beliefs must answer. However, one clear point that Spielberg makes in this wonderful film, is that killing for revenge for killing, does not resolve conflicts or bring peace, just more hardship. Moreover, the mental toll taken on by these Israeli assassins for carrying out their justice, raises interesting parallels with their targets. The Bible says ""Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord,"" indeed."
"CountZero313","10","5","8","20 April 2007"," Spielberg at the top of his game
","ET wanted to go home, and Elliot missed having a father. In Jaws, the father wants to find his son. In Minority Report, the Dad wants to find his son, ditto the Dad in War of the Worlds, and the Mum in Close Encounters. In Terminal, Tom Hanks wants to go home. In Saving Private Ryan, they want to bring the son home to his mother. Spielberg unashamedly explores the same theme of family and belonging in the vast majority of his movies. Sometimes he gets it spectacularly right - ET; at other times it falls flat on its face - AI. In Munich, his passion for this theme reaches its crescendo as he flawlessly blends the micro and the macro: the Israelis as children looking for their lost home (mirrored by the displaced Palestinians), and Avner roaming the globe but longing to be with his wife and daughter. What makes Munich such a special cinematic experience is that Spielberg manages to hold in check the sentimentality that so damages his other work. In Minority Report, Samantha Morton gives a speech to Tom Cruise about all the possible futures his son could have had, an embarrassing gush of sentimental tripe. But in Munich, Avner breaks ranks to be with his wife when she gives birth, but his sentimental words are undercut by her teasing; the scene plays out realistically, touchingly, and devoid of sentimentality. It is almost a post-modern apology from Spielberg for the excesses of previous work. There isn't a missed beat in Munich. My God, those transitions - the attention to detail is breath-taking. <br/><br/>I was struck watching Spielberg on The Actors' Studio when he said that he is aware of Spielberg the icon, an entity separate from himself, that people criticise or deify, but that as Spielberg the man he is removed from that and suffers over every film. That is reassuring to hear from the most successful and celebrated filmmaker of our times. Clearly Munich is a result of this process of reflection and self-doubt. The day Spielberg relaxes, film-making will suffer. Long may the rigour and self-examination that produced Munich continue."

From it's beginning to it's end, the film's graphic subject matter will not be easy for those to take.<br/><br/>Eric Bana, Oscar worthy in every way, portrays Israeli Mossad (intelligence) officer, Avner Kauufman who was years ago a bodyguard of the then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.<br/><br/>Kauufman is a loyal Israeli supporter who wants nothing more than for a strong Isreal and it's citizens.<br/><br/>Hours after the massacre at Munich, Avner is contacted by an Israeli intelligence officer played by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush to plan a top secret mission of retaliation against the members of Black September, a Palestinian terrorist organization responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games.<br/><br/>Avner is brought together with a group of European Jews each with a certain specialty, one who is great with weapons, and for getaways, one for creating explosives, one who is excellent with forging documents, and one for clean up, leaving no traces of Israeli responsibility.<br/><br/>The first sets of retaliations goes as planned as the group led by Avner and his hit-man team track down and ""assassinate"" each of the Black September members responsible for the assassinations in Munich.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwords, the tables are turned against Avner and his team as Black September and it's members begin tracking Avner's team in retaliation for the first bombings. Avner starts feeling the pressure when members of his own team are marked for assassination, and after some of the bombings go horribly wrong. This starts to mark questions in Avner and the audience's mind about what is right and what is wrong in dealing with terrorism.<br/><br/>This begins a long game of cat and mouse between the Israels and the members of Black September as they chase each other across the globe, from Europe to the Middle East, searching for revenge on one another.<br/><br/>One of the biggest and most tense scenes is where Avner, and a member of Black September argue each other's point, Avner justifying the existence of Israel, and the Black September member arguing for a homeland for the Palestinians.<br/><br/>There are no points in confronting terrorism, is the movie's message, each time you retaliate, the other side will also retaliate.<br/><br/>This is definitely Spielberg's darkest film, with some of the most graphic violence recreating the assassinations of the Israeli athletes, and those looking for simple answers will not find them in this film.<br/><br/>Spielberg has raised some serious questions, about the state of Israel, it's existence, and how they handle and justify their defense against terrorism, and this film could anger some of his most loyal fans.<br/><br/>However, I applaud Spielberg for the questions, that he and his film have laid out, and the questions it asks for how our country is leading the current War on Terrorism.<br/><br/>One word about this film, it is surely going to be controversial, some will absolutely hail it, and some will absolutely hate it. This film will surely divide people, into some really hard decisions, that's for sure!

"buymyapartment","1","19","43","25 December 2005"," Scandalous and shameful, spewing salacious lies
","'Equally as unjustified'.<br/><br/>That's the quote I read at the end of someone else's review.<br/><br/>(paraphrase) 'The tragic events of Munich led to Israel's doing something equally unjustified'...<br/><br/>And you see, Mr. Spielberg, that is precisely the problem. You release a film that poses a lot of questions, raises a lot of doubts...the sorts of things that would be best explored in the privacy of a library, or on the internet, for you to research and discover and discern and figure out, using solid sources and sound research techniques. But when you air your gripes in a popular format like a movie, wild theories and unanswered questions have a way of freezing themselves into the public consciousness. Perceptions are altered, people's understanding of history warp into the twisted and perverse theories your mind entertains, and blasphemy is born.<br/><br/>To suggest that Israel's hunting down of terrorists is 'morally equivalent' to terrorists kidnapping and executing 11 innocent athletes is mind-boggling in its Stockholm-esquire insanity. How do you feel, Mr. Spielberg, knowing that your artistic venture caused such thoughts to creep into the mind of at least one, and who knows how many other fertile minds? Irrational, morally relativsitic thoughts like this stem from your planting absurd thoughts into people's minds. What the filmmaker views as an artistic or intellectual exercise, others view as immutable proof of reality. So for example, when some of the Israelis in 'Munich' repeatedly question whether their ring leader has seen the evidence implicating their terrorist targets, the intelligent viewer understands this as the reasonable worries, fears and doubts anyone in an extraordinarily stressful, life altering position might think about, if only to keep his sanity. The uninitiated viewer, on the other hand, sees such an exchange as a none-too-subtle swipe at the justification for the Israeli government's selection of targets, and thus comes to such conclusions as Israel's pursuit of the terrorists being morally on par with the terrorists' gruesome actions.<br/><br/>And when the opening credits divulge the name of the book upon which the film is based, and include the words 'inspired by real events', the discerning viewer who takes the time to do a little research knows that the book was written by a widely-discredited figure who has been repeatedly accused of fabricating all kinds of stories, and of claiming connections to events or places or organizations in which he never took part. The uninitiated, on the other hand takes the film, many of whose moments of intrigue and blunder were no doubt ramped up in the name of artistic license, as gospel.<br/><br/>The cadence of Spielberg's piece however, and quite possibly his raison d'etre in creating this terrible affront, is the implication that the State of Israel has lost its Jewish character. The film takes breaks from the main cat-and-mouse aspect of the tale repeatedly to remind us, via long speeches spoken by many characters, about what 'true' Jewish virtues are: righteousness, goodness, justice etc. Certainly, Spielberg is no anti-Semite. But he then proceeds to demonstrate -- most vividly in the final 15 minutes -- how, in his view, Israel has deviated from that paradigm. How it is willing to do anything and everything to justify its existence and continued survival, even when those actions run contrary to the core of its collective spiritual being. Golda Meir says it, Avner's mother says it, Geoffrey Rush's character's whole being says it...and we, as an audience who sympathize with Avner, find such a stance increasingly reprehensible. And this reprehensible idea is not brought up in the abstract or in a vague and ambiguous vacuum, but as the 'official position' of the State of Israel, and by extension, represents the raison d'etre and collective zeitgeist of the State. That the state and its officers treat him so callously and coldly throughout -- certainly with far less admiration or affection than th Palestinian has for his daughter -- is one very disconcerting image that anyone who has been through the very family oriented aspect of Israeli political and military life can tell you is patently false. But it really comes to a shocking head in the very last line of the film. Avner, in a gratuitous line completely out of character, invites his nemesis to 'do something Jewish' with him. (Until this point, Avner has made no mention of his Jewishness, no desire to engage in anything remotely religious. It can only be assumed that Spielberg/Kusher included this only to drive their terribly anti-Zionist point home; that Israel has extricated itself from Jewish values.) When Geoffrey Rush's character refuses, it is the ultimate sign of Israel's (represented by Rush) complete break from all manner of Jewish values, which we've been schooled throughout the film to see as the epitome of virtue. This is the terrible, scurrilous point of the whole film, the way Spielberg manages to impugn the integrity and validity of the state while avoiding the charge of being 'anti-Semitic'  as if to say, I'm critical of Israel, but Israel does not represent Judaism. Israel, is in fact, the antithesis of Judaism, which is virtuous and righteous.<br/><br/>This is an argument used to justify and hide anti-Semitic attacks on Israel by Jew-haters for decades.<br/><br/>Shame on you, Stephen Spielberg, for buying the bile and advancing such a horrendously offensive theory.<br/><br/>For shame."

","There are basically three types of movies, ones which simply entertain in its running time, ones which fail to achieve that objective and ones which stay with you long after it is over. This certainly is in the third category. A chilling tale of Munich Olympic killings and the eliminations of its perpetrators aftermath, this movie drives home a point or two. The conversations between Avner and Ali and then again of Avner and Carl bring forward those arguments while the agents go about the pursuit of their targets. Despite its length, the movie is thoroughly engaging with top-notch performances from all, but hard to not mention of Mathieu Amalric and Ciarán Hinds in their respective roles. Tension was acutely palpable in the assassination scenes; and as a viewer, one would experience the journey they go through hunting down their targets and could relate to their resolve being weakened and fatigued as they go from one part of the globe to other to complete their mission and getting hunted themselves. Spielberg's take on Operation Wrath of God is dark, realistic and gripping to say the least. The infusion of the Godfather-like character of Papa to the story may have been an improvisation in the script but that much liberty can be given to this great director. Nothing less than 8/10 for this Spielberg masterpiece."

The trials and tribulations he and his team go through during the years away from Israel are many and aren't just 'brushed off' like some action movie heroes might.<br/><br/>The other cast members are equally adept at giving a real face to their roles. Daniel Craig plays Steve, the hot-headed South African, Ciarán Hinds as Carl, the worldly, at times melancholy old soldier, Hanns Zischler as Hans, the pragmatic German 'cleaner' and Mathieu Kassovitz as Robert, the Belgian toymaker turned bomb maker.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, the team's Mossad 'handler' gives a excellent supporting performance as does Gila Almagor as Avner's Mother and Ayelet Zurer as Daphna Kaufman, Avner's gorgeous, supportive wife. Other important roles are played by Mathieu Amalric as Louis and Michael Lonsdale as Papa, the Frenchmen (son & father) who feed information to Avner and his team and, paradoxically, information to those hunting them.<br/><br/>The film pulls no punches, showing the brutality and ethical dilemmas the team and those they hunt face. It's this very stance that apparently gained the film some hate from members of the Zionist Organisation of America, a highly pro-Israel group who were aghast at the Israeli's being portrayed as assassins. Unfortunately for them, it's a case of ""if it quacks like a duck, it's a duck"". These men hunt & kill a number of Palestinians without legal authority at the behest of their masters. Sounds pretty much a definition for an assassin to me. Equally galling to ZOA was the depiction of Palestinans as (gasp, shock) having families, feelings and even idealism and not being simple robotic fanatics.<br/><br/>It's this very honesty that gives the film it's true character. Suggesting neither good nor bad, but merely being.<br/><br/>Those looking for a historically accurate movie will be chagrined no doubt, but I've yet to see a movie that is a genuine truth rather than an ambiguous kaleidoscope of truth and artistic licence.<br/><br/>I have little or no hesitation in recommending this somewhat long movie to anyone looking for a thriller with much more depth that your average flick."

","When speaking of Steven Spielberg Munich is a film that isn't always mentioned as much. But it should be because this is an incredible film by him and is truly one of his best efforts. Personally I have no stake in The Israel-Palestine conflict but for those who do I can assure you that this is a very neutral movie Spielberg doesn't paint either side as heroes every character is a flawed human being who for better or worse is fighting for what they believe in. Munich pulls no punches during the massacre scene is brutal and bloody and disturbing to watch. Eric Bana is in my opinion and extremely underrated actor he blew me away in this movie he perfectly conveys his characters inexperience at first to the end where he is a wounded veteran traumatised by what he's done. That is another great thing about this movie there are consequences to the killings in this film it takes a toll on the characters and forces them to question what they're doing. A pre-bond Daniel Craig plays a supporting role in this film and he's excellent here he's such an interesting character despite the fact that he plays it a bit more simply than the others proving that he can do much more than just play James Bond. Another actor I love is in this movie Ciarán Hinds is in this film and is completely Oscar Worthy I loved his characters conflicted attitude and moral compass and was a very intriguing character thanks to Hinds captivating performance.I loved the teams dynamic in this film you just want them to all come out OK in the end and fear for them every time they put themselves in danger and like I said it's not straightforward they have conflicting opinions on what they're doing and why. The Final Shot in this movie is one of the greatest and most effective uses of symbolism I've ever seen it reflects Aavners arguments perfectly and tells us that Ever action has a reaction.<br/><br/>I like Crash unlike most people, I love Brokeback Mountain like most people but I absolutely adore Munich I've watched it far more times that I really should have this is one of my all time favourite movies and should have won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapeted Screenplay.

","I have not read the novel that this is based upon, but it is worth noting that while it has been attacked, it has never been discredited. This isn't a documentary, it is a dramatization; still, the level of detail is high and the realism is through the roof. You do need to possess a basic insight into the Israel/Palestinian conflict, and it's a good thing to know some of the important people back then who were involved in it. The version I watched was 150 minutes sans credits, and worth every moment. This is incredibly gripping, and astonishingly intense. The action is photographed and edited to be chaotic(think Saving Private Ryan), and this neither glorifies nor bastardizes the events that it shows. Every acting performance is spot-on; Bana is stunning. The dialog is well-written and natural, and the camaraderie between the members of the main group is convincing and subtly developed(as such, no character feels one-note or flat, even if they can't flesh them all out extensively). This is psychologically accurate, dealing with what happens to people when they kill other humans. It doesn't take sides and goes into the gray areas, and there are discussion(one is particularly unforgettable) in this that provide plenty of food for thought. This does not decide what is correct. Instead, each viewer will by themselves have to ponder... was it justice or revenge? Was it right to do? And is anything resolved? There is a moderate amount of bloody and gory violence and disturbing content and a little full frontal female nudity and mild sex. The DVD comes with a single featurette(making that menu seem superfluous), entitled Munich: The Mission, The Team(I will review it on its own page here on the site), and a 4 and a half minute intro by Spielberg which is well worth the time. I recommend this to anyone that cares about the situation between the Jews and the Arabs. 8/10"
"estebangonzalez10","9","3","4","5 August 2010"," A Debatable thriller
","¨We are supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. And we're losing it. If I lose that, that's everything. That's my soul.¨ Munich is a very powerful and emotional movie that combines thrills with human drama. I went into this film expecting it to be simply a revenge movie, but it is much more than that; Spielberg doesn't take sides and brings a lot of interesting elements that open up the debate between Israel and Palestine and which country is really the enemy. Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors active in American cinema and he has directed several masterpieces, Schindler's List being perhaps the best one. Munich will probably not rank amongst his best work, but it's still a great and powerful film that required a lot of risks on Spielberg's part as a Jew because in Munich he never takes sides and by doing so both sides have declared him an enemy. The movie is based on George Jonas's book ¨Vengeance¨ and the screenplay was adapted by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). The screenplay was beautifully written and also nominated for the Oscars along with four other categories (editing, directing, score, and best picture), although it went home empty handed. Those were probably the strongest elements the movie had, which was finely edited and the score really enhanced the film. I thought that there were also some very good performances from the cast, especially Eric Bana who gives his best performance to date, and Ciaran Hinds who also nails his role. Spielberg has only directed the fourth installment of Indiana Jones since Munich in 2005, but we will be hearing from him soon.<br/><br/>The film opens with the 1972 murders that took place in the Olympics of Munich. 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by a terrorist group called Black September. Munich focuses on what happened after these murders took place although there are several flashbacks during the movie returning to this attack. Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) didn't negotiate with the terrorists and therefore the hostages were killed, but now she decides to allow for a black operation to take place in order to kill some of the men behind the planning of the 72 attack. They hire Avner (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent who had served as a bodyguard for Meir, to lead the assassination squad which consisted of five men. The other men hired for the job were Steve (Daniel Craig), the driver, Hans (Hanns Ziechler), an expert at forging false documents and passports, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the man in charge of doing the clean up after the assassinations took place, and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), the bomb expert who knows more about dismantling them than creating one. The men resign from their official jobs and the Mossad and work as black operatives not tied to the government. They only receive a list of eleven men they have to kill and have to get the rest of intel on their own and work as a terrorist group and the only connection they have with the government is the payment they receive in the Bank and through a middle man named Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush). Avner contacts a man named Louis (Mathieu Amalric) who finds the location of almost every name given to him in exchange for a high price.<br/><br/>The movie begins very slow, but once the assassinations take place the thrills and suspense begin to play a big part in the film. This is not your average revenge film, it's much more than that. It opens ethical questions and dilemmas on several issues. Even the characters feel remorse for what they do and end up questioning if they are doing the right thing. Ephraim and Avner have very insightful conversations which open up the debate on this issue. It seems as if every murder that takes place is retaliated by the other group, and every leader that is murdered is replaced by a new one so the war will never end. Some leaders justify their actions by claiming it is the price to pay for building their home and having a land. Spielberg is very clever and doesn't take any sides in this movie, he doesn't justify the violence and makes you debate over who the true enemy really is. Munich is a very powerful film that relies on good direction from Spielberg and a solid performance from the entire cast.

","From two-time Academy Award winning director Steven Spielberg comes Munich, the story of the assassination of the 11 Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympic Games. The film stars Eric Bana as Avner, head of the intelligence unit assigned to kill everyone involved in the assassination. This is Bana's finest performance and finally taps into that thespian persona that we've all known he was capable of. Bana hasn't been more aware of his surroundings and character depth that his Avner requires like we've ever seen him.<br/><br/>The supporting players are adequate enough to make it through the picture but some are developed better than others. Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, the operative heading Avner in different directions doesn't wear his character as well as others we've seen in past performances. Mathieu Kassovitz as one of the team members is the best of the supporting players as a torn individual between the job he is given and the results of his actions in the eyes of the almighty.<br/><br/>Ciaran Hinds has a presence on screen that gives the extra topping of an actor's showcase of talent. Daniel Craig as the ""badass"" operative is equally as charging and impressionable.<br/><br/>The candle of this picture is Steven Spielberg who's never been this dark and this thorough since his achievement Schlinder's List. Not holding any measure to Schlinder's List or Saving Private Ryan which are cinematic gems with this auteur at his finest, Munich is immensely erotic in cinematography and editing and a score by John Williams to die for. His choices here rather risky are so unlike anything we've seen of him before.<br/><br/>This is an exquisite motion picture and should be seen by all. Eric Roth's screenplay is pin-point with dialogue and rich in flow. This is definitely the Spielberg show.<br/><br/>Grade: ***/****"
"Tjenkins-11","8","3","4","26 November 2007"," Munich shows that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict appears endless at times. It delves into the conflict on a very personal level.
","Munich attempts to show that vengeance against savage and barbaric killing does not discourage terrorism. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the central themes present in this film by Steven Spielberg. This film does stretch beyond this endless conflict. An underlying theme of Munich is family and the dehumanizing effect that Israli born Avner's (Eric Bana) mission of revenge has on his wife and new born baby. Steve (Daniel Craig) plays a South African driver, part of the Israeli government's secret retaliation assassinations of those ""responsible"" for the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Black September. Occasionally they meet up with Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush),their case officer. Ephraim tells Avner that the assassinations are to just be the names on the target, and no others; especially civilians. Central to the films theme, approximately the middle of the film, Avner finds himself sharing a safe house with a Palestinian terrorist group (he manages to pass himself off as an ETA operative). The two get to talking and the Palestinian describes his pride at being part of the struggle for a free Palestine. Avner finds it difficult to keep his anger hidden to the point where the other man accuses him of being an Israeli sympathizer. This scene is crucial because it is the one time in the film where we actually hear the feelings that drive the Palestinian cause. It is also the moment at which Avner sees the human face of his enemy and realizes that, not only are they as devoted to their country as he is to his own, but they might actually have legitimate goals, even if their methods of achieving them are wrong. Spielberg has entertained us with audience pleasing films such as Jurassic Park, E.T. and Indiana Jones, however, Munich appears to be a film that Spielberg felt compelled to deliver. One of the Munichs' elements is the emotionally deep music by John Williams. It is for the most part very suitable to the central theme and overall experience. The song from the film soundtrack, Prayer for Peace, won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. The song is played during numerous scenes, including the ending where it is an arrangement for strings and piano. The movie was painful to watch. I would imagine this is the case for many unpopular subjects."
"Gearoid6","8","3","4","2 February 2007"," Steven Spielberg can do no wrong
","Steven Spielberg's latest offering, Munich, delves into the story following the events of the massacre at the 1972 Olympics ,in which an Israeli, Jewish hit squad set out to gain vengeance for the atrocity. Controversial, politically incorrect, supremely biased and misunderstood. This is just some of the criticism Spielberg has had to endure, but I for one have embraced Munich as a truly harrowing and mesmerising piece of cinema. Expectedly, it has provoked a substantial amount of controversy. Spielberg has been slammed by the Israeli Government for creating similarities between the terrorists and the counter terrorists for example, in one particular scene, the Israeli hit squad must reluctantly share accommodation with members of the P.L.O. Weapons are drawn swiftly and panic ensues, however, violence is averted when they learn no threat is present. Following this, the protagonist ( Eric Bana ) and a member of the P.L.O share cigarettes and discuss politics. It suddenly struck me when I watched this. The two men were astonishingly similar. They're both fighting for freedom in their country and they would inevitably have to face death in order to achieve their happiness. Two men who have to kill or be killed.<br/><br/>It is interesting to know that Spielberg himself is a Jew. This was obviously a hugely significant factor in the making of this film. Spielberg wanted us, the audience, to experience the physical and mental torture the athletes themselves had to endure and to do that, he creates a surreal, realistic and graphic dramatisation of the callous abuse the athletes suffered. Spielberg doesn't attempt to portray the Palestinians as sombre characters with inhumane qualities, and for this, he has been criticised severely, and has been charged for ""humanising demons"" by many of his Jew counterparts.<br/><br/>I see several comparisons between Munich and another project of Spielbergs, Schindler's List. Both films contain scenes of torture of Jews and share several comparisons in terms of Spielbergs cinematography. Spielberg uses dark images, numerous silhouettes on important characters and insidious nuances e.g. the ghostly appearance of the Twin Towers which haunts the final scene and reminds us of the more devastating terror to come, and of course the only use of colour in Schindler's List which is the bright red coat of the dead Jewish girl. However, Schindler's List is superior in my view mainly because of it's sheer realism and exceptional direction. <br/><br/>Eric Bana, who plays Avner, delivers a promising and convincing performance as the leader of his platoon of assassins. Avner and his colleagues go through a process of moral transformation during the course of the film, after all, they're just ordinary human beings, lacking the experience of trained hit men. Bana's character is explored more vividly than his counterparts and this remains one of the films negative attributes. The rest are blatantly one dimensional, no emotions conveyed, no depth or context. Steve ( Daniel Craig ) however, is given more characterisation than the rest of the group, besides Avner of course. He's the most ruthless of the pack, showing little or no moral disconcerns and provokes unnecessary tension in the group. Also, I would like to have learned and explored more aspects of the Irish actor's character, Ciarán Hinds, who in my view wasn't given enough screen time. Special mention should also go to Michael Lonsdale who plays the Israeli's mysterious information provider. A fine performance from an experienced actor.<br/><br/>Filled with superb shock effects, convincing performances and hidden political messages, Munich is an exceptional thriller which will no doubt lead to controversy, but as a 16 year old who enjoyed it, it makes no difference to me......."

","but it was still to long. About an hour in, I was thinking this movie is not very good. I didn't think the characters were introduced well and was wondering who was on screen. But, then it got better and the story made more sense, but at almost 3 hours, it was still too long. Edited to about 2 hours and 15 minutes would have been better.<br/><br/>Eric Bana looked great in this. He was good as well as the other actors. It was just the story set-up needed to be better explained. A story like this had too much info to fit into a big screen film. It would have been better if this was a made for TV 5 part movie. Characters like Louis and his dad and the other killers besides Avner did not get enough development. I would have liked to know more about there back ground.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A good film on an important subject matter, but was too long. If you aren't familiar with the story, it is hard to understand some of the characters. Overall, worth watching."
"fred-houpt","9","3","4","31 December 2006"," Flawed as history, but still powerful entertainment
","This is my second full viewing of this film, this one at home. Just a few days ago I watched ""Syriana"" again and I've had time to let the two contrasting films move about in my memory. After watched Munich I downloaded a bunch of comments that author George Jonas contributed earlier this year, relating to his involvement (largely non-involvement) in the development of the film. Much has been said about how unhappy he was at how his book was somewhat refurbished into a polished Spielberg vehicle, almost unrecognizable to him. He also said that the film as a film was very good, even if not the idea he had in mind if his book was to one day become a film. I must say that I have yet to see another film version of his book, ""The Sword of Gideon"", although I hear it is also a must see.<br/><br/>""Munich"" has stuck Jew and non-Jew in a deep and sensitive place, causing much gnashing of teeth and strongly worded condemnations as well as praise. I don't recall this level of negativity or recrimination when ""Schindler's List"" came out. Among my fellow Jews it sounded much more like the fulminations and frothing that came with the release of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".<br/><br/>The film should make us ask questions and I'm not sure that the debate has become any more clear. Certainly Spielberg (maybe not Jonas) has forced us to consider the following: in the face of outright terrorist murders, is a state well recommended to seek total revenge, tit for tat, an eye for an eye? Even more: has this mentality brought about any increase of good, any lowering of tensions, any more common grounds between the combatants? What, he asks, has been the net result of many years of reprisals? These questions alone were enough to make many Jews totally outraged at Spielberg. How, they thought, did he have the gall to even question the motives? To make the Mossad agents have a conscience, even though not completely the same one or shared, made them look weak, at least in the eyes of those who thought and still do believe that revenge in such cases is totally appropriate. Never mind, the other side will argue, how in the long run it has proved to be counter-productive; with each form of terrorist group that is attacked, the next incarnation is double the level of terror and murder. So, what can be done to evacuate everyone from this dark hole that vacuums in the best of intentions of all people? What else can be done when such outrageous terror is committed? I'm not sure that Spielberg has an answer. I don't think that he intended to sit on a soapbox and argue that Israel was wrong at the time of the Munich murders to seek revenge. Given the environment of Israel and the surrounding countries, doing nothing, acting like passive Buddhist monks is not what Spielberg had in mind. However, he is also saying that more of the same is also not working.<br/><br/>So, what are we left with? Never mind that he humanizes many of the terrorists. When we are engulfed in self righteous indignation, it is easy to emotionally profit by making the ""other"" a monster and twisting them into non-human entities, making them dehumanized to the ultimate extent. That only blinds the hateful into being drawn into the same dance as the perpetrators. After so many years, Spielberg has the gall to say, who now is the perpetrator and who the victim? It's all been blurred into a wasteful bloody noise and it just gets worse all the time.<br/><br/>In closing for now, let us remember please that this is a film, not a documentary. We need to be reminded of this from time to time because we tend to get carried away with our emotional attachments to the side we feel is most correct, righteous. With God on our side we can do no wrong and we can feel as justified in the destruction of our enemies. However, we also have to remember that seen from a birds eye view, everyone involved is thinking the same thoughts. That's only one reason that this deadly dance goes on and on. There are many reasons. The film only points our attention at some but not all of the issues. It's a powerful drama, ""borrowed"" from Jonas's book. It is not the first or the last word on the subject. But, it's worth watching because it will shake you just where you need to be stirred."
"dnlcmch","10","3","4","4 December 2006"," A riveting achievement
","It would be fair to say that Steven Spielberg is a director who's craft evolves more sufficiently within each decade. In the 70's, he created the term ""blockbuster"" with Jaws and soon became the master of popcorn entertainment with films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T throughout the 80's. The 90's proved to be his ""mature"" era, as he directed deeply personal, mature, and melancholy films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Now, the early years of the 21st century, can easily be considered as a sort of ""experimental"" phase for Spielberg, as he somewhat departs from his David Lean influence and heads more towards his Stanley Kubrick inspiration. Not to compare Kubrick with Spielberg, because they are two completely different directors in their own ways, but, the way Spielberg has matured at this time has made his influence in the honor of his former colleague, an influence that is present in his latest masterpiece, Munich, as the film delves deep into the dark mists of human nature with thought-provoking themes that are conjured by awe-inspiring visuals and a gritty, melancholy atmosphere. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics, when nine Israeli athletes were infamously massacred by the Palestinian terrorist group, Black September. It's a destructive issue that still haunts the face of the Earth today, as two cultures collide for the sake of their shared dream of having a homeland. As a result of the tragic massacre, the Israeli government decides to secretly hire a team of assassins, lead by a former Mussad-Agent, Avner Kaufman(Eric Bana). From the moment we see him, we know Avner is a decent man. He's polite, he has a sense of humor, and he's a dedicated husband who is urging to start a family. Yet, his current state of personal happiness is put to a halt once he accepts the mission that has been offered. With the help of four other men, each specializing in their own specific skill, Avner must hunt down and kill every Palestinian who was involved in the planning of the Munich massacre. But, it's only a matter of time before these acts of vengeance and desecration become the culprits of paranoia. <br/><br/>The issues and themes that Munich deals with are things that we still deal with today. Spielberg handles these controversial issues with great fragility. Being a Jew himself, he could have simply labeled the protagonists and the antagonists of the film, yet, the plot remains sufficiently neutral throughout the film's entirety, showing empathy from both perspectives. Although we see it from the Jews' perspective, that doesn't necessarily mean their morals are not as corrupt as those of the Palestinians. Munich displays how vengeance, echoed through the actions of five men, effects the depths of our nature and our state of being. By the film's conclusion, Avner no longer is, nor will never be, the same man. His actions reflect those that still haunt us today both as nations and as citizens of our countries. <br/><br/>Eric Bana is stellar as the film's ultimately sympathetic lead, as he carries the film with poignancy and a fragility that can be seen in his eyes. It's an utter crime that the Academy did not nominate Bana for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Spielberg, while presenting us with a subtle story, adds even more subtlety by giving us visuals that will haunt and provoke our thoughts for days, with the help of the film's gritty and stylish atmosphere that perfectly reflects upon the emotions that are intact within the film. The camera movement also works sufficiently as it blends in greatly with the era that is being presented (the 1970's), by using various stylish camera tricks such as quick-dolly-ins.<br/><br/>In all, Munich is the best film I have seen in 2005, and among the best of the decade. Spielberg has achieved in creating a thought-provoking masterwork that shall leave the view pondering upon its message for days. And if you can't swallow it all, that haunting last shot should sum it all up perfectly."
"spooly_montana","10","3","4","22 August 2006"," Stirring Masterpiece
","Director Steven Spielberg has wowed us with many outstanding films over the past three decades, including: Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, Jaws, Schindler's List, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Saving Private Ryan, The Indiana Jones Trilogy, Jurassic Park, Color Purple, War of the Worlds, Amistad, Minority Report, and Always. Something he has proved time and time again is ability in diversity, creativity, and infusing that with great storytelling and compelling film-making. Spielberg has always had a passion and respect for the medium of film, and his latest film MUNICH is a shining example of what he can create, surely one of my favorite Spielberg films of all time. Based on the George Jones book 'Vengeance,' this film is historically inspired and Spielberg researched this story thoroughly before bringing it to the screen. Before dawn at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, the Israeli wrestling team was taken hostage at gunpoint and killed by a group of Palestinians. This movie tells the story of what happened next: the covert operation to track down all the people involved in the killing of the Israelis, and the pros and cons associated with that violent retribution. Five men with different skills ranging from bomb making, to forging, hunt the assassins down one-by-one. Avner (Eric Bana), the leader, has a wife and a newborn child, and takes his commissioned job which leads him around the world, with a solemn duty. The line is blurred as they get deeper into the operation, the trail leading them to various locales, where they have to watch their step as they soon too become hunted. They must constantly look over their shoulders for the CIA, KGB, PLO, among others. I will note that Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, plays Steve, one of the four men in the operation, and Craig does a great job in this film as the trigger-man. Spielberg is one of the greatest directors working today. Many who receive that moniker do not truly deserve the esteemed repute, but Spielberg earns it again and again. This versatile director is not overrated, but genuinely one of the best. In presenting the subject matter Spielberg does it with much conviction. Not aligning with one side or the other, but looking at it in an unsettlingly mesmerizing and unflinching way. I admire him for doing that. It may have been far easier for a lesser director to side with one position, and paint a certain stance, but then that would taint the reality of this film, watering down the power that results in this film, because of Spielberg. He shows great empathy towards these human characters that we follow and care about. ""I wanted to highlight the issues  not answer them, but open them for discussion,"" said Spielberg. Munich is a rare gem, and I would characterize it as a masterpiece. Many moments I sat perched on the edge of my seat in suspense at what would happen next! Pulse-racing scenes where nothing is contrived. John Williams scores the music, as he has so many other Spielberg films, such as Indiana Jones, E.T., Schindler's List, just to name a few. Williams brings real emotion and edge to the music that backs this amazing film. Eric Bana embodies his character, making him completely relatable and human. I notice he is getting much deserved notice as an actor now, thanks in part to his role in Munich. This film was nominated for 5 Oscars, including Best Director (Spielberg), and Best Picture of the Year. Munich also stars Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Pirates of the Caribbean). This film is rated R."

","Munich, 8/10, 3rd best of 2005, 132nd best movie of all time.<br/><br/>This movie fell only three spots short of a 9/10. I really liked this movie, probably one of the fairest war movies I've ever seen. There have been movies before that refuse to take sides. But in those movies it mostly seems that they try to make the message, ""everyone is evil, there are no good guys, everyone just wants to kill everybody."" This movie is more on the side of saying that everyone is pretty okay. All these people involved in terrorism or anti-terrorist espeonaige or killing or war... they aren't fighting cause they want to kill people, they all have something to fight for, something that's extremely important to them. This movie doesn't really attempt to answer any of the important questions in the mid-east crises, but that's not its job. Wonderful movie, good characters, and most importantly.... I never got bored."

","I've seen it 3 times now and it has really made me think about the whole situation. Although it is a story of an event that has taken place over 30 years ago, the whole situation in Israel hasn't changed. That is also the scary part of it.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg really gives the impression of what possibly(we don't know the details)happened. It is about the response of a group of Israeli's who are ordered to kill all suspects involving the murder of 11 Israeli sports men. As the movie goes on the purpose of their mission is not always clear. Replacements take the tasks of those who have been killed. Some of the group know it isn't right but on the other hand it is.<br/><br/>The 2 1/2 hours are really worth it and this political/historical/drama earns a 9/10 rate because of all that is offers."

You really have to give it the time of the day. I really liked this movie. I recommend it to any movie buff. It is important during the whole movie to stay impartial and do not take sides so you wouldn't ruin the movie for you. And to be fair, the movie was, to a certain extent, objective. Although over did it a little bit with the Jewish morals but still, not too much."
"Antagonisten","8","3","4","2 April 2006"," Most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindlers List
","I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg, rather i find him a competent if rather uninteresting film-maker. Especially these past years. Now however, after seeing Munich, i had to re-evaluate my stance somewhat.<br/><br/>It is a brave thing Spielberg is doing in this movie. Tolerance for multiple perspectives has declined recently to say the least, and here Spielberg is presenting a movie without clear morals dealing with the touchy subjects of religion and terrorism. And in my opinion the timing is perfect. The ability to not see things in just black and white is what i feel separates intelligent people from fools, and so many people act foolish today just because they don't use that ability. What makes this movie great is the fact that Spielberg never comes even close to justifying the terror attack on the 1972 Olympics in Munich, he just asks if barbaric acts should answered in kind. A just question.<br/><br/>The movie itself is well made with excellent acting. Great thought must have gone into the casting process and what we get is near perfection. Eric Bana is excellent as is the rest of his team of assassins. The technical qualities of the movie are excellent, achieving a very 70's feel. But of course the story is the star here and this is by far the most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindler's List. Unfortunately for him the race for the Oscars was tight this time around with loads of worthy entries, otherwise this would have been a clear-cut contender for several awards."
"maria-skold","7","3","4","26 February 2006"," Slow, but beautiful
","I have never really been a fan of agent movies, you know, the kind of movies where an agent clad in a trench coat forms a team and tries to fulfill some goal, which he of course always does. I see for example Michael Caine i big glasses.<br/><br/>Munich is fresh and interesting because the Cause is not the main theme in the movie. Instead it has its focus on the change in the character Avner, who is introduced as a devoted patriot. He is however forced to question his task, as it becomes increasingly difficult to see what good it does to murder leaders who are quickly replaced by others.<br/><br/>Spielberg also gives us a revival of American 70-s movies, with the slow but tense storytelling. Yes, there is the classical conflict and the deepening of the same, but the audience is given time to reflect during the watching. The movie is not about absolute good fighting and winning over absolute evil, as in the fairy tales or many of the 80-s and 90-s movies, but is instead told in a beautiful and interesting multi coloured scale."
"davideo-2","7","3","4","24 February 2006"," A heavy, thought-provoking and inspired Spielberg film but a little wavey
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>A true story from Steven Spielberg, depicting the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian fundamentalists of Israli athletes and the subsequent and immediate backlash by the Israeli authorities who wanted swift retribution for the atrocity.<br/><br/>On the day I went to see Munich, I'd had to get up a bit earlier than I usually would to go to a (distant) relative's funeral in the morning and I'd travelled straight from there to another destination up to see it, so maybe that had worn me out a bit, or maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to sit through it on the day, but either way after about two thirds of the way through this 164 minute Spielberg saga, I must admit I found myself nodding off for a little while. Or maybe it was just that, despite the thought-provoking and inspired subject matter, Munich could emerge as a fairly boring film in parts, which is a bit of a problem for films this long. I'd sat through and enjoyed a similar sort of film from Spielberg, Schindler's List, which I ended up rating as one of the best films I'd ever seen, but I was able to see that at my own leisure on video, unlike Munich.<br/><br/>In between making big special effects filled blockbusters like War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park, Spielberg likes to make more deep and meaningful stuff like this and Schindler's List as well, making him a varied sort of film-maker. I admire him for this and like to try and give more credit to this sort of work than his cinematic eye-candy stuff. But I just didn't see Munich as a perfect work.<br/><br/>Maybe there wasn't enough humour and light-heartedness in it, maybe there is something morally black about the story. It certainly has a strong cast to guide it, in the shape of Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and some Israeli supporting cast members, as well as a good story to go with it. But as interesting as Munich can be, it can be just as boring in equal measure. ***"

","Munich sounds like a catchy name, doesn't it? And the topic of this movie is, to say the least, a hot one. When you enter a movie with such a hot topic like Munich, a topic on which you've already formed a somewhat strong opinion, you hunger to criticize the flick. That was the case with me. But after seeing this movie, my head was full of unanswered question on which I had to find new answers.<br/><br/>Obviously this movie is after Schindler's List Spielberg's second movie that touches the subject of Jews. But in this movie he takes no sides. He sympathizes with both the Jews and the Palestinians. Maybe ""sympathize"" is too strong a word. I'd rather say he let's us see both sides of the coin. The movie has no real good or bad guy. I would define the main character of the movie as an antihero who slowly gets into trouble with his moral guidelines.<br/><br/>Spielberg chose to give this movie a dark tone and an unsettling (brilliant) score that puts us viewers in a constantly alarmed mood. Each time the assassins take down one of their targets the heartbeat like score forces us to ask: Are they doing the right thing? And the general style of the movie seemed to me similar to the, in my opinion great style of The French Connection.<br/><br/>Like all the Spielberg movies, this movie is relies more on it's story than on the performances of the cast. But nevertheless the cast delivers a solid performance. Eric Bana doesn't fail to carry the movie with some strong assistance from actors like Geoffrey Rush. He was very believable as the lone Israeli assassin who at first gets hunted by moral questions and finally becomes the prey himself."
"nolanm_182","10","3","4","16 February 2006"," A Haunting Steven Spielberg Masterpiece
","I'm a very big Steven Spielberg fan and I love all his films. Since Schindler's List, this is Spielberg's best movie next to Saving Private Ryan. Munich is a film that is a thriller that deals with the aftermath of the tragic events at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany when Black September took the Israeli team hostage. The movie does not get very political, but stays more with their characters. A group of assassins is hired to seek and kill the people who planned the attack. Eric Bana gives a superb performance, which is Oscar-Worthy, as a husband and father who leaves on this mission that nearly drives him mad and makes him question his motives of why he is doing what he is doing. The memorable aspect of this film is the tragic flashbacks of the events at Munich with the Israeli team being taken hostage to their haunting deaths at the end. Steven Spielberg, creates another memorable film that is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2005."
"DavidH6","9","12","25","8 January 2006"," Spielberg scores again
","Once again the man whose known as the best filmmaker in Hollywood scores again with an incredible film. From start to end we are immersed in the amazing screenplay, acting, directing -- everything, its perfect. But what strikes me the hardest is that every kill is unique, personal, and fantastically executed. Every assassination is different, yet their one strong commonality is that we don't see the ""target"" as a ""target,"" we see them as a person. We know them as vulnerable, as a father, as a good person. And we watch each one suffer. Incredible work. I was surprised to see Spielberg make a picture that criticizes Israel as he is one of the most admired and active Jews in the world, however I believe he is making a statement about how there is no black and white and to terrorism and war in general. My one criticism for the film is the sex seen towards the end when we lose some respect and humanity with Avner. But, thats it. Definitely worth the price of admission. Could not have been better."

","Amazing! I went into the movie not expecting much, even though I am a Spielberg fan, but I came out thinking that I couldn't believe I had ever been skeptical about the movie. You come out of the movie actually thinking about the message the movie gets across. The message that resounds through this movie is that terrorism only leads to more terrorism. Spielberg does an awesome job of not really taking sides. He doesn't come out and say that the Isrealis were bad, and he does not come out and say that the Palestinians were bad. He remains surprisingly neutral. But that movie also leads a lot of questions unanswered which leaves the viewer really thinking about it and making some attempt to fill in the blanks. Overall I would highly recommend this movie. But it is not a family movie. It is also not a movie for the faint of heart. At times the violence is almost overwhelming. But at the end you will not regret seeing Munich yet another Spielburg masterpiece."

","Having grown up with the likes of 'ET', the first three 'Indiana Jones' films (of which 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is still one of his best) and 'Jurassic Park'(also 'Hook', though it's much less good through adult eyes, don't dislike it though), it's safe to say that Steven Spielberg was part of my childhood.<br/><br/>Am still shocked and moved by 'Schindler's List', enthralled by 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', moved by 'Empire of the Sun' and 'The Color Purple' and thrilled but often scared senseless by 'Jaws', and consider all of these plus 'ET', 'Raiders' and 'Jurassic Park' among his best films. For me his weakest are 'The Lost World' and '1941', and also had mixed feelings on 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' and 'The BFG'.<br/><br/>'Munich' is not quite up there with his very best, but it's from personal opinion one of his best since 'Schindler's List'. There is a sense at times of hasty production about it, not visually or directorially (on both counts the film's top-notch) but more to do with occasional parts in the storytelling that feel a little muddled and not as well developed as they could have been in how some things are resolved.<br/><br/>On the other hand 'Munich' does look absolutely great, love the very gritty and somewhat stark look to how everything's shot and lit (the restless camera proves to be atmosphere-enhancing) which felt evocative to the mood and the subject matter. Spielberg's direction is some of his best of his later films, under him pacing is deliberate but tight and he gives plenty of unnerving intensity without resorting to the schmaltz that he can be criticised for.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is understated but also haunting, even if not having themes as unforgettable as the likes of those for 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Schindler's List', 'Raiders' and 'Jurassic Park', adding a good deal to the atmosphere while not making the mistake of over-emphasising (like in 'Amistad'). The script is thought-provoking and with the right amount of nuances and avoiding the traps of cheese and schmaltz, while boasting many genuinely powerful and poignant moments. The story is continually compelling, with it being particularly strong when the doubts appear with the urgency and emotional power being maximised. The action scenes are pretty electrifying also.<br/><br/>Not ending 'Munich' with a pat and too conveniently wrapped up conclusion was a brave choice, and honestly can't imagine the film ending as effectively if it had done. The characters are interesting, having strengths but also flaws and conflicts and to me the film didn't feel at all one-sided.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific, Eric Bana heads the cast in one of his better performances, here he's charismatic but stoic. Even better are the support, with both sides of Bana's Avner's troubled conscience being superbly played by Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds. Mathieu Kassivitz, Michael Lonsdale and Geoffrey Rush register strongly also.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film and one of Spielberg's better later efforts (since 'Schindler's List'). 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"philipp-armingeon","9","4","6","4 November 2011"," An outstanding and thrilling movie being a lot deeper than other thrillers
","I've just finished Munich a few minutes ago and I feel strongly urged to give a short review about it. When I decided to watch Munich I was interested in how exactly Spielberg was capable of displaying the Munich massacre in 1972. I asked myself in how far he would be able to keep up with a somewhat difficult topic like this. The Munich massacre is a symbol for the whole middle-east conflict. I had my doubts at first whether a Hollywood producer would be able to not only reproduce but also show the complexity of this conflict to the general public. After watching the movie itself I'm proud to say my doubts turned out to be wrong.<br/><br/>I was impressed by how deep this movie actually is. I've seen quite a lot of those, I call them, ""assassination movies"". Munich is the only one I've seen yet which does not show the act of killing as something the killer just does, because it's his job. In fact every single member of Avner's assassination team is somewhat likable. They're ordinary people, who have been chosen for a job, they couldn't know how it would turn out. In contrast to most killers in similar movies Avner's team is not unscrupulous. Yes, they take the lives of many people, but not without losing anything themselves. At the end three of Avner's team will be dead and Avner himself will probably sleep with one eye open for the rest of his life. They might be killers in some way, but eventually most people, even the ones we consider as tough enough for killing (e.g. the terrorists who took the Israelian athletes hostage, eventually losing their grip and killing their hostages at the airport), are still human and thus will pay their price for doing something as inhuman as assassinating other human beings.<br/><br/>Munich's also telling us a story about justice and how people tend to interpret it until it fits their personal understanding of what justice should be. Justice is a very subjective thing. While Palestinian terrorists find it righteous to kidnap some Israelian athletes, who apparently got nothing to do with the whole middle-east conflict at all, except for their nationality and religion, the Israelian government deems it right to send out a team of 5 assassins in order to force justice. In fact both sides are aiming for their personal justice, something one would call vengeance.<br/><br/>The golden thread of Munich is the search for home. Israelians claim they've been deprived of their home for over 2.000 years. Eventually after WWII they've been led home by the winning forces (with America/UK leading the way). The area of nowadays Israel has been taken by the people who lived there. Now those have been deprived of their home. I'm not writing this in order to judge any actions which have been taken back then, also I'm aware this is a very briefly worded version of the history of nowadays Israel. But the actions, which have been taken about 70 years before, caused one of the most complicated conflicts of today. Many people feel homeless nowadays. The message of this movie is that someone, who lost his home, is capable of everything. At the end Ephraim tells Avner he killed all those people ""for the sake of peace"". This is the root of all evil. As long as both Israelians and Palestinians won't stop to kill each other the middle-east conflict will go on for eternity. Neither will you ever be able to fight violence with violence nor will you ever gain peace by violence."

","Spielberg did an excellent job using stock news footage from the tragedy and overlaying actors into recreated scenes. Though these events are actually shown piecemeal throughout the film, the actual story is about what transpired afterwards. The Israeli government hired a hit squad to track down and eliminate 11 individuals that participated in the planning of the terrorist action at the Olympics.<br/><br/>This is based on an actual operation that the Mossaud carried out but obviously is Spielberg's fictionalized version of how it was done.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is a German/Jewish Israeli Mossaud operative who is chosen to lead the group of 5 mercenaries as they hunt down the perpetrators throughout Europe. It is interesting how this Australian actor is able to change his accent at will to fit the roles that he is playing.<br/><br/>Bana is torn to do the mission because his wife is expecting the birth of their first child and the secret mission means that he must risk his life and possibly not see his wife till the mission is complete which could take years.<br/><br/>As the movie goes along Bana's personality starts to change from a gung-ho good government employee to someone who questions what he is doing and is constantly looking under his bed and phone for hidden bombs.<br/><br/>The movie moves along at a fast pace and you keep thinking you are seeing real events as they happen."

","MUNICH After two years I finally saw the movie tonight...and in a way I was awestruck.<br/><br/>Now most stupid people will watch this movie and say its the most biased movie they have ever watched, either biased against Jews and Israel or biased against Palestinians and Muslims....these people are just nincompoops (i.e. fools) This movie is a portrayal, a very beautiful and all at once ugly portrayal of human nature, very much like Steven Spielbergs other masterpiece ""Schindlers List""....this movie encompasses a whole range of human emotion to an uncanny degree as reflected on the characters, it lends no preference over which ""side"" is better, its just an astonishing and shocking portrayal of humanity.<br/><br/>First of all the central theme is vengeance, but also mixed with that is rage and hate, self-preservation, nationalism, ethics, paranoia, and of course love of family and nation. One actually feels for the main character, Avner, (masterfully played by Eric Bana) in this movie, and the roller-coaster of emotions that he endures and the ensuing paranoia and guilt after has had helped commit his actions. One feels as if he is transformed with Avner from a good soldier who puts God and country before all else to a tormented human soul who seeks justification for his actions against fellow human beings amidst a paranoia which engulfs his reality and threatens the ones he loves the most, his family. In essence the movie questions if the ends justifies the means, and if violence, vengeance, and hatred really solve anything at all....which we all know it doe not.<br/><br/>This movie has tons of action as well, for all the action fans, and as a student of the 1972 Munich Kidnappings, it accurately portrays the events that transpired in September 1972, and the bloody secretive war that transfixes Israel and Palestine over the next couple of years, filled with terror.<br/><br/>Overall a masterpiece of a film, which of course inspires claims of Bias either for or against the Jews , questions of who is the most terrible nationality Palestinians or Jews?, in the end no one is right, if everyone is wrong, this film finally is a study of human nature for we are all susceptible to unrestrained hate and vengeance and we are also endowed with a conscience, an ethical means of doing things.<br/><br/>There are things greater, than Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Shinto, things greater than the color of your skin, or who is your God, or what language you speak, that thing is humanity, which is a burden or a blessing, a curse or a cure....it is up for you to decide, and this film like Schindlers List masterfully paints a real portrayal of the strifes and range of humanity. of what it is to be human.....<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS FILM Supramaxx rating 10/10"
"lmayer2","9","4","6","29 June 2007"," It brings us back to the problems we've gotten away from
","This is such a clever film, in that it utilizes a lot of clever aspects (example: whenever they do the assassinations, there's always a clever way of doing them). I am very glad that Spielberg chose to direct this film and similar to Schindler's List (but of course, not even close), he takes into account the care, consideration, hardships and aspects of the Jews during very hard to cope with times. And as this does not compare to the caliber of Schindler's List, I do believe it's another brick in the wall for us to learn from and begin to understand those hardships if we're not Jews ourselves. And any film that deals with the hard times the Jews went through is stunningly powerful and emotionally resonant. Yet, ti still has that urgency and that importance that something can happen like that at any Olypmic game or at any time. Security and safety may have doubled since 1972 but that war and threat against security and safety has doubled as well. There's always new technology to be used and to be abused. But Munich, however, really captures the thoughts and the cares of the Jews, as they take their revenge and that's where the raw emotion and heartfelt theme takes its presence. That's where Spielberg takes his presence and really captivates the audience into understanding this piece because that's where you get the knowledge needed to pass this on to future generations because this problem, this threat will continue on for generations and generations."
"blairgallop7","10","4","6","10 June 2007"," Munich was educational and absolutely brilliant
","The movie,Munich is about a team of Israeli agents(Mossad) tracking down and attempting to kill the 11 Palestinians responsible for murdering the innocent 11 Israeli athletes involved in the Munich Olympic Games of 1972 which judging from the footage shown in this film looked to be one of the worst tragedies that occurred in the 20th Century along with countless other tragedies that occurred as well. Some of the best things about the movie is that it helped the audience learn about something historical and it had a good cast and a good director. The only improvement it needed was that it exceeded the time limit I was expecting. Great cast such as Eric Bana,Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush. Out of the all the movies I have watched with Eric Bana in it,it is my favorite Eric Bana movie and I think it is his personal best.Good on you Eric.

"claude_mayer","8","4","6","27 May 2007"," Quite surprisingly decent movie
","It took me a long time before I actually finally decided to watch this movie. I read so, so many bad reviews about it, journalists making the worse statements about Spielberg's intentions, that yes it did affect my choice. However, being way too curious, i decided to at least give it a chance and make up my own opinion. And, I am very satisfied I did, since it is an absolutely decent movie. May be because I saw it in its original version with subtitles i cannot read (there were in Finnish) I might have missed some of them. But I got to confess I found the characters credible, the movie very acted. Thanks for picking up excellent actors, not the ones you endlessly see on the screen. It made the movie so credible. I did not really feel any hatred, although there must has been a great deal of it, and I think this was the best way to approach this problematic without falling into some kind of extremism. The characters happened to be quite human, and I guess this could have happened to any of us who might have a sense of idealism, try to revenge such an awful act. An eye for eye ideology that does not lead anybody anywhere. The French character was a bit unusual, however credible. I also like the fact that the actors did not hesitate to look ""average"", i.e. normal. Thanks for not falling in that trap of selling a product for its aestheticism. What I really appreciated is that it gave me the envy to read about these events. I guess a movie is supposed to make you think and trigger some kind of interest and raise questions, it succeeded. I believe i will watch it again out of curiosity. I recommend this to anybody. It is refreshing to see that movies are not just evolving around cheap actions brainless scripts where the characters look so good with their 6 packs! Finally a daring movie that disturbs the audience! Monsieur Spielberg, thanks for shaking our minds and trigger the little sens of ""libre arbitre"" that is left in this extremely minds-cloned society of ours!"

"Cary_Barney","10","4","6","31 March 2007"," Magnificent (mild spoilers perhaps)
","I didn't catch ""Munich"" on release, partly because all the stirred-up controversy over its political stance turned me off. I'm glad I've caught up with it, though, and recommend it to anybody skeptical about Spielberg, as I've often been. This is by far the best thing he's ever done, intelligent, dispassionate, clear-eyed about the moral ambiguities of its subject. I admired ""Schindler's List"" in a lot of ways but it turned so Capra-corny by the end and forced its protagonist to abandon his more interesting amorality and become a two-dimensional saint. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a visually powerful war movie married to a conventional war movie script and with a tacked-on, totally unconvincing moral. (I wondered why Matt Damon didn't just grab his crotch and say ""Earn THIS."")<br/><br/>In ""Munich"", though, for the first time there's absolutely no surrender to sentimentality or easy platitudes. A lot of this has to do with Tony Kushner's script. He says in the ""making of"" DVD extra that he doesn't think of himself as a screenwriter. He should reconsider. Screen forces him to cut back on the baroque verbiage of his stage plays, and he brings a subtlety and sharp dialectical intelligence to what could easily have been a simplistic and partisan thriller.<br/><br/>It's far from an anti-Israel movie. Spielberg and Kushner caught a lot of flak for simply asking good questions about Israeli policy. The policy in question, vengeful hunting down of terrorists and their mentors, is awfully close to the ""permanent war"" Bush, Blair and their ilk have advocated in the ""War on Terror"" and which is likely to have the same result -- more, not fewer, terrorists. Spielberg at no point condemns the Israeli response to the Munich massacre, but through his actors (all superb) points up the intense conflicts it engenders within each of the participants in the hunt. None of these characters emerge as right or wrong by the end; their varied human feelings about their mission meld into a polyphonic chorus of conviction and righteousness on the one hand, doubt and unease on the other.<br/><br/>Also, quite wonderfully, the film questions the idea of homeland, for anybody. The scene in the Athens ""safe house"", which separatists and nationalists from many corners of the world have to share, implies the danger and absurdity of ethnic and religious territorial claims -- again, without shoving the message down our throats with an easy answer. The word ""home"" echoes recurrently in the film, most powerfully in the final scene. It lingers as a troubling reminder of the claims all nations make upon those who serve them and of the price paid in serving them -- that sometimes you can never go home again, or must redefine what ""home"" means in the first place (as Avner, the protagonist, finally seems capable of doing). And the final shot of the film quietly but unmistakably deepens the film's fundamental question: what does anybody have to show for the deaths of a few terrorists? What will we, finally, have to show for al Ghraib and Guantanamo?<br/><br/>Frankly, I never thought Spielberg capable of anything this complex, thoughtful or measured. (Those who found it dull should just rent ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".) May he put Indiana Jones behind him once and for all and continue to demonstrate that, in addition to being a master of light and magic, he's also learned to think."

","I think this movie is so important not only because it is one of the most audacious in Steven Spielberg's career, but the fact that it relays an important message about the cry for peace in today's post 9/11 world. It has some stunning images, especially the end, when it shows the Twin Towers. This movie is a definite cry for peace, and I feel sorry for the people who do not understand this movie. Many people said that this movie made them think too much. Which I think is ridiculous. Spielberg wanted you to think about the nature for killing. Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Spielberg tries to make this point by showing Avner as a person who has a good soul and spirit but it has been corrupted with the things that he has done for Israel. The film may have a lot of violence, but it certainly never condones violence. Everyone hould see this film, to see its wonder and beauty."
"coolgrl5050","10","4","6","6 January 2007"," Seriously and incredibly overlooked and unappreciated
","This film, like a select few of Spielberg's is what i like to call his collection of secret pleasures. these films, which include schindler's list are made by Spielberg for his own personal benefit in many ways. Walking into the theatre as a favor to my sister who wanted to see this film. I thought is was going to be about confusing and boring politics of foreign countries observed in an American point of view. I thought it would be boring and extremely confusing to someone like me. I thought it was one of those films that would only be enjoyable to a viewer who's main passion in life was poring politics of foreign countries. I was extremely mistaken. Five minutes into the film I sat up and paid attention to what it had to say. putting all my prejudice aside i watched it and was enthralled by what I saw. I left the theatre entranced and in love. I was shocked and delightfully surprised. Eric banna was absolutely amazing and IMO was cheated out of an Oscar, because he deserved it. The film was also made by the supporting cast members, too many to name. I was delighted that is was nominated for best film but IMO it was a sick and quite tasteless joke that Crash won. Even though I knew there was no chance of Munich winning. the Oscars are far too political to give the award to a film like Munich, or even BBM. But if you haven't seen this film i suggest you go to your nearest blockbuster (or netflix) and rent it for a measly 3.99, its a small price for such a delightful film."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","4","6","16 December 2006"," Unbelievable that this lost to 'Crash' (spoilers throughout)
","The final frame of Munich  the image of the Twin Towers  rather than being pat or overly simplistic, as some people would suggest, is a wonderfully economic way of summarising the film's message  for every action there's a reaction; none of us are as innocent as we'd like to think and all of us are responsible for the unholy mess we're in.<br/><br/>Munich's main strength is its refusal to glorify or condemn the actions of its protagonists. Nothing they do is heroic, but at the same time, their brutal response to the central atrocity is understandable  if your people are murdered, it's only natural to want to kill the people responsible. The only problem is that revenge begets more revenge, and eventually it's impossible to tell who's good and who's bad.<br/><br/>Of course, it's a bit of a cliché these days to have the tortured assassin  the man who's haunted by his actions  but in Munich it never feels like it's done purely for effect. Instead it's a natural by-product of (fairly) ordinary men doing things that most people in 'civilised' society never do  take the lives of other people. And so, therefore, unlike quite a lot of the film-going public, I think the final sex scene between Avner and his wife works tremendously well. It shows how everything has been ruined for him. He's not even capable of enjoying the physical act of love. And remember, this is what he was supposed to be protecting  the men, women and children of his homeland, and their way of life; he was supposed to be making their lives safer. Instead he's just helped things get worse.<br/><br/>And Avner's demand for evidence in the final scene is directly related to where we are at the present. All too often our desire for wrongs to be righted is exploited by governments and regimes. Just take Iraq  we've committed massive wrongs to try and right a barbaric act. And then you have the Israeli's justifying their actions in the name of the Holocaust and other more recent acts of brutalism they've suffered. Same goes for the Palestinians  they try and justify bombs and mayhem by saying that the other guys have killed their people. What they say is true, but no one can claim to be righteous  we're all as bad as each other.<br/><br/>The film realises this and, even though the protagonists are Israeli, it does a pretty good job of presenting both sides of the argument. Just take the scene in the safe house in Athens. Beneath all the political mumbo jumbo what both sides want is a home. Both want somewhere they can call their own. But by using violence to claim this home both are corrupting their dream  if, by some miracle, one side wins, what's going to be left? <br/><br/>And the idea of home is probably the film's main theme  the lengths we go to in order to protect it. It's certainly the reason why these men embark on this mission. But when Avner's mother tells him that he did what he did for their people, and that finally they have a place on Earth, you can only wonder whether it was worth it.<br/><br/>For me, one of the best scenes in the film is the bombing at the hotel. Without being heavy handed, it shows how difficult it is to kill somebody. And I don't mean difficult in the same way as the first killing, which is more about the physical difficulty, but instead the moral dilemma. How can you kill somebody in cold blood when you've had a perfectly pleasant conversation with them? And you can see Avner debating it in his mind as he stares at the light. For the first time doubt is creeping into his mind. He's realising that everything isn't clear cut. But still he condemns the man to death  for whatever reason, even when alarm bells are ringing in our head, we're still more than willing to close our eyes and ignore good sense.<br/><br/>But even though there's a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, Munich also works as a thriller. The first murder, for instance, is very Hitchcockian. You've got the music, the shadowy figures, the shots of the lift, the terrified killers and the macabre detail of the man falling on the milk bottle. It's very cinematic. And then you have the Munich siege itself. The killings are grim and bloody (and the stabbing in the head is shocking in the way that it comes out of nowhere) but it also gets the blood pumping. It helps you understand the outrage the Israeli's must have felt and how easy it is to let emotions get the better of you.<br/><br/>Another excellent scene is the killing of the female assassin. Again the film shows murder as messy and clumsy  the blood squirting out of the woman's throat is a great detail. And then you have the telephone bombing. It's quite conventional in the way it frames it with the little girl  will or won't she get killed?  but Spielberg builds the tension expertly and you're never entirely sure what's going to happen.<br/><br/>But to view the film entirely as a thriller would be to miss the point. The film, quite rightly, is more concerned with the way violence corrupts. It's certainly at the root of all our problems today. But as the film points out, for every person that's killed there's another person willing to step into their shoes  the group even has to kill the replacement of a person they assassinate. So what does the group really achieve? The answer is that they achieve nothing. Some people die and things carry on as they did before. They've only fanned the flames."

","Heavy Spielberg. After taking a walk in the park with Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal and pumping up some energy with War of the Worlds, Spielberg again conjures up heavy material in this movie about conscience, revenge (hence the title of the book it was adopted from) and the human condition in relation to it. Spielberg may have taken liberties in some areas, as a filmmaker he has done that in Catch Me if You Can or anyone for that matter is entitled to artistic liscence, but he captures the reality of the TRAUMA involved in each of the main players. Bana does a terrific job as do those who play his team, and also his wife. One thing I'd also like to point out is that Spielberg and DP Kaminski always always manage to photograph movies BEAUTIFULLY with an aesthetic that's both atmospheric and at times chaos-inducing such as some freestyle albeit carefully calculated hand-held and choreographed sequences. Safe to say that beyond a doubt Spielberg is a master in of biomechanics with respect to blocking and cinematography. You will also see him fabricate the most appropriate visual sensations during some of the most tense sequences such as the under the bed bombing sequence, you will momentarily see human appendage left over and rotating from a ceiling fan amidst Bana going through demolition seeing to it that his sexually active neighbors are safe after the mishap. And there are moments of cliffhanger and tension such as the telephone-bomb sequence. I need not say more, but that is one moment in the cinema when I actually said ""No!!!"", proving that this movie does manage to unnerve when it gets its moments albeit it is a drama by essence.<br/><br/>MUNICH does not shy away from violence, but it is a movie that is sort of anti-violence, once again it echoes an innate ability to show compassion and remorse. This is also one aspect where Spielberg's talent and maturity shine as he always depicts his pieces in context of the human condition his movie preceding MUNICH may have been scorned for being a bombast marred by mediocre storytelling yet in that movie I will say it has excelled in portraying the human condition. John Williams, as he has done many times with Mr. Spielberg before showcases versatility and a different type of music, has avery Middle-eastern feel yet deviously and subliminally propulsive that has repetitive motifs of fear, anxiety. And the screen writing? As with most of the best in the art of adaptation of true to life events, the use of temporal displacement is deployed. You'll know what I mean when you see the delay of exposition and progression during the Olympic Massacre. It is flashed back all throughout instead of being depicted all at once. (Would have marred the pacing and flow that way), so I commend the screenwriters as well.<br/><br/>While many will be irritated by this expected Spielberg routine: YES the movie ends somewhat low key it has moments of suspense but it is more histrionic and probably this isn't to everyone's taste. In the POV department, who are we supposed to be rooting for? It's instinctive to say Mr. Bana, yes that is a fact but ultimately we are supposed to be examining conscience and our own morales. The movie has also a lot of subliminal portrayals of these issues in society and in our lives, from a lady discussing Karl Marx's theories on right and wrong with respect to situational ethics and philosophy, to temptation of adultery and SEXpionage rolled into one. And the remorse and maybe even confusion that Mr. Bana's character feels, you will feel too in the end. It's NOT a feel-good movie but it's GREAT. Grade A-"

After the murders, a group of Mossad agents are sent to Europe to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible. What the movie explores is how in doing so with burning desire to find and punish the murderers, in following the ancient law of an eye for an eye, the searchers for justice nearly become terrorists themselves. You can't just look into abyss and stay the same because, ""When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.""<br/><br/>In his new, easily one of the best films he ever made (in the same line as ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), Spielberg looks at terrorism from many different angles. He does not justify killings, and there are many, many terrifying killings in his film and behind every death there is a human character and every character is a real person, not cartoonish villain or a super-hero. Devastating, powerful, and controversial this film will split the audiences and will have as many admirers as haters.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Crannicus_Maximus","10","4","6","3 September 2006"," A Simply Outstanding Film.
","Every year, there is one or two films that are released which truly touch the mind and the soul. Munich was one of these films.<br/><br/>Featuring an outstanding cast from start to finish, Munich had many actors in it whose talents I severely doubted previous to seeing the film.<br/><br/>One such actor was Eric Bana, who I had only seen in The Incredible Hulk before this film. Anybody who has seen that movie would understand why I doubted the talents of this outstanding actor. However, his performance as the lead in the film more than redeemed him.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is the other actor who, until Munich, I had doubted. His turn in The Road to Perdition was not very impressive, and when they announced that he would be the next James Bond I was shocked. However, after seeing his turn as the character ""Steve"" in this film-- one of Eric Bana's accomplices-- I am more than ready to take in his performance as the legendary British spy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was superb, featuring some of the finest actors in some equally fine roles-- Cirian Hinds, for instance, puts in an amazing effort as another of Bana's teammates, and Geoffrey Rush, as per usual, is outstanding in his supporting role as Bana's ""boss"" of sorts.<br/><br/>The Palestinian aggressors, as well, were portrayed in a respectful manner. In fact, the film seems excellent in what it does because of the fact that it refuses to take a side-- both the ""villians"" and the ""heroes"", so to speak, are painted as human beings rather than monsters. For instance, one of the men who organized the killing of the athletes is seen with his family, and those sent to kill him actually abort their first opportunity because the man's daughter is present at the time, and would have become one of the victims.<br/><br/>The hunters have hearts, and this makes for a far more interesting drama than any other because it stands as a unique piece of work.<br/><br/>10/10."
"shanfloyd","10","4","6","22 August 2006"," Simply another masterpiece.
","It is quite safe to say that ""Münich"" is among the five best movies that Mr. Spielberg made till date. With a topic shockingly relevant even after thirty-three years, Spielberg reaches out to both emotion and judgement of the audience. The main four reasons behind his achievement? The film's screenplay, cinematography, acting and of course his own trademark serious yet visually appealing style of direction.<br/><br/>Israel security officer Avner is assigned to conduct a secret government operation to kill eleven Palestinian high officials after eleven Israeli athletes were murdered in 1972 Olympic Games. He gets aided by four teammates with four entirely different characters. They travel to several European and Mediterranean countries in order to do so. The film effectively portrays the basis of so-called modern terrorism and speaks against those who justify it. The biggest achievement of the film is that it doesn't take any side. There is no hero in this film. Avner questions the utility of terrorism and counter-terrorism in the end but only after he carries out his mission.<br/><br/>Janusz Kaminski's ever-brilliant cinematography and Spielberg's ideas effectively blend in to generate some unforgettable shots in the history of cinema. Who can forget the dramatic midnight encounter and exchange of words between Avner's team and some Palestinian agents in that old room in Athens? Or when extreme paranoia strikes Avner at a time near the end of the mission? or when he's still haunted by the Munich murders even while having sex with his wife? The use of violence in this film is graphic and shockingly realistic and none of the scenes are actually uncalled for. The film majorly becomes a character study of every different mind related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Yet the film remains absolutely neutral... almost passive. It doesn't even shout a message like ""Terrorism is bad"" or something. One can imply anything from it.<br/><br/>Eric Bana plays the role of Avner with great perfection and style. He effectively catches that vital bit of determination of the character behind his gentle and calm demeanor. Geoffrey Rush also deserves much praise as Avner's superior officer in the Government. Daniel Craig and the actress who played Avner's beautiful wife also did well.<br/><br/>While Ang Lee's work in Brokeback Mountain is passionate and personal, Spielberg's in 'Münich' is almost hard realism. Spielberg doesn't voluntarily evoke the audience's emotion by exaggerating a particular scene. But who cares? he will surely win more Oscars in upcoming years."
"praveen1013","10","4","6","20 August 2006"," The trauma suffered by Mossad agents
","Munich is definitely among the top of Spielberg's best movies. The movie is well crafted right from the way the title is displayed(showing all cities involved in the movie(incident) to the end of the movie where the director sends a strong message to the Zionist regime (or) even the warring nations at a larger picture.Eric bana shines as Avner exemplifying the saying 'Action speaks louder than words'.He is a stern Mossad agent who is asked to kill 11 Palestinian names, who are said to have planned the Munich massacre. But as the operation goes on, he starts losing his partners, all of them realizing that what they are doing is not righteous and Jewish.Ironically, everyone who realizes his fault face tragic end and the one who doesn't budge till the end escapes unscathed. Avner suffers a great mental trauma mistaking natural events for a bid on his life and loses peace totally that he is unable to enjoy his wife. He starts doubting whether the persons he kills were actually behind the Munich operation and gets out of mossad leaving a strong message that 'there is no peace at the end of all this'.A must watch movie . P.S. The movie is not at all biased.He gives the two chances for the arabs to explain their side. Hats off to the genius for maintaining neutrality in this movie. But,the israelis seem to be disgruntled with this movie which was expected."
"Derek237","10","4","6","20 August 2006"," Butcher's hands, gentle hearts
","The 2005/2006 Oscar race was indeed an odd one, especially when you consider the fact that the winner for Best Documentary made more money than any of the Best Picture Contenders. Combined. Munich, directed by Steven Spielberg, was one of those contenders, though I think it was the least hyped of the 5 films, and no one really expected it to win, and it didn't. But I'm very glad it was nominated, and I'm glad to have seen in while it was playing in theatres, even though it turned out to be a very, very unpleasant experience for me. It's a long movie, and if you take the previews into account, it probably runs for about 3 hours. I never really appreciated how long 3 hours actually is until I went in to see Munich feeling perfectly fine, then halfway through I started to feel cold and shivery, and by the time the film was over, I walked out with a terrible fever and could barely make it home.<br/><br/>Now, I could probably make a great endorsement for the movie in my little IMDb comment here and say that Munich is such a wrenching, powerful film that it actually effected me physically, but I know that's not the case. It was winter, there was a flu going around. You know how it is. Anyway, I recently bought the movie and watched it over again, this time with a clear head, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is one of 2005's best (a great year for movies, by the way), and even though movies about penguins or gay cowboys seemed to capture all the interest and hype, it's still gratifying to see that Munich got its nomination over some other very worthy films. I think that within the next few years, more and more people will discover Munich and wonder why they didn't see it before; it is a movie that will linger for decades and decades to come.<br/><br/>It's a very involving film, it is not afraid to give all of the necessary crucial details, from the actual Munich massacre (spread out and shown in segments throughout the entire film) to a scene in a dark conference room where the Prime Minister of Isreal makes the decision to retaliate against those who planned the murders. Most of the story is told through the eyes of Avner (Eric Bana), who takes on the mission out of devotion to Isreal, but slowly numbs with each murder until he doesn't even care about taking the lives anymore; he just wants to get to his home, and see his wife and child, but even when that finally happens the mission has taken such a toll on him that he is constantly paranoid and distraught. He is hailed as a hero for his mission-a hero that never existed- but he feels no sense of accomplishment as the cycles of violence and vengeance continue and escalate while he is helpless, and spiritually broken.<br/><br/>Munich is a great film and I'd compare it to something like The Godfather. It's a violent film, but it doesn't just throw senseless and brutal violence at the screen. Much like Coppola, Spielberg gives us little details in the violent scenes to keep them in our minds more vividly. We remember that the first person is assassinated while holding his groceries, and we remember the tense hesitation between the two assassins. We remember that that young girl answers a phone bomb that is meant for her father, and the moment of panic before he is actually murdered. We remember Avner's signal to ignite the bed bomb in the hotel room next to him- the lamp being turned off- and seeing the same lamp moments after the explosion on the floor among all the debris. It's those little compositions that make a film like this so memorable.<br/><br/>It's also like The Godfather because of the fact that it holds very familial values. Family is an important theme. Avner comes to dinner with the family of one of his ""business associates"" and is treated very much like a son to the character Poppy. He offers him advice and anecdotes, and while he helps him prepare the dinner he notes his big hands and offers a similarity between the two: ""We are tragic men. We have butcher's hands, but gentle hearts."" Avner shows devotion to Isreal, but his most sincere devotion is to his family. That is what makes Avner so likable, but also so tragic. The movie itself is not a tragedy, though it deals with tragedies, but the true tragedy can be found internally- in Avner's moral and spiritual dilemmas.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a director who seems to have unlimited talent. I'm always impressed and delighted with each new project he takes on. Munich is another masterpiece that you can add to the list of an almost uncountable selection of masterpieces from one of the best directors of this, or any other time. As the years go by, I'm sure more and more people will look at Munich and think it deserved the Oscar. It's a timeless and brilliant film.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"KUAlum26","9","4","6","13 August 2006"," Not as simple as ""Israel is wrong""or vice-versa
","I recall reading in columnist Ann Coulter's Academy Awards article(not really sure why she decided to cover the awards,given her very public contempt for actors and awards,but anyway...),she boiled down the concept behind Oscar nominee Munich as ""Israel is wrong"". <br/><br/>From seeing this movie,I can clearly tell she's not seen this film,or if she has she was there to cherry-pick this for the kind of things she didn't want to see or hear. I'm sure she's not alone out there,but these people are missing the point of this film.<br/><br/>This film account of the book(whose title and author eludes me at the moment),co-written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth,tells of the Israeli backed(though NOT officially recognized by the state)mission to find and kill the people responsible for the kidnapping and killing of twelve Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich(hence the title). The group is led by Avner Kaufmann(Eric Bana,very good here,as he was in the Hulk and Troy),the son of a national hero who is a star agent of the Moussad(spelling?). His team of agents are sent by fiat of PM Golda Meir(Lynn Cohen) herself and is authorized by a fellow Mossad commander named Ephraim(Geoffrey Rush) to go about their missions.<br/><br/>Over the course of about eight months,Avner and his five transverse Europe looking for and executing each person for whom they are able to get a hold of,with each mission becoming a little more dangerous and each target becoming more murky. As Avner comes closer and closer to finding the main Palestinian who headed(or financed)the Olympic kidnapping,the endeavor becomes much more dangerous and Avner starts having his doubts about the effectiveness and purpose of his mission.<br/><br/>Dripping in moral quandaries,this movie starts as an anatomy of a national call for vengeance and justice and ends as...well,something different. I don't think I'm giving away anything by saying that this film shows that revenge is not nearly as simple,easy or clear as it seems.<br/><br/>With fantastic supporting performances by Daniel Craig(the future JAmes Bond!),Ayalet Zurer(As Avner's pretty,worried wife and new mother),Ciaran Hinds,Mathieu Kassowitz(both as members of the group),Cohne,Rush,Michael Lonsdael and Mathieu Aralic(as,respectively,the father of the info broker and the broker himself,who supply Avner their info as to whom to kill)among others,this movie is a searing,heart-tugging film. As per Spielberg,there is no skimping on emotional spark-plug moments,and plenty of the images here will stick with you long after you've seen them. This film doesn't pretend to have the answers about the violence in the Middle East,it is merely showing that in one instance of violence and tragedy,the way a nation responds can sometimes complicate or even make worse to some degrees,the situation. Nobody here is really wrong or right,just unable to break the chain of violence that has become synonymous with the region. Anyone who simplifies the situation,or this movie,doesn't get it or the film."
"howard.schumann","9","4","6","7 August 2006"," A lament for the loss of idealism
","Steven Spielberg's Munich is a lament for the loss of idealism, not only for Avner (Eric Bana), the leader of an assassination squad, but also for Israel, a country that once proclaimed the supremacy of human values. The film deals with events stemming from the deaths of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, Germany at the hands of a group of Palestinians who came to be known as Black September. It is not a documentary but historical fiction that dramatizes the unofficial Israeli retaliation for the deaths in Munich, depicting the revenge killings of a secret intelligence operation.<br/><br/>There is much bloodshed and horrific violence in the film but there are no heroes and no villains and, to the chagrin of supporters on both sides, the film contains more questions than answers. Will the killings stop the terror or will the men killed simply be replaced by even more dedicated terrorists? What is the result for an individual's soul and indeed the soul of a nation? Is revenge killing ever justified? These are questions in which Spielberg has shown considerable courage in raising.<br/><br/>The leader of the unit is Avner, a member of the Mossad, the Israeli version of the CIA, and the son of a war hero. Though he is reluctant to leave his wife who is pregnant, he does not question his mission out of his belief in the righteousness of the Israeli cause. His team includes Steve, a dedicated Zionist from South Africa (Daniel Craig), a toymaker who has turned to making bombs (Mathieu Kassovitz), an antique dealer (Hanns Zischler) and a veteran military officer (Ciaran Hinds). All work for Mossad and their case officer (Geoffrey Rush), though officially no one has an identity or connection to the organization.<br/><br/>The film shows that the primary decision was made by a high member of the government, presumably Prime Minister Golda Meir, who justifies the assignment by proclaiming that ""every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Each assassination attempt is shown in detail, including the planning and the execution as the team carries out its operations in Rome, Paris, Cyprus, Beirut, and Athens. As the killings pile up, the bloodshed begins to take its toll, especially the gory ""personal"" killing of a woman operative who lured and killed one of the members of their unit. The once idealistic Avner becomes disillusioned by the experience and he and others begin questioning the morality of their assignment and whether it will ultimately help or hurt the Israeli cause. Some like Steve, a hard liner says, ""the only blood that matters to me is Jewish blood"". One member of the Israeli group, however, says ""Jews don't do wrong because our enemies do wrong. We're supposed to be righteous"" Another says, ""Palestinians didn't create terrorism. Palestinian lands were taken by bloodshed and terrorism"".<br/><br/>The Palestinian point of view is represented by a group of Arab bodyguards who unexpectedly share a safe house with the team in Athens, each unaware of the other's true identity. One of the bodyguards, Ali (Omar Metwally) claims that the Palestinians can ""wait forever. You don't know what it is not to have a home. Home is everything"". Although the film does not take a stand on how countries should react to terrorism, it questions the wisdom of the ""eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth"" philosophy and the ethical basis of the operation. When Avner concludes, ""there is no peace at the end of this"", he demands evidence from his superiors that the men they killed were actually involved with the Munich massacre.<br/><br/>Munich is an honest, tightly woven, and very suspenseful film that contains some fine performances, especially that of Eric Bana. More importantly, it asks us to look at what is possible in today's world beyond the exchanging of atrocities, to perhaps even envision the day when claims of religious superiority (""religionism"") will be seen as racism and homophobia are today, as relics of an ignorant past. It allows us to dream that the ultimate solution to the Middle East conflict will not be a political one based on dual states enforcing a religious apartheid, but a spiritual solution where direct experience, not ancient scriptures, will lead people to the divine presence."
"photoe","8","4","6","14 July 2006"," A View into a Violent World
","Much has been said about this movie, so I wont repeat the obvious. There are a couple of parts that aren't clear, like when the Israelis bunk with the Palestinians, and the bomb-makers and an older team members death.<br/><br/>The sexual aspects of the female assassins death, and the final sex scene are absolutely shocking, and I think the last scene has people grasping for interpretation a lot, but I think its fairly clear.<br/><br/>Intercutting the final horror of the 72 Olympics tragedy with Av having sex with his wife may be understood by anyone who has had sex while grieving over a recent death. The mind wanders to topics that you suppress. Bana went on this mission still having not emotionally digested the full horror of what exactly happened in Munich. In the final scene, Av finally releases his grief over the sadness of what happened at the stadium, and his wife says 'I love you'. Its all about the price of grief that has to be paid for violence and the only redemption that can heal, love.<br/><br/>I've never seen anyone dare to do this in a film, and Spielberg obviously doesn't give a flip about whether people get it or not. Its there to make you cry and maybe think. Its not just some banal manipulation.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of Bana's mother telling him its OK to kill so that Jews have a home, with the Palestinian Ali's statements about how the Palestinians are fighting for a home is also telling and thought-provoking. Av himself talks with his wife about her being his only home. Ali also says 'the world will see what we have become and they will ask questions about our conditions...' Very true indeed, and on my mind right now with the Israelis wandering the ME like avengers in their expensive US-funded jets.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a famous Jewish person and he sees some equality in the conflict, so I take his word for what its worth. Maybe he doesn't, but he makes a good point that the killing just doesn't end. People think the final scene with the two towers is excessive, but what it does is show us that, back in 1972, we were only just beginning on this long cycle of death, and that the killing continues.<br/><br/>Spielberg is no idiot. People need to look deeper into what he is trying to do before they mouth off about his banality or supposed lack of sophistication. The film is not perfect, but its a real spy thriller, with almost too much information about how to assassinate people, as well as a multi-level thought exercise on violence, vengeance, the individual vs the state, and the times we live in. Pretty Great."
"brodie_kashmir","9","4","6","10 July 2006"," Fast paced and gritty, though rushed at times
","Akin to spy films, only without the spies, Munich is a gripping emotional film that takes you too the edge of your seat and to the brink of tears.<br/><br/>Following the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes by a group of Palestinians at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, a group of Israelis is then contracted to hunt down and kill the organizers of the event.<br/><br/>Violence begetting violence and the futility of it all is the major theme that Steven Spielberg wants you to take away from it all. Throughout the film the replacements for the people they kill are mentioned, even going so far as to kill one of those replacements. You'd think that with the message so clearly spelled out, the movie would be an insult to the intelligence of the movie going public (though I guess that depends on what you think of the intelligence of the movie going public). But it's not. The message is so simple, so obvious, that it would be an insult if the characters DIDN'T know it and state it.<br/><br/>Eric Bana proves his talent by masterfully portraying Arven, the man put in charge of the Israeli hit group. He is torn between doing a job and getting revenge and perpetuating the violence. He doesn't want to spend all that time away from his pregnant wife, which is a Spielberg trademark, the issue of fatherhood. Seriously, look at his films, it's an issue all the time, distant, absent or neglectful fathers, or men not wanting to be fathers, or some kind of father issue. It was an interesting way to present that sub-plot.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was wonderful, including Brit and new James Bond Daniel Craig, and Bana's fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush, all of the men wrestling with several issues concerning their assigned task.<br/><br/>The real star of the picture though is Steven Spielberg. It's his most un-Spielberg film to date. I honestly thought it was a Ridley or Tony Scott film at times. That's a sign of a true craftsman. You know his films when you see them. Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, E.T., Saving Private Ryan you can look at them all and say ""That's a Spielberg film."" And here we are, thirty years after his debut with Jaws and he's disappeared into his film.<br/><br/>The only real downside I could see in this film was that it was a rushed film and you could see that at some points. Spielberg has constructed two massive films in a little over a year. He started War of the Worlds in August of 2004, and it was ready by the following June. He immediately started on Munich and had that mostly done by the end of November. But there were some noticeable continuity mistakes. And I say noticeable because I rarely notice them, because I'm not looking for them. But there are a few, showing that the editing process was rushed."
"cherhyll","10","4","6","12 June 2006"," Excellence unrecognized
","Hands down--the most effecting, and best produced, directed, edited and acted film I have seen in a long time. It is a masterful telling of a personal dilemma within a horrible political truth and it succeeds on every level. But sadly, too many people said to me--I saw it on TV...I didn't need to see it again. And so, they missed everything this perfectly-cast movie had to offer. That day in Munich our world officially lurched into the pain of the terrorist era, and to dismiss it, without watching it,seems irresponsible. Aside from superb work from the DP, and music that hasn't been so scary since Jaws, this is a nail-biting suspense story that packs its full wallop when you finally leave. Eric Bana should have walked home with the Oscar...taking us into his core and answering his life-and-death questions with him...did he succeed? Was it worth it? How has the world suffered? What type of never-ending cycle was started? It was almost like lifting up a rock onto a never-ending snake pit. Bana was so exceptional--as was everyone in the cast--that in the trite, ultimate commitment, I truly forgot I was watching a movie. Spielberg continues to be the master and Hollywood's jealousy is sad. And as a New Yorker who watched the Twin Towers smoking on 9/11, the ending scene said it all."
"sheldonlgreen","9","4","6","28 May 2006"," Exhausting!
","I love Steven Spielberg's movies but I truly wanted to hate this one.<br/><br/>The happenings at the Munich Olympics, 34 years later, are still fresh in my mind, and my feelings of that day, that someone needs to get even with Black September and its supporters is still present. Therefore, I wasn't ready to accept a large part of Spielberg's premise---that there was a great personal toll on the Israelies who were commissioned to carry out targeted killings of those who actually planned and/or carried out the terrorist plot.<br/><br/>With mixed emotions I have to say that this is an outstanding movie pointing out the complexities of how a free Western society reacts to the actions of society's lowest common denominator--those who would rather destroy a perceived enemy than attempt to work with them as partners. <br/><br/>While there are many fine technical aspects of Munich--the precision needed to hunt down and destroy the terrorists--what is most memorable is the final questioning by the Israelis of the implications of what they are doing. And, it is important to note, Israel has pretty much gone out of the targeted assassination business."
"mfischler-1","10","4","6","22 May 2006"," The movie is scarily relevant to today
","This is the best movie I have seen all year. Good acting, directing, fast-moving storyline, large moral questions, it's all there. I started watching it at midnight but it kept me up for it's 3 hour length and then some.<br/><br/>The violence is realistic and horrific, especially in the scene at the dutch woman's house. You really don't expect it from a Spielberg movie, especially after his chain of ho-hum movies such as the Terminal and Catch Me If You Can. This movie is gripping and emotional from start to finish. I believe that the movie gives fair treatment to both sides of the Israeli, Palestinian issue and explores why it's such a difficult conflict with no easy answers. Largely the movie is just another spin on why vengeance is never good, but this is the human drama that will keep playing itself out because it is in our nature.<br/><br/>Finally, the tones of terrorism throughout the movie make it eerily relevant to today. The events took place not very long ago, and we still live in a world with terrorists and if we terrorize the terrorists in revenge then what makes us any different. In the final scene, the twin towers were digitally added to the center of the shot. The message couldn't be any clearer."
"thornugc","9","4","6","11 May 2006"," Haunting yet Beautiful
","Here are the facts; 11 Isrealis were murdered by the terrorist group known as Black September and because of this, Israel responded by killing those responsible with covert operations. The rest of the movie is story driven. With that in mind you must understand that my review of this movie is purely from the entertainment point of view.<br/><br/>When I first saw the length of the movie I was thinking this was going to be hard to get through. However when the movie ended I was surprised because it didn't seem so long to me. It is the story of the men who were given the mission to hunt down and kill the alleged planners of the Munich massacre that happened during the Olympics in 1972. There are some strong scenes in this movie that are not for the faint of heart. I was pleased with the entertainment value of the movie although I do believe that Spielburg placed some of his own liberal ideals within it. Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down, Hulk, Troy) does a fine acting job. The whole time you see that he is totally committed to this mission however does he remain committed? The realism in this movie is quite dramatic and I feel it is needed. This movie is not for the little ones.<br/><br/>I look at this movie as what might have happened. I don't look at it as the truth of what happened. It shows that the Isralis weren't cold blooded murders but it also shows they had no remorse for those they killed. Ironic isn't it?<br/><br/>**SPOILERS--DO NOT READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE** The raid in Beruit was very well done. I was amazed at the professionalism displayed when portraying the Isreali soldiers who arrived just before the raid. I like the idea of them holding the pictures while looking at the men just before shooting them.<br/><br/>The dramatic build up of the phone bomb concerning the little girl was superb. I truly thought she was going to die. And then the other woman who lost her sight, very dramatic and eye opening for the main character played by Eric Bana. However I must say the most disturbing piece in the whole movie is when the remaining members of the team found the woman who killed one of the teammates. Her realizing that she had just been shot and then going to her cat knowing she was dying was a very strong image. It gets stronger. The blood started to run from her throat and Bana's character just stared in disbelief, I must say that was on of the most disturbing images I have seen in film in a good while.<br/><br/>In the end the main character believes what he did was all for nothing and you can tell he is haunted by it. Yet he still sees those athletes in his dreams reminding him of why he took the mission. I believe the only reason he was able to fight madness was because his wife through all of this let him know that she loved him and no matter what she will always love him.<br/><br/>If you have the time and are about to give it an honest viewing without distraction, then I do recommend you watch this movie. If you don't have the time and cannot sit and watch without constant interruption, then you will not be able to follow it and it is a waste of your time."
"Thelightbulb","10","4","6","24 April 2006"," The cold hard truth
","War and violence are bad, we all know that, but most of us accept that sometimes under the most extreme circumstances it is necessary. Steven Spielberg's Munich explores the actions of the Israeli government's response to the massacre of the Israeli wrestling team at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, and whether all the subsequent bloodshed was justified. Under the leadership of the patriotic Avner (Eric Banner), a group of five unofficial Mossad operatives (Including Daniel Craig) set out to exact revenge on a list of 11 men that the Israeli government say are responsible for masterminding the 1972 Black September slaughter.<br/><br/>This film is truly remarkable, and if not as poignant as Schindler's list it certainly comes close to being one of Spielberg's greatest films. The key to this film being so great is the cold hard truth it tells about the fine line between appropriate response and bloodthirsty vengeance. Many people die in this film both Jewish and Palestinian, but not once is death shown to be glorious or satisfying. Indeed as the Mossad squad go about their duties, the consequences of their actions weigh heavy on them to the extent of breaking point. The real life events that this film are based on could quite conceivably be an action vehicle for a Chuck Norris, or an Arnold Swarznegger type film, killing all the bad guys and helping to make the world a better place, but instead Spielberg gives a balanced and thoughtful insight into the conflict between the Israeli's and the Palestinians.<br/><br/>Ultimately Spielberg underlines what many of us fear about the world today, violence breeds violence and solves nothing. The one point this film really rams home is that the actions of Israel did not make the world any safer or better, they made it worse. It is entirely understandable watching Avner's decent into paranoia and despair. We see a Jewish patriot haunted by the fate of the murdered athletes, fail to get any sense of justice or satisfaction from his actions as guilt and fear overcome him. Eric Bana, who was already well regarded for roles in Troy and Chopper amongst other films, is superb portraying Avner and now surely stands up there amongst the greatest Hollywood actors of today. The normally bland Daniel Craig is also surprisingly good as a supporting actor as are all the cast, especially Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale.<br/><br/>If you're looking for some lightweight action entertainment I would suggest you avoid this film at all costs, however if you want to see stark reality on the futile nature of revenge and the dark nature of mankind then this film cannot be missed!"

The acting, the screening of the tragic events or even just the backdrop was utterly amazing. It has a very liquid like flow to it from beginning to end. This has to be one of the best and powerful films this year with strong performances by Eric Bana and Daniel Craig. Munich had me on the edge of the seat right up to the end and I was disappointed when the Credits started rolling since I didn't want the movie to end - but all good things have to come to an end right? <br/><br/>Just when I thought Steven Spielberg was slacking off a bit he delivers this little gem. Awesome....to put it in a word."
"vaga52","10","4","6","9 March 2006"," smooth and wonderfully done film. A real masterpiece!
","I live in Serbia and unfortunately I got to know the full meaning of hatred and revenge. Once you enter the circle, you are lost and statements like ""They were the first to do it"" begin a never ending horror. Thats the first reason why I liked the film, the second, Mr Spielberg didn't take sides. He was above all and that's why he is not going to be much liked. A lot of them will not understand him. Once again he showed us that he is one of the greatest directors in the world. Such a smooth and wonderfully done film. Great to do it after The War of the Worlds and to remind us what a great master he is. No wonder he was not praised in Hollywood as he should be, if he had got an Oscar, maybe Jewish or Palestinian people wouldn't have been very happy. Unfortunately, everything is politics, in the end. Another film, that was maybe one of the best films ever made in Hollywood, The Brokeback Mountain, didn't get the Oscar for the best film! Are you surprised?"
"jackalchow","9","4","6","8 March 2006"," Munich is worth awarding
","I have watched this movie after Oscar academy.Although I haven't watched another awarded movies yet,this film is good enough to get some prizes. I don't agree that Munich is not as good as Spielberg's previous productions.He portrayed the emotional fluctuation of Avner deeply, and the struggle of his heart about the contradiction between Jews'compassion and Israel's loyalty are absolutely introspective. I would like to have a great deal to this society. However,after watching this film,I am confused whether it's really worth to do something like what Avner done in Munich. I wonder how many people can be stressed like it and even I may commit suicide in such kind of a madness."
"reclined","9","4","6","6 March 2006"," Haunting, gutsy and brilliant.
","Absolutely the most haunting and memorable film of 2005, if not of this century. I agree with Roger Ebert that Spielberg has very carefully and courageously placed our sympathies in this film between Israel and Palestine. However, I also feel that Spielberg simultaneously reminds us that our current ""War on Terror"" is not only unwinnable but also just part of a mankind's historical and hopeless cycle of pride, envy, murder and revenge. The latter task is a tricky one for Spielberg to pull off, but he does it so heart-wrenchingly in Munich without being terribly preachy about it. As in so many of his best films, here the action speaks so much louder than words.<br/><br/>Munich should have received every one of the Oscars for which it was nominated, and I would also like to have seen Eric Bana nominated for Best Actor and at least Geoffrey Rush nominated for Best Supporting Actor. It's hard, in retrospect, to imagine anyone else playing these roles so convincingly. Maybe Hollywood could someday add an ensemble category (as the Golden Globes do) for acting? Avner's team, like all the other characters, were so well cast in this film.<br/><br/>History may most remember Spielberg for Schindler's List, but our future is arguably more tied to Munich. What an incredible film to finally open up a dialogue upon such a crucial topic and to such a universal scale! Bravo, Mr. Spielberg! ;-)"

","Avner calls home to hear his wife's voice and check on his daughter who he has only seen once, because he is off killing people. She is learning to talk now and over the phone she utters ""dada"". Avner begins to cry. Because of this scene, Munich is the only 2005 film so far to make me cry. <br/><br/>The film is heartbreaking, powerful, devastating, and suspenseful. It is by far one of the best films of the year. But then again, what do you expect form the great Spielberg. He presents us a film that keeps us at the edge of our seats hating the main characters because of there crimes against nature yet sympathizing for them and hoping they pull off their mission. <br/><br/>Everyone in this film is bringing there all especially Ciarán Hinds and Mathieu Amalric. Hinds countenance in every scene gives us a character who is mysterious and we want to learn all about and when he succumbs to his final destination, the audience is heartbroken. Amalric on the other hand is one of the best villains of the year. The great thing about this performance because ALvin knows he's tricky but he must use him to complete the mission.<br/><br/>There is one line in the film that stand out as the theme of the film and a theme of life itself: ""All this blood comes back to us."" And indeed it does. Consider the scene where Alvin and Steve go after Salamah but karma ends up screwing up the mission.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is a powerful piece of work with great camera work, performances, and direction. It is a yet another masterpiece to add to Spielbergs resume. Well done to all!"
"mbyrne-3","9","4","6","2 March 2006"," Graphic, honest, gripping, balanced, deep - Superb!
","If there is one message that I got from this excellent movie it's not political, but more human. The message I got was that life is about family. Through all the tragic scenes of the events at the Olympic Village and airport, the subsequent scenes of bloody revenge by Mosad you are shown the human side of all the characters.<br/><br/>From the PLO operative at the safe-house in Athens, to Avner to the other members of the Mosad team. They all have their loyalties, but always comes back to family. The PLO operative statement that after he dies there will be his children, their children etc etc. The son of the PLO target in Beirut, who we see later guarding the grounds at the attempt on Ali Hassan Salameh.<br/><br/>Then within the Mosad team, Carl's doubts over their exact motive and justification, his son lost in 1967. Robert and his emotional weakness before the Netherlands killing, returning to his own family, i.e. his solitude, models and defusing bombs. Steve, even though we don't hear him speak of family, his concern for the documents expert Hans, who is killed by the River Seine, is suggestion of Steve's feeling for the 'family' of the Mosad unit Then finally Avner, in the last few scenes haunted by the athletes deaths suddenly becalmed and comforted by his wife. And, his realisation that he and his family are now the ones at risk suspecting even his own countrymen.<br/><br/>I think that Spielberg can be rightly proud of the film which he has created and the writers Tony Kushner/Eric Roth, and the original author of the book George Jonas. I would go as far as to suggest that this film left me with the same deep emotional impacts as Saving Private Ryan. A film that younger people should be exposed to as a lesson from history of how man can be."
"ddavidoff","10","4","6","2 March 2006"," A living proof about Spielberg's geniality
","At first I thought this movie is one of those 'new and no story' movies. I didn't have a clue it was directed by 'the Genius'. The story is outstanding-the story is true. Bana did his job extremely well, in fact great. things that happened during Cold War were absolutely illogical and one of those things is described in this masterpiece. On one side Spielberg shows us a story about revenge and war between Israelians and Arabs and on the another side it is story about a man who had a family and hope for better and peacefully life. I have no words any more, I'm fascinated and positively surprised. I hardly wait for new Spielberg's movie-it should be another piece of art."
"artemis_5","10","4","6","1 March 2006"," Very Relevant to Our Times
","Steven Spielberg's latest film begins with a terrorist attack on innocent civilians that is witnessed throughout the world. Both the families of the victims and those of the terrorists are affected, and a nation is left with the question of how to respond. Sound familiar? The year is 1972, and a group of terrorists, who have come to be known as Black September, have kidnapped and killed 11 Israeli athletes and their coaches participating in the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. This prompts Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister, to call a cabinet meeting in which the decision is made to assemble a team of elite assassins headed by Meir's former bodyguard; a gentle family man ""with butcher's hands"" whose wife is expecting their first child.<br/><br/>The team includes people who are experts in different areas of espionage. Robert is an expert in bombs. Until he was given this assignment, he worked taking them apart. Hans is a forgery expert; it is his job to keep the real identities of the group members secret with falsified documents. Then there are those who do not seem to have any particular talent, but are needed to do things like clean up after hits (i.e. Carl), or look really cool in sun glasses and add a touch of glamor to undercover work (i.e. Steve, who appropriately enough is played by the newest James Bond).<br/><br/>As the body counts start rising, Spielberg has some of his characters question whether their mission is really the best way that they can serve Israel and their own humanity. Robert questions whether killing people goes against what Judaism stands for. He reminds Avner that the Jews are a ""righteous"" people, and that is what makes them ""beautiful."" Avner questions the purpose of killing one group of terrorists, only to have them replaced by a group far more dangerous to Israel.<br/><br/>As a whole, I found this film very thought provoking. However, like ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it is also extremely violent. Spielberg, like Mel Gibson, is not a director to give the audience much relief from painful images. A worthy film, which deserves its nomination as best picture, with a cast dominated by strong actors, with no one giving a bad performance. The only criticism that I had of the film was that it may be a little too long, or it at least felt that way. As you can imagine, when the plot involves the location and killing of several antagonists, there is a tendency for repetition, although Spielberg somewhat avoids that by making each killing unique (as morbid as that sounds!)."
"ladyisjazz","10","10","20","31 December 2005"," Gripping, terrifying, emotionally wrenching.
","If only it were fiction... <br/><br/>""Munich"" is an outstanding movie from the one director today who consistently hands us outstanding movies, making his own mark of excellence higher to reach. How can a movie maker do it again, after ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" have slammed the moviegoer between the eyes? <br/><br/>""Munich"" begins with the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the ""peace"" Olympics in Munich. The Israeli mission to hunt down and kill those responsible for planning the assassination is the movie's story. A team of 5 men, previously unknown to each other, none of whom is a trained killer or assassin, is assembled and their job is to seek and destroy those who were responsible for the massacre. Their leader is a man who has ""the most boring job in the country"", as he describes it to his wife; nervous, frightened-looking, inept at first, he and his team begin their mission and their discovery of killing, passion, fear, loyalty, paranoia, and the ability to retain a sense of morality in a world that increasingly shows none. Chilling, terrifying, exciting and dreadful, in the true sense of the word.<br/><br/>For myself, the most compelling moment was when Avner, the leader of the team, in the midst of the horror of what he is becoming, telephones his wife and hears his baby daughter for the first time. Avner's face crumbles as he weeps for what he once had, once was, once thought was so boring but was so innocent, what he can never have again."
"bbrown8870","6","10","20","29 December 2005"," Much too long for the message it delivers
","This movie is interesting enough, but are we afraid to edit, just because it's Spielberg? This is little more than a string of brutal assassinations, beginning with the first one in Munich. The acting is superb, the directing is too, but after a while, it's too much work for too little payoff. ""Munich"" is a quasi-documentary without supplying the historical background that a good documentary would include. I give Spielberg credit for some thought-provoking dislodge, but it's mixed in with gratuitous sex (and I usually like a certain amount of sex in a movie), gratuitous violence, and corn-ball dislodge. The movie just never really grabbed my heart.<br/><br/>Maybe the highly visible director/producer doesn't want to repeat Salmon Rushdie's exile and so he softened his message. This could have been another ""Schindler's List"", but it feels like the movie's editor didn't cut anything. (Was there even an editor involved?) I ended by not caring about anyone in the movie. There is not one truly sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Where are all the great end-of-the year movies?"
"supergiantbugkiller","1","18","41","25 December 2005"," forget the politics, the movie is just plain tedious.
","In my opinion, the majority of the reviews of Spielberg's ""Munich"" have failed their readers. From what I've read, so many people are reviewing this movie's message rather than the film. Like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or ""The Passion"" before it, I think some people's political leanings and/or allegiance to Spielberg (I love Spielberg, but well... you'll see) is tainting the scores. <br/><br/>While there are many hailing this as a great film, Spielberg is getting nailed from all directions because of ""Munich"" - Israeli groups say he is naive about terrorism, Palistinean groups are saying it doesn't humanize them enough or show what their motives really were. There are some that instead say it is too even-handed, that Spielberg has tried too hard to please everyone. If I really had to pick one, I'd go with the latter - it seems the only message of this film is about the haunting price of revenge, that violence only creates more violence no matter who does it. I can deal with that. Neither Israel or the PLO strike me as innocent, and I've been attacked so many times for even saying so that I've kind of given up on even having an opinion. Does this even matter though? No. I found ""Munich"" to be the worst Spielberg movie I've seen. It's the least commercial, and the least watchable, and my opinion has nothing to do with politics whatsoever.<br/><br/>A variety of little problems were evident from the get-go. While this movie has the watchword 'inspired by true events', some characters are historical figures I don't recognize, such as the female Prime Minister of Israel. Some way of pointing out who she was while she was on screen would have been helpful rather than finding out who she was much later. There were no location subtitles despite frequent scene changes. Many scenes feature characters speaking in foreign dialects that in my opinion should have been subtitled. The characters took off on their quest before ever being properly developed, and would fail to be adequately developed as the film progressed beyond generic 'types' - the hothead, the smart one, etc. The film is overly quiet and distant, and most of all, bloated, with too much time between anything happening. It feels like we were given a directors cut DVD of a b-revenge flick that wasn't good at a regular running length in the first place. So basically, this movie bored the holy hell out of me.<br/><br/>I love Spielberg, and saw this movie not because of any specific interest in the story, but because I trust him to hold my interest. Spielberg has made movies about serious subjects before, and as much as we don't want to say it, Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan are entertaining films. ""Munich"" is not.<br/><br/>Despite a cast of people I like including Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana, each character is stone faced and dull, with no one giving a standout performance. Eric Bana in particular is atrociously bland here. When he isn't staring off into space with dead eyes, he's required to go into amazingly forced crying fits. The conversations between any set of characters rarely show any passion, and most situations they find themselves feel really phony. The only tension the entire movie has is the occasional feeling that something is going to go very wrong, because the group is very incompetent in carrying out their cold blooded revenge. <br/><br/>Much has been made of that violence. Yes, it is loud, realistic, and kind of exploitative. But that doesn't really matter, since these action scenes are also incredibly repetitive, and eventually fail to even work as a tool to wake up the audience. I don't know if we were supposed to feel all that sympathetic for either side, but some of the revenge murders are vicious enough to make me wonder just what the point was by making them so graphic. I guess this was supposed to reinforce just how nasty killing actually is - that the images can and should haunt you forever - but really all it does it make you feel less sympathetic for everyone. I eventually stopped caring what happened to any of these people, and that's when I began praying it would end. But it kept going and going and going and going. I found out that the script was given a run through by Tony Kushner, writer of ""Angels In America"", and it is said he had an influence on the set. It shows. ""Angels"" is probably the one piece of media I've hated most of this past decade, as there hasn't been a movie or series more boring or pretentious. Without saying what it is, there is a scene near the end of ""Munich"" that is so kitschy, so overblown and ridiculous, I'm sure it was Kushner's doing.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not alone in my dislike of this film - I've got a significant roster of well known, thoughtful reviewers who also hated this movie for the technical aspects of film-making alone. So decide for yourself, but don't make my mistake of going to see it just because it's Spielberg. - Goon"
"boaz_munro","9","13","28","21 December 2005"," An excellent retelling that does its job.
","The war on terror, especially when it comes to Israel, is a war of ideologies, and most people align themselves with one or another based on the information they receive or the religion they subscribe to. The reality of it, though, is the reality of every controversial topic--there's merit to both sides, and that's why there's controversy. Steven Spielberg's latest film, a huge step away from his morally comfortable fables, forces us to face the depth of the conflict, and of revenge and killing in general. Anyone seeking validation for their partisan views won't find it. Munich leaves viewers at a loss, and this is why it succeeds.<br/><br/>Munich tells the true story of a team of Israeli agents assigned to kill the Palestinians responsible for the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes. Aside from Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's rich and complex screenplay, Janusz Kaminski's gripping cinematography and the genuine, troubling performances of the cast are probably the film's most vital elements. Eric Bana is a strong, conflicted hero whose patriotism and doubts are reflected in his colleagues. <br/><br/>Despite the many characters and plot twists, it's a pretty simply told movie, and isn't hard to follow. Even though Spielberg has matured, he still delivers many of his usual powerful if contrived moments. <br/><br/>Munich is an excellent thriller, but don't expect a dazzling moral revelation or a neatly wrapped message. You won't get those things. Munich doesn't appeal to any political group. Rather, it stirs the doubt in all of us and forces us to face the humanity in everyone."

In Paris for example, one can the Eiffeltower, Eric buying garlic, Lui riding a Citröen DS and Edith Piaf is singing all the time. In Rome (which does not look a bit like Rome, because it was filmed in Budapest) there is a café where you can see the brand ""Martini"" everywhere , and Vespa scooters in the foreground (hint, hint). In London one can see in the short street scene a red post box, a red telephone both and a red double-decker bus. Mabey I missed the Tower Bridge, but I would not be surprised.

","This is one of the best and worst films ever to grace the screen - critics will love and hate it with equal measure.<br/><br/>The hatred spawns from almost 3 hours of unspectacular cinematography, amazing cast with no-one giving a stand-out performance, a leaning towards Jewish sympathies in the most complicated conflict the modern world has known and a basic feeling of ""why was this film made?"" However these simplistic first impressions must be put to one side as this film is an epic unfolding of human emotional drama. Eric Bana hasn't given such a powerful performance since ""Chopper"" and the rest of the cast support admirably. The shot selection is equally average but this too only adds to the power of the story. This film is totally focused on story - and, boy, is it focused on story.<br/><br/>If you don't know about the narrative you will be shocked. The story speeds through emotions and locations like an express. Terrorists are bad, Governments are worse. Violence creates violence and the gun has never solved any conflict. A ""War on Terror"" creates a hydra effect and more terror, not less. And the violence is shocking - a woman three seats down from me was retching at one point. There isn't ""Saving Private Ryan"" excessive gore but up close and personal murder.<br/><br/>This film will struggle at the box office because the content is intense and the length will work against it. And it may struggle at international award ceremonies as no one area stands out. But, for me, this makes the film so special. We're talking Spielberg here and there is no fluffy, happy ending. In fact (spoiler alert!) the twin towers have been digitally put in to the film to emphasise the ultimate point of this film and a warning for our generation from the past. As the Isrealis discovered in the 1970s, so America and Britain are discovering today - you cannot fight fire with fire: terrorism will never be destroyed by violence."
"phillipstephenso","10","10","21","31 December 2005"," Saving Eric Bana
","Steven Spielberg delves deeper into unabashed realism with this film. Like Saving Private Ryan, this film does not hesitate to explore the horrors of the human urge to violence. Perhaps, Spielberg is trying to warn us of the end of our tendencies toward revenge that in turn leads to not only the endless cycle of violence but also to the inevitable ruin of the psychological health of those entrusted with the revenge. Spielberg depicts the massacre of Jewish athletes in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games to illustrate his point. Eric Bana plays a member of the Israeli Mossad, which is assigned by Golda Meir the task of revenge. However, Bana begins to doubt the wisdom of some of the assassinations and asks his commander why the Palestinians were not simply arrested and tried, as Eichmann was. The intricacies of secret assassinations are vividly depicted, including bombings and cleverly disguised guns and accidental killings (collateral casualties). Government sponsored assassinations are seen as a dangerous and nasty business. Bana continues his wonderful portrayal of the hero, following his portrayal of Hector in Troy. And Spielberg continues to show himself to be a master of realism, as well as fantasy."

","Masterpiece? I keep hearing masterpiece? who are you people? I bet you you list National Lampoon's European Vacation as one of your ten favorites. When will you people start accepting the fact that Spielberg is not infallible? Yes, Schindler's list was superb. That was a masterpiece. Munich, on the other hand, was a complete failure. If you can't see this, then you can't see this, and obviously you need to continue watching more movies to hone your skills.<br/><br/>The 70s are amazingly accurate; visually the film is great, of course. However, Spielberg approaches a serious subject with sophomoric nonchalance; we know he wants to tell us that it was all futile, all the killings, but we're not convinced. and that sex scene, where the final bloody moments at the airport unravel, is intolerable it is so bad. Spielberg screwed up prodigiously when he included that scene; Bana is having sex with his wife and suddenly the images, away long enough to enjoy a moment of bliss, suddenly reappear at the most crucial moment in coitus and Spielberg, his mind rotten by years of fat living and too much success, perhaps, crosses the wires between sexual climax and men unloading their Uzi's on each other. If one puts Schindler's List aside--an obvious success of a movie--you wonder if this asshole (and he is a asshole for mishandling a subject which he, as a Jew, should have treated properly) shouldn't just concern himself with pg-13 subject matter.<br/><br/>one last thing: I don't know who played Golda Meir; this might have just been her, that's how accurate it was.

"solutions-2","8","10","21","23 December 2005"," Terrific movie, with Spielberg politically naive; Kushner self-hating
","I bring certain insights regarding the Mideast into this movie i just watched. If you are only interested in the human drama which is so excellently portrayed, my remarks may appear irrelevant to you. Since we are nearing the ""next holocaust"" for the Jewish (Israeli) people, I must share my insights now. Owning dual citizenship as an American and Israeli, i also share many years of deep research into the history of Israel's place in the Mideast. It is therefore, with resignation that i watched the movie bend its knee to the accepted left-wing viewpoints totally accepted by Tony Kusner (he sits on a board of the most shameful pro-Arab Jews) and to some extent naively assumed as truth by Mr. Spielberg. This is most evident here by the unspoken assumption that the Arabs are freedom fighters for a land ""taken by force"" by Jews (Israelis). This is the classical BIG LIE of the terrorists and believed by the Left, and it is unfortunate that it is not only kept solidly in place in this movie, but given credence (while the majority of Arabs came to Israel for employment under the Zionist enterprise in the 1930's and 40's, every one now claims his grandfather had orange groves and olive trees taken by the Jews.) While this is common knowledge in Israel, Spielberg falls for it in a major scene of moral- equivalence. The vitriolic, unapologetic Jew hatred so evident in all Arab countries is not deemed important enough to even address, nor deemed as important as pointing out their refugee camps (in reality slum cities kept in place by the Arabs thru the UN) or the fact that there was no ""Palestinian movement"" even in years prior to 1967, when Jordan and Egypt held the West Bank and Sinai, respectively. In other words, there is not a single character who really speaks for an intelligent, historically accurate. strong nationalist Israeli position. A position that would be regarded as ""normal"" for any other country."
"kid_gonzo","10","6","11","16 July 2006"," Spielberg finally makes a 'great' movie
","The comment titled ""Half Cooked Masterpiece"" by 'marcosaguado' on the IMDb website indicates that not everyone is going to understand this movie, despite Spielberg teaching the film's lessons gradually, ensuring viewers saw/understood/contemplated the moral dilemmas and questions raised by each action or situation before moving on to the next. I'm usually not a fan of Spielberg. Schindler was excellent, yes, but other films of his I find a little light- on, however Munich went far deeper than anything I've seen from him. It's by far his most nuanced film to date, near perfect, and extremely rich in imagery and symbolism for those with a keen eye for such things - take the KGB man crawling across the road desperately trying to get one more shot in before he dies, or the symbolism of the kitchen for Avner's character (he aspires to create a home with a big kitchen, but then his wife finds the new kitchen too big; the general excuse used for the film's conflict is to protect and acquire a true 'home', but in reality, such a quest has no end or ultimate point of satisfaction). Munich wasn't a thriller at all, as 'marcosaguado' wrote. If that's his opinion, he only saw the veil and not the beauty beneath. In fact, it wasn't really even about the Munich incident or its aftermath - it was about the moral questions behind the ongoing conflicts of the 20th and 21st century - namely the conflict within the middle east and also involving the USA, Australia, the UK and other parties who have helped to keep it going. And it's neither liberal nor conservative - it's about the need to try harder, to think clearer. Some of the film's main points were that at first we do think revenge is the best solution, but gradually as we think about the situation of all who are involved, things aren't so black and white. You could keep tracing causes of conflict back through history and never find the thrower of the first stone, the first point of blame, which is irrelevant anyway since no human living today was around then. It's also about not blindly trusting the leaders of your country simply due to loyalty, for all humans are fallible (the things which took place in this film stemmed from the Munich incident, yet also the decision of one woman, Golda Meir, and we can see now that her actions only led to reactions, with no possibility of peace). Then there's the revelation that both sides are fighting for the same thing - their home - so there's no way of saying whose motivations are more pure. And Ali, the PLO member who Avner speaks with in the safe house in Athens (and where we also see a micro conflict, with a sensible resolution, between a PLO and Mossad agent over which station the radio station should be tuned to - in the end they compromise) makes a great speech, admitting that he is an animal for what he does, but also makes a good point about the world being forced to think about the cages these animals are confined to. The Middle East disputes are a problematic conflict, as there is no good or bad, right or wrong - it's one big conundrum. The people who one side sees as terrorists in turn see their opponents as terrorists too. It's about perspectives and making an effort to understand them all before you can even think about trying to solve the disputes. Ultimately, the film is a big question - one that the leaders of the world need to start pondering - and certainly not an answer. It can point in the right direction, but it can't solve the world's problems, although it CAN say most definitely that the questions it raises are far more valuable and productive in the long term than the continuous eye-for-an-eye conflict we are plagued by today. The current self-absorbed, black-and-white thinking of George Bush, and practically every leader involved, will never lead to peace, only more conflict. Revenge brings revenge brings revenge brings revenge brings revenge... And if you think this movie is too long, you're either missing half of its messages, or you need to work at your attention span. It is the duty of all humans to start thinking deeply about what's going on, and unfortunately it's easy to say, ""It's too hard. I don't want to."" Munich is by far one of the most important films I've seen, and absolutely engaging from beginning to end. Now that the Academy has failed to recognise this with an award, it's safe to say the institution is irrelevant. To nominate Joaquin Phoenix over Eric Bana? That makes no sense. Walk The Line was so shallow I wanted to scream and I'm glad Johnny Cash never lived to see it. He'd have been appalled at being reduced to so little. To name Crash best film over this? Give me a freaking break..."
"riderpridethemovie","9","11","24","24 December 2005"," The other list
","I wonder how this film would be judged without Spielberg's name attached. My feeling is it would be hailed as a masterpiece. However, with great achievement comes great expectations. Most of those expectations will be exploded by the end of Munich, the least Spielbergian of Spielberg's films. Firstly, there is no obvious hero here, and that is the point. Terrorism and anti- terrorism drags all of humanity into an unheroic world. Witness Avner's reaction to the young Israeli soldiers who revere him when he returns from his mission: He doesn't believe he is a hero. Secondly, the pacing will alternately disorient, lag, overwhelm and frustrate. I would argue the beginning of the second act owes heavily to The Day of the Jackal, a film which also tried to demonstrate just how banal the days of an assassin can be. Tony Kushner, best known for Angels in America, writes scenes that disturb. They may irritate you at times, but you will remember them. In Munich, one such scene is the sex scene that ends the movie in which Avner is dreaming about the murder of the Israeli Olympians. It seems so ridiculous at the time, but days later you will still be haunted by it. Finally, Munich's point-of-view may come as a surprise considering it was directed by the man who won so much acclaim for Schindler's List. Of course, you would think Spielberg's sympathies would lie with the Jewish state created after the very Holocaust he set his most acclaimed film during. But Munich is a nuanced piece that takes a horrible event that solidified most of the world behind Israel and shows how Israel's response, to hunt down the planners of the kidnapping, turned into something just as unjustified."
"avi_vardi","3","9","19","3 January 2006"," Emperor Spielberg is NAKED
","""Munich"" is overrated by most reviewers. I am here to report that emperor Spielberg is naked! The script is bad almost throughout the movie. The directing is sloppy almost throughout the movie. The first part of the movie looks like a low budget movie. Several scenes don't make any sense (the meeting of Israelis and Palestinians in the same room; the final sex scene of the main character with his wife). The scenes that did get more attention are the violent scenes. I find a contradiction between the main message of the movie that violence does not pay and between the extra care in directing the violent scenes because... violence does pay."
"DPower37","10","9","19","26 December 2005"," Munich was a very well-made and historically informative film fairly presenting both sides of the conflict'
","I recently read in a publication (not sure if I'm allowed to say which it was without getting censored) that the film ""Munich"" would attempt to equally present both sides of the struggle related to the terrorist attacks at the 1972 Olympics. In other words, the article stated that the movie would not be pro-Israel. My brother, with whom I saw the movie, said he believed that the movie favored the Israeli side of the story. I am quite sure that a great many other people would feel that to be the case. This critique is my effort in showing that there was no favoritism in the presentation of this story.<br/><br/>Obviously, it could be expected that Spielberg would favor the Israeli side of the argument in the case of this movie. For example, the majority of the story and plot-line from the movie comes from the Israeli perspective; one could say that there were a great deal of phrases or sayings in Hebrew or Yiddish and that therefore ""Munich"" is pre-disposed to someone who is Jewish. There is clearly some truth in this, much in the sense that if you don't speak Spanish - you will obviously lose some of the meaning from a Spanish language film in subtitles that one who speaks the language would have understood. BUT the reality of that being the circumstance is that it would be historically inaccurate and unrealistic to have Israeli characters from that time, and in those circumstances NOT using that sort of phraseology. If Spielberg had not included this sort of language (for example the phrase, ""Mazel Tov"" in a few instances), it would have not only hurt the character development, but it also would have compromised what he knew to be the reality of the moment. From a film-making standpoint, it would have been irresponsible to make a story about an Israeli group and not have a pre-disposition to SOME degree to the Israeli customs and euphemisms.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there were multiple cases in the film where it presented not only the Palestinian mindset of the current conflict in the Middle East, but also where the terrorists who committed the crimes in Munich did not intend for it to be as violent as it was. In other words, we were not urged to see them as monsters or terrible human beings, as a less politically-sensitive director may have done. Transversely, in certain sequences, it was clearly presented that the main characters struggled with the ethics of their tasks and felt wrong about their actions.<br/><br/>There was also no apparent attempt to make enemies of Palestinians or to show the terrorists as horrible people, but rather to present that they are on one side of a war and that people on either side of a war do what they have to do to fight for that in which they believe. The goal of a terrorist is obviously to create terror, but it was clearly demonstrated that even terrorists, while they commit murder and do horrible things - have families, and are real people. I felt this was an extremely important facet to this film.<br/><br/>Finally, if there wasn't the desire to present both sides, many scenes in which both parties were made wrong or right for their actions could easily have been omitted. Multiple sequences of the movie were presented specifically so that the viewer could be left to devise his or her own feelings and opinions, instead of being led in one direction. I feel that ""Munich"" very well performed its stated purpose of saying that 'terrorism helps no one and hurts everyone', without getting politically one-sided. In addition, it achieved part of its purpose - to put viewers in a position to never forget what happened to the athletes in the events in Munich."
"Ndirsch11","10","7","14","30 December 2005"," Spielberg's Best Film Since Schindler's List!
","Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' is not so much a political thriller as it is a wrenching human drama. Those who go to see the film specifically expecting it to take either the Israeli or Palestinian side will come out either disappointed or angry. The film is arguing from an Israeli perspective but is severely critical of Israeli policy all the way. What the film, ultimately, is arguing against is meeting acts of terrorism and violence with more terrorism and violence. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner also are arguing from the perspective that if one intends to solve the problem of terrorism, one must look at the actual causes of terrorism and keep your pride and nationalism in check. The film's message is one that strikes a chord in a post 9/11 world.<br/><br/>The plot of 'Munich' follows Israel's response to the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Germany at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. The Eric Bana character, who works for Mossad, is assigned to lead a team of four people who will track down those responsible for masterminding the killings in Munich and use whatever methods necessary to eliminate them. Some people have objected to the very idea of portraying assassins as anything but people who bravely and boldly follow their orders for the sake of their nation's security. What Spielberg rightly does instead is humanize the assassins and portray them as people who have fears and doubts as all the rest of us do. (*small spoiler warning*) What is so masterful about the film is the way we get to know these characters and the way their confidence in the mission slowly dissolves. The assassins begin to realize the futility in carrying out their mission as they see how their terrorist targets merely get replaced by other terrorists. When all is said and done, they realize, nothing gets accomplished.<br/><br/>As usual from a Spielberg film, 'Munich' is an incredibly well-made production with stunning camera-work and cinematography. John Williams' score is haunting and brooding and the acting is impeccable (Eric Bana deserves an Oscar nomination). The screenplay gives weight and dimension to all the characters as we see their disillusionment slowly sink in. 'Munich' is incredibly powerful and moving, a film that will shake you to the core. It is Spielberg's strongest production since Schindler's List and is as equally passionate as well. That people can still criticize Spielberg for being timid, melodramatic, and overly sentimental is ludicrous. This film is an act of courage and bravery and shows Spielberg at his absolute best. Here, he shows himself as a director in complete control of his vision. Bravo, Mr. Spielberg!<br/><br/>I award 'Munich' a 10/10. It is also the best film I have seen in 2005."
"SnorriGodhi","7","5","9","30 May 2006"," Hamlet in Tel Aviv
","As a thriller, ""Munich"" works very well. Unfortunately, Kushner, Roth, and Spielberg felt the need to overlay the thriller with a political statement. Thus, we are faced with an assassin who talks like Hamlet, because he has to talk for Kushner & Co. It is difficult to get involved in an action movie when even the main character's heart is not in it.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Avner (the main character) is offered a clear choice: to join the mission or not; and he decides to join. Then, after killing his first target, he begins to feel moral qualms. Some of his team mates react in the same way. Nothing strange about that, and yet their crisis of conscience does not seem sincere: their words and actions hardly betray any feelings about killing. Instead, they talk about the abstract morality of their mission, and its likely consequences. They are almost too cerebral to be recognizable as human characters. They do not amount to much as philosophers, either. Their discussions offer no more insight than: killing is bad.<br/><br/>To be fair to this Hamletic hit squad, part of their problem is that they are faced by conflicting information: first they are told that new terrorists are recruited by terrorist attacks, like Munich; later they are told, or tell themselves, that killing terrorists creates more terrorists. Damned if you don't, and damned if you do.<br/><br/>This cognitive dissonance takes its toll on Avner. In one scene, he empathizes with a terrorist who wants to kick all Jews out of Palestine. In another scene, flashbacks of his terrifying experience in Munich do nothing to inhibit his sexual performance. A psychiatrist could make a career out of studying this guy!<br/><br/>Once more, apart from the psychological flaws, the movie is actually very good. The logic of Avner wanting to take part in the Beirut operation is pretty shaky (did Avner want his informers to know that he was in it, or not? and why go there in either case?); the way Avner buys information looks too easy to be true; but otherwise I found the plot believable. Even the physics is realistic: nobody flies off backwards when hit by a bullet, for instance. It would have been a great movie if Kushner & Co. had allowed the story to speak for itself.<br/><br/>As a footnote, the statement ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"" (see memorable quotes) is questionable. It is hard to believe that the ancient Mongols or the Vikings ever had to compromise their values. The Icelandic sagas show that the ""cycle of violence"" is easily broken, when both sides accept that the other side is going to stand up for its rights. Genghis Khan had his own (quite effective) way to break the ""cycle of violence"". Maybe the Viking and ancient Mongol cultures do not count as civilizations, but even so, they are still valid as proof of concept; so it would have made more sense to say: ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own unrealistic expectations"". But then the statement becomes a tautology."
"Buddy-51","9","5","9","28 January 2006"," another powerful work from the master
","There could hardly be a film more relevant to our times than Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" the master filmmaker's grim and controversial rumination on how violence only begets violence and how the philosophy of ""an eye for an eye,"" when taken to its extreme, only winds up with two men who cannot see. It certainly wasn't a ""safe"" subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.<br/><br/>Based on the book, ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games. To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act. Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission. As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops. <br/><br/>Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty. Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence. It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism. However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine film-making will have less trouble with this aspect.<br/><br/>For as a movie, ""Munich"" is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction. The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time. Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met. <br/><br/>As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole. He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass. <br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching. <br/><br/>""Munich"" is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through. It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes. But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, ""Munich"" is a provocative and richly rewarding experience."
"TheGorkyOne","10","5","9","13 January 2006"," On par with Schindler's List
","What Mr. Spielberg has gone and done is something that only a few filmmakers in the history of cinema have managed. He has managed to create a film of history that explains our current situation beyond any film I have seen since September 11th(the last shot of the film supports this). Spielberg is one the few directors remaining who is able to yield to the actors talent allowing them the freedom to truly ACT. The film was long, no doubt, and should be seen in the theater, but in view of the length, Spielberg never loses our attention. Flawlessly written, directed, acted, and edited, this film is stuff of greatness. By far the best film of the year. If anything the most underrated film of the year as well. If it fails to win Best Picture than the academy should take a year or two off to evaluate its judges. Dark, yet supreme."
"cutske","10","5","9","8 January 2006"," Give him the Statue
","I have just recently seen 'Munich' and it was one of the brutal, heartless, intelligent and wonderful films have seen in a long time. Spielberg's use of flashback and time-line to spin this horrible tale, though not entirely original, was a stroke of genius. I believe that director Peter Weir also used this style of directing in his 1993 film 'Fearless'. The Jeff Bridges character, who flashsback constantly throughout the film of the plane crash he walked away from is eerily similar to the Eric Bana character's journey in 'Munich'....both films endings culminating in the final telling of the tale....great performances abound as well in 'Munich'...Ciarans Hinds best work to date (Rome & Sum of all fears)...Our newest James Bond, Daniel Craig, puts in a stellar performance as well....also a nice touch bring back former James Bond Villain, Michael Lonsdale, (as Drax in Moonraker) to play the culinary-obsessed, Double-agent 'Papa""...This a must see....first three hour movie I have seen in a long time that I did not want to end....give him the statue."
"cdelacroix1","7","5","9","31 December 2005"," Great Story, Great Action
","This is very intense movie with great action, great suspense, fast pacing, wonderful cinematography, excellent use of flashback and color, and a wonderfully panoramic sweep from Israel to Europe to Lebanon to Brooklyn.<br/><br/>The gradual evolution of Avnar is convincing and troubling ... and chilling. If anyone wants to see what Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can look like, Avnar in the later part of this movie shows a fairly good picture of same. As a working psychotherapist with a specialization in trauma-related disorders, I can attest that the portrayal of Avnar in this regard reflects an authentic representation of trauma-driven mental and behavioral processes.<br/><br/>There are moral ambiguities that are raised again and again. The moral ambiguity of the ""twilight services"" I guess date back to John Le Carre's spy novels. One thing I myself liked about this movie, though, was that while it does dabble a little in ""moral equivalence"", on the whole this was not pursued as relentlessly as in ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", for example. <br/><br/>I myself came away with a clear sense that Munich, for example, involved a right and wrong side, as far as it goes: there were perpetrators and they were not the Israeli athletes but the Black September terrorists. <br/><br/>Now this is, I'll admit, in contrast to what seems to be the general view of the movie: that Spielberg, following the Kushner book on which the movie is based, was indeed trying to paint the Israelis as being as much terrorists as the Black Septembrists of Munich. And I'll admit that, especially in the conversations between Avnar and his case manager, we see some real ""back and forth"" that depicts the difficulties of the path that carried Avnar ... and Israel ... forward after Munich. <br/><br/>Yet there is never any question, in my own reaction to the movie, that raison d'etat here is closely connected with Israel's .. and Avnar's ... deep sense that they are fighting for their Home. The assignments of Avnar and his team are (I think) always recognized as, at one level Justified: these are terrorists who slaughtered in Munich and elsewhere, after all; and yet these are humans, people, with families, with lives that the film depicts as startlingly ""normal."" It is naturally tempting to view the Terrorist as somehow inhuman; this movie makes clear that the Terrorist is a Terrorist *and* entirely human.<br/><br/>The final ... or near-final, I can't recall ... scenescape of a New York skyline in which the Twin Towers are clearly recognizable adds for me a special sense of poignancy. The Towers were destroyed by Terrorists ... when? 9/11/2001? And I see this scene in December 2005. There's sort of a sense of both déjà vu (in the movie ... set in 1973-74) and flashback (for the viewer of the movie in 2005) that is remarkably moving from my angle.<br/><br/>All in all, it seems that Spielberg was indeed trying to make a political ""statement"" in this movie. But if you can ignore that and focus on this as a great flick with plenty of action and intrigue, hey, I think it's a great addition to this genre."
"whiteage","8","5","9","2 January 2006"," Munich72 Real World, Spielberg's Film
","There's ""Munich"" the film, and Munich Olympics 1972 the event and its real-world aftermath; getting the two together would be impossible under the best of circumstances. <br/><br/>For those who weren't there - the World in 1972 - or unaware of Israel's various policy responses to threats, conflict and terrorism since 1948, Spielberg's powerful dramatization of the Black September terrorist Israeli hostage taking and tragically bungled ""rescue"" attempts by German federal and regional government cannot but generate powerful emotional and political responses. <br/><br/>His sub-text, what ""violence"" does to those who seek justice and whether counter-terrorist violence only encourages a continuing cycle of violence, may be right or wrong, effective or ineffective. As a film - exempting Spielberg's over-the-top closing sexual scene - and as art, it has and will continue to provoke an important discussion. One can only hope that discussion's heat throws ""light"" rather than burning everyone involved. <br/><br/>One ( or two ) very important - and it appears reflexively overlooked - reality checks. <br/><br/>No one on the Black September ( terrorist ) side has said they would not repeat the hostage taking, in fact one planner still standing complains Spielberg has slighted his role by not including him! And - perhaps more to the film's probing point and where Spielberg takes off from less disputed fact - no one on the Israeli side, including both ""Avner,"" the Mossad first- among-equals Mossad agent of George Jona's very thoughtful and questioning account, and not Jonas, either, has disagreed with both the counter-terrorism idea or the counter- terrorism actions. <br/><br/>So despite journalist/Israeli military intelligence expert Aaron J Klein's just-published ""Striking Back,"" there's agreement - any ""doubts"" about either the righteousness or the efficacy of that Israeli counter-terrorism while they may have been in the air, in every participant's final judgment the mission was wholly justified. Doubts for discussion, maybe; doubts about efficacy, maybe - but no doubts sufficient to stall or withdraw from completing the counter-terrorism mission. <br/><br/>Secondly, why were the ""beans"" spilled in the first place? <br/><br/>Spielberg's film dramatizes one reason - doubts as to whether counter-terrorism responses in fact become a successive stage of terror, perpetuating the ""cycle"" of violence. But Jonas - and a number of other military intelligence accounts - suggest another, just as old and just as serious, set of reasons. ""Politics,"" general, organizational, internal and just plain personal. Whomever disputes Jonas' account must concede, handling the material in a fair-minded way, those complex political realities. Mossad is no less immune to internal strife than the CIA or KGB.<br/><br/>If some terrorists believed they were ""removed"" by an opposing faction, what was supposed to prevent Avner from bailing when the Hunters not only became the Hunted, but the Israeli support - and funds - became more and more restricted, when the strings became tighter, more controlling? Spielberg gives some credence to this second set of reasons, including concerns about both Avner's family in Israel and his wife - and child - in New York City. But where Spielberg must necessarily sketch these - the fish Spielberg's frying is that first reason - Jonas and others simply have more time, and space, to lay out what for this Reader are more persuasive arguments about how the political devolves into the personal. <br/><br/>While Spielberg worries about the ancient Ends vs Means, the tired, frustrated, frightened foot soldiers lack either the luxury or the means to engage in political philosophy - they signed on for themselves, not their families."

OK, I went to watch this movie with an open mind. But it gets really disgusting. Even though the movie has good photography, a fast pace and some snappy dialog, it is the story and theme itself that makes anyone with half a brain cringe. I am humanistic. The thought of athletes slaughtered like sheep sure brings revolt in me, and sure the terrorists should be punished. But this movie shows the Arabs as only terrorists (when everybody knows that only a few deranged individuals are terrorists in real life, and Arab culture is something so rich that, for example, our math is all inherited from them. But I digress). As I was saying, the whole movie paints Arabs as cardboard villains who ""are only good to be killed"". And the Jews are painted as ""unjusticed people who will take what they deserve"" Oh my, every killer think he is justified in his actions, eh? What better is a man who uses terrorism (even against terrorists). He is as much an assassin as the men he murders. All in all, the whole point and message of the movie is (in the words of one of the characters ""Don't f u c k with the Jews"". As a fact, this movie did lower the opinion I had about Jews as a nation :( They did no better than the terrorists about the Munich regrettable incident, and they now are doing no better than the Nazi propaganda: just that now the Jews are trying to pose as heroes.

"lisnik","8","14","34","7 December 2005"," I have seen it
","I went to a screening last night. Spielberg did a great job of weaving events of Munich with re-imagined events of agents plotting their attacks. Eric Bana's character has a lot of depth and his acting his excellent, plenty of emotion and his range is amazing. What his character goes through not only as a man, but as a man on a mission, with a family, and the allegiance to his country makes his mind go through many tumultuous stages. Various underlying characters do a great job, as members of his team. The next Bond, Daniel Craig's character is a bit showy, Matthieu Kassovitz is virtually unrecognizable, and Ciaran Hinds character remains composed.<br/><br/>As for any stance regarding Jewish/Palestinian comments that Spielberg/Tony Kushner/Eric Rogh make, I think they are taking real events that happened in our lifetime, some of which have to be re-imagined. They realize that peace in this region is still an ongoing process, and who knows when this may occur, but it is something we can wish for. It is interesting that there is dialogue that reflects this ideology, and yet today, the same situation remains in the Middle East."

","taken as just a technical achievement this film was nice and slick eye-candy. Sadly good eye-candy is a great vehicle for effective propaganda. Let's see if I understand the message of this film correctly: Arab nationalism = bad. Jewish nationalism = good. Arab/ Palestinian terrorism = bad. Jewish terrorism = good.<br/><br/>If you doubt the overt racist tone of this film, watch it again and insert ""white, Aryan, or Arab"" every time you hear ""Jew"" and see if you find it acceptable. I believe most people would picket a film depicting the racial or religious superiority of Aryan Christians or Arabs Muslims. A good example is when on character utters the line ""the only blood that matters to me is Jewish blood"". Insert any other race or religion into that sentence and most would call that overt racism.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for Spielberg to give us at least 1 sympathetic Arab character. The only Arabs we see are militant, hateful,reactionary fighters, or pseudo intellectuals who articulate a very simplified version of the Arab/Israeli conflict.<br/><br/>One Spielberg tactic of late seems to be this formula: one of the heroes, an intellectual, is slightly sympathetic to the humanity of the enemy. Said sympathetic character then dies or pays dearly for his foolish sympathies. Message: kill when you have the chance without hesitation. Forgiveness, understanding, and compromise are foolish ideals. Barbaric, ruthless acts are the real mechanisms of justice.<br/><br/>When your message is just blind nationalism, you can twist a film to glorify anything as necessary to preserve the race or homeland. I thought it was particularly disgusting to make an almost messiah type character of Eric Bana as he discusses his situation with his mom. Once again the Holocaust is dragged out to justify the barbaric acts of the films heroes, only in this case our ""messiah's"" message is the cliché ""never again"". This is a shameless effort to tie all of Israel's actions back to the Holocaust and attempt to justify the highest degree of hate, violence, and overt racism by claiming supreme victim status.<br/><br/>I hope people recognize this film for what it is: a slick propaganda film designed to prop up the ongoing Israeli atrocities and vilification of the Palestinian population."

","Before laying out money to see Steven Spielberg's much-hyped Munich, I would urge you to read a recent explanation in the Wall Street Journal as to why people who support Israel are outraged by Hollywood's latest attempt to undermine the struggle against Muslim terrorism.<br/><br/>The movie, surprisingly, characterizes terrorists more sympathetically than the Israelis who combat them. Its historical accuracy is highly dubious. Spurious straw man arguments are put in the mouths of Israelis in support of their actions. A false dichotomy is created between supposed Jewish ideals and Israeli behavior, as if it were a tenet of the Jewish faith that they should passively let their enemies slaughter them. The movie's hero ends up turning his back on Israel, and regarding the Mossad as the enemy.<br/><br/>In an apparent effort to support the bizarre reasoning of some who seem to regard terrorism as a natural and legitimate response to our response to it, the butchering of Israeli athletes that sets the story in motion is put at the END of the movie. Evidently, the intent is to disorient viewers as to cause and effect, leaving a subconscious impression that Israel's punishment of the Palestinian killers is the only thing that made them kill in the first place.<br/><br/>Tony Kushner, who was brought in to rework the original screenplay, considers the birth of the state of Israel to be ""a historical, moral, political calamity,"" the policy of the Israeli government to have been ""a systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people,"" and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to be an ""unindicted war criminal."" Little wonder, then, that there was little, if any, pre-release publicity attached to this project.<br/><br/>Be warned: Spielberg (aka The Maestro), for all his God-given talent, has produced the most expensive anti-Isreali political statement in the history of the Middle East. He's apparently forgotten that Israel is presently surrounded by nations and ideologies that pray daily for guidance on how best to complete what Hitler began.<br/><br/>NEVERTHELESS, this is a beautifully shot, brilliantly acted film. My Chicago homeboy, Janusz Kaminski, gives yet another example of why he is arguably the greatest cinematographer in film history. Bana & Rush are again very compelling, as are the myriad Isreali & Sabra actors featured here.<br/><br/>Truly, I regard The Maestro as the preeminent storyteller of modern film. As such, my disappointment aside, I'll again be first in line to see what he comes up with next."

","This movie is just about killing, killing in a rush, jumping from scene to scene, like the director is in a rush to show how this evil killer called avner manage to kill so many, the more the better. I was surprised to see the director was Spielberg. This must be without a doubt his worst movie. What is the point of this terrible movie? are we suppose to feel good and in the same side for this mercenaries who only know how to commit murder? Are we suppose to feel sympathy for this professional killers? Is this movie telling us that terrorism is OK only when it is perpetrated by the mosad? I would say this movie is about terrorists killing terrorists. There is no difference here between the mosad or their mercenaries and the palestiniam terrorists. Spielberg thought otherwise by the look of it. This film is highly offensive and disrespectful with the victims of terrorism worldwide."
"noralee","10","6","12","10 January 2006"," A Literate, Intelligent, Emotional Thriller About Morality Amidst Political Murder
","""Munich"" is the first time that Steven Spielberg has combined all his story telling talents to serve a literate script. <br/><br/>It certainly seems as if Eric Roth's early draft outlined the basic plot while surely it was Tony Kushner, in his first for-hire screenplay, who added in the extensive Yiddishkeit, Talmudic discussions and moral angst. The dialog also refers to the meaning of ""home"" and the Middle East, as he did in his recent play ""Homebody/Kabul"" (let alone, of course, ""E.T.""). The film follows virtually the same themes and emotional trajectory as the recent Israeli completely fictional ""Walk on Water."" In both films, the sins and merits of the parents are passed on as responsibilities to the next generation that we know will lead to the nihilism of suicide bombers.<br/><br/>The opening montages of the playing out of the 1972 Olympic hijacking smoothly edits together real broadcasts with recreated perspectives from around the world as sportscasters were drawn into horrific breaking news. The hair, clothes and production design, and particularly the evocative pop music including multilingual covers of American hits, seamlessly consistently maintain the period. These images are a continuing almost dream-like leit motif throughout the film as the story plays out, so that all sides know why they fight yet literally starts blurring their moral differences. Ironically, these images reinforce why terrorism is successful at drawing the world's attention while generating its own continuing cycle of revenge. <br/><br/>With different characters schematically representing different points of view and philosophies, the motley-accented international cast creates mostly individual people, from the Israeli government apparatchiks to the gathering of the diverse Jewish team of incongruous action heroes to glimpses of other terrorists, and they spend a lot of time having midrashic debates over home-cooked meals.<br/><br/>The film is anchored by a brilliant Eric Bana as ""Avner"" who wrenchingly goes, Jack Ryan-like, from an intelligence analyst to active field agent, but then more -- to personal revenger to anguished post-traumatic-stress syndromed paranoid with haunted eyes. (It is a shame that he's not getting remembered at award time, but it has been a great year for lead actors.) I enjoyed the irony of his character posing as a German, particularly to gain access to ideologues who help the Baader-Meinhof Gang, with Germany serving as a locus for international terrorist planning, whether Basques' E.T.A. or I.R.A. etc., then as it did with the 9/11 plotters (and portended further at the end with the view of the pre-9/11 NYC skyline).<br/><br/>The formation of the team is freighted with other ironies as well - Daniel Craig with his accent, body language and voice creates another unique character in his career as a steely, unreflective South African who is solidly single-minded in his goal: ""Don't f*ck with the Jews!"" and can just as easily pretend to be an ANC supporter. Mathieu Kassovitz is marvelously nervous as a toy maker turned bomb maker, and Hanns Zischler is very old world fastidious as an art dealer turned documents forger and team accountant regularly toting up the cost of each kill. Ciarán Hinds disappears into his ruthlessly efficient, gray Mossad bureaucrat, recalling Alec Guinness as George Smiley in another intelligence service in a Cold War with questions (and there's also close-up shot of an umbrella in London that recalls an infamous assassination from that period).<br/><br/>A lot of the film's tension is caught up with their efforts to avoid collateral damage, which, symbolically, gets harder and harder for them to do. It is a bit heavy-handed but very effective for the emotional core of the film that those who feel guilty become the most vulnerable.<br/><br/>Too much in service to the themes and less to credibility are the mercenary information merchants. Ironically, Mathieu Amalric is usually cast in French films as a Woody Allen type, such as in ""Kings and Queen (Rois et reine),"" while Michael Lonsdale, a la his role in ""Ronin,"" as the patriarch of this amoral family business perfectly embodies the European intellectual sang-froid of anarchists with principles available to the highest bidder of the moment, like the information equivalent of Nicolas Cage's gun seller in ""Lord of War,"" that is the detritus of colonialism. But it's as if they are the sole confidential informant in a cop movie, let alone ones who rent the same safe house to opposing terrorists at the same time, for an interlude that simplistically allows for presentation of the PLO's unambiguous position. There's lots of amusing references to hiding behind American dollars, but at that time there would have been plenty of Arab petrodollars available for similar nefarious ends. There's also a Mata Hari side story that goes a bit over the top visually, James Bond-style. This is definitely a hard-R film.<br/><br/>Very unusual for a Spielberg film are the strong, physically dynamic women and ""Avner""s emotional ties to them, from a baby to the tiny grandmotherly Iron Lady Golda Meir. Noted Israeli actresses play ""Avner""s mother and wife: Gila Almagor both provides the inevitable Holocaust resonance and sounds like a Biblical Hannah in telling of her prayers for a son, and Ayelet Zorer, who was also so moving in ""Nina's Tragedies (Ha-Asonot Shel Nina)"" is not the usual wifely appendage but an essential, beautifully sensuous grounding for her tormented husband in mature scenes that are unlike any previous Spielberg film (finally contradicting the ""Dawson's Creek"" critique that there's no sex or romance in his films). But it's an unnecessary production design repetitive element to have the mother's apartment oddly filled with menorahs.<br/><br/>These nuclear family relationships intelligently link ""Munich"" to ""A History of Violence"" as a reflective, geo-political counterpart.<br/><br/>The tight editing of Janusz Kaminski's beautiful and varied cinematography (dark Graham Greene-murky Europe vs. the blinding light of Mediterranean machine guns-and-bikinis Israel) is a continuing subtext in service to what is being said.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is uncharacteristically subdued and is in service to the tension in each scene."
"bobbobwhite","8","6","12","3 January 2006"," Best Spielberg film in a while
","Spielberg's last film had a deficient story patched together with great modern FX and was a failure, even with Tom Cruise in it. Munich was a great story with almost no modern FX. Which film was better? Munich, hands down. Thus, FX alone does not a great Spielberg movie make, contrary to the opinions of many children of all ages who wouldn't know a great story if it came out of a dark closet wearing King Kong's ape suit. ""Show me the action"", they would say. Well, Munich had plenty of action, and plenty of great story too. That's enough for anyone who loves great and authentic(as is possible in a dramatic film) history films as much as I do.<br/><br/>Ahhh, Munich, that Spielberg labor of love so well done overall.....dramatic..... balanced.... well acted.... so aware of historical truths on both sides. Other than needing about 20 or so slow minutes cut out to enhance the pacing and suspense element it was terrific, and scary as hell in places. Spielberg knows better than most how to show the common man in uncommon crisis situations, with that man's warts and incompetences and humanity(or lack of it) bared, and he did it just right here, almost to nerve-wracking, nail-biting excess.<br/><br/>Others have detailed the story to a fare-thee-well, so I won't. Suffice to say, Spielberg ""gets it"" about the Middle East and its conflict history, and shows it in this film. His film told that a thousand years of Islamic-Jewish warfare is not going to be cured by trading lives now, just as it hasn't helped over those many past years. As one Islamic character in the film said.... as long as the Jews have a chunk of Palestine's homeland, the conflict will continue forever until they are gone, every single one. The keyword here is ""homeland"", even the film recognized that, and the Palestinians will stop at nothing until they get it back so they can die at home in peace and glory.<br/><br/>Carve another piece of land from some other country and give it to them instead?....Forget it. Palestinians will never stop until they get their original homeland back. It's ingrained in their religion and culture and they will never stop fighting for it. So, on it goes, endlessly.<br/><br/>Will they get it back under Dub's watch?....No! Will it ever happen?... Arabic people are many and Jews are few and the world has many days left. Jews have had the world's sympathy since WWII so they have prevailed in this war to date, but with time and possibly more sympathetic world leaders to this Palestinian plight, who knows? That's as good an answer as any, and it could happen someday. It's a fickle world and alliances change.<br/><br/>Someday, sometime, endless religion-based killing in the Middle East has to stop. See this film and understand better both sides of this issue. That's Spielberg's point, and I commend him highly for telling it so well."
"priddy_michael","7","6","12","29 December 2005"," Technically a great film but lacked an important human element
","Overall I thought this was a very good movie. Putting the subject matter aside for a moment the photography, casting, acting, direction were superb. Going back to the subject matter I was very curious on how Spielberg was going to handle the bias issue. Too many movies use these themes to cast good vs evil dramas. I thought Spielberg made the grade. Even though this is a long movie, it's wouldn't be long enough to adequately present all sides to the on-going Israeli-Palestian conflict and therefore I didn't expect to be educated on them. Before viewing the movie I assumed that he would present the theme that violence begets violence, a vicious merry go round that never stops. He delivered that message brilliantly. Like some of the other commentators I got emotionally involved where I understood, liked and disliked the partisans from each side. They were right and wrong. Which makes the telling of this story so relevant to the current war in Iraq. Despite the best efforts of the U.S. administration, this is not a good vs evil struggle. Violence is justified to stop violence...that's the insanity that the main character played by Eric Bana comes to learn.<br/><br/>I did have a few problems with the script. The 5 man Israeli team spend up to 2 years with each other, sleeping, eating, planning, socializing and killing together. They are a family unit. However we see very little of how they related to each other and feel about each other. There are moments of joking around, scolding and venting but nothing below the surface. Secondly, after Eric Bana and Daniel Craig fail in their last mission in Spain, Daniel Craig's character disappears. What became of him? Lastly I need to speak about Eric Bana. I hope he receives a Leading Actor nomination. An Australian actor (despite the unfortunate Hulk movie) he played his character brilliantly. Dropped his Aussie accent and mannerisms, and used very real American, Israeli and German accents and speech patterns"
"Ethabell","10","6","12","26 December 2005"," The best this year
","This film deserves to be seen. Eric Bana is amazing, his entire demeanor morphing before one's eyes during the course of the movie. And because it is a riveting film with a talented cast it seems shorter than its 2 hour and 44 minute actual length.<br/><br/>The movie is fair,fair, fair to both sides of the argument because surely, there are no easy answers. Both the Palestinians and the Jews are sincere and true to their respective cultures (their religions do not play a significant role in the film) and logical in their reasonings and yet both can be immoral and brutal in their methods. Thanks to Spielberg and the excellent screenwriters, this film offers us both sides of the most complex Semitic, geographic, and, ultimately, religious dilemma in the history of the modern world. And, thankfully, it never preaches.<br/><br/>Bravo Spielberg, and congratulations for choosing an excellent cast. Kudos to the cinematographer as well."

Intense, heartwarming, shocking, and sad, this movie just doesn't have it all, but it works to it's full potential to achieve one of the finest films I have seen not only in years, but maybe in my lifetime. Spielberg gets criticized for only being able to do well with ""period-pieces"", however, I think that if you can do something extremely well, and has meaning with your religion, hell yeah. Crowning achievement. I look forward to seeing the Oscars. Go Munich."

","I have just recently seen Munich which has impressed me very much not only for its good story but also because of the extraordinary performance of all the actors. Apart from the story itself what Spielberg tells us is an important question not only about the conflict between the Israelites and the Palestinians (despite of the fact that I am not a Jew, I have to declare that my position is in favor of Israel) but also about the human nature. Is it right to take revenge of any kind against all those who have killed our people? He declared his total opposition against the killings of the terrorists because he thinks that violence only creates violence this is why in this movie what happens makes the audience think about the consequences of our acts of revenge. Although I like him very much and think that his words are absolutely beautiful, the reality is that those sport men were brutally killed by a gang of terrorists who were and are still supported by terrorists nations such as Iran which are never condemned in the UNO and nobody did nothing. Israel was right in its actions otherwise all the Arab nations would have tried to exterminate the Jews something that is happening in these days. It was right to kill them because this is not a normal conflict between two nations, the problem is that the Arabs want to destroy Israel and consequently they want the extermination of the Jews population. I support Israel."
"Alieniloquium","7","4","7","25 January 2006"," While not without indulgent faults, ""Munich"" is a well-made thriller and one of Spielberg's best
","Spielberg's ""Munich"" is similar in motive and execution to ""A History of Violence."" Both films explore the need for and result of vengeful violence. In ""Munich,"" however, this is not Spielberg's primary purpose. ""Munich"" is first a thriller and second a social commentary. Spielberg first created a top notch thriller and then draped meaning over it. The result is a highly entertaining and well-written dramatization of the 1972 Munich massacre and subsequent retaliation by Israel topped by poorly construed notions of violence.<br/><br/>As the story is about the retaliation against Black September, the film concisely lays out the events leading up to Israel's decision to assassinate the members of Black September. We then follow Avner, possibly the least likely secret agent in all of Hollywood, and his team as they hunt down their targets. I understand Spielberg's need for historical fidelity, but in the interest of making an entertaining film, he should have embellished Avner and his team's talents. They are the worst assassins ever depicted on the screen. The assassinations are well directed, almost Hitchcockian in suspense, but for almost no purpose since the targets have little to no security. After each job the viewer is left wondering, ""Why did they make that so difficult?"" Despite these minor idiosyncrasies, the film does build suspense quite well, culminating as Avner's team itself is targeted for further retaliation. Eric Bana does well in depicting a father-to-be trying to reconcile his fear and guilt for committing heinous acts.<br/><br/>The kidnapping and murder of the Olympic team is shown repeatedly through flashbacks, with the murders itself shown with extreme gore. As viewers, we are supposed to feel the same need for revenge after the Israel team is murdered. Avner's character is constructed as our surrogate for this vengeance upon Black September, which is possibly why he is depicted as such a family man. Each assassination, however, is shown with the same violence and graphic gore as the murder of the Israeli team itself. This ties the revenge to the original murders, questioning the morality of the acts and serving as visual punishment for the viewer's desire for revenge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Spielberg does not use these concepts as well as Cronenberg does in ""A History of Violence."" Cronenberg uses embarrassment in conjunction with excessive gore, while Spielberg's gore stands alone. And while Spielberg cannot help the time period, ""Munich"" takes place in 1970s Europe, which is visually different enough to make identification with Avner as a surrogate slightly more difficult. Avner's eventual punishment is another of Spielberg's hackneyed ploys; he is slowly driven mad with fear and he remains unhinged even when he returns to his wife and child. Finally, we are left with a shot of the Twin Towers. This is clearly meant to associate Israel's actions with our own vengeance in the wake of 9/11. The association is too late in the film, however. It seems as if it were thrown in as an afterthought to drive his point home.<br/><br/>In his oeuvre, Spielberg instills a sense of optimism in his films, consistently almost to a fault. It, of course, works in some films, such as ""Schindler's List,"" but is awkward in others, like ""War of the Worlds."" In ""Munich,"" a film that could do without optimism, he almost overcomes this need before Avner's apparent sexual catharsis spliced with the final moments of the Israeli team's murder. After this almost perverse scene, Avner seems calm and without his paranoia. Is this really a catharsis and is Avner forgiven for his crimes? Even with this scene and with its misconceived moralization of revenge, ""Munich"" remains as a taut, well-made historical thriller ranking among Spielberg's best."

","after reading previous comments, i am disgusted by the people who watched this movie and saw avner and the four others on their mission as ""the good guys."" i wasn't on anyone's side. what i gained from this movie is an understanding of how deeply rooted the hatred is between israelis and palestinians and how the fighting may never stop. i think this movie showed why the principle of ""an eye for an eye"" is so detrimental to everyone involved. avner and the others went after these terrorists, to find and kill them, but what happened next? all of the people they killed were replaced by even more radical leaders. 3 out of 5 on the team were hunted and killed, and avner was being hunted by the PLO when the movie ended. he was going crazy with fear. ultimately, his mission to kill these terrorists had done nothing but create more death and strife. if the movie had continued, probably all 5 on the team would have been killed, realistically. the movie also showed a personal side to each person the team killed--the man in the hotel who offered avner sleeping pills, the guy in Paris with the little daughter playing the piano, etc--no one in their right mind watching this movie should have been thinking ""yeah! go kill them!"" after meeting each of the terrorists avner and the team were after. i really don't think this movie was biased, or trying to make the viewer see one side as evil and the other as good. it was trying to represent the seriousness and the hopelessness of the situation in israel/palestine."

The dialog is solid, so is the camera work. But what is most important to this movie are the emotions portrayed by the characters. They are put in situations of all sorts including family vs. country and what is right vs. what your country wants from you.<br/><br/>This is clearly Speilbergs cry for peace, and if you want to see a movie full of suspense, good dialog, and social importance, go see Munich."
"virek213","10","4","7","15 January 2006"," What Price Vengeance?
","Steven Spielberg's huge popularity means that he is frequently the target of critics, whether it is for shouldering the blame for the Hollywood ""blockbuster"" trend that started with JAWS, for alleged audience manipulation (as in E.T.), or for the more weighty issues behind SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But nowhere does it seem that criticism has been as fierce as it is with MUNICH. Here he is, the most popular filmmaker in Hollywood, tackling the subjects of terrorism and vengeance with the same consummate skill he tackled with sharks, the Holocaust, and aliens--and here are people slamming him not only for doing so, but for doing so in a way they don't agree with. Why is this? For starters, as the title indicates, he uses as a focal point the murders of eleven Israeli athletes by members of the ultra-violent Palestinian terrorist group Black September at the Summer Olympics in Munich on September 5, 1972, and the response by Israel. Eric Bana is one of five Israeli Mossad agents sent to track down eleven high-ranking Palestinians who are believed to have had a hand in planning the Munich massacre. The purpose of the mission is to send a message once and for all to the Palestinians that Israel will not be intimidated into ceasing to exist as a country. The team goes about their business throughout Europe, though their operations are not the most perfect (which is so often the case in missions of this sort), and are always bloody. Very soon, however, they learn of other Palestinian terrorist acts, including the hijacking of a Lufthansa jet in Germany, and they find themselves not only being the hunters but also being the hunted and the haunted as well. Near the end, after he has moved to New York, Bana openly wonders to his superior (Geoffrey Rush, in an incredibly direct performance) whether they really got the exact ones who plotted the Munich tragedy. It is a question that remains open-ended, as the film ends with a view across the Hudson River to Manhattan and the twin towers of the World Trade Center.<br/><br/>No film about real-life acts of political terrorism will ever satisfy everybody, but Spielberg has come in for some extreme attacks. On the one side are those who criticize his stand as being too pro-Israeli; and on the other are those who feel he gives too much credence to the Palestinian terrorists. The fact is, of course, being Jewish, he is hardly going to go against the state of Israel on anything. But he also sees the troubling ambiguity of the aftermath of Munich in relation to the decades-long Israel/Palestinian conflict and, with respect to what Israel did to avenge Munich, he asks the question: ""What price vengeance?"" How can a mission like the one Bana and his fellow Israelis undertake ever fully satisfy the need for vengeance for Munich without costing a huge price, in terms of human lives lost, and in human souls that are destroyed in the continuous cycle of bloody revenge killings? These are very troubling questions, and I think this is why certain people with extremist views are attacking Spielberg for MUNICH, even with its superb ensemble acting, taut editing, and compelling storyline. A lot of people don't want to deal with that painful reality; nor do they want to deal with the fact that the world doesn't work on a black-and-white/good-guys-and-bad guys level. Spielberg knows the world doesn't operate like that. And the film's final shot of the World Trade towers clearly states that the questions of vengeance and retribution are now being directed at his own country with respect to its war on terrorism, motivated by revenge for 9/11 and the price *that* war is taking on American lives and the soul of the nation.<br/><br/>The consummate skill that Spielberg, his crew, and his cast put into making MUNICH work is what I think will outlast the attacks against the film. This is a film that is a must-see for all those who really care about where our world is headed, and how we deal with the always troubling subject of terrorism."

It doesn't really bring anything new to the central question it purports to explore. Yes, we all know that revenge is an ethically complex issue. We all know that collateral damage is always possible and that guilt is a heavy cross to bear. But the film doesn't really impart anything beyond these simple platitudes. If that's not bad enough, the last third just gets SLOW. And I agree with a previous poster that the ""climax"" scene (wink, wink) is just unbearably ham-handed.<br/><br/>It's too bad, because the subject matter is so relevant to today's political situation.

Likewise, Munich is a sick, defeatist, self-loathing reaction to the War On Terror.<br/><br/>-----------------------SPOILERS FOLLOW---------------------------------<br/><br/>For that reason, the first Arab mercilessly assassinated by the Israeli hit squad seems as harmless as Harpo Marx. Yet, the most sickening point in this travesty is the mythical arms dealing, information swapping Frenchy family that ""does not deal with governments."" GIVE ME A BREAK!

Eisenstein - this is NOT.<br/><br/>Spielberg wants us to appreciate Avner as some kinda antihero character who does the dirty deeds, but feels so guilty about it. His character arc climaxes with the realization that both sides are equally evil or misguided.

"Pasafist","9","5","10","23 December 2005"," MUNICH is a powder keg
","MUNICH is a powder keg. It is a film that is so steeped in controversy not because of its content, but because of who made it. The most famous director in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, has crafted a film that is so brave not because of its content but because of its point of view. This film is about Israel and it's ongoing conflict with the people of Palestine, and it doesn't paint a pretty picture of anyone involved.<br/><br/>In 1972 thousands of athletes and spectators poured into Munich to celebrate and compete in another Olympics. All was well until 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a terrorist faction called Black September. All 11 men were killed. In its aftermath the Israeli government hired five Mosad agents to go undercover and kill the 11 men who were responsible.<br/><br/>The film follows Avner (Eric Banner) the leader of this group on his mission to get revenge for the Munich Olympics. Avner is a regular guy placed in a position that at first seems justifiable. But as the body count gets higher and he finds himself justifying more and more killings, we the audience are left wondering if the ends really do justify the means. Were the Black September terrorists really evil and uncaring or were they men without voices trying to make somebody listen? Is revenge really the best weapon? Does killing those responsible end the real violence? MUNICH poses questions and leaves the audience to sort out the answers.<br/><br/>MUNICH is not a film about the battle between good and evil. It's a film about evil fighting an even worse evil. It's about human futility and about how vengeance doesn't solve a problem it only makes it worse. It's about corrupt Nationalism and corrupt ideals that turn good people into monsters and the corrupt governments that penalize the monsters they've created. But at the heart its about the regular guys who are fighting turf wars with regular guys and how given the right circumstances we all have the potential to do evil masquerading as good.<br/><br/>And yet trying to nail down the intentions of Munich is quite difficult. You certainly can't cheer Avner. He's no hero, but you also can't fault him for his outrage. His countrymen were killed senselessly, why shouldn't his people retaliate? Why shouldn't the terrorists pay for their sins? The major flaw and yet its strongest attribute it that it fails to take a side. It fails to define just what evil is. It allows the audience to watch from a distance and doesn't attempt to drown the audience in political correctness. But can these warring factions both be right? Is there ever an end? Where does America fit into the story? Does America's support of the state of Israel make us culpable? The film shies away from those answers (except in the final shot that speaks far more than any in this film). Is that a good thing? I don't really know, what I do know is that this is the kind of film that will put people on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict on the defensive. If you think strongly one way or the other MUNICH will anger you.<br/><br/>I applaud Spielberg for the brave choice of choosing an Israeli as the focal point of the story. If this had been about the Palestinians it would have been so easy (at least for me) to accept the Arab people as the villain and the Jewish people as victims. But at the end aren't both sides Victim's of each others misguided Nationalism? It's easy to paint terrorists as the evil party. But good and evil are never black and white and sometimes bad things happen on both sides. But revenge never gets us anywhere, and Munich shows us characters that are so normal becoming Monsters. They may be justified in their anger but are not helping the situation. This is a bold position to take.<br/><br/>MUNICH is not a black and white film and it should be dissected. IT should be discussed and it should be a lesson to those who see the issues of Israel's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger. The ongoing tensions in the middle east will not be solved by American guns but by the people of the middle east putting down the guns and asking for forgiveness from each other. Would that ever happen? Will the fighting ever end? Not until someone can fix the darkness in every human heart.<br/><br/>Post-script: After writing this review I must say that the film MUNICH is inspired by actual events and that my comment are not meant to be skewed either right or left. The current problems in the Middle East are numerous and complicated and I myself only know very little. The above review are my thoughts after viewing the film MUNICH and not on the people of ISRAEL and/or PALESTINE. I believe they both have a right to exist and be defended, and I pray for peace in that region."
"ronin98syu","4","11","28","22 December 2005"," Disappointed
","What disappointed me the most was that the director mishandled the subject and made it into an action/thriller film rather than a thought-provoking drama. Terrence Malick would have been a wonderful choice. Throughout the whole film, I kept wondering if I were watching Munich or Mission: Impossible and Godfather flicks.<br/><br/>I also had problems with Mr. Spielberg's portraying of violence on the screen. Obviously, he didn't believe the philosophy of ""less is more"" as he depicted the killings full on. Most of the adult audience gasped whenever a violent deed was committed on the screen. I didn't think that thoughts rather than fears were provoked as we were wondering when, where and how the next one was going to hit the screen.<br/><br/>The film score also presented a problem to me. It reminded me so much of Schindler's List. I guess that Mr. William ran out of ideas and simply recycle his old scores.<br/><br/>The climax at the end (intercutting of a ""domestic event"" and the Munich tragedy) was really uncalled for and tasteless. It was disrespectful to draw such parallel.<br/><br/>However, I find Mr. Spielberg was courageous setting the tone of the film, neither Pro- Israel nor Anti-Palestine. The question of ""does retribution or an-eye-for-an-eye policy toward peace really work"" was constantly brought up through out the film. 30 years after the Munich tragedy, we all know the result (albeit it's a sad truth). <br/><br/>I only wish Mr. Spielberg made this film the way Terrence Malick made The Thin Red Line: subtle, philosophical yet thought-provoking."
"seperite","1","9","22","25 December 2005"," In sum
","There are, thus, two central arguments advanced by Spielberg in this film (each of which is repeated ad nauseum, neither of which is conveyed with the slightest bit of subtlety). The first, that violence begets only violence and nothing more, is simple-minded and pointless criticism, especially in light of the fact that he offers no viable alternative to exacting revenge on your enemies for the pain and suffering they cause you. At no time does Spielberg suggest that say, dialogue would be more effective, nor does he indicate that it was ever an option (it wasn't, not with the Arabs, not at that time in history, and anyone who thinks otherwise is not up to snuff with 1970s geopolitics.) One wonders, if Spielberg's own family had been among the 11 athletes mercilessly snuffed out, would he still have advocated passivity and non-reaction?<br/><br/>The other argument is the contrast drawn between Judaism and the State of Israel. Two seemingly parallel ideals, often perceived as synonymous to the outside mind. But in Spielberg's weltanschhaung, one is virtuous, the other is but a pale reflection, the antithesis of the values the first strives to uphold. The state's raison d'etre, he argues, is only self-survival, at any cost, at any compromise of its own values, and it shuns anything remotely, traditionally Jewish (read: ""good""). This argument is used by the most vicious, virulent anti-Semites, who cloak their hateful, senseless criticism of Israel by distinguishing between the 'nazi-like' character of their state (in their view), and Judaism, which is pure and righteous. By the 'revolutionaries' who claim that they support every minority's right to self-determination, but when it comes to the Jews, they should be condemned to the same wandering and lack of independence that caused millennia of pogrom, inquisition, holocaust...<br/><br/>The primary figure responsible for ensuring that the world never forgets what happened to the Jews in the Holocaust, in artistic and literary bed with the same murderers and defamers who would slaughter the Jews through the stroke of their pen? For shame."

","If a movie is based around a real event then it should be faithful to that event and all associated events. After watching this movie I was left wondering why Spielberg chose to change history. First hand accounts are available but he chose to ignore that reality and substitute his own. These assassinations were done professionally and as a means of prevention. I was disgusted at how the Mossad agents were portrayed as morally conflicted amateurs. The real life leader of this team has repeatedly stated that he takes great pride in what he did for his country. I see it as a grave injustice that the brave actions of these men was slighted by an ignorant director for what seem to be pacifist political reasons.<br/><br/>I used to enjoy Dreamworks films.

The film skims that issue but never really delves into it.<br/><br/>Instead, it is a rather boring version of Mission Possible. No real techno stunts or tension. Very predictable and rather boring.

"Kleister-Meister","7","3","5","21 September 2010"," Affecting, dramatic thriller with unbalanced point of view
","""Munich"" is Steven Spielberg's thriller about the Israeli act of reprisal against Palestinian assassins for the murder of 11 participants in Munich's Olympic Games of 1972. Or let's better say it is based on it. Most things in the movie were invented by Spielberg to create a thriller for cinema, and he was successful. It is a thrilling story about five men who fight for their country. Just to realize, that in the end they all made everything even worse. That is the message of the movie, and it is a good message: revenge doesn't help, but it makes the situation worse. But the movie has some problems with being unpolitical. Too often the Israelis are shown as the insentient evil killers and their Palestinian victims are people, who appear to be nice and not very cruel. After some time you have the feeling it is an anti-Israeli movie. OK, not really that drastically, but the balance is somehow missing. Furthermore I think it was not intelligent of Spielberg to choose an important historical event with strong political background for a thriller that ends up being not correct in its historical background. Together with the imbalanced presentation of Israelis and Palestinian people, it is dangerous for people who don't know what really happened in 1972. I think many people who saw that movie still believe that it was a correct movie and that the Israelis are the ""evil"" persons. And that is the big problem about this otherwise really great film. Movies about an event that really happened and which are of historical and political importance shouldn't be reduced to a thriller for entertainment, if they don't show the truth.<br/><br/>It was somehow hard to find an adequate conclusion for ""Munich"". I think the best I can say is: The movie is great, it is thrilling, sad and has a good message, BUT: Please read up the historical background before watching it, or at least don't take the movie to seriously in its correctness."
"mkham6","Null","3","5","15 June 2006"," Powerful masterpiece on the horror of war, risks of vengeance, and costs of killing
","June 14- The ambiguity and confusion of counter-terror terror has never been so accurately portrayed- nothing ever goes exactly as intended, and the firefights and bombing scenes are very realistic and harrowing. This actually shows the effect of a machine gun ripping through a human body, not the TV cartoon violence of thousands of shots without ever hitting someone. The killing of the gorgeous Dutch seductress assassin (a Montreal Naomi Watts type) is one of the most horrible ever displayed. ""Such a waste,"" she says as she's killed. The shadow war of retaliatory killings unfold as regular Palestinian terrorist events happen in the background, sometimes in apparent retaliation (vaguely remembered from my semi-youth).The Munich massacre was searingly and relatively accurately depicted. The incredible moral quandary of becoming what you hate, and are warring against, is vividly displayed and has immediate application to America, where our Bike Boy President and his nitwit neocons are disemboweling the Bill of Rights, sanctioning torture of innocents, and lying us into a conflict of faiths that could last generations.<br/><br/>Munich is based on a semi-discredited 1984 book: Vengeance, which already produced a 1986 movie: The Sword of Gideon. ""Munich"" doesn't claim strict historical accuracy. Many of the Israeli assassination targets had little or nothing to do with Munich; amazingly the alleged mastermind Abu Daoud(who was shot 6 times by Israelis but survived) claims the unwitting financier of the Munich kidnappings was Mahmoud Abbas- current Palestinian Authority President. Much confusion exists over whether the remaining 3 terrorists were later killed by Israeli hit squads or not- 2 may have been, but at least one was alive in 1999 for a documentary One Day in Sept.<br/><br/>Spielberg addresses the book controversy at the beginning of the DVD, saying ""Vengeance"" was attacked but never discredited. He does avoid the most atrocious event of the Mossad vendetta- the killing of the wrong man in a street in Norway, which publicly outed the whole plot. The Palestinians aren't cardboard cutouts, in the most impossible scene PLO gunmen and the Israeli hit squad share a safe-house after a long standoff (""ETA- Basque!"", scream the Mossad men). After, Eric Bana and a PLO guy argue about Palestine and the Palestinian has the same motivations- honor, homeland, family, stopping them from killing us. No way they wouldn't make them for Israelis, though.<br/><br/>According to a new book, Striking Back, the tragedy in the 1972 Olympics was the result of incompetent, pompous, cowardly German officials. It was run by blithering blow hard Bavarian bureaucrats, who because of the German Constitution, had almost complete autonomy- nothing of the rescue was run by the national German Gov.- it was all Bavarian and Munich police, who had no anti-terrorist training. In fact, there was no such thing in demilitarized Germany- no SWAT, no special forces, no anti-terrorists. The top Israelis who flew in were ignored and abused- their offer of a counter-terrorist squad rejected. Because they had no experience at all with Germany, because of..... the past (only 27 years from the death camps), they thought the Germans would run the rescue with their usual devastating efficiency and effectiveness. They couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>First the Munchkens had a group of assault cops dressed on track suits assemble on top of the Israeli building- in full view of TV cameras airing footage to the Palestinians. Forced to retreat there, they sent the terrorists and captives by 2 helicopters to a military airfield, where a 727 was supposed to take them Cairo, but an ambush by sharpshooters was actually planned. 6-10 Munich police dressed as crew simply bailed out of the plane while the helicopter was in flight without telling anyone- it was suicidal, they thought. They were probably right- they still were wearing their police pants with Lufthansa jackets. They thought there were only 5 hijackers; when there were 8 (4 were employees at the Olympics); they had only 5 marksmen there out of 29 in the area, they had no proper searchlights, no night vision gear or scopes, no radios, no generator power, no armored cars, no forces or plans to storm the plane if things went bad.<br/><br/>""Later it was discovered that one of the snipers never fired a shot, and yet another sniper was positioned directly in the line of friendly fire, without any protective gear""-Wikipedia They just opened fire- killing 3 terrorists- and commencing an hour and a half firefight. The remaining terrorists quickly knocked out the 3 light stands with grenades, so snipers were firing in the dark. The Chermans refused to storm the plane, and insisted on waiting for armored cars. When they appeared, however, the hostage takers, realizing the game was up- blew up one helicopter with hogtied hostages with a grenade, and wiped out the rest with machine gun bursts. The Germans did kill 2 more hijackers after the massacre; 3 survived and were released 2 months later when Black September hijacked a Lufthansa jet. They were flown to Libya for a heroes welcome. German firefighters refused to go in and put out the fire even when the terrorists left- one hostage died of smoke inhalation.<br/><br/>To their credit, German officials did offer to exchange themselves for the Israelis, or an infinite amount of money, and one cop was killed in the shootout. Somehow the story got promulgated that all the hostages were safe, and Israelis and much of the world wept in relief. Then, like in the West Virginia mine disaster, they wept much more. The good Bavarian burghers stonewalled the Israeli families for decades, denying the existence of any documents about the case, giving them nothing in info or compensation (Israel also did nothing) until 2002. Finally- in 2004, they offered $114K to each of the 36 family members, now only 27. Disgraceful.<br/><br/>Truly a masterpiece, and a film that will have you thinking, and remembering- long after you see it."
"lee_eisenberg","7","3","5","12 February 2006"," ever a loaded issue
","OK. We should all know by now that the situation in Israel/Palestine is a loaded issue: no matter what you say about it, someone's bound to take offense. In the post-September 11 world, it would seem virtually impossible to take a balanced look at terrorism.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""Munich"" manages to do so. Focusing on some Israeli agents given the assignment of killing the Palestinians who assassinated the Israeli Olympic team in 1972. Led by Avner (Eric Bana), they travel all over Europe to track down the men. But after a while, Avner begins to have misgivings about the whole mission: every time you kill a terrorist, you create another.<br/><br/>The movie also lets us hear the Palestinian side. One man explains that the Palestinians have been a displaced people for over twenty years. Of course the Zionists claim that they never had a country to begin with.<br/><br/>So overall, I will assert that Steven Spielberg has made an acceptable movie."

","The Munich massacre always fascinated me as a young boy. When it happened I was too young remember it but when I got a little older I read about it and it became very interesting to me. This brilliant film directed by Steven Spielberg deals with the aftermath of the incident and how revenge took place. You probably already know the story so I'm not going to spend my time writing a review about the plot but about the film itself. It's an astonishing piece of film-making with powerful performances throughout and amazing direction. There are scenes in the film that are brutal and hard to watch, there is no doubt about that, but Spielberg doesn't let this flaw his movie at all. I am glad Munich has been nominated for Oscars this year but I am disappointed with the fact that Eric Bana has not been nominated. He delivers a sensational, hard-hitting turn as Avner and he is an actor of pure quality which has yet to be truly discovered in the Academy's eyes. Overall Munich is a devastating but excellent film of violence, revenge, betrayal, war and passion which is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's best. A remarkable picture."
"Jay_Exiomo","9","3","5","8 February 2006"," Über Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" depicts the events starting from the assassination of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Mossad worker Avner (Eric Bana) is called to lead a group of five - getaway man Steve (new Bond Daniel Craig), cleanup man Carl (Ciarán Hinds), forger Hans (Hanns Zischler), and bomb maker Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) - and avenge the massacre by hunting down and killing those behind the Black September attack. Aiding them from tracking the terrorists who have scattered across Europe and the Middle East is an informant named Louis, even as they find themselves targeted of assassination.<br/><br/>What is vengeance's worth? When is it going to end? In every war, those questions are easily generated yet hardly answered. That is, in essence, what Spielberg's latest film is about. Through its building of tension, Spielberg presents the themes of truths and paranoia through a group of hired killers, who, find themselves hunted as well. Sure there were controversies but that's enough about it.<br/><br/>The film itself is a visual delight. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, a staple of Spielberg films, sets most of the film in a dreamy setting with warm tones and low contrast (I am reminded of my ""sunsoft"" filter), while the score of John Williams, another Spielberg favorite, works superbly in many scenes as well. <br/><br/>It's not the best film of the director, though, as there were times the movie feels slow and lags at times. But the portrayal of every murder and assassination especially during the tense opening scene, and the flashbacks showing the brutal killings of the athletes, is altogether stunning. It is this force and soul that carries the film.<br/><br/>The actors portraying the members of the group are superb, Ayelet Zorer is brilliant as the Avner's wife, and Mathieu Amalric brings a sense of fear to his character Louis. The movie, however, obviously belongs to Bana. The former Hulk brilliantly showcases his emotional intensity and almost every scene works with Bana on screen.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is a gripping film that portrays the morality of the event in an unobtrusive way. It isn't perfect but you have to give it to Spielberg for having the guts to film it, and doing it in a way only he probably can."
"sunraider","7","3","5","21 January 2006"," Good as a thriller
","This film is a thriller combined with a message film. As the former it succeeds brilliantly; I was riveted during the run-up to and execution of every, well, execution. I loved the details that we were shown and the fact that these events weren't rushed. But I felt the film dragged somewhat whenever it veered into delivering the ""message."" I found the lead assassin's home life uninteresting and too much time was spent following that main character's personal life after he came in from the cold. Throughout the film I kept wanting to know more about how the Israeli government viewed the operations; the end part would have been the time to explore that aspect. Since the film is only ""inspired by real events,"" there's no reason the director couldn't have inserted some scenes showing high officials debating the merits of the operation upon its conclusion. Surely there must be some scholarship or rumor about this aspect of the decision to go after the Olympic terrorists. I also felt the prominence of the ""message"" seemed to make the lead characters less interesting than the minor ones, such as the elegant Louis and his ""Papa"", who are delicious to watch as they have no scruples. A little bit of doubt would creep into anyone's mind who does the kind of job these men did, but too much doubt makes the characters seem weak and indecisive. All throughout the film I enjoyed the characters who seemed to know exactly what they were doing and didn't care what all the consequences were, be they the shadowy information brokers, the Mossad handler (Geoffrey Rush) or the terrorists like Ali. Despite some of these characters only brief appearances, they were the ones I was intrigued by. It's no surprise that of the five assassins I enjoyed Daniel Craig the most, even though I'd see any film with Eric Bana. Overall an excellent thriller weakened by extraneous messages."
"cheers-2","8","3","5","17 January 2006"," Munich - A Review and a Learning Experience
","""It costs dearly, but home always does,"" said by Mathieu Amalric who played Louis in Steven Spielberg 'Munich' is all telling and should have been the bi-line for this film.<br/><br/>Entering the theatre I knew nothing of the subject. I was born in 1974 and have literally never heard a single thing about this tragic event. Perhaps that disabled my experience, perhaps it assisted me in watching from a fresh perspective, I am not sure. Not being a historian by any means and not being well-educated in the plights of our fellow humans on the other side of the world, this movie taught me an abundance of what I should have already learned years ago.<br/><br/>Spielberg, being an obvious Jewish supporter, I thought this work would have been much more biased. Instead he beautifully and intellectually demonstrated that all involved are human at their very core and are all simply fighting out of loyalty and love of home. Neither side was portrayed as monsters, heartless terrorists or simple assassins. We, as spectators, were able to sympathize with the entire situation.<br/><br/>This movie was phenomenally acted, beautifully written, and the direction was executed in Spielberg's usual magical essence.<br/><br/>I believe that this world was meant to have no boundaries. We were all meant to have a home, and that home is simply earth. Land is that on which we walk, I do not believe it is what makes us who we are. So much torment, death, and destruction in the name of Land, Home, and God. It is so sad when what we all need to realize is that belongs to each of us in our hearts, not below our feet."
"trevor-hall-1","8","3","5","11 January 2006"," Spielberg delivers again
","Steven Spielberg delivers another fine movie to add to his impressive repertoire. He captures the 1970s feel with clever use of archive footage, and mixes this brilliantly with recreated footage. The film grabs its authenticity from the simple ordinariness of the assassination team. There is no 'day of the jackal'-type reporting, just a group of people gathered together to do a job. Admittedly Bana plays his role well but for me, Geoffrey Rush steals the show. Every scene that he's in, he dominates. A fine performance. This is without doubt a war film, and one that eloquently shows us both the futility of war and the shifting nature of it too. Perhaps it's an indictment to man's efforts in the region that we seem hardly to have moved on at all when it comes to peace and tolerance between these two nations. As usual, Spielberg gives me food for thought for many days."

The film pretty much sticks to the book, though it skips Avner's early Mossad recruitment and training to go straight to the action. Also, one other Israeli covert op that actually happened are added to the script, which enhance the storytelling.<br/><br/>While some Palistinian perspectives are given, and the commonality of mankind is stressed, there is also a strong message of the determination of the state of Israel to survive.<br/><br/>I am sure that some will disagree. I am not a Jew, but I think that this film presents certain realities that must be confronted. Every nation thinks it is morally superior to it's enemies, Israel probably more than most. But the simple fact is that certain things need to be done for survival. Those who have faced the elephant know that. Everybody else is just jerking off.<br/><br/>SPOILERS! Those who have read the book know that when Avner refused to return to ""active duty"", the Israeli government jerked all of the accumulated salary out of the bank account they had been ""keeping for him"".

","After delivering two disappointing flicks(Terminal/War of the worlds),Spielberg is finally back in his usual form.He is best at dramatic and intensely realistic films.And Munich is just the film that shows why he is the best in the industry.<br/><br/>A morality tale about vengeance and its consequences.How one's beliefs destroy another's faith.A powerful shocking drama that leaves a chilling effect on you.<br/><br/>It begins off with an intense situation of hostage takeover,and really gives a feeling what it is like to be taken as a hostage.I was on the edge of my seat ,it shocked me and left me disturbed of how these athletes were put into a horrifying situation and the blood bath that follows.<br/><br/>It's the story of how a group of men struggle to seek their revenge against a group of terrorists who murdered 11 athletes in the early 70's during the period of Olympic games in Germany.They are assigned a mission to hunt down those who were responsible and take them out one by one.But as they begin this perilous mission of vengeance,they no longer become different from their enemies and they themselves are transformed into something close to a terrorist;as all of them lose their soul and the very thing that makes them humane.Their beliefs are challenged.They question themselves for what they're doing.Why are they doing and for what?Are they even doing it for the right reason.As they approach each target ,their worlds are shattered and haunted by the bloody killings that they make.And slowly leading them into horrific consequences.<br/><br/>The characters are all intense.They are men put into situations they rather not be.Every target they approach leaves a shiver to them,and a chilling effect on the audiences.Every target of theirs end up in a blood splattered scene.They slowly realize that what they're doing simply causes more chaos and destruction.But it becomes too late for these men to give up as they are being haunted by all the killings.They fear the world and somehow they're being targeted.And they no longer have their souls.<br/><br/>This is a powerful suspense thriller that takes us a trip throughout Europe,with beautiful locations as a setting.The film is filled with stark realism to every scene.The cinematography really gives the film a docudrama look.A very violently intense thriller that will leave you with fear ,shock,dilemma and perhaps leave you feeling some sympathy for those men who are committed to something they don't really understand.The film poses very provocative questions with controversial remarks.Can there ever be peace?<br/><br/>Spielberg has always been a master when it comes to dark ,unsettling subjects.His approach to serious films is different from those commercial ones.When he arrives at a certain concept he really brings the best out of it.I never admired Spielberg as an artistic filmmaker.To me ,he was more of a moneymaker.But here ,he diminishes his trademarks and gets involved with a very striking subject that surely leads to controversy.I've never seen a Spielberg film this dark or graphically violent.Not even Schindler's List or Minority report were this dark.<br/><br/>I would simply regard this film as his most accomplished and meaningful film since Schindler's List.His most haunting and powerful film yet.Although there is a certain lack of emotion.There is not enough emotional drama than there is dramatic or violent moments.Spielberg seemed to focused more on the act of violence than how these men felt.I mean we don't see them speaking about anything but violence.How each target would be executed.But you could see that they were terrified at all times.Fear was all around them.The very first target they assassinated ,they weren't sure and were nervous about it,they almost bailed.And by the end one after another was being hunted.Avner started to get paranoid,started having nightmares,dilemma's.He was haunted by those deaths he saw and he felt guilty.He doesn't know the right meaning to his actions.Spielberg somehow takes us deep into the minds of terrorists.For once we see how they plan their attacks and bombings,and that gives a cold feeling.Shivers run down your body.<br/><br/>The actors work well together,and only Eric Bana gives a soulful performance.Only his character was broaden.While the rest were perfect in their roles.<br/><br/>Superb camera work ,giving an utterly realistic looks, Stunning in every way.The script was tightly written but the films length could've been shortened.It was simply too long.There was an excellent score to heighten the tension and emotion.<br/><br/>After watching this film,I would never in my wildest imaginations ,dream of becoming a spy or an assassin working for a government or whatever.I always thought it was cool and really fun.But watching this film,I realized that every second of your life is inflicted with fear.You have no control of your mind and you live in fear 24/7.Terror is what all you feel.<br/><br/>This film is an unforgettable,shocking ,unsettling and haunting film.A very flawed masterwork from a man who is widely respected.A very risky move made by Spielberg which has done anything but disappointed.A powerful achievement and he deserves to be praised for this film.<br/><br/>****/5"

","There's so much I want to say about Steven Spielberg's Munich. So much that needs to be said about what the film that he has made. This film that wraps up thousands of years of debate on morality and idealism, layers it with historical reference and atmosphere, and throws on a cautionary tale only to find that there's still more to this film that what meets the eye. I think of Munich not so much like an onion, but a head of cabbage (soft thriller on top but tougher, more bitter moral questions underneath). By the time that we see the final shot, I realize what exactly it is that Spielberg is trying to say.<br/><br/>Munich starts off with the daring heist of the Olympic Village by a terrorist cell of Black September during the 1972 Games. These are not the hard-headed terrorists that we're used to seeing in movies, but kids who are scared but believe they are doing something for ""the greater good"". The film jumps forward in sprinter's bounds through the next few days as we see the media frenzy, the family reactions, and the officials trying to cope with what is going on. Then it is over, the 11 athletes are killed with Jim McKay's epic words ""They're gone"" bringing the pain home.<br/><br/>But the film is interested in the aftermath of tragedy as the gears in Israel shift into reciprocity. ""Forget peace for now."" Golda Meir says to her advisers. They need to show strength, but can't do so with their hands full of blood. That's where men like Avner (Eric Bana) come in handy. He leaves behind his pregnant wife and family to join a secret operation to hunt down 11 ""targets"" that had a hand in orchestrating Munich. He has a team of four others, unlimited funds in a Swiss bank and ""no ties to Israel"", but he better ""keep his receipts"".<br/><br/>For the next few years, they plan a series of hits on their targets, getting better and more violent as they go along. The team isn't used to such cruelty, since none of them are really mercenaries. Even Avner was just a bodyguard before he took the job. Their bomb-maker (Mathieu Kassovitz) is a toy-maker by profession. And they are soon taking deep hard looks at what they are doing. ""We're supposed to be righteous"" one says in a fit of sadness. Even when they aren't shadowed by paranoia, they still convey in conversation they extraordinary difference between what they were and what they are now doing. And with their every success, Palestine hits back, a macabre dance of death as the old guard is being killed off as the new and more vicious guard takes over. And it's even said that the squads might actually be doing the work of the new guard of the PLO so that they can be in control.<br/><br/>But these are only a couple of the complexities of this film. Government and family dynamics are looked at under a scrutinizing microscope. And the deeper down the rabbit hole we go, we realize that if you replaced the word Munich and put in the phrase 9/11, that we have more in common with Israel than we might want to admit. Especially when the last thing we see before fade out is the twin towers in the background, a not-so-subtle reminder of what we are going through right now in our own country.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, this is a massive achievement in casting. There are no Americans in this cast which is headed by Austrailians Bana (in his best performance ever) and Geoffery Rush, British actors Cirian Hinds and Daniel Craig (yes, the next James Bond) and French actor Kassovitz. They perform wonderfully together and alone. They keep action tight and conversation even tighter. It could easily feel like a Sunday school lesson if it weren't for their performances and the dynamo script penned by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth.<br/><br/>For Spielberg, this film has been a long time coming. If you looked at all of his post-9/11 films, you'll see that they have dealt with portions of the traumatic experience. Minority Report deals with our paranoia, while Catch Me If You Can dealt with our loss of innocence playing dangerous games. The Terminal showed us a look at ourselves from the outside with humor and humility. And even the terrible War of the Worlds showed us the emotional impact of terrorism. But this film adds all of these things in and builds a foundation on all of it. We think that this is the worst thing in the world to happen, when all it really did was break us into what goes on to the rest of the world around us. That's really what Spielburg is trying to say.<br/><br/>There's been a lot said about Spielberg concerning his loyalty to the Jewish community and the Middle East. What he's really doing is making everybody think about the situation going on over there. There are no real victims in that struggle because both sides victimize while playing the victim. I cannot comment about the situation any further because I really don't know enough and I don't want to lead anyone to the impression that I do. But what Spielburg is doing is not drawing conclusions, but observing the behaviors of all sides. Look at the scene where our protagonists spend the night in a ""safe house"" with a PLO group. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>All in all, this is the most important film to see and quite possibly a classic in the post-9/11 era. And I can say with some certainty, this is the best film of 2005."

","I know I am running out of adjectives to describe this movie...but I must say I was deeply move by watching it. Firstly, a marvelous performance by Eric Bana (a fresh face instead of the hackneyed big stars). This was exactly what the movie needed for the lead role. Great European locations to give the motion picture a true feel of what was happening; rusty streets, intimidating men with guns, gun shots in the background. All worked out superbly. Most important of all the historical significance. We all know about the German Olympics in 72 and as rightly tagged this is what happened after that. One of the very rare weak points are its a bit long, at times it keeps on lagging. But the ending was brilliant and after watching the whole movie I felt it was worth 3 hours. If you are a movie who wants some fun, this one is not for you. Surely it doesn't bring the chills n thrills which king Kong or Narnia does, but its a class movie-making. And here Spielberg wins over Peter Jackson (there are some who have started comparing them). Overall, a must watch for all who wants to see good movies: 9 stars out of 10."
"mitchum_unscented","1","6","14","1 March 2006"," all the boredom of a documentary without the historical truth
","This film has the feeling of a documentary. It has the kinds of extraneous details and odd occurrences that documentary makers leave in their films to give you a fuller history.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the consensus from historians and intelligence experts seems to be that Munich is neither accurate nor plausible. It neither shows what really happened, nor even a competent construction of what might have happened. So when you strip away the value of learning true history, what is left? Not much.<br/><br/>A large part of the film has to do with mundane details of an intelligence operation. This would be interesting if these details were accurate, but since they aren't, its hard to see why anyone would care about them.<br/><br/>Another major part has to do with the relationship of the main character with a criminal he uses to get the job done. Again, this is all made up, so it doesn't tell you anything historical about how criminals and intelligence agents cooperated in the 70's.<br/><br/>What's left are the ""issues"". The two issues are whether terrorism is moral and whether killing terrorists is moral. But the movie doesn't really bring any new ideas to the debate. It doesn't even do a good job of exploring the obvious ideas.<br/><br/>If you are willing to accept that this film will teach you nothing factual about the history, nor will it explore the politics, but are hoping for at least an interesting story, you won't find it. As far as revenge movies go, this one is totally boring.<br/><br/>I wish all the theaters that showed ""Munich"" had instead shown ""Walk on Water,"" an Israeli film about a modern Mossad assassin who kills terrorists. ""Walk on Water"" never claims to be anything but fiction, but it explores the issues of justice, revenge, and morality with more truth than ""Munich"" does. ""Walk on Water"" also has real characters and a good story, both of which ""Munich"" lacks.<br/><br/>""Walk on Water"": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352994/"

Moreover, those that live by the sword find it hard to escape the life they've led.<br/><br/>But on a cinematic level, the acting and the screenplay were excellent.

More on that later... Now i know that it has been about a year since i saw the movie but to this day i am still haunted by the effects of this film. Not only did i lose my 10 dollars for the ticket (which is a given) but i also lost over 2 hours of my time, my dignity, and respect. I am cut off indefinitely amongst my peers from ever picking out a movie due to my choice to drag them along to Munich. The major complaints about this movie is that it had no plot...and i mean no plot. There were vultures hovering around the theater the movie was so dead. After watching it and forcing myself to stay through it since i paid 10 dollars i now know that Eric Bana(who was once of my favorite actors) envisions cars blowing up and other violence of that nature during sex, and i also know how many ceiling tiles there are at my local theaters because looking up and counting had a better plot, and was more exciting than the movie. Also on a lighter note I'm not sure if this is accurate but i wasn't quite sure that the U.S. Olympic team was responsible for letting the terrorists into the Olympic complex enabling them to kidnap the Israeli athletes. What it basically comes down to is that i was tricked into seeing a movie that i and I'm sure millions of other people (including an angry crowd that left the theater with me) believed that this movie was actually about the historical and plot filled drama of the events that happened during the kidnapping and raid during the 1972 Olympics and not about the nothing that happened after wards."

","I have, for a long time, followed the incident that occurred at the Munich Olympics, so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard this film would be made. By all accounts, it should have been great: good actors, a compelling story and gut-wrenching footage of the actual event. But when the story got handed over to Eric Roth and Steven Spielberg, any chance the film had to succeed was snatched away. Spielberg should stick to ""B"" movies, instead of trying ineffectually to deal with delicate matters. The script is shallow and ridiculous, polished over with a thin veneer of trying to display both sides, when it really has a single and distinct point of view. It is even worse, though, by trying to deny this. While there are some scenes that are cinematographically beautiful, most are boring or stacked with hilariously obvious ""subtle meaning."" The film goes on too long, drags, and is overly episodic. The actors are given nothing to work with (only Jeffrey Rush shines in short scenes) and the film is so blunt and heavy handed you can almost feel them squirming through the scenes (especially in one scene between Bana and his wife near the end). One of the worst films I can think of: muck masquerading as a masterpiece (far worse than the admitted muck of even Uwe Boll). If you want to know a truly terrible film, this is worth a watch. Otherwise, I would avoid this offensive mess all together."
"eichelbergersports","7","11","31","16 December 2005"," Spielberg's 'Munich' flawed but thought-provoking
","Director Steven Spielberg is probably going to take heat from both the Palestinians and Israelis for his latest film, a retelling of the events following the hostage tragedy at the 1972 Olympics in West Germany.<br/><br/>He'll take much more from the Israeli side, I'll wager, as many may see this effort as more of an attack on that state's handing of the terrorist problem, and equating its efforts as just as bad as the original crimes committed against it. But being Jewish, perhaps Spielberg has a better angle on the issue.<br/><br/>It is nevertheless a hard-hitting, uncompromising look at how Isreal's secret service (Mossad) dealt with the members of the Black September group which kidnapped and ultimately murdered nine Jewish hostages during the '72 games in Munich.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (""Troy"" ""The Hulk"") is Avner Kauffman, the reluctant army officer forced to go undercover in Europe to exterminate (with extreme prejudice) 11 Arabs thought to be associated with the Black September organization. He is personally asked to take this mission upon himself by none other than Israeli Prime Minister Golda Mier (Lynn Cohen, ""The Station Agent""). He even leaves his pregnant wife, Ayelet July Zurer, behind for love of country  or vengeance.<br/><br/>Like Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables,"" (in which good men break laws to get bad ones) we then meet this group of ""good guys"" which will aid Kauffman in carrying out the plan; the macho Daniel Craig (""The Jacket,"" as well as the newest James Bond), nerdy Mathieu Kossovitz, uptight Ciaran Hinds and middle-aged Hanns Zischler. On the surface, it would seem that none of these men could carry out the mission given to them. One is an antique dealer, another is an account and one makes dolls.<br/><br/>When the time comes for action, however, each knows his job and  for the most part  they know what they're doing. At first. The inaugural hit is an elderly Palestinian author who has just translated ""The 1001 Arabian Nights"" into Italian. He is shot several times in his Rome apartment building, and while Kauffman initially feels guilt over the slaying, he soon learns to kill without much thought.<br/><br/>The clan then begins to run into problems, one bomb is too weak to kill its intended victim; while another blows the front of a hotel out. A sloppy shootout in Athens gets the Russians involved and secret information leads to a deadly firefight in Beruit between Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli Army.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, to get information (whether it's good intelligence or bad, we do not know), Kauffman & Co. are forced to rely on a duplicitous Frenchman, Louie (Mathieu Amalric) for millions of dollars. They also have to deal with the CIA, which seems intent on protecting some of the terrorists.<br/><br/>Failing to get one of the bigger fish, and after losing three of the group, the mission is called off by Kauffman's superior, Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""), while Kauffman wonders what good it did. ""For every one we eliminated,"" he says, ""six more take their place - and they are worse."" Spielberg's point is well-taken. The hostage murders only galvanized the Israelis, while their retaliations only galvanized the Palestinians. It seems a lose-lose proposition all around and it's still going on in the Middle East today.<br/><br/>Spielberg does a fine job of directing this rather low-key, matter-of-fact melodrama that tries a bit too much to be fair and balanced, while costumes and set design accurately reflect the film's early 1973 time period. The final crawl indicates that most of the bigwigs in the Munich murders escaped immediate detection (sheltered by the Russians or hid in Arab countries), but most were eventually tracked down. Kauffman's victims, however, seemed to be minor characters, if even that.<br/><br/>The major flaw was that it was about 15-20 minutes too long. Time is wasted on unnecessary narrative while the movie teases us with at least three endings. All in all, though, it is thought-provoking and certainly one which will be talked about for a while, at least."

For a famous Jew to make a movie in which he strikes a moral equivalence between people who murdered Olympians in cold blood because they were Jewish and the people who sought to bring these murderers to justice is also an abomination.

","Munich is Steven Spielberg's fantastic drama about Israel's secret revenge program ""Operation Wrath of God"" in the wake of the 1972 Olympic Games massacre in Munich, Germany. While I believe Spielberg approached the subject with what he believed was a balanced and sympathetic perspective toward both the Israeli and Palestinian points of view, Munich is a film that powerfully shows the moral vacuum entered into when an oppressive government decides to inflict even more destructive terrorism on the people they're already oppressing. The leader of Israel's strike team, Avner, ends up looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life, knowing that he's created more terrorists than he's killed, and left wondering what he's actually achieved. Pro-Israelis and Zionists were outraged by the film and called for boycotts, and many reviewers blasted the film for insinuating that Israel's actions were actually worse than the terrorism they were responding to. One scene even allows a Palestinian militant to make a powerful argument for their cause, and the film ultimately makes the viewer question the kind of ""eye for an eye"" policies that exacerbate conflict rather than end it. Spielberg's film is expertly directed and the performances are excellent throughout."

","A reminder that Spielberg can make strong, mature films for adult viewers when he knuckles down to it, in comparison to the usually sentimental and twee offerings he makes for kiddie audiences. MUNICH is an often gripping world-hopping thriller that outdoes the likes of Ridley Scott's SPY GAME in terms of international espionage.<br/><br/>It helps that the central narrative is strong and ever-moving: a team of assassins are set up by the Israeli government to kill the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the murder of Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics. Violent death, condemnation and retribution are the central themes here, dealt with a more subtle approach than you might have expected.<br/><br/>Spielberg's cinematography is impressive, as it avoids flashiness and super-fast editing to instead provide an old-fashioned, '70s-style piece of tense filmmaking. The script is strong and the cast stronger; Eric Bana gives a reminder of why he was once leading man material back in the day, Daniel Craig shines in a supporting role, Ciaran Hind is splendid, as ever, and Mathieu Amalric steals all of his scenes. MUNICH is a great film and clearly one of the director's best."
"raphaklopper","10","2","3","23 June 2013"," Steven Spielberg still AWESOME, so shut up if you don't agree!
","After the entry of the 21st century, Steven Spielberg began to be criticized by the new generation. A lot of them saying that he was losing his edge, that he longer make good movies like he used to, that he is getting lost on making entertaining movies such as ""AI"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""The Terminal,"" ""Minority Report"" and ""War of the Worlds ""(which are nothing bad at all, all of them just great movies). But ""Munich"" served almost like a letter in response to those critics telling them to shut up forever.<br/><br/>""Munich"" shows (almost perfect) the truthful events of the terrorist attack by the terrorist group called ""Black September"", which took place on September 5 in the Summer Olympic Games in 1972 in Munich (dah). In this attack, 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by the terrorist group, and were later brutally murdered when the terrorists were caught in a shootout with the German police. The story follows a group of agents of ""Mossad"" led by Avner (Eric Bana) who are ordered to hunt down and kill the leaders of the group ""Black September"" and the men who planned the attack. All of them fled and spread throughout Europe.<br/><br/>The film is able to demonstrate in a very realistic and at the same time loyal to the actual events of the fateful day. The partnership of Tony Kushner and Eric Roth on the screenplay works superbly giving a simple writing while packed with suspense leaving the man-hunt behind the responsible for the attack more tense leaving us more intrigued wondering how it will end, and together with the direction Spielberg all works fantastically.<br/><br/>But while the film works as a drama demonstrating the true story of the attack and also as a thriller full of suspense showing the hunt for those responsible, but at the same time functions as a symbolic and human exploration of religious conflicts involved in the film. The screenplay delivers several moments of dialog between the characters questioning the cause of these conflicts and the cause of them and the reason for so many deaths. And also dialogs about the relationship and family honor involved in the midst of those religious conflicts, most of them involved with the character of Avner that while is hunting the terrorist leaders, he has a pregnant wife at home to worry about and a father with a great military career. While giving a somber and also reflective tone throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cast was also highlighted in an excellent way, all superb in their characters since Daniel Craig as the angry and sarcastic agent Steve to Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim the head of the ""Mossad"", all great but who stands out and demonstrates a real talent is Eric Bana gives a astonishing performance (even the weird accent can give).<br/><br/>""Munich"" only shows that Spielberg still manages to make films with a bleak vision and matures upon a true story. And along with Eric and Tony writing manages to bring to the public tense and reflective moments about the religious conflicts and the family values and religious influences involved, delivering a superbly well written screenplay and alongside with a fantastic direction and excellent performances, makes ""Munich"" one of the most ambitious and magnificent films that Spielberg brought to the world."
"Tweekums","8","2","3","23 May 2013"," The price of vengeance
","In the aftermath of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 Avner, a Mossad agent is given a mission: he is to go to Europe and, with four other men, hunt down the eleven people he has been told organised the atrocity. Israel might not have the death penalty but it has been decided that these men must die; a message must be sent to the terrorists that if they attack Israel they can expect no mercy. As the team learns the whereabouts of their targets they travel all over Europe. It is not an easy job; killing does not come naturally to them but they do it for their country. As time passes they begin to wonder whether or not it is worth it; each person they kill is quickly replaced and also leads to further attacks against Israelis. Over time they themselves become targets; which leads to paranoia; could their contact be betraying them or have they crossed swords with another security service? This Paranoia ultimately leads to Anver starts to wonder whether the people on his list had anything to do with Munich at all perhaps Mossad was just using Munich as an excuse to eliminate some enemies.<br/><br/>Before watching this I half expected it to be a revenge thriller but it was more than that; rather than getting satisfaction from the killings Avner and most of the team start to question what they are doing and it begins to take an emotional toll. When they set out they believed they were the good guys but as time passes they start to wonder whether they are all that different from their targets. This doesn't feel like an action film either; there is no exciting music to accompany the action and what they do is shown as being frightening not exciting. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story interesting without glorifying the actions and Eric Bana does a great job portraying Avmer as an increasingly tormented man. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a solid drama but don't expect it to be like an action movie where you can cheer for a hero who knows he is doing the right thing."

","Munich is a historical drama about the Israeli government's secret retaliation against the Black September terrorist group after the Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics.It stars Eric Bana and Daniel Craig together with Ciarán Hinds,Mathieu Kassovitz,Hanns Zischler and Geoffrey Rush. The film shows how a squad of assassins, led by former Mossad agent Avner, track down and kill a list of Black September members thought to be responsible for the murders of eleven Israeli athletes. The second part of the film, which depicts the Israeli government's response, has been debated a great deal by film critics and newspaper columnists. It is based on the book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team by Canadian journalist George Jonas, which in turn was based on the story of Yuval Aviv, who claims to have been a Mossad agent. In the book, Aviv's story is told through a protagonist called ""Avner"".The film written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth; and it was produced and directed by Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>At its core, Munich is a straightforward thriller. It's built on a relatively stock movie premise and the revenge plot: innocent people are killed, the bad guys got away with it, and someone has to make them pay. But director Steven Spielberg uses that as a starting point to delve into complex ethical questions about the cyclic nature of revenge and the moral price of violence.By all rights, Munich should be an unqualified success as it has gripping subject matter relevant to current events.It was co-written by one of America's greatest living playwrights in Tony Kushner and an accomplished screenwriter in Eric Roth.Also,it stars an appealing and likable actor in Eric Bana and it was helmed by Steven Spielberg, of all people. While it certainly is a great movie, it falls just short of the immense heights such talent should propel it to. This is due more to some questionable plot devices than anything else. But while certain aspects ring hollow, the movie as a whole is a profound accomplishment.This examination of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict in the aftermath of the Munich assassinations is politically even-handed and cinematically visceral.An absolutely good film indeed."

","""Munich"" is a brilliant piece of film-making. It takes the story of the 1972 Munich massacre (where Palestinian nationalists murdered 11 Israeli Olympic athletes) and uses to ask questions about terrorism and the use of violence as a legitimate response.<br/><br/>Eric Bana plays Avner, who heads up a group of agents assembled by the Israeli government to track down and kill the terrorists responsible for the massacre. Avner, who has a wife and child, initially accomplishes his mission dispassionately. But his involvement with a pair of duplicitious information brokers (Matthieu Almaric and Michael Lonsdale), makes him question not only himself but the government he serves...<br/><br/>Some brilliant acting by Bana and fellow Australian Geoffrey Rush, who plays his handler, highlights the humane issues raised in the script and their final confrontation, closed by a shot of the World Trade Centre towers, underlines this.<br/><br/>Some fine ensemble work with the rest of the other actors, a strong screenplay and Spielberg's typically assured direction ensure this complex and intriguing tale is told without becoming completely incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Still relevant today, especially after the Gaza bombings, ""Munich"" is well worth viewing."
"g-bodyl","9","2","3","8 February 2009"," A Thrilling History Lesson!
","Munich is a very powerful film in all aspects. I am surprised that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg directed this film because he is Pro-Israel. If you are expecting a movie such as Jaws or E.T, you will be disappointed. This film is a thriller and a history lesson meant to tell the truth by Hollywood.<br/><br/>This film is about the 1972 Munich Olympics games. Eleven Israeli hostages were murdered. Now, a team is sent out to kill the members who planned the Munich attacks. The leader of the team is Avner. He must leave his family and he is stricken with pains of war and death throughout this movie. All he wants to do is be home with his family.<br/><br/>The cast was absolutely amazing. Eric Bana is powerful playing Avner. I liked Daniel Craig's character. There are other great actors out there whose names I cannot recall such as the guy who played Louis.<br/><br/>The music is superb. John Williams can do any kind of music for any kind of movie genre. The music adds a more thrilling demeanor to this movie.<br/><br/>The one thing I have against this is that this movie is a little long so that meant some scenes were a bit overdone. Not much, though.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film. It deserves the Best Picture nomination. I rate this movie 9/10."
"Haynerator","7","2","3","5 February 2009"," An Intriguing Historical Insight
","The cinematography in the opening scene is worth mentioning, it sets a very suspicious mood which gives the audience a very early sense of intrigue. If you know nothing of the 'Munich Massacre', then the graphic nature of this opening scene will have a bigger impact upon you. The tension and suspense created during these early moments of the film set a nice pace to be carried through. Spielberg's portrayal of these events creates a very well executed shocking sense of realism.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel, however, that to some people interest might be lost within the first 10 minutes. After showing a portion of reconstructed events in somewhat realistic detail, the film shifts to a slower pace with less intrigue with the display of on-lookers watching their TV sets, and reporters at the scene. This can however be construed to be with good reason, setting an authentic mood of how people reacted to the news at the time with a very clueless perspective, which was achieved well with some archive footage of the events. For audience members who remember watching these events on the news, this can easily bring back emotions experienced at the time.<br/><br/>There is a great feeling of an independent production surrounding this, with a Hollywood look pasted over the top  You can see the money, and with Spielberg in charge, it's no surprise this got a major release into the box office. This isn't particularly a bad thing though; this just goes to show what you can accomplish when a real life drama is granted a healthy budget. Though it seemed at times that the money was used to acquire the best equipment possible rather than considering the mood of the scenery, resultantly, this made several sets visually come across as a studio stage where each scene was, in actuality, shot on location. However this does not distract from the rest of the film too much, maintaining suspense, intrigue and tension throughout.<br/><br/>Eric Bana gave an amazing performance, practically stealing the show. It's clear he worked very hard on his accent. Though Geoffrey Rush delivered some great acting too, his accent didn't feel too solid. Everybody slipped up a tiny bit here and there, but I think Rush's accent was the least consistent. Daniel Craig was fairly mediocre in this, a bit semi-natural. He carried his role well but wasn't very consistent  There were moments when it felt like he was over-acting, as if trying too hard to grant his character a sense of realism.<br/><br/>The other notably great performance was from Mathieu Amalric who plays a character called 'Louis', 'Avner's primary source for gathering names of 'Black September' members. He is a very intricate, well written character  There is something naturally sinister about Amalric as an actor, and this aided him well here, making 'Louis' a subtly untrustworthy character. The chemistry between Amalric and Bana was brilliant, they were very natural together and this made their scenes together very captivating.<br/><br/>One particular scene to mention shows 'Louis' taking 'Avner' to his father's place for lunch, surrounded by a very large family. 'Louis's father came across as a somewhat contrived character in the things he said. The character was written to portray a certain level of wisdom, delivering various metaphors such as; ""Butchers' hands, gentle souls"", and saying to his son, ""You centaur, you minotaur."" The whole scene was an explosion of forced metaphor and felt a little detached from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Structured around attempts on members of 'Black September', 'Munich' is well designed and artistically executed. Each attempt on a member of 'Black September' brings an excellent level of conflicting humanity, evil and power. Their first potential assassination brings about the realisation that they are not only killing people with terrorist involvement, they are killing fathers, sons, uncles and brothers. These people, despite their evil, are people who will be missed. Though 'Avner's team believe themselves to have faith in the operation they are carrying out, their morality often gets in the way as they try to execute their target, and their target alone, bringing about a certain degree of failure with each attempt. <br/><br/>The character development is well orchestrated, giving us a group of very compassionate and moral assassins. This is displayed best at the meal time scenes; the main characters always share large home-cooked meals with each other to discuss their execution plans. This is some great symbolism, showing how they can participate in something so tidy and civilised, only to discuss plans of something so messy and monstrous. These meal times gradually display a realisation of potential futility in their operation. As the film moves along, 'Avner' starts to question the morality of what he is the leader of. If what he is doing, is the right thing to do? Whether it is justified? Whether he was manipulated by the government of his own country, to carry out an operation for selfish national objectives or pure revenge? It's a very well orchestrated ambivalent mix of compassion and evil, and the protagonist knows this. Due to this, we ultimately have a traumatised hero who feels as if he has accomplished nothing, making not only the character, but the audience realise the futility of retaliation and terrorism as a whole.<br/><br/>I rate this film a respectable 7 out of 10, it's a well worth seeing and is very enjoyable. Great performances, story, script and great historical research. From what I've read of the actual events of the 'Munich Massacre', the film appears to be very historically accurate, and the mix of fiction is superbly balanced. It's great to see an A-Lister like Steven Spielberg tackle such a challenging piece. This is one of those films not necessarily designed to entertain, but to teach us about humanity, and the depth and fragility of human emotion and mentality as well as a bit of history."
"Dean_Jenkins","8","2","3","5 February 2009"," Extremely Exciting , Suspense Filled , Perfectly Paced ... I Could Go On!
","Munich tells the story of 11 Isralie Athlete murdered when a hostage operation doesn't exactly go as planned. The Group of people behind it were/are known as ""Black September"".<br/><br/>What the film really focuses on is everything that came after this event. In response to this a new attitude/ approach is taken it is decided by the Isrealie government that the best way to change things to fight back is to start doing some of the killing themselves. So it is decided that a team shall be put together with the intention of finding and killing the people responsible for the slaughtering of the athletes. <br/><br/>Chosen to lead the team is Avner the son of a once war hero who has to agree to leave his life which is taken up mostly by his pregnant wife for a while and focus on the objective in hand he can not tell anyone about this and will be given four other team members in which to carry out his ""work"". <br/><br/>Well what happens after all this is quite simply amazing and shown so well by Spielberg. The film shows the consequences of the attitude ""fighting fire with fire"" It shows how over time the men doing the revenge killing almost can't handle it and lose there eagerness to kill back. It shows how this affects you , others around you and even sometimes people who don't deserve to die. The film almost spells out that killing gets you nowhere and doesn't change nor right wrongs. What the film also does is shows that the men doing the hunting down for those responsible ultimately become the hunted in a world were information can and will be sold to whoever will pay the most. It shows how even after the mission is over Avner is affected by what has happened he is scared as he is now a man wanted and is scared for him and his family's life. <br/><br/>This film is full of edge of the seat stuff! and is ram packed full of suspense. Even at it's long running time not for one second is this film slow and never manages to drag in anyway!<br/><br/>With amazing performances from Bana and the other four members of the team including ""Daniel Craig"" this film is for anyone who just generally loves movies. <br/><br/>It has no particular target audience and can be enjoyed by all. Everything in this film just feels so perfect the Cinematography , Performances , Action , Handling of violence and how real it feels in general!.<br/><br/>It's one that all lovers of both drama and action movies will enjoy and makes you wonder what more Spielberg could have mastered if he had opted for more serious movies like this. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Munich is a movie that exposes the effects of the prevailing principles of ""peace"" on the men at the receiving end. It is an intelligent movie that does not stress and excruciate the viewer despite its long running time.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain-- the cinematography is very intelligent. It seemed as if the camera angles alone would tell a story! The cinematography also gives the movie that sort of suspenseful air that makes the movie rather slow than the usual fast-paced.<br/><br/>Another factor that makes Munich watchable till the end is the story development. The ending was definitely an ending, unfolding a hidden plot that has been running throughout the film. It does not rely on the killing of the targets to keep the story going.<br/><br/>Munich definitely has a plot, and it keeps that plot running until the end. The actors all gave good performances, and the cinematography aids the overall mood the movie wishes to impart to the viewers.<br/><br/>Final say? Definitely not your usual action movie! It's sleek and intelligent, and it definitely has a plot unlike other action movies which depend on the action sequences to keep audience members watching!"
"Killakai","9","2","3","20 June 2007"," Polished and nuanced film, which poses tough questions.
","Political extremists don't like this film because, well, this film attempts to provide a nuanced view on terrorism, and violence. This is a film that is about characters and their psychological makeup, and how they respond to the missions they are asked to accomplish and what happens to them as they move closer towards their goal. The acting is superb, the characters are real, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and visually the film is stunning to look at (I watched it in high def, wow).<br/><br/>The attention to detail with 70's era cars, clothes and hairstyles was also excellent. <br/><br/>This movie is about assassinations, and it does get bloody (graphically bloody), so it isn't for the squeamish, but its a thoroughly enjoyable movie, even if it is a bit long at 2:40, nothing in the film seems rushed or thrown in. I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10, and its definitely something i'd like to have in my collection."
"hollywoodhorrorchick","8","2","3","2 April 2007"," violence has no beginning, no end
","I had put off seeing this for a long time, scared off by the length (2 hrs 40 min). But there are so many internal stories and so much to consider about the consequences of what is happening, it is really served by demanding your attention at length. The particular events surrounding Black September are incredibly rich and powerful, but the bigger impact is knowing that they are not isolated acts of honor, rebellion, and revenge, that the same conflict is fueling unimaginable suffering today, as it has for centuries. Not just in the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but in any clash where violence is answered with violence. Aside from being a great film, it is an interesting exercise to take three hours and focus on the cycle of violence that occurs with acts of terrorism and retaliation."
"senortuffy","7","2","3","7 November 2006"," The morality of assassins killing assassins
","This film is Steven Spielberg's take on the moral dilemma faced by assassins killing for the sake of their country's morale. If the protagonist was played by a better actor, it might have worked, but the film lacks spark and drags on much too long.<br/><br/>Avner, played by Eric Bana (The Hulk), is a Mossad agent who quits to head a secret unit of assassins being sent to Europe to hunt down the people responsible for the killings of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Avner's motives for joining the unit are vague. He appears to passively accept his assignment and doesn't express much enthusiasm for revenge, so when he later begins feeling guilty about the killings, it's hard to understand where this emotion comes from. Bana has to carry the movie to make it work and he's just overwhelmed by better actors playing supporting roles.<br/><br/>Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric are memorable as the father/son combination heading a group of free-lance agents operating out of Paris. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Avner's Israeli handler. Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, appears as one of the Israeli assassins. Ciarán Hinds also turns in a fine performance as another one of the assassins.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is not one of Spielberg's best efforts. Usually, he draws the viewer into his films by way of emotional attachment to the characters, but with the lead player being a bit of a cypher, it just doesn't work. Still, it's entertaining and worth watching."
"WalterFrith","Null","2","3","16 July 2006"," Terror's impact and the endless cycle of violence.
","Steven Spielberg is far from done as a film maker. As a 30+ year veteran of the big screen, Spielberg is continuing to evolve and re-invent himself with each decade. From the popcorn entertainment of 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters' in the 70s to the moving human feelings obtained from 'E.T.' and 'The Color Purple' in the 80s to the world shaking 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' in the 90s to the present, Spielberg is in total control because his true talent is in his choices. 'Munich' takes no side in the dispute between two sides in the most volatile conflict of the last 50 years on planet Earth. By taking no side, Spielberg has managed to take both sides and show them as equally flawed and equally human. The subject matter is the star performer of this film and the actors are merely taking their cues from it and while this film has been heavily criticized for its politics, no matter how this film was presented, it would have been criticized. How then do you make a film this sensitive in subject matter so attractive? Only Spielberg knows and he has managed to convey his vision convincingly. Extraordinary."

","Steven Spielberg has hit a rare home run with this film; an emotionally charged examination of the work of an unofficial elimination squad. Based on what the Mossad claims are highly questionable sources (which lends no small amount of credence to the story), the film traces a great portrait of the self-righteous, unreasoning ""logic"" that drives the never-ending strife in the middle east. People are killed because of what they are instead of who they are, and it is an ever escalating situation. Both sides pay for it in ways they never could have imagined, much of the time the innocent victims are found in the form of families . A great film."

After watching this film, it made me think about a lot of things, i am a very political person and i thought Spielberg captured reality pretty well with this one, he showed different sides and didn't make unnecessary directorial commentary.

"meeza","8","2","3","2 April 2006"," My Munichcipalaties have decided that this film deserves a Silver medal!
","Steven Spieldberg has been praised as the premier ""gold medal"" director in cinematic history. There are many that share that sentiment while others that opinion that he is more in the ""silver or bronze"" auteur medal category. Why I am I getting into such a ""medalica"" state in describing Spieldberg's career? Because his latest controversial flick is inspired by true events of a historic horrific Olympic tragedy. Many know it as Black September. It was during the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich when 11 Israeli athletes & coaches were assassinated by a Palestinian terrorist group. The premise of ""Munich"" is what happened next. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir ordered a vengeance strike against the Palestinians planners of Black September. The Israeli covert revenge team was led by a former security officer turned agent named Avner. His subordinates were comprised of a former toymaker now bomb crafter, a forgery specialist, a practical agent, and an experienced schematic hit specialist. These Mossad agents are not exactly the Israeli armed forces ""high five"" but remember the operation was very clandestine one. The main focal point is that they seek revenge for Munich, non-stop. It is no bullocks that the film has sparked up controversy from Palestinian and even Israeli groups. Palestinians state that Spieldberg depicts them as unmerciful terrorists while Israelis state that he was too lenient against the non-pals Palestis. Personally, I thought Spieldberg was too harsh against his own Israelis, ""jew"" know what I mean. Hey, if this film is controversial why can't this review be of the same caliber? The film's ""message for peace"" signifies that revenge is useless and non-resolving by having Israeli apply egoistic vengeful tactics. Eric Bana executed a Herculean performance as Avner. Bana masterfully portrayed Avner as a righteous family man, a devoted countryman, and later a conflicted hit-man. Spieldberg's recreation of the Munich horror integrated with actual footage was resourceful and effective. The screenplay of ""Munich"" was complex, but yet, suspenseful. Writers Tony Kushner and Eric Roth did give ""Munich"" justice by giving Spieldberg their ""words"". Undoubtedly, Spieldberg has developed a cerebral film. ""Munich"" is not a masterpiece, but it is startling enough for one never to forget that striking back is the same as striking out. Games Over! **** Good"

","Munich is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List. In today's world of international terrorism, Munich is highly relevant and it deeply explores the conflict between country, duty, family and humanity. Told mainly through the view of Avner (Eric Bana), you can see just how difficult and disturbing waging a war against selected enemies can be. Leaving your family to perform a duty for country is already a hard task to swallow, while executing team strategies against the enemy adds even more danger and hardship.<br/><br/>Spielberg's directing in this movie is very striking and artistic, which not only exposes the most relevant elements of Munich but it also delivers deep impact to your conscience. That's right, Spielberg's impact is too powerful to ignore and your conscience will tingle a lot.

","Munich is a good but depressing film.It lasts for two hours and a half and in the first half the pace is rather slow.It is very difficult to analyze the most-complex conflict of the second half of the 20th century-namely the Israeli-Palestinian one.But this film manages to do it and to do it well.At first,the people who had to take the revenge are somewhat hesitant,they still find it difficult to kill(the first Palestinian),As time progresses however ,they are more and more sucked in the spiral of revenge and violence from which there is no way out.Because it is essentially a matter of survival and the stakes are very high.Avner,the main character gradually turns into a killing machine.But all this comes at a price-and it is huge!!!He becomes paranoid,loses his friends,alienates himself from his family.Yes,this is war-a bloody,merciless war on both sides.And what is worse is that war spreads far and wide turning Europe into a Iraeli-Palestinian battlefield. The scenes of murder are really hard to bear.But they are not there for violence's sake,they make a point.In this way it is justifiable to have such graphic violence shown. There are some shortcomings such as Avnir's dreams of the murder of the athletes mixed with his having sex with his wife-I didn't like this-it was superficial.But some scenes are wonderful-when he hears the voice of his baby-daughter on the phone,when he sadly watches the kitchen through the shop-window:a symbol of home and domesticity which he misses so much.Or when one of his victims,not knowing who he is offers to give him sleeping pills seconds before being blown up. Ultimately the film is very depressing because it becomes painfully clear that no solution will come soon.There were(and are)too much hatred,too much bitterness and violence."

","A strong movie with quite a lot of questions asked but not always answered. A movie with over all strong performance by superb but not always ""star"" actors. Does violence breed violence?? What is wonderful about this movie is that the actors never rule the story. All actors are subdued by a story, very strong and believe it or not very non partial. I've never in my life felt 164 minutes pass with such ease. Spielberg really sticks his neck out on this one but on the other hand he raises a lot of questions that applies on 1972 as well as today. Violence always breeds violence! Doesn't it? In any way this movie in my mind clearly competes with other movies nominated this year. None of them... in my mind are as important as ""Munich"" a year as this..."

","I am too young to have been alive during the Black September abductions of the 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Though I did not witness these events I felt as if I was there due to the excellent achievements in Cinematography and in the all over layout of the film. Certain scenes such as the Black September member walking out onto the balcony as the others in the rooms were watching it on TV showed the realism that Spielberg was attempting to capture again...which he did. I very much enjoyed Spielberg showing the insecurity in the behavioral aftermath of the mission in the eyes of Eric Bana's character after ""the smoke clears"" added that edge of suspense that i was looking forward to. I give this film 9 stars, though a lot of people would disagree with that decision I just enjoyed the over all feel of the film and can't wait until it is available on DVD. Now most would call it a controversial film, I did not look at it that way, I just looked at is as an epic picture and enjoyed the drama, action, and heart-pounding suspense. Overall I look forward to seeing how it contends at the Oscars."
"treedcub","9","2","3","20 February 2006"," A tale of moral complexity appropriate in our complex times.
","A lot of people are angry about the film Munich because it is too sympathetic to those they would prefer to hate. This willingness to see humanity in the face of 'the enemy' is precisely why this film is so very important. If everyone could see the humanity of those they hate, how much less violence might there be in the world? Many resist morally complex thinking. It is much easier to see the world in terms of good versus evil. Thinking in absolutes removes unsettling doubts about our place in the world. The problem is, everyone has a point of view, and when pushed to the limit of human experience, people can justify almost anything.<br/><br/>In such difficult times as these, when we all feel threatened and angry at those who engage in senseless violence, it is important to remember how easy it can be to descend into our most savage nature when we feel threatened. Every character in Munich is allowed to have his moment of doubt, even of horror, at the violence he or she commits. Even characters on ""the other side"" are shown having their doubts before pulling the trigger. Munich asks the question: Should we let the murderers make us into murderers? If we do, what in the end are we defending, and what will be the end of it? Munich wisely refrains from answering this question, perhaps because we are all still waiting to learn the answer."
"lsataite","10","2","3","20 February 2006"," astonishing
","Why astonishing? Because it learns to think, what is bad, and that is good, because it gives a choice, to see things in another perspective, because it's not just one sentimental drama, it has no happy end, it's has no end at all. We self have to decide then it;s will stop. It's us, who has to make end to it. It's not sympathize to one or other side, it just gives a lot of time to think where all that go? Where the world goes? And who has right to stop or continue all that madness? Not recommended for short-minded people with just one point of view. Because then you just will see black or white, and that's not what Spielberg wanted. I think this is masterpiece, and the most important, such a masterpiece that lets us to think. Where all this world going too?"
"herman_inclusus","8","2","3","19 February 2006"," the other side of Spielberg's paradigm
","The Jews had always been recipient to numerous conflicts and atrocities since the ages of antiquity. They had been involved in slavery, territorial conflicts, racial discrimination and struggle, religious controversies and several other misunderstanding; and for that the Jews are considered to be the most sensationalized race in this world.<br/><br/>The most often miserable fate of the Jews has countlessly been re-portrayed in film and has captured considerable sympathizers. Since the Jews had been in conflict with different races and countries, their never-ending history of war is not anymore new to the world. And movies with their struggle against countries like Egypt, Greece, Rome and Germany have continually haunted every audience.<br/><br/>It's expected that if it's a Stephen Spielberg movie that it's always disturbing and moving at the same time. It's always elevated to 'Art' status and will never fail to influence the audience because of its natural feel and transcending direction and cinematography – cinema that gets through your veins and drags you into feeling the real experience.<br/><br/>While Spielberg had been fascinated in filming his kin's dreadful experiences in the past as the victims and losers of human abomination, Munich however gives us another perspective where the usual victims no longer play as martyrs but vengeful heroes of their own race. The story is a deviation to the usual portrayal of the Jews' martyrdom and exposes their innate nature for revenge.<br/><br/>Spielberg didn't reside on what just actually happened on the Munich Olympics hostage tragedy and its aftermath but he tried to depict the characters' dilemma on their given assignments since the predefined missions were not really clear and pure. Although the veil of nationalism and justice was the major pretext of their elders, Avner was caught between conspiracies he had no clue of and would somehow fail to understand unless his elders feed him the truth. The already sensationalized history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has smoothly shifted to the dilemma of the character and his allies, giving us a point of view that we need to reconsider and reflect.<br/><br/>It's again a masterpiece and one could just imagine how Spielberg was able to harmonize and give rhythm to a number of short scenes on the movie to create an overall theme of pure drama and portrayal of the effects of the Black September tragedy in Munich to the individuals related and to the world."
"samuelcking","8","2","3","18 February 2006"," Shocking, Violent, Involved
","There is a definite message in this film and it's obvious to anyone who sees this movie and understands politics. It's important to point out that this film is ""based on real events"" and is not true-to-life as far as the history of Munich's aftermath. If you're okay with that, then it's an excellent story.<br/><br/>If you are planning to see an action flick, this is probably not for you. This film is emotional, complex and the characters spend a lot more time talking then they do killing. When the sequences of ""killing"" do occur, it is nothing short of shocking.<br/><br/>The acting is tremendous to say the least, and if you're thinking about seeing it, might I recommend a large screen and loud speakers for those sporadic sequences of action. They are very loud and very intense.<br/><br/>Spielberg shows his directorial expertise by using a type of film enhancement that makes it appear like ""Munich"" was shot in the 1970's, but at the same time couples it with the modern visual/special effects technology which makes some of the more violent scenes seem like we're on location with the actual assassins doing their dirty work.<br/><br/>As far as sex goes, there are a couple of mild scenes between the main character and his wife, of which the latter scene could've been omitted because of its bizarre connotation. Secondly, there is a scene where a woman appears in full-frontal nudity, but I will warn you it's not a sex scene.<br/><br/>I would have given this film a ""10"" except that there were some scenes that slowed the movie down and also the fact that I would have rather seen a more true-to-history depiction of ""Munich""."
"robfitz1972","8","2","3","17 February 2006"," Spielberg Back On Track
","After the disappointment of War of The Worlds, let down by some hammy acting and a weak storyline, Munich goes a long way towards restoring Spielberg's reputation. Based on Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, this is a near flawless piece.<br/><br/>The storyline is excellent, relying heavily on family/nation imagery throughout, from when Avner meets Golda Meir, the Israeli Prime Minister who remembers his father and comments on his wife's pregnancy, to Avner being disenfranchised from Mossad and missing out on the upbringing of his daughter.<br/><br/>The acting performances bring together some quality actors, such as Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, the legendary Michel Lonsdale and the ever consistent Geoffrey Rush. Although he does not have the same reputation, Eric Bana's performance as an assassin and family man is excellent. Ruthless in his duty, his softer side comes to the fore when he hears his daughter's first words over the phone, arguably the most heart wrenching scene in the film.<br/><br/>But what is most impressive is the attention to detail to what is a period piece. The mixture of original ABC archive footage with reconstruction of the siege is eerily accurate. The scenes of all of the locations is truly a step back to the 70s, even down to the inclusion of the World Trade Centre in New York.<br/><br/>At 2 and a half hours, this one long film. But the drama is so unrelenting that the time whizzes by. And for such a violent film, the futility of violence is given considerable emphasis. Spielberg can take pride in this piece of work. He'll now have a hell of a job on his hands to follow this up. But if Munich wins the Best Picture Oscar, will he care?"
"MrBiddle","9","2","3","17 February 2006"," Come home, Avner.
","Heavy Spielberg. After taking a walk in the park with Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal and pumping up some energy with War of the Worlds, Spielberg again conjures up heavy material in this movie about conscience, revenge (hence the title of the book it was adopted from) and the human condition in relation to it. Spielberg may have taken liberties in some areas, as a filmmaker he has done that in Catch Me if You Can or anyone for that matter is entitled to artistic liscence, but he captures the reality of the TRAUMA involved in each of the main players. Bana does a terrific job as do those who play his team, and also his wife. One thing I'd also like to point out is that Spielberg and DP Kaminski always always manage to photograph movies BEAUTIFULLY with an aesthetic that's both atmospheric and at times chaos-inducing such as some freestyle albeit carefully calculated hand-held and choreographed sequences. Safe to say that beyond a doubt Spielberg is a master in of biomechanics with respect to blocking and cinematography. You will also see him fabricate the most appropriate visual sensations during some of the most tense sequences such as the under the bed bombing sequence, you will momentarily see human appendage left over and rotating from a ceiling fan amidst Bana going through demolition seeing to it that his sexually active neighbors are safe after the mishap. And there are moments of cliffhanger and tension such as the telephone-bomb sequence. I need not say more, but that is one moment in the cinema when I actually said ""No!!!"", proving that this movie does manage to unnerve when it gets its moments albeit it is a drama by essence. MUNICH does not shy away from violence, but it is a movie that is sort of anti-violence, once again it echoes an innate ability to show compassion and remorse. This is also one aspect where Spielberg's talent and maturity shine as he always depicts his pieces in context of the human condition his movie preceding MUNICH may have been scorned for being a bombast marred by mediocre storytelling yet in that movie I will say it has excelled in portraying the human condition. John Williams, as he has done many times with Mr. Spielberg before showcases versatility and a different type of music, has avery Middle-eastern feel yet deviously and subliminally propulsive that has repetitive motifs of fear, anxiety. And the screen writing? As with most of the best in the art of adaptation of true to life events, the use of temporal displacement is deployed. You'll know what I mean when you see the delay of exposition and progression during the Olympic Massacre. It is flashed back all throughout instead of being depicted all at once. (Would have marred the pacing and flow that way), so I commend the screenwriters as well. While many will be irritated by this expected Spielberg routine: YES the movie ends somewhat low key it has moments of suspense but it is more histrionic and probably this isn't to everyone's taste. In the POV department, who are we supposed to be rooting for? It's instinctive to say Mr. Bana, yes that is a fact but ultimately we are supposed to be examining conscience and our own morales. The movie has also a lot of subliminal portrayals of these issues in society and in our lives, from a lady discussing Karl Marx's theories on right and wrong with respect to situational ethics and philosophy, to temptation of adultery and SEXpionage rolled into one. And the remorse and maybe even confusion that Mr. Bana's character feels, you will feel too in the end. It's NOT a feel-good movie but it's GREAT. What is also visible is Avner's character arc, we see him being dismissive about assassination many times repetitively, even telling Carl his team mate to NOT think about it. And also in the dinner table when discussions escalate on the replacement of the slain leaders. His 180 turn around takes place towards the end, and it is depicted by Spielberg carefully with a lot of gusto and emotion. From the juxtapousition of a love scene to a graphic and ultra histrionic recollection of the actual murders of the athletes. It ends with Geoffrey Rush (also someone to be commended in his performance here) telling Avner that what it was really all about was COMING HOME or the essence of home; but closely regarding Avner's final experiences in the dreaded field op, was it really about that? That is the recurring theme of the movie, would you still consider or would you reconsider right and wrong? Why do I cut my nails? They grow back. Grade A-"

"VegasBabyVegas1","7","2","3","16 February 2006"," Spielberg is still top-dog despite an unsatisfying whole
","First, the good news. Spielberg once again shows that in director terms he's peerless. He exercises a technical prowess that is frankly on another level to other directors.<br/><br/>The scenes involving the set-ups and execution of each assassination (which is essentially all this film is about) cranks up the tension to an unbearable level despite their predictability and even manages to diffuse this with some moments of ultra-black comedy. Editing, photography and sound design are all masterclass level.<br/><br/>However, as Spielberg has undoubtedly improved with age as a director, as a story-teller he again seems to have become a little complacent. This film is little more than a document of what happened following Munich and is as coldly calculated as the protagonists.<br/><br/>The actors do well to capture the feeling of paranoia and lingering doubt in the rightness of their actions, but this would have been much more satisfying had the director fleshed the characters out with back-story.<br/><br/>As for the now infamous sex scene involving Eric Bana's character, Avner, and his wife inter-cut with scenes of the massacre of the hostages and terrorists at the airport, well, all I can assume is that this was in the hands of another director, such is the cack-handedness of it. It is probably one of the most needlessly self-indulgent scenes in recent memory and, being at the end, significantly mars this film.<br/><br/>Having said all this, you still have to marvel at the director's abilities and hope his next offering will be a more satisfying whole."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","10 February 2006"," Satisfying on every level
","Look at it first as pure entertainment, putting the serious subject matter aside just for the time being - a team is put together very secretly by the Israeli Government to track down and kill all the Munich killers on the loose all over Europe. An ensemble of experts carrying out a dangerous mission is such a familiar set up that is can be easily mishandled, out of complacency. Here, Spielberg shows why he is still the most popular director. Five guys carrying out one killing after another can be a very boring affair. What Spielberg has done is making every meticulous effort to ensure that the audience see something new in each sequence, be it variety of camera angles, mise en scene, pacing, story-telling. In-between the operations, there are plenty of scene with the five members debriefing, planning, discussing or simply relaxing. Imagine the countless frames that contain all five or a combination of some of them. There was not one single repetition of the positioning of these characters as far as I could see.<br/><br/>And I was also happy to find that the playful Spielberg is still there, albeit making way a lot for the serious Spielberg. But look at the scene when group leader Avner (Eric Bana) is conducting business with the French informant Louis (Mathieu Alamric) in an open-air café. Absorbed in the important discussion, the audience may not notice the ridiculous fact that Louis is counting a huge pile of dollar bills until Avner, quite suddenly, murmurs something to the effect that Louis shouldn't be doing this in public and tries to use some plastic wrappers to cover the money held in the latter's hands.<br/><br/>Purely on the level of an espionage thriller with a bit of a procedural nature, the movie works extremely well. But there is of course much more to ""Munich"", which has received a level of unanimous acclaim from professional critics that has not been seen for quite some time. It delves quite deep into the psyche of professional killers with various personalities, through an agonising journey from awkward hesitation to numb indifference. But that's not all. As the hunter becomes the hunted, numb indifference turns into nerve-wrecking paranoid. ""Munich"" is a treat for anyone interested in the psychology of the characters in a movie.<br/><br/>But then, there is still another level. In trying to tell the story of both the Jews and the Palestinians, Spielberg has incurred criticism form both said, so I understand. This can only mean that he has done an excellent job. He puts a lot of questions fairly on the table  does killing achieve anything, what is a home, how does one best serve one's country, is there a bottom line at all to violenceand all the time never forgetting to bring the audience back to the main theme, the senseless killings at Munich in 1972 that accomplished nothing except triggering more killings.<br/><br/>It's quite disappointing that ""Munich"" wasn't even nominated for the Screen Actors Guild's ""Outstanding performance by a cast"" award, because I think its ensemble is better even than the winners in ""Crash"".<br/><br/>Eric Bana's portrayal of the group leader Avner's anguishing mental journey is absolutely first class. Daniel Craig demonstrates that he can call up a bellyful of fire needed for hit man Steve, something he didn't get a chance to show in either ""Sylvia"" or ""Enduring love"", serving notice that he is up to the Bond job. Ciaran Hinds who was most impressive as the Russian president in ""Sum of all fears"" among his prolific screen work plays dependable Carl. German actor Hanns Zischler who bears a remarkable resemblance to Glenn Ford surprises us as stylish forger Hans, who shows that he is quite capable of acts of daring and violence towards the end. Little known actor Mathieu Kossovitz plays the appropriately subdued bomb ""expert"" Robert who turns out to be not so expert after all.<br/><br/>There's a lot more. Each and every one of the supporting characters is immensely watchable. Needing no introduction is talented Oscar winner (""Shine"") Geoffrey Rich, who has quite a significant role as Avner's contact man from the Israeli Government. Another important character that has plenty of scenes with Avner is French informer Louis, played by Mathieu Amalric. Anyone who has seen the excellent French movie ""Rois et reine"" (Kings and queen) will remember how good this French actor is. Another top French star, director Francois Ozon's favourite Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (""5x2"", ""Le temps qui reste"") has only a cameo role but is still good to see. Those who have seen the 2003 Oscar Best Foreign Language film ""The barbarian invasions"" should remember talented Canadian actress Marie-Josee Croze. In ""Munich"" she plays beautiful, deadly alluring Dutch assassin Jeanette. There are also Ayelet Zorer who plays Avner's loving wife Daphna, Michael Lonsdale who plays Louis' ""Papa"" and Lynn Cohen who would make you believe that it's Golda Meir plaing herself! Whatever you are looking for in a movie, you'll probably find ""Munich"" immensely satisfying.unless you happen to be looking for a romance comedy."
"Kryzak","8","2","3","9 February 2006"," Emotionally Exhausting
","Alright, this review is written a little more than 2 weeks after I saw it. Why is that? Well, I needed some time to digest the movie and decide whether I liked it or loved it. A side trip to the actual city of Munich didn't hurt either .<br/><br/>With that said, I believe the movie was a very well made, well thought out, and well acted piece of work. Steve Spielberg shows us again that he is not only great at action/sci-fi spectacle movies like ""War of the Worlds"" (yes, I liked that movie, so there! ) but he's also a genius at movies that explore very touchy issues like in ""Munich"". The only thing is, emotionally I wasn't as engaged as I should have been with this movie. That is the reason why I can only give ""Munich"" an 8 instead of a 9 or 10 like many other critics out there. I guess that's what differentiates one movie critic from another. They might all agree that a movie is very well made, but how much emotional impact they get from the movie will differ, and thus the varying ratings for the same movie.<br/><br/>OK, enough babbling. Let's get on to the review! At the heart of the movie is a semi-fictional story about the details of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre of the Israeli athletes by the Palestinian terrorists, and the endless cycle of revenge and retribution that follows. All credit must be given to Spielberg for presenting as balanced of a viewpoint as one can of this messy situation, for he does not favor either side of the conflict, and allows the audiences to make the decision for themselves.<br/><br/>What is most interesting and powerful in the movie is the story of one man (played by Eric Bana) who has to lead a small group of assassins to exact revenge on those who planned the massacre, and all the emotional turmoil he and his team have to experience throughout their mission. Eric Bana played the lead character's part with masterful skill and subtlety. He is at first happy for revenge, but as the mission goes on, his beliefs are challenged and the killings start to become a burden on his soul. It is watching this slow transformation and development of Bana's character that fascinates me the most about the movie. I believe Bana's performance should warrant an Oscar nomination, but in a year where there are so many great performances by a male lead, it'll be a toss up.<br/><br/>As usual, the cinematography and action of the movie were very powerful and realistic, and I expect nothing less from Spielberg. The only problem I have with the movie is near the end, when there seemed to be multiple endings, one after another, similar to ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" or ""Return of the King."" While I understand the need for these endings to provide closure to the story, I found myself wondering ""when will this movie end?"" a couple times watching it. It's a very small gripe for such a good movie, but I just wanted to point it out.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Munich"" was a very well directed and acted film with a LOT of poignant themes involved. Even with my slight emotional detachment from the movie, I still strongly suggest you to see it. It'll definitely make you think and leave you emotionally exhausted."
"DoctorKay","8","2","3","6 February 2006"," The last scene
","The film is neither pro-Israel nor pro-Palestine. If you see and understand the scenes where Avner is talking with ""Ali"" and especially the very last scene in New York where he offers Ephraim to eat with him, as Jews are supposed to do it, you notice that the film only shows the completely desperate situation of both religions without naming one as the better one, the true one. And that's what makes the film so extraordinarily honest. Spielberg does never judge anybody, but he criticizes both parties. Ephraim turns down Avners offer to eat with him, he only sees the conflict, he is no longer aware what it usually means to be a Jew. Being Jewish for him means fighting against Palestine, he forgot his own roots. And that's the part where Spielberg delivers his own opinion, without judging."
"roland-104","8","2","3","22 January 2006"," Failed opportunity to illuminate Palestinian terrorism; instead we mainly get James Bond redux
","Docudrama about the Israeli-sponsored counter-terrorism team assembled (with the blessings of Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister at the time) to retaliate against the Palestinian terrorists and their co-conspirators responsible for slaying 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and staff at the 1972 Munich Olympiad. The screenplay - by resident Broadway genius Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, who also wrote ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""The Insider"" - is based on a book by George Jones, entitled ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team."" <br/><br/>Ever the entertainer, first and foremost, Steven Spielberg gives us no insights about the causes of Palestinian or Islamic terrorism, but, rather, a high intensity, slick action movie on the order of the James Bond flicks. We even have a bomb maker who creates too cute, one of a kind, overly gimmicky devices tailored unnecessarily for each assassination, just like the lethal toymakers in the Bond stories. (Maybe it really happened that way; my point is, why did Spielberg dwell on such techie details when there were more weighty issues to address?) The pace is fast, and as the team take out one anonymous, one dimensional bad guy after another, with ingenious methods and plenty of risk-based tension, I could not resist being caught up in the excitement of blood sport on display here.<br/><br/>As for more serious geopolitical subtexts, we do get misgivings expressed about the whole notion of revenge embodied by this team - an eye for an eye, Talion Law, the Code of Hammurabi, the raison d'etre for their lethal mission. Occasional doubts about the mission do furl the brow of the serious minded Avner (Eric Bana), recruited from within Mossad, Israel's CIA, to lead the team, but only in passing. His ambivalence seems easily patched up. The bigshots behind the mission  people like Mrs. Meir (Lynn Cohen) and the team's Mossad supervisor, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush)  have no doubts at all that history and God are on their side.<br/><br/>The other four team members are an interesting lot, but we really don't get to know them all that well, even in the expanse of 2 hours, 44 minutes film running time. The chief trigger man, Steve, is played by a coolly psychopathic, baby blue eyed Daniel Craig (Ted Hughes in Sylvia; the latest actor to be anointed for the James Bond series role). Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) is the bomb maker, recruited for this task because of credentials that are at best equivocal: he was formerly a toy maker and bomb dismantler. Turns out that some of his devices are too powerful, causing collateral damage. Carl (Ciaran Hinds) is an expert in obliterating evidence, traces of the team members' identities. Hans (Hanns Zischler) is a master document forger. The group wine and dine their way around Europe in elegant circumstances between assassinations, another Bond-like touch, however true it may have been.<br/><br/>A fascinating side story here concerns a Paris-based Mafia-like family that indulges in espionage and other dirty tricks for hire. Avner contacts a son, Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and pays handsomely ($100K per person) for information on the whereabouts of people the team wants to take out. Louis eventually takes a blindfolded Avner to meet the family's leader, Louis's father, called simply ""Papa"" (Michael Lonsdale), a stout avuncular fellow who takes a liking to Avner that stirs jealous sentiments within Louis. The world of this amoral French crime family would serve as excellent fare for expanded treatment, perhaps in some other film.<br/><br/>Just in recent months we have witnessed an rapidly emerging and maturing cinema of contemporary terrorism (""The War Within,"" ""Paradise Now,"" ""The Friend,"" ""Syriana""), to which ""Munich"" adds something, but not a lot. To be sure, the violent practice of Talion law still dominates relations between Israel and Palestine. And, at one point in the film, Louis plays a fiendish little trick on Avner and his mates. They are put up in a safe house in Arab territory, Yemen as I recall. Late in the evening, in troup another gang also instructed to use the same safe house. They are Arab terrorists. A long, tense, guns-drawn moment ensues, but the situation is defused when Avner's team passes itself off as a leftist German terror cell (think Bader-Meinhoff or Red Brigade). An intriguing discussion between Avner and the Arab team leader follows, about the historic inevitability of their causes. The Arab leader says that Islam will prevail against the West, even if it takes 100 years.<br/><br/>This is one of the film's best scenes. But much of ""Munich"" seems like a throwback, a film that would have been more timely in the 1980s perhaps, but less so now. The hit team's targets are people we never meet or learn about only superficially. We don't know why they did what they did to contribute to ""Black September."" It is unfortunate that with the immense resources at his disposal, Mr. Spielberg could not have reached for something less showy, more edifying to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary terrorism. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Film seen 01/09/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."

","This was one of those films that none of my friends would go see with me. I don't know why. They could've learned a thing or two from it. So, I went to see this by myself yesterday and it turned out to be a damn good movie.<br/><br/>It immediately starts off with a riveting re-creation of Black September terrorists making their way into the compound that houses the Israeli athletes. The terrorists are not merciful in any way, shape or form.<br/><br/>I liked how Spielberg used the actual TV footage from the 1972 broadcasts. The killing of all the athletes is not completely shown right away. Instead, Spielberg shows it in flashback scenes throughout the film all the way up to the end. This helps us remember why Avner (Eric Bana) and his team are doing what they're doing.<br/><br/>Most of the film concerns Avner and his team tracking down every single senior terrorist responsible for the massacre and disposing of them in unique ways. Not the actual men who carried out the massacre...they are all killed along with the hostages. We're talking about the brains of the operation.<br/><br/>The wealthy Arab men who financed it and set it all up.<br/><br/>A bomb in the telephone and the little girl who almost fatally answers it was a pretty intense scene. The bomb under a man's mattress that's filled with a higher grade explosive than Avner's bomb maker realized. Instead of just blowing the man up inside his hotel room, they accidentally end up taking out an entire floor.<br/><br/>The killing of the female Dutch Assassin with zip guns. (that scene was particularly disturbing to me) Hours...no...days after the film ended, this was the scene that I kept seeing over and over in my mind. You will too when you see this.<br/><br/>Avner and his men are asked to carry these assassinations out by the Israeli government but are considered expendable. If they are caught, Israel will deny all knowledge of them. Even though they are all in the Mossad.<br/><br/>Another fascinating part is Avner's ""source"" for info. This ""source"" will give the location of every terrorist for an extremely high price. The average Black September member costs over $200,000+ to take out. Little does Avner know is that his ""source"" also sells info to the bad guys and soon Avner believes he is being hunted and becomes so paranoid that he slices his own mattress open to see if it contains a bomb. Then he goes and sleeps in the closet.<br/><br/>And just who are the bad guys anyway? That's an interesting question Spielberg proposes. Are Avner and his team just as bad as the terrorists?<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. Just be sure to buy the extra large bucket of popcorn...this movie is almost 3 hours long."
"mad_marge01","10","2","3","14 January 2006"," Munich
","Stephen Spielberg has been elevated from Master Craftsman to Artist with Munich. The movie looks at the hard truth. The post 1967 war Israeli occupation of the West Bank was mentioned in the movie several times as justification by the Palestinians for the Munich debacle. Just as the Munich attack begat the Mossad operation; the Israeli occupation of the West Bank begat the Munich slaughter. This point was illustrated in the final sex scene. The same passion that produces the violence is as strong and unstoppable as a sexual encounter and will beget children fighting for the same cause as their parents. The violence will beget violence. The Israeli government bundled past grievances in the revenge operation and lied to the Mossad operatives. When Eric Bana asked Geoffrey Rush for proof that the people on the list were involved in the planning of Munich, Geoffrey gives him proof of their past involvement in other tragedies. In real life, there was at least 1 instance of completely mistaken identity."

","""Munich"" starts off showing how the massacre of 1972 started, and then it takes the viewers for a ride as it shows the men that tracked the men involved with the attack, and what their job was during this horrible time. Steven Spielberg rebounds from that mess of an action/sci-fi movie known as ""War of the Worlds."" He casts rarely seen talent Eric Bana (last in Troy) and the new James Bond Daniel Craig (Layer Cake) as two of his five mercenaries hired to take out the terrorists. The movie is slow at times, but I think Spielberg did this to let the audience get engaged with the men involved and not with just what they are doing, because both aspects are important in this film. One thing that I enjoyed in the movie was the violence. I thought maybe that he would cut down the violence to get a PG13 rating, but he kept it realistic and gritty. Bana and Craig turn in two of the better performances that I've seen from them. Geoffry Rush also does a good job as their secret boss, whose really not their boss, if you catch my drift. Spielberg leads us on a violent mission through these gentleman's lives, but slows it down a little at the end, however, I enjoyed the movie very much, and look forward to seeing it again."
"Matt_Layden","8","2","3","10 January 2006"," Spielberg Is Back At Directing Good Films.
","The year is 1972 and Palestinian terrorist have eleven Israeli hostages from the Olympcis in Munich. After a shootout and explosions, the deaths of the Israeli Olympians send shock waves through the nation. Avner, an Israeli Mossad officer is given the task of killing those responsible for Munich. Avner and his team begin their mission and it costs them more then they could have expected.<br/><br/>Spielberg's last couple of films have been sub-par at best and seems funny to me that this wave of lackluster films started off as crap and ended off as crap. Both A.I. and War of the Worlds were not of Spielberg's caliber, but now he has made his best film since Saving Private Ryan and is back at directing good films.<br/><br/>Munich is an intense film, it has haunting images, especially the opening segments with the terrorist taking the Israeli hostages. Unlike most films today, Munich is grounded. When people are shot, you see it's grittiness, people don't fly backwards. It's message of violence never solves anything is evident in the film's own violence. From being stabbed in the face with a butcher knife, to being shot in the throat naked. Munich does not go light on the realism of violence.<br/><br/>Bana leads the cast with a great performance, much better then his previous efforts Hulk and Troy, even if he was the best thing in Troy. One scene that connects with the audience is when Bana is talking to his daughter on the phone, when his child says ""dada"" for the first time, the tears of joy and fear are immediately brought to Bana's eyes. He is overjoyed with the fact that he hears his daughter and she knows it's her father, but also fears that if he continues on with the mission, he may never be able to see her. Beautifully done scene, Bana expresses his emotions perfectly and Spielberg captures it all on screen.<br/><br/>Spielberg's last few films have been below his level of directing, War of the Worlds, The Terminal, and Catch Me If You Can were decent films, but not of Spielberg's usual caliber. With Munich Spielberg has directed his best film since Saving Private Ryan. Straight from the start we see the talent of Spielberg as he inter-cuts the actual events of the hostage situation and what Spielberg has recreated. The film runs 163 minutes long, but Spielberg's style is gripping enough to keep us wanting more. Spielberg's visual style is back, with Bana going through the difficulty of his first kill, the blood mixing with the milk from the groceries the victim was carrying is horrifying. Spielberg handles a difficult subject very well showcasing the faults of both sides. <br/><br/>The films faults are few, but the are faults that effect the film nonetheless. The Twin Towers and the sex scene at the end. To me it felt like a Gatorade commercial, with Bana's sweat flying all over the place. You knew that Spielberg was going to inter-cut this scene with the massacre of the hostages and it doesn't fit too well. Running fifteen some odd minutes short of three hours, Munich does drag in some scenes, but others are so intense, that it makes up for it.<br/><br/>The film is controversial and will challenge you to think if what they did was justified. You can make your own judgement on that, but we see the horrors that plague Bana after his mission was ""over"". Trying to cope with his ordinary life with his family, looking over his soldier for somebody that may have a target on him. Paraniod and Depressed is how he feels after his actions, not being able to sleep, always looking out his window. Whether you can connect with it's characters or not, you have to give sympathy for the hardships that he had to endure, and will endure.<br/><br/>In Munich we get a glimpse of what Bond will look like in the upcoming Casino Royale. As Spielberg gives Craig a silenced handgun, it screams bond and was humorous to see. You may not cry at this film, but you will be changed in some way. It's intensity and message is conveyed clearly and will affect those we see this film. Steven Spielberg creates a film that has impressive acting, beautiful visuals and a tight script which all make Munich a perfect choice for a Best Picture Nominee at the Oscars."

","I don't usually write reviews on IMDb.com but after seeing this, I felt compelled to so here goes. It isn't often that I come across films like this or watch them but when I do I do enjoy it immensely. Coming from Steven Spielberg, I really expected a CGI fest or some sort of other ""wow"" factor. Well label me as surprised because I can honestly say that I think that this was the first Spielberg film that I would call a truly adult film: not adult as in ""top of the shelf adult"" (you dirty minders...you know who you are) but as an adult story. Non of the directors usual sentimentality or divulging into simplistic child like fantasy here. Based on the true story of the Black September aftermath, this film was a slow build up of tension and when it was at its peak, it threw in more tension. Yes I was bored through some of the scenes but the boredom (for me anyway) added to the tension and mood. It has been a long time since I've seen a film in which the emotions of the characters carry the film like this and I found it refreshing to see. The assassinations/murders as they happen are quick, brutal and downright shocking. Even if the viewer is clued up on the history of Black September...it still is a nail biting ride. A thinking mans film that answers some questions and leaves the viewer to ask some questions. Recommended."

"tomgillespie2002","9","1","1","16 October 2015"," Spielberg at his most mature and unsentimental
","Steven Spielberg's Munich questions the value of compromising your own ideals in the name of retaliation, whether 'doing what your enemies do' is a necessary stance or the beginning of a downwards spiral towards violence and bloodshed of which there is no end, and ultimately, no point. There are ancient political and religious rivalries in Ireland, South Africa and, especially, Israel; countries that have been torn apart by civil unrest. There seems no reasonable solution apart from forgiving and forgetting, but this doesn't seem to be an option. In the wake of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munch Olympics, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) decides that lawful justice will not suffice for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and team members.<br/><br/>A crack team is put together to carry out a series of carefully planned assassinations of alleged members of the Black September group. The group's leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent and soon-to-be father who is briefed of his task by the shadowy go- between Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush). The rest of the team is Carl (Ciaran Hinds), a clean-up man, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), an expert bomb-maker, Steve (Daniel Craig), a South African weapons handler, and Hans (Hanns Zischler), a professional document forger. Their first hit takes them to Rome, where they are sold information on the whereabouts of target Wael Zwaiter (Makram Khoury) by a Frenchman named Louis (Mathieu Amalric), who claims to work for an organisation unaffiliated with any government.<br/><br/>Highly controversial upon its release, some extreme views questioned director Spielberg's sympathies and ultimate goal. For most people not directly linked to the various religious groups and organisations seen in the film, it should be clear that Spielberg makes a point in showing both sides as equally sympathetic and morally ambiguous. Every attack and execution is a result of one action or another, bringing into question the whole idea of revenge (the movie is based on the book Vengeance by Yuval Aviv, who Bana's character is a fictional substitution for). Israel itself plays a key role. Although we spend little time there. Munich takes us to Italy, Greece, England, Spain, Lebanon and America, but Israel's disputed lands are never far from the characters minds.<br/><br/>Avner is an especially haunted soul, questioning the ethics of his operation and plagued by visions of the events at the Munich Olympics, the latter of which are portrayed with a chilling authenticity at various point throughout the film. He later meets Louis' 'Papa' (Michael Lonsdale), who argues that family, over any government or religious organisation, is the only unit worth fighting for, casting Avner's mind back to his recently-born child. The ensemble cast do a very good job at carrying the weighty tones of the film on their shoulders, but it is Spielberg himself who is the most deserving of acclaim here. It is the director at his most mature and unsentimental, and as the industry's most famous Jew he has taken a huge risk by tackling an extremely sensitive issue. It upset the people on both sides, but that is precisely the point. How can anyone come out of such a bloodied conflict, of which there is no clear end in sight, with a clear conscience?"

The plot was very well written and the characters were brilliantly constructed. The acting was best aspect of the film, Eric Bana should have one an Oscar for his performance. He pulls off his character in a realistic way and it made the film more believable.

"evancyl","9","1","1","12 October 2014"," Suspenseful action-packed thriller with great intellectual and emotional depth
","Centred on Mossad's systematic assassinations of the Palestinians behind the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, Munich is both a suspenseful action-packed thriller and a stirring portrayal of the agent tasked with this grueling mission. <br/><br/>It asks deep questions that were especially pertinent post-911 and that remain relevant today, what with rebel groups still very much alive. Given the reprisals spawned by each assassination attempt made by Avner and his team, do revenge attacks make a country safer or do they just perpetuate an endless cycle of violence? Are national security agencies justified in taking action against suspects without strong/direct evidence? The film also shows the effects that killing (even where it's for a just cause) can have on a person. Avner struggles to shoot his first victim and is overwhelmed by the gruesomeness of it. But soon, he gets comfortable with his role and finds himself pursuing anyone who tries to stop him or hurts his team. The experience leaves a deep mark on him however. Throughout, he fears for his family's safety and even after the mission is over, has nightmares and suffers from paranoia. <br/><br/>Intellectual and emotional depth aside, Munich had many tense, exciting moments followed by great action scenes. I was kept glued to the screen. Watching the team members, with their quirks and diverse backgrounds, work together in such a high-stakes environment was also highly entertaining. Spielberg chose a very effective way to tell the story - current events interspersed with episodes from the Munich massacre as Avner visualised it. This helped to build suspense, and also mimicked the deep impact that the massacre had on the collective consciousness of the Jews, especially the team charged with executing revenge.<br/><br/>I wouldn't ordinarily recommend violent films, but this one stands head and shoulders above the pack for the important story it tells."

","Steven Spielberg has done it again. He is one of the best Sci-Fi directors of all time but he also shines in Non-fiction dramas as well. Personally I think this is much better than Lincoln, but not nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan. It dives deep into how Avner had to deal with the psychological troubles assassins go through. Eric Bana plays the lead and gives the character much depth that I think the other characters struggled from. May very well be Bana's best performance in his career. Daniel Craig was also good as one of his four partners, (Pre James Bond days). What I really liked about this film was the fact that they didn't cut out the Israeli's as the heroes. As dark of a film as it is, it needed lighter and more pleasant scenes, and you get that with Bana's family, lead by the beautiful Ayelet Zurer. It's truly a great historical piece, no matter how close it was to depicting true events or not. John Williams also added intensity with his score, and the cinematography was great as well. I can't really say it was an enjoyable film, considering people were being killed every 15 minutes, but its an interesting watch.

","A provocative illustration of the aftermath of 1972 Munich massacre, a tricky meditation on morality & arguably the most controversial film of Steven Spielberg's filmmaking career, Munich is an intimately crafted, meticulously detailed & technically sound cinema that dares to examine both sides of a single coin yet ends up being an unsatisfying, convoluted mess.<br/><br/>Based on the infamous incident at 1972 Olympics in Munich where 11 Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, the story of Munich follows the aftermath of that event and focuses on the secret retaliation program carried out by the Israeli government to track down & kill the alleged members of Black September; the group responsible for the Munich massacre.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens with an extremely accurate depiction of the massacre, followed by Israel's own response to the terror attack and for the first half of its 163 minutes of runtime, it's very engaging. But then the gear shifts, the fictional elements start taking over the factual ones & the control is eventually lost as the story entangles itself into one mess after another.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is as accomplished as any other Spielberg feature. Most of its depicted events are factually correct, Production design team manages to recreate the environment with strong emphasis on authenticity, Cinematography makes excellent use of the camera & lighting, Editing paces the film at its own desired pace but could've used a bit of acceleration while John Williams delivers with an emotionally-scarring score.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Munich features a pretty reliable cast in Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz & others, and while their characters do have a depth & the performances are equally good, this aspect of the film never really stands out. Also, it was good to see the film not submitting itself to a one-sided perspective for it questions the whole act of retaliation, if it was worth it in the end & if it in any way accomplished anything.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Munich is one of Steven Spielberg's most polarising works that's going to divide its audience with the difficult questions it has in store but purely from storytelling perspective, there was enough room for improvement as the story completely fails to hold its grasp in the later half. Nevertheless, Munich still makes up for an intriguing experience & shows a new dimension of Spielberg that many will find rewarding and for that, it's definitely worth a shot."
"ashi-lance","8","1","1","6 February 2013"," Munich (2005)
","Munich ,a thriller that deals with Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes by Black September at the 1972 Munich Olympics, is a near flawless piece. There is a definite message in this film and it's obvious to anyone who sees this movie and understands politics. It's important to point out that this film is ""based on real events"" and is not true-to-life as far as the history of Munich's aftermath. If you're okay with that, then it's an excellent story. The Jews had always been a recipient of numerous conflicts and atrocities since the ages of antiquity. They had been involved in slavery, territorial conflicts, racial discrimination and struggle, religious controversies and several other misunderstandings and for that the Jews is considered to be the most sensationalized race in this world. The most often miserable fate of the Jews has countlessly been re-portrayed in film and has captured considerable sympathizers. Since the Jews had been in conflict with different races and countries, their never-ending history of war is not anymore new to the world. And movies with their struggle against countries like Egypt, Greece, Rome and Germany had continually haunted every audience. Spielberg didn't reside on what just actually happened on the Munich Olympics hostage tragedy and its aftermath but it tried to depict the characters' dilemma on their given assignments since the predefined missions were not really clear and pure. Although the veil of nationalism and justice was the major pretext of their elders, Avner(played by Eric Bana) was caught between conspiracies he had no clue of and would somehow fail to understand unless his elders feed him the truth. The already sensationalized history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has smoothly shifted to the dilemma of the character and his allies, giving us a point of view that we need to reconsider and reflect as well as it is often overlooked in most sensationalized and biased situations as that. The memorable aspect of this film are the tragic flashbacks of the events at Munich with the Israeli team being taken hostage to their haunting deaths at the end but to me personally best part was a postscript note that says 9 of the 11 men targeted by Mossad were eventually assassinated. It's again nothing less than a masterpiece from a great director and one could just imagine how Spielberg was able to harmonize and give rhythm to a number of short scenes on the movie to create an overall theme of pure drama and portrayal of the effects of the Black September tragedy in Munich to the individuals related and to the world. <br/><br/>My Rating - 8/10"
"jdkraus","10","1","1","3 July 2012"," Violence is what makes us lose our souls as well as our minds...
","""Did we accomplish anything at all? Every man we killed has been replaced by worse."" The lead character Avner (Eric Bana) makes this statement at the end of this thoroughly engaging film. This phrase relates to the basis of the war that has gone on for nearly a century between Palestine and Israel. In part, it also relates to this movie. Based off of George Jonas's novel ""Vengeance,"" ""Munich"" explores one of the Israeli teams assigned to take out the 11 masterminds behind the 1972 Olympic Massacre. Like the book, the story is seen through the eyes of Avner, the head of this Israeli team.<br/><br/>When approached by Golda Meir for his assignment, he is at first reluctant. He eventually signs up, feeling it is his duty to serve his people. He also needs the money to support his very pregnant wife. When he and his team track down their first target, he at first hesitates and then kills him. After this first hit, the violence almost becomes second nature—more and more people die. It is not until Avner starts losing people that paranoia starts to infest inside him and his inner self begins to deteriorate. This is particularly reinforced with only bits of information of the Munich massacre being shown at a time throughout the film. This eventually builds into a final climax on how the violence has turned him into a target as well as disturbs him. Among the most important scenes in the film is when one of Avner friends informs him, ""We are supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. And we're losing it. If I lose that, that's everything. That's my soul."" This goes back to the meaning of Avner's line at the end of the film. What had they accomplished in killing 7 men? Only more and much worse people will take over, and it is at the expense of his friends and his soul. This message alone is what makes ""Munich"" such an excellent film. <br/><br/>I have read George Jonas's novel and it is one of my favorite reads. It is written like a documentary, but it reads as an espionage thriller. In the film ""Munich,"" the use of archive footage on TV sets, a dramatization of the horrific events, and even the use of hand-held in the heat of the action attest to a gritty, accurate take of the novel. Simultaneously, Spielberg and his team master a breathtaking feat full of thrills and violence. Janusz Kaminski's grim and de- saturated color schemes create an ominous mood. John Williams heart-pounding and occasionally sorrowful score adds additional elements of emotion. The sets and costumes assist in making a realistic look of the 70s in Europe, America, and the Middle East. Michael Kahn's style of editing creates tension within the story and helps push it forward with perfect execution. <br/><br/>To add more positives, this film has a great supporting cast, which includes: Geoffrey Rush, Cirian Hinds, Daniel Craig, and Michael Lonsdale. The real magic though falls on Eric Bana. I never imagined him as a lead. Even so, he embodies the Avner character well. Much of this is accomplished through his non-verbal cues. One scene that stands out is when he tears a room apart, looking for any potential bombs or booby traps. You can tell this man is not only paranoid, but is afraid of dying—just like the rest of us. <br/><br/>""Munch"" was nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Picture and Director in 2006. It did not win any of them. There was a lot of competition that year. In my opinion, ""Munich"" is one of the most deserving of movies in '06. It is engaging, powerful, intense, and extremely violent. Forty years after these events, Israel and Palestine still has not learned anything. It has been privilege to finally see this movie."

It masterfully shows their confidence gradually dissolving as they come face to face with nagging doubt, and the growing realization that violence only engenders violence. Note that the film doesn't do this in a heavy-handed manner. While some have criticized him for being naive, I believe Spielberg's only motive is to step back and look at the entire conflict from a distance. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"
"phenomynouss","10","1","1","30 December 2008"," A second viewing later and I've fallen in love with the characters and story
","I first saw the movie when it came out in theaters in December 2005, and was ultimately forgotten by me, until I decided to buy it on DVD two and a half years later and watched it again. And I found that the movie was highly enjoyable, entertaining, and something that I could easily watch again and again just for the character interaction.<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems ridiculous to base politics and beliefs off what is seen in movies, but this wouldn't be the first time it's happened to me; before seeing the movie, I saw Israel as the wrong party in the Middle East, having stolen Palestinian land, and then leeching US assistance in oppressing Palestinians just because they lived in Israel 2,000 years ago. After this movie, I can't see either side as bad. It's a conflict beyond black and white whose basest participants are nowhere near anything resembling Stalinist or Hitleresque evil people they are made out to be by their enemies via propaganda or extremist ideology.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the movie is done in amazing fashion that makes you feel as though you are watching the news and hearing about the events unfold in real time with your supportive Muslim family and your tense, frozen-stiff with terror Jewish family, while you also get very beautifully shot and gory scenes of the Black September terrorists breaking into the Israeli athletes' hotel room in Munich, where the fighting and conflict is so well-directed, you feel as if you were one of the Israelis, and that if you just stayed quiet and followed orders, you would make it out alive.<br/><br/>What ultimately happens is already well-known, but still hits painfully, and with the simultaneous reading of the Israeli names of the victims on the news with the Palestinian names of those who planned the botched kidnapping listed off by Mossad high command.<br/><br/>Every character that is come across in the film is interesting, and has innate chemistry with whomever else they're talking to. Eric Bana as Avner is perfect in the role, being highly sympathetic even as he is indeed a terrorist. Ciaran Hinds as Carl plays the father-like figure to Avner and the rest of the group, like a rock holding the makeshift family together. Daniel Craig as Steve is the quintessential hothead who seems the be the prototypical terrorist in that he is driven purely by hatred for the Palestinians, yet is still well-rounded in that he is a believable, likable person, without any characteristics that seem wildly out of character for him. Matheiu Kassovitz as Robert is the makeshift bomb-maker, who manages some minor humor that is in no way out of place or inappropriate.<br/><br/>Even their enemies in the conflict are keenly humanized without being overly apologetic, from Abdel Wael Zwaiter in Rome, who is clumsily killed while trying to talk and reason with a highly nervous and tense duo of Avner and Robert, Hussein Al Bashir's brief conversation with Avner in the Cyprus hotel balcony before the bomb under his bed blows him up, and nearly kills Avner and two civilians in the process, to Louis's intentionally bunking the four Mossad agents in an old apartment with a group of Palestinians at the same time, the two groups forced to keep their identities and intentions a secret or else risk exposing their plans to the enemy.<br/><br/>This sequence also has some lighter, and yet in the broader context most deeply disturbing, moments, such as Steve and a Palestinian silently fighting over what music to play on the radio, before mutually settling on an American station (I forgot what type of music), and Avner arguing Arab/Israeli politics with the Palestinian group's leader, with the Palestinian's conclusion that the reason to fight the Israelis over Palestine is that a home is more important than anything else.<br/><br/>Like with most any movie involving a makeshift ""family"" between comrades, there's always the series of events that leads to its dissolution, and for viewers like me, a sense of that time being the best time of their lives, and the (survivors') lives afterwords being bleak and emptier without the comradery. Indeed, even Spielberg said of the character of Avner ""I don't think he'll ever find peace"".<br/><br/>For the negatives, I think the biggest down-point of the movie would be the poorly-explained, completely fictional and unimportant French connection involving ""Louis"" and his whole amoral spy network of secret information and connections that seemingly works everywhere with everyone from terrorists to first world countries, in a sort of ""Quantam"" (""Quantam of Solace"") sort of 'apathetic godly overseer' type role. While at the very least the conversations had with Avner and the old man (forgot his name) at the head of the family, I didn't find it to be all that necessary, and would have spoken more for Mossad's intelligence capabilities if the information on their targets had come from Mossad instead of from an unnamed, barely known, seemingly unstructured independent French organization with eyes all over the world and no real desire to do anything with it but sell information to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>While there are flaws, it's definitely a movie both tragic and enrapturing, grittily shot and realistically depicted, with intense chemistry between virtually everyone involved that makes it worth multiple viewings and owning."

"gelman@attglobal.net","8","1","1","2 September 2006"," Unfairly criticized as anti-Israel
","Steven Spielberg drew quite a hostile reaction from many within the American Jewish community (and in Israel) for what was taken to be a criticism of Israel for its effort to kill the murderers of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich. That criticism focused chiefly on the moral doubts and nightmares suffered toward the end of the picture by the agent, Avener, (Eric Bana) sent by the Mossad to find and execute the members of Black September who had carried out the murders. At the end of the screenplay by Tony Kushner et al., Bana argues with his chief handler that the dead killers have been replaced by people who are even worse and that revenge breeds revenge and will continue forever. What is missing from the screenplay in my view is the appropriate answer to Avner's troubled view -- namely, that failure to punish terrorism will embolden Israel's enemies to continue killing Israelis and Jews all over the world. They must be made to understand that terrorism has deadly consequences for the terrorists. (That point of view is articulated to a very limited extent earlier in the film by the actress playing Golda Meir, then Israel's prime minister, who authorized the reprisals.) Steven Spielberg was so troubled by the criticism that in the DVD version of the film which my wife and I saw, he takes 10 minutes or so before the movie begins to explain why the film is NOT anti-Israel. I didn't think it was. As an ardent supporter of Israel, I had no trouble with the assassinations (now referred to as ""targeted killings"") of the Black September gang, nor did I find it troubling that Bana's character eventually cracks under the strain, having lost several of his comrades while carrying out his assignment. On a far more modest and therefore more human scale, the Israeli film ""Walk on Water"" also deals with the moral struggles of a young Israeli agent instructed to make friends with two grandchildren of a Nazi murderer in order to get to the grandfather and execute him. ""Walk on Water"" is a smaller and more personal film and the emotional effect on the Israeli agent is made more real by the fact that he comes to like the homosexual grandson (though he is prejudiced against gays at the beginning) and falls in love with the granddaughter who has chosen to expiate her country's sins against Jews by living and working on an Israeli kibbutz. The Israeli agent in Munich is under greater stress than the agent in Walk on Water because he has killed seven people and has lost several of his comrades. Yet the emotional and moral dilemmas are much the same. Is Israel justified in seeking out and killing murderers of Jews? Yes. Is it credible that an Israeli assassin would be traumatized by carrying out his assignment? Certainly. Does displaying that dilemma call into question Israel's right to revenge the death of its citizens? Not in my book. Steven Spielberg made a movie, not a propaganda film. He has made other movies that have demonstrated his firm attachment to the Jewish people. If anyone can tell me that he has killed seven people, lost comrades in doing so and been unaffected emotionally or morally, I'm prepared to listen. Otherwise, excuse me, I think this is a fine film (even though I feel Walk on Water was even better)."
"mouse_robot","9","1","1","27 August 2006"," my thoughts on Munich
","There are a number of things that I love about Munich, and one or two things that I find disappointing. Let's start with the good stuff first.<br/><br/>You could tell Spielberg was passionate about this story. it shows through in every frame. It's rare to find this sort of dedication in Hollywood today. I for one am glad that Spielberg chooses to tell challenging stories that he cares deeply about rather than resting on his laurels.<br/><br/>I love Eric Bana's performance in his movie. There is one point where the character of Louis says I could be anybody, you could as well. Or something like that. Avner literally has to be anybody if he is to carry out his mission. Anybosy aside from who he actually is of course. That this facade takes so long to crack is one of the most interesting things about Avner.<br/><br/>My interpretation of the ending is that Spielberg feels that Isreal should unite Jews, when in the end scene it divides Avner and Efraim. I think that the movie is bitter about this but has hope for that things will be different in the future. I don't think it was an accident that Munich was released during Hannukah.<br/><br/>Now for the stuff I didn't like. I hated the sex scene. I understand the point it was trying to make. But I would that Avner's demons would be his own acts of violence, and not the Munich massacre. I also didn't like the scene in which Avner storms the Isreali consulate and screams at them to leave his family alone. We've scene this kind of scene in dozens of cheesy thrillers, and just for a moment this scene reduces Munich to that level.<br/><br/>But those are relatively minor quibbles. Munich remains not only a stirring and passionate political tale, but also a masterpiece of suspense."
"heimann-2","9","1","1","29 June 2006"," Munich is an excellent treatise of a millennium old state of mind
","Munich is summarised in (I believe)the last word uttered in the movie ""NO"" I watched the movie on DVD in the comfort of my lounge - I didn't want to see it in a public place. I believe it absolutely captured the Israeli approach to their collective future. It also absolutely captured the Israeli brevity of emotion in particular circumstances. I have not read one word of commentary by anyone on this movie - i witnessed the actual Munich situation and didn't need to be reminded. What really grabbed me was the message of the movie - we have heard the message many times before. However, this movie delivered it without frills and therefore was so effective. Israelis and Jewish people generally (and I am Jewish)have a particularly strong sense of justice - as well as a strong image of self. Israel is ""our"" country and ""we"" will never be dismissed from that country - Israelis in particular see their country as an inviolate state of their right to exist after untold periods of suppression and violation. This is what Munich is about - the Spymaster's word ""no"" at the end of the film is seen as absolutely the last word to the entire world. No you will not defeat us! No we will not accept violation! No you cannot hurt us without being hurt in return! Unfortunately, to a large extent, the Arab population throughout the middle east continues to misunderstand that here is a people who would rather visit an entire middle east ""Masada"" than lose either their home or their freedom. Unfortunately, the potential combined economic impact of a united middle east may never be realised - or is that the intention?"
"anthony_mcarthur","10","1","1","22 May 2006"," An Extraordinary Film
","An extraordinary film. I struggled with my preconception that Spielberg, conceptually, would be heavy handed against the Palestinian/Arab side of the story. Thrity minutes into the film, my amazement began to grow at the depth of this film. Half way through the film Spielberg's involvement was not even a thought in my mind. At the end of the film I was left dazed at the compelling depth of the story, the quality of the acting and the technical mastery with which the film was made. Though I have always admired Spielberg for his talent and mastery, I have never much appreciated his actual films. This is by far and away his greatest achievement. I cannot think of a better film that was made in 2005, nor really, one better done yet this century.<br/><br/>Unless I am utter blind and stupid, I would recommend this film equally to Arab or Jew, liberal or conservative. The story defines the situation, the predicament, the history so fully, and thought the point of view is definitely from an Israeli set of eyes, the humanity his enemies so rocks and disrupts his soul that he literally has to walk away. The symbolism of the final scene of the film is remarkable. And those two buildings standing in the background that are no longer there then tell us why Spielberg used so much Vertical patterns in his shots. Kushner and Roth's screenplay is superb. A story told and directed by Jews that is basically asking the questionwhat is all this madness and where will it end? <br/><br/>In our own way, we are all looking over our shoulders, we are all questioning what has happened, we must all be questioning what we have been lead to believe, we are all clinging to our identities while questioning who it is we are in the process of becoming, we are all blinded by this flash and choking in the smoke trying to resurrect some concept, some hope, some tattered dream of peace. But after watching this film few who view it can in honesty turn away untouched. I was deeply disturbed by the truths that this film exposed. My 17 yr old niece refused to watch it because it was too real, instead she wanted to watch ""Scarface"" for the 20th time.<br/><br/>This film should be taught in schools as a reflection of history. I hope that a similar effort exists or will emerge from a Palestinian point of view that will reflect the same depth and complexity of this dilemma, which is not exceeded by any other.<br/><br/>Peace be to Mr. Spielberg and anyone who watches this film with as open a mind and courageous a heart as those who made it."

","Powerful. Tense. Riveting. Everything. A Spielberg masterpiece that should be described in the ""superlative degrees of comparisons only"". <br/><br/>Once again, Steven Spielberg reflects, or perhaps supersedes the methods of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. There's no need to describe the plot. There is no need to explain or criticize. It's the ""way"", the technique, the presentation, the integration of location +character+music+plot+effects that ascends to a heretofore unattained level of action and suspense. If you are able to look past the political issue, you will see a modern cinema masterpiece. Spielberg has come light years from 'Star Wars', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Jurassic Park'. Creations such as 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and now 'Munich' make his science fiction entertainment seem like merely toys for children.<br/><br/>The film makes a political statement. It's bound to be controversial. The shady world of cross and double cross espionage, and an expose of, perhaps, a terrifying underground war, fought without concern for borders or boundaries. The presentation is far from one sided. In fact, there is a scene that parallels that of the captured German soldier in 'Pvt. Ryan', you get to see and hear 'the enemy'. It is not a 'war movie' as you might be used to, but it is a 'war movie' and the assassins eventually begin question their common confusion about the 'ethics' of their mission in this war.<br/><br/>This is cinema 101. A must see masterpiece.<br/><br/>As for the story, and the emotions that you're sure to experience, see it for yourself."

Toward the end of the film, Avner who has heard the tale that one of his victims lives with so much fear sleeps in a closet, winds up spending a night in one himself.<br/><br/>The film is a metaphor for this country's current War on Terrorism: you kill one and a half dozen more spring up in his place, some worse than the person you eliminated. There is the fact that no matter how carefully you plan to kill villains, innocents die too. The movie exposes the notion that regardless of the ""righteousness"" of your motives, the other guy generally has a ""righteous"" motive as well. The Israeli government purportedly paid one million dollars to kill 5 men on their hit list. The U.S. is spending billions, yet you wonder if the Israelis or Americans get their money's worth. Perhaps their million (like our billions) could have been spent in a way that would have mended some wounds instead of opening new ones. In the movie, those who expressed pride in the team's acts were safe, far away from the bloodshed. Finally, the movie illustrates what we should all know by now, that killing claims the highest price of all."

","Not a totally faultless film - Rush's performance is perhaps too inconsistent, and it may be a little over long - but this is Spielberg's Best Film all round. I'm thinking possibly because it is his most morally 'ambivalent', and it contains many curious facets. Previously his serious films seem to have been built of neatly constructed and shaped cubes that are stacked with great surety, and yet somehow this regularity seemed to deny the randomness of 'real life'. MUNICH contains many odd-shaped components that when stacked into an impressive whole, create the unease and unpredictability of human existence. Life's not made up of bad guys and good guys - rather there are good guys who do bad and vice versa. It's an impressively mounted piece of work, and one can't help wondering if the speed of the production process which meant shooting in June, and delivering finished prints by Christmas, has aided in eliminating the opportunity for an overly studied and crafted feel. MUNICH is a valuable contribution to debate on current global geopolitical questions, smartly articulated in the final scene, with the final pan sounding a premonitory but discreet warning of things to come."

Eric Bana plays Avner Kaufman, a Mossad agent appointed as leader to a group of men charged with hunting down the terrorists of Black September. The story is bloody, and does not pull any punches.

For every violent act of justice one society performs against another so they will live in fear of retribution.

","""Home is everything"" In the midst of this tense, violent tale of retribution for the assassination of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, is this fundamental yet poignant reminder of why there is so much unrest in Israel. Both Palestinians fight for their homeland and that supersedes all other calls for peace. Spielberg creates a film that resonates with his own Jewishness and yet is placed smack dab in the middle of the issue to the dismay of both Israelis and Palestinians. Eric Bana does a convincing job showing us the conflict between his desire to do right by his country and his need to provide for his growing family. His cohort of fellow assassins are a motley group of men who, in their quirky way, endear us to them and their cause. The movie the tense moments surrounding the 1972 Munich Olympics as the scene is juxtaposed between the actual telecasts and the movie. We then are taken to the board room where Israeli Prime Minister, Gold Meir assesses the situation and decides to send Avner (Bana) to head a team of killers to pay back Israel's woe. In her own words, ""Forget peace for now. We have to show them we're strong."" Throughout the tension of each of the killings-some comic and some close calls- the viewer is prodded to ask ""Is this really the best way to punish wrongdoing?"" ""Is this the most effective and acceptable method of responding?"" Even though the film is grounded in Spielberg's own Jewish proclivities, you cannot help but have some semblance of sympathy for the Palestinian cause when you hear the Palestinian freedom fighter declare, ""Home is everything"". As one who has visited Israel and who has grieved with the rest of the world at the horrors of the Holocaust, it is easy to understand the Jews longing for a homeland and how Israel is the best fit. However, you can also understand the plight of the Palestinians who have been forced to be refugees and who also lay claim to Israel. Perhaps it is for this reason that ""Munich"" ends in an open-ended way, leaving the viewer to make up his own mind and making a bit clearer the consequences of both positions."
"dfranzen70","9","1","1","6 February 2006"," Fascinating, unsettling
","Gripping, almost unwatchable drama about the assassinations of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Steven Spielberg's narrative is never complacent, and it never seems to take the easy way out, choosing not to portray either side as completely good or bad.<br/><br/>Told from the viewpoint of Avner (Eric Bana, who looks like a younger Liam Neeson), a man charged by Israel to avenge the deaths of the athletes - no matter what the cost. Avner is given a small group of men with which to carry out his task: Kill all 11 members of the terrorist group Black September.<br/><br/>Although not quite as evocative or provocative (to me) as Spielberg's earlier Schindler's List, Munich is compelling nonfiction, crisply moving Avner and his crew from target to target and juxtaposing his thirst for revenge with his thoughts of his family, including his newborn daughter. Spielberg does a good job, too, of compelling the viewer to care about Avner, even while the latter mows down bad men using guns and bombs and other toys.<br/><br/>The movie is unsettling, probably much more so if you remember the events of the 1972 Olympics, which I do not. In fact, considering I am not Jewish and do not remember those events, this movie still unnerved me quite a bit. One of the recurring themes is the old ""eye for an eye"" mantra that pops up in any revenge tale. Which is preferred - sinking to the level of our enemies, or rising above it? It's not a question that's easily answered.<br/><br/>Bana is very good as Avner, as is Geoffrey Rush (whom I almost mistook for James Woods) as Avner's liaison with Mossad. There's not a slacker in the bunch, though, no insincere performances, no flat notes.<br/><br/>The movie manages to be eerily compelling considering that the outcome is already known - that it, in fact, is still fresh in the minds of many people. Schindler's List had the benefit of arriving more than 50 years after the Holocaust, but with the events in Munich so chronologically close, it would have been easy for the story to lose its footing, to perhaps expose itself as propaganda one way or another. But it doesn't. Although it is pro-Israeli, it is not so to the exclusion of anti-Israeli views; to wit, it is not posited as a clear honorable-revenge story with an easily seen resolution."

It is almost definitely an emotional roller-coaster with the ability to make you laugh, cry, jump out of your seat, bite your nails and with some extremely bloody violence make even the strongest feel squeamish. Acting wise, Bana's performance for me should have got him a nod from Mr Oscar, it is a performance that shows us just how versatile he is, from maniac man (Chopper),big green bloke (hulk), sandal wearing sword swinger (Troy) to this career best performance as an under experienced assassin. Spielberg is on fine form also, making sure that we get the full effect of every emotion and every death, and although political makes it easy enough for everyone to understand.

I think, any viewer would feel compassion for the Palestinian's also from this piece. However, I can see how Palestinans would not be satisfied, but trust me, the point was made several times, very explicitly, that they both share the same story. Displaced. No home. Brutal tactics. Fight or die.<br/><br/>I spent a month in Israel in '73. I was 19 and sleeping on the beaches at Eilat on the Red Sea. Golda Mier came to town and they used fire hoses to get us off the beach but it was all good natured. So we built hippie shanties out of cardboard in hills. I slept in city parks all around Israel and the occupied territories. Stayed in several kibbutz settlements where goats like to eat passports. I hiked alone and camped in the mountains above the Dead Sea. Played chess in open-air, dive bars drinking beer till the wee hours. <br/><br/>I went there to see what it was like to have your back against the wall and see what war cost you, does for you and to you. It was like going back in time to our own American Revolutionary War. I was not disappointed. That's what ""Munich"" accomplishes. War is not tidy.<br/><br/>I took a ship from Haifa to Cyprus. You couldn't go directly from Israel to an Arab country, so Cyprus was the stepping stone. Israel doesn't stamp the passport directly, but gave me a sheet to hold their passport stamp. That way you can toss it and get into the Arab countries. The night I got to Cyprus 30 bombs went off in the capital. It was unstable, but more from the Greeks and Turks who both claim Cyprus. I got the next ship out to Beirut.<br/><br/>Beirut was beautiful in '73. This was a few years before Lebanon started to melt down, but I was in the city right around the time of the para-military raid they depicted in the movie. I spent a few weeks in the Beka Valley near Syria exploring the Roman ruins. The hash oil trade was the main line of business in village where I stayed, but I declined to buy into it no matter how attractive and safe the dealers made it appear. <br/><br/>When I saw ""Midnight Express"" five years later in 1978 it made my butt pucker. I took the same path as the main character over land through Syria and Turkey to Europe. Syria was full of Soviet goods like the very heavy, clunky cameras that, nevertheless, worked pretty well. Turkey was full of 1956 Chevy's. I ate some bad sausage in Turkey and almost died for a few weeks. Beautiful land. <br/><br/>My point is that being around there a few months gave me good feel for the very complicated, intractable situation and a love for all the people involved. Steven Spielberg does an honorable job with ""Munich."" Well, maybe the last speech by main character's mother was a bit much, but just a bit.

One by one Avner and his team track down the involved people across the European landscape.<br/><br/>The incident of the Munich Olpymics is vividly recreated by Steven Spielberg, the 1970's is meticulously detailed against the rich backdrop of the European cities. Munich is a great, thrilling political drama on the terrorist attack, blending fact and fiction. Spielberg has captured the coldness that surrounds the situation, and the retaliation taken by the Israeli government. During the scenes of the assassinations, the tension is so taunt and of such a high caliber. Its unnerving that we are shown the detail and precision of the attacks; how they construct the bombs and contraptions, and the set up to place them. It really shows the commitment they are taking to complete their task. The attacks are more unnerving and realistic with the graphic violence.<br/><br/>Holding Munich back from reaching a brilliant thriller is the length. It has a drawn out pace with the story. The tension doesn't keep an even pace, due to the pacing of the film. When there should have been rapid fire tense scene after one another with little breathing space, we're given to much breathing space, letting the tense atmosphere slip. Munich starts to fall towards the end, leaving the political tension for family drama. Yet there is much paranoia captured in Avner, trying to keep his family safe.<br/><br/>While this could have been a one sided story, we are shown both sides, hearing both the Israelis and Palestinias. We hear their argument and the commitment they hold for their beliefs. While Avner is shown as a noble man, committing deplorable acts, while we can sympathise with him, we still aren't meant to accept what he's doing.<br/><br/>In a career defining role, Eric Bana gives his best performance to date. He perfectly embodies Avner, showing the eternal conflict he has, yet the commitment for the task. Daniel Craig seems miss casted as Steve, though does a good performance. Geoffrey Rush shows another strong job in the minimal role of Ephraim. Completing the assassin team; Ciarn Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler all give gripping performances. Steven Speilbergs direction is wonderful. We are taken head first into the story, yet Spielberg's direction isn't intrusive, letting the story come out.<br/><br/>Though it may be drawn out to much, Munich still is a gripping thriller, on the retaliation taken out on this tragic event."

"moviecool","7","1","1","8 January 2006"," A very well-made, thrilling movie whose message is a little messed up
","Having seen Munich yesterday myself and wondering how its politics would be, I was very surprised. In the film, while Spielberg showed the killings as gruesome, he focused more on the personal elements of Avner and the terrorists' lives. I expected that the movie would be outright against the ""revenge,"" and it was a pleasant surprise to me that the film treated it as something justified but a little too far. The politics I found pretty clear, though, was that Israel is supposedly ""sleazy"" and ""careless."" However, the film was INSPIRED by real events, so most of it could all be seen as playing into Avner's personal life.<br/><br/>What the film failed to grasp was that Israeli (and even some American) anti-terror missions are both vengeful and preemptive, as assassination of these terrorists helped bring an end to years of terror, as shown in the news clips in Munich. Also, a small detail that was interesting was the terrorists always driving Mercedes Benzes.<br/><br/>It was a very good film, though, and to me showed what people who work to fight against terrorism must go through and their emotional breakdowns. It left me with mixed feelings about its politics and how truthful they were, although much of the movie wasn't actually true, but it also left me with one definite feeling: terror."
"desperatethespian","1","9","25","25 December 2005"," A scurrilous screed, more anti-Israel and offensive than Paradise Now
","I am shocked. Simply numbed beyond words. With the release of 'Munich', Stephen Spielberg has created the most offensive, vicious attack on the integrity and validity of the State of Israel since, well, the widely-discredited book on which this paean to anti-Zionism was based. He has debased, defamed, impugned and offended every man, woman and child who has given his/her life for the creation and sustenance of the Jewish state. The man who has single-handedly made it his life mission to ensure that a vivid, living testimonial to the Holocaust and Jewish history endures has turned his back on the present and future of his people.<br/><br/>My objections do not entirely mirror those of many of the other reviews I've read. Sure, the targets of the Mossad team's assassinations are portrayed EXCLUSIVELY and SOLELY as lovers of literature, doting fathers, harmless flirts, refined and sophisticated family men, etc. rather than the terrorist masterminds that they were. And yes, the Palestinian characters in the piece are given free reign to inveigh passionately on the 'justice' of their cause and the gripes that they have, without so much as a peep of retort from anything remotely resembling anything pro-Israeli. In fact, some of the lines that the Israelis say make them sound more bloodthirsty, parochial, self-obsessed and evil than the docile, art-loving, universalist Palestinian terrorists they are dispatched to eliminate (oh, were they terrorists? I was too busy watching them insist on paying for milk at the grocery store and translating works of literature to remember why they were being hunted). Lines like 'the only blood I care about is Jewish blood' and 'how do you think we got this land?! Through violence!' (paraphrase) were clearly not intended to elicit the same sympathy that seeing a terrorist who's planned the murder of innocents tenderly speak to his daughter is supposed to. So it's unbalanced. So there were speeches that bothered me. Eh, I can live with that. It's just a movie, after all, and Hollywood artisans are bound to put their own spins on hot-button political topics, and one cannot expect it to be anything more than oversimplified and one-sided in the context of a film.<br/><br/>Similarly, I disagreed with Spielberg's central assertion, repeated over and over throughout the film, that meting out punishment to criminals that fit the crimes they commit ONLY results in more crime, i.e. that violence begets ONLY violence. (In case you didn't quite get it the first hundred times it's brought up in such wink-wink, none-too-subtle references as immediately following the Mossad team's bombing of a terrorist with a terrorist bombing of innocents in the very next scene, the movie ends with an excruciatingly long shot of the World Trade Center. Get it? 9/11 stems from the fact that victims of terror have the audacity to strike back at their oppressors rather than succumbing to their wishes, which in turn leads the terrorists to strike again, Hint hint). The very famous, and equally tired, 'cycle of violence' lament. This sort of hippie-dippie, passive, thinking is a hallmark of the extreme left, and the kind of thinking that led to World War II, when Hitler's megalomaniacal moves were met by concession and appeasement by the West. It's the sort of thinking that would have invited Osama bin Laden for dialogue, or turned the other cheek, rather than pursuing him, after 9/11. What makes Spielberg's dope-smoking, turn-the other cheek, peace on earth nonsense all the more preposterous is that he does not even offer an alternative to exacting revenge on criminals and terrorists. He doesn't suggest dialogue as a viable means of righting a wrong or any other means of reconciliation. He only condemns: saying, implicitly and explicitly, through the voices of the characters and the consequences of their actions, exacting revenge on those who harm you is bad, ineffective, even morally equivalent (note the reprehensible interspersing of the voices naming the names of the 11 athletes and the 11 terrorists in one of the early sequences of the film, suggesting a moral equivalence between their deaths) and tantamount to terror. But he does not offer any discernible alternative, other than to roll over and die. That's been tried, for hundreds of years of Jewish history. It doesn't quite work.<br/><br/>Much as all of the aforementioned bothered me, I was willing to accept the film as an exciting, intriguing, if not entirely balanced work of art...until the last fifteen or so minutes. That's when it became clear that Spielberg had a vicious agenda to promote, one that is all the more hurtful, offensive, callous and Judas-esquire, insofar as it comes from the mind of a man who is purportedly a great admirer and fan of the state of Israel, but who comes off making a statement that would be more fitting in the works of Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, or worse."
"sftiger","10","6","15","21 December 2005"," A brilliant exploration of the moral costs of violence.
","""Munich"" is a tremendous movie, thanks largely to Tony Kushner's brilliant screenplay, that explores the nature and moral costs of violence. As such it is necessarily an extremely graphic film in its depictions of violence.<br/><br/>Based on historical events that began at the 1972 Munich Olympics: the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists, and the Israeli efforts to assassinate those who planned and carried out that attack the movie centers on Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana in a wonderful performance) who leads the Israeli death squad. Bana shows Kaufman, a gentle patriot, whose work pulls him from his pregnant wife, being deeply transformed by the brutality of his work. Around this transformation we see others, mostly Israelis, and their attitudes about what has been or must be done.<br/><br/>With Kushner's script and Spielberg's direction the actors all around share credit for fleshing out characters that could easily be cliché and stereotype into more fully human figures. Some of the more peripheral figures even present more depth and reflection on the range of opinions and experience of Isreali Jews than do some of Kaufman's teammates.<br/><br/>This film is sure to raise a lot of political controversy, and anyone with an opinion will find both brilliance and flaws. From my own perspective, I was dismayed that Israeli terrorists were fully fleshed humans we were drawn to care about, and Palestinian terrorists were little more than props and targets. On the other hand, some of the Israelis articulate points that will anger fervent Zionists including acknowledgment that whatever Israel is it is land taken by force from Palestinians. While this is a very Jewish film, it accepts no easy assumptions about the Zionist state. Its criticisms will be far too mild for some, and an unconscionable betrayal according to others.<br/><br/>The exploration of violence, whether for or against any state, is one that is far more widely applicable. This film is not just about Jews and Israel, but a cautionary tale about those who use violence and how that feeds into an expanding destructive vortex.<br/><br/>Kushner's script and Bana's performance easily merit Oscar nominations, and this could even get a nod for ""Best Movie."" I think the political questions it raises make a nomination likely, but a win very improbable."
"fayepaul67","3","8","22","24 December 2005"," Munich
","Munich was excruciatingly long and BORING! Why was Kushner asked to to screenplay: ""....Kushner, who laughably stated in the Time magazine piece that he ""never likes to draw lessons for people,"" calls the establishment of the State of Israel ""for the Jewish people a historical, moral, political calamity  I wish the modern Israel hadn't been born."" He slanders the Israeli Defense Forces, snootily declaring, ""I deplore the brutal and illegal tactics of the Israeli Defense Forces in the occupied territories  Jews, of all people, with our history of suffering, should refuse to treat our fellow human beings like that."" Allowing Kushner to write what will probably be seen as the definitive movie on the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics is somewhat like allowing Ramsey Clark to write the definitive account of United States foreign policy in the Middle East...."""

","Unfortunately, I've lost quite a bit of respect for Steven Spielberg. The movie did not represent factual events with the exception of the actual tragedy that occurred in Munich (and that was a small part of the movie). Spielberg equated terrorists with innocent civilians and depicted the Jewish/Israeli people as cold-blooded murderers who would stop at nothing in the name of their homeland. This movie wasn't about the tragic aftermath of the the events at Munich. Instead, this movie was about the consciences of the Jews when seeking out the terrorists. The movie was about sympathy for terrorists who killed 11 athletes in cold blood. Perhaps Spielberg should get his facts straight before imposing his false view on the world. Clearly, the only murderers in this tragedy were those who devised and executed the operation to brutally kill innocent athletes. This movie was beyond offensive."

","I have to admit my confidence, Mr.Spielberg was had faded if not dissappeared after the last Jurassic debacle, but with re-newed faith I gave this film every chance to change a faltering opinion of someone hailed as one of the greatest directors, to my cost I must emphasise. They say a director is alone in his interpretation of his subject matter, in this case very much so as I would be surprised if anyone with a modicum of sense enjoys what is basically self indulgent and very pointless filming with and repeat formula that in this case had me hoping that even the dinosaurs would appear to brighten the day, no such luck. I fought sleep throughout, concede to Mr.Craig who I am sure will go forth to be the very best Bond since Connery or Lazenby, that he must have been tempted by the price tag and of course wowed by the Spielberg label and pedigree in the sad and very insular world which encompasses the Hollywood clique of has beens and played outs who now hold dominion over the majority of your visual leisure. Spielbergs only good move here was casting Craig, doubtless on the basis of his forthcoming fame as 007 in the hope that it would sell what is other wise a waste of your cinema admission. Stay at home for this one, it makes Eastenders dangerous and new. Gibberish, every word of it."

","Usually excellent director Stephen Spielberg (q.v. Saving Private Ryan) seems to have lost it with this confused and confusing mess. As a thriller there's no thrill: No surprises, no twists, no suspense, no interest, and no coherent point of view. By trying (unsuccessfully) to pander to Arab hatred and bigotry simultaneously with sticking (barely) to the basic outline of what should be a strongly pro-Israel story, Spielberg has produced morally equivocal pablum of no interest to anyone. This lousy film should act as a warning to all artists in whatever medium against lying in order to curry favor with tyrants or hate mongers, be they Nazis, Communists, Islamofascists, or any other brand of villain."

","The real question posed by this movie is not when will the middle east violence end(hint: it has something to do with oil), but when will this bad movie end? At 3 hours, the film would have worked better if they dropped the flashback scenes to Munich, dropped the preachy confrontations and re-cast more unknown actors than Eric(Blackhawk Down Hulk) Bana and Geoffrey (better as a prissy pirate) Rush. Spielburg really treats the audience like idiots by dressing the terrorists in the flashback scenes with obvious tacky 70's visual costume cues (terrorist #1 in white ladies hat, terrorist #2 in cowboy hat) that I kept thinking about the excellent Spike Jonez/Beastie Boys music video 'Sabotage' with it's costumed parody. And here's the real clincher towards the end that made me sigh - when the Hulk is making crazy assassin love to his wife, his climaxing scene is inter-cut with flashbacks to the assassination of the hostages and Beastie Boys crew in Munich. I also was having painful flashbacks during this time of the cash I paid to support this crap from a director who needs to try a little more nuance and innovation."

","Who has not felt how sadly sweet<br/><br/>The dream of home, the dream of home, Steals o'er the heart, too soon to fleet,<br/><br/>When far o'er sea or land we roam?"" Thomas Moore<br/><br/>If I ask students to name a great living American director, the answer is almost always ""Stephen Spielberg."" And, of course, they're right. With that fame comes the director's obligation to feed the fans high-quality films as well as satisfy their desire to see films characteristic of that director.<br/><br/>This film critic brought too much of that expectation baggage to Munich, Spielberg's account of the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic games, in which athlete hostages were murdered by the Palestinian terror group Black September. I hoped for insights into the endless battle between Israel and Arabs. What I got was a high-class espionage tale about Israel's attempt to assassinate the Olympic terrorists one by one and a slight nod to the plight of the Palestinians. Much history, little insight.<br/><br/>The pervasive Spielbergean motif of finding home (E.T. for example) is here again in the chief operative, Avner Kaufmann (Eric Bana). After leading a team of 3 others to eliminating most of the terrorists, Kaufmann returns to find life has changed even in his family home, which, like Israel itself, is less safe than when he left on his covert assignment. Here is where the director does his best work by suggesting the endless cycles of crime and punishment, the endless routine of two countries fighting without changing things. ""All this blood comes back to us,"" wisely an assassin observes.<br/><br/>There is a curious simplicity to the film's vision, as if the horrors visited on each country were the result only, for instance, of two countries trying to secure land they believe is theirs. And even that simplicity belies the hatreds that have seethed for ages, separate from the need for land. <br/><br/>My expectations were unmet with Munich: I didn't witness the Spielberg magic of childlike wonder and hope (even those were present in War of the Worlds); I didn't learn much about the complicated conflicts. I'm going to look at Saving Private Ryan to get satisfaction."
"st-shot","5","4","9","25 December 2007"," Spielberg mangles Munich
","Steven Spielberg has about as much success with Munich as Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did when he met with Hitler there in 1939. Spielberg uses as his catalyst the 1972 massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Palestinian terrorists to deliver a semi-factual rambling disjointed, political, suspense film that tries to have it both ways as statement and entertainment. It fails on both accounts and Spielberg's confusion and indecision is clearly the culprit. The film opens grippingly with with the hostage taking scene at the Olympic Village. Then rather than play out the whole incident, Spielberg jumps to the aftermath, decision making and actions to avenge the killings. For the rest of the film flashbacks of the event shove their way back into the plot with unintended meaning. In a scene where the film's main protagonist makes love to his wife, Spielberg inter cuts the final violent moments of the hostage disaster. We are left to wonder if our hero is tortured or turned on by the event. Spielberg is clearly a cheerleader for Israel but he does attempt to put a human face on the Palestinian plight. Even this however comes across as patronizing and highly contrived in a scene where opposing groups have an uneasy truce at a safe house.<br/><br/>Production values are top notch but it doesn't hide the poor editing and overall plot construction. At two hours forty-five minutes long there's plenty of time for repetitive hits and the rationalizing of such acts that could have been summed up in half the time. But Spielberg is in the act of being profound and drone on it must. The Israeli assassins are all noble and nondescript except for Avner who serves as the conscience of the cell and its actions. He is Spielberg's alter ego displaying a gung-ho hesitance but nevertheless steeling himself to commit morally objectionable acts in order to defend the homeland. The heavy handed Mr.Spielberg hammers this point home in the final scene of Munich with a distant lingering shot of the World Trade Center Towers, a taunting symbol of what our future holds and how the US will react. One is not sure if Munich is an attempt to absolve Israel of its rogue actions in reaction to the PLO, more firmly cement the bond between the two democracies as victims of terrorism or is a merely a plea for all of us to get along. In the end Spielberg's wishy washy approach as well as the abandonment of his renowned editorial skills leave us with a haphazard piece of questionable history that even doubts itself."
"sumsaris","Null","4","9","3 March 2006"," Curtain Falls on Spielberg
","****Spoilers Included****<br/><br/>It's hard to hit the nail on the head about what doesn't make Spielberg tick. Although the man seems to master all the tricks of his trade, lately they just do not gel to make a coherent moving whole. His dramatic films lack soul. He resounds with the obvious, underlining every line of dialog. The sly innuendo of former years has become stiff with overstatement. His films seem exclusively shot in a vast obvious foreground where no detail is left to the intelligence of the viewer. And perhaps the courtesans of the royal court are afraid to tell the king the bad news for fear of banishment.<br/><br/>Munich proceeds awkwardly as if a first draft story-board had been tacked on the wall during a brainstorming session. A poorly edited hastily pasted pastiche that neither rhymes nor runs with its subject matter. Rome, Athens, nor Munich barely feel like the cities they're supposed to represent (probably because they were filmed inand sponsored by--Hungary and Malta). And the Middle East context reflects such a level of Orange County Jewish Club claustrophobia that one wonders if Spielberg and his harem ever even set foot in Israel to research the film.<br/><br/>The actors for the most part are deployed with the standard two-dimensionality we've been accustomed to in a Spielberg film. Shallow in character, high on histrionics. The Mossad team and its top banana Bana act with about as much authority as the San Fernando Valley Chicano-cum-Indians of Costner's Dances with Wolves. Even the prime minister in Golda Meir has become an off-the-shelf Jewish grandmother. The only credible performance was Michael Lonsdale's even if he was cast in the oft stereotyped role of the sly but slimy Frenchman sitting on the fence profiteering from both sides of a conflict (aka The Deer Hunter). And am I mistaken or does Avner's accent shift constantly between a Yiddish lilt and one you'd find in a Nebraskan suburb? Intentional? If so the effect is so 'subtle' as to appear sloppy and is virtually indistinguishable from the speech of another character, Louisand he's French.<br/><br/>One of the reasons many people find this film boring is the redundant nature and treatment of the assassinated Palestinians. The killings serve neither to raise the tension level nor drive the narrative forward. Rather they seem like tics on a hit-man's shopping list. A little bomb here, a bigger bomb there. And weren't those Black September veterans such regular lovable types: one old man who does his own groceries, another's daughter takes piano lessons while yet a third is available with aspirin or sleeping pills after the pharmacy closes. Sounds just like my bourgeois neighbors at home. If that is the point, then it gushes with over-simplicity. Adolf Hitler, too, was probably just as cute when he blew out the candles on his eighth birthday cake.<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of the camera work, where unimaginative framing and sequencing only serve the movie's discontinuity. Witness the messy hit at the Athens hotel. There were also far too many of those slow head and shoulder zooms that added nothing except draw attention to the zoom. The contrived outdoor banquet exchanges at the French country estate comes to mind. Table prayers in France? I've seen it once in twenty years here. And they don't pick apples in June either, even sour ones. All about as believable as Mathieu Amalric's flaunting a wad of $100,000 in the broad daylight of a Paris café. These are undercover agents?? <br/><br/>If Mossad is a model of espionage and covert operations on the planet earth, the Spielberg version portrays them as latter day Keystone Cops. On the Amsterdam houseboat, the pocket silencers allow the victim, shot twice in the chest, to gingerly skirt her assassins, saunter over to the kitchen, pet and kiss the cat, walk a little further and ease herself into a rocking chair before realizing her barfly days were over. She could have pulled that gun from the drawer in a fraction of the time. <br/><br/>In another preposterous hit scene, our boys dress up as women and proceed to feign an arm-in-arm stroll along the docks of Beirut (like most Middle Eastern women naturally would do on a dark, deserted and forbidding night), yet don't 'surprise' the guards in the least. They then charge fifteen-man strong up a flight of stairs, blotch the operation by resorting to not-so-silent submachine guns, and retreat back down the stairs straight into the flying bullets of the Fedayeen before escaping into the night without a scratch. What a cartoon.<br/><br/>The clincher of convolution of course takes place near the finale, where Avner orgasms to the tune of the climactic Munich airport shoot-out. Begging the point that he could hardly have flashed back to the Palestinians on the tarmac since he'd been doubting their very culpability all throughout the film, the perverse suggestion that our hero or any other normal male on this planet could even have an erection much less an ejaculation thinking about murder and mayhem just boggles the mind.<br/><br/>Munich is a simple revenge story embarrassingly cloaked in an ever so sheer veneer of topical respectability that make it no more convincing than the Charles Bronson Death Wish series of the 1980s. I, like many, long for the old unique Spielberg touch when it was fresh with Indiana Jones swapping the whip for a gun in the bazaar or the kicking of the chair out from under the hangman's noose in Schindlers's List. When vignettes such as these were laced together back then, there were the makings of storytelling genius. Today, Spielberg is trying hard, too hard, to be Spielberg. And when he fails to find himself, he opts at turns for a bit of Kubrick here, a bit of Hitchcock there. The end result doesn't fly. If Munich is about Home, Spielberg should go there and stay put. It's over. Time to retire."

Even as I sit here writing this, I am still overcome with emotion just thinking about it. There's something uniquely fascinating about watching a work of art being created by someone at the top of their game and Spielberg has created a true masterpiece. I know the film has sparked debate because of current events but I truly believe that this is a film that will be remembered and discussed for many years to come. This movie is about violence and the response to violence and the toll that it takes on everyone. It doesn't matter what religion or nationality you are, this is something that needs to be experienced by everyone. Rarely have I experienced so many different emotions while watching a film.

He recreates the brutal sequence of events during the 1972 Olympic Crisis, and does it brilliantly. And he even doesn't give you the whole thing in one shot, but makes you crave to see it more and more. And the addition of all the newscast footage from the actual crisis was a nice touch too.<br/><br/>Bana puts in an awe-striking performance as Avner, and is still showing off the talent he's been showing since the start of his career (a saving grace in Troy, and great in The Hulk). Everyone else who pops up during the film, does a great job in their role as well, but are clearly overshadowed by Bana's brilliant performance. Craig is alright too, but still nothing amazing.<br/><br/>The cinematography and overall story is gritty and amazing. The entire film, all 163 minutes, are nothing short of intense. People are dying, people are scared, there is all sorts of uncertainty on tops of mountains of blood, and the scenes from the crisis just keep coming up at just the right moments. Again, you can tell the handwork of a skilled director in Spielberg. His dedication to the subject matter, and his blatant attempt at showing the real message of the horror of terrorism and revenge, is evident in all the blood soaked frames.<br/><br/>The special effects up the realism aspect of the film, and when it gets loud, the sound really starts thumping. And speaking of blood, damn, there's a lot of it. And much more than I ever expected. Yes, I forget most of Saving Private Ryan, minus the D-Day sequence, but this film is just soaking in it.<br/><br/>If there would be any problem, it would be the fact that some pieces of explanation are missing, or just hinted at, and leave you staring asking yourself ""Who/What was that about?"" Yes, some movies don't need to spell it all right out for you, but some of it just left me dumbfounded, asking more questions than needed. And the film could have benefited with the removal of about 10-15 minutes. Some of the stuff drags a bit, even if you can't take your eyes off it. The sex scene near the end, intertwined with the final pieces of the Munich massacre just seemed inappropriate and silly (the sweat going everywhere in slow motion was bizarre as well).<br/><br/>In the end, a flawed masterwork, and Spielberg's best work since Ryan. And yes, it does more than make up for the fact that War of the Worlds sucked.<br/><br/>It was a nice touch to see the WTC in the skyline too, even if it brings in a whole whack-load of overall messages that should be taken from the movie.<br/><br/>9/10."

Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, this classic features a top notch cast (Stephen Bauer, Michael York, Rod Steiger, Colleen Dewhurst, et.al.).<br/><br/>""Munich"" follows The Sword Of Gideon in almost every way. In fact, short of the last scene depicting the World Trade Center to help bring home the message that violence only begets more violence, it is difficult to see what Spielberg changed to make Munich ""new.""

","Munich (2005) isn't Steven Spielberg's only movie about Jews, but it's by far his worst. Although Shindler's List (1193) turned Auschwitz into polish Disneyland and Israel into the Shoah's happy ending, Munich manages to make Mossad assassinations more painful for those who carry them out than their victims. Spielberg turns the idea that Palestinian guerrillas responded to the atrocities involved in expropriating their property in order to create the state of Israel into a of lame slogan only voiced by a confused ""terrorist"" named Ali (Omar Metwally). The movie starts with the events at the 1972 Olympics, effectively de- historicizing the attack and reifying the event according to our post 9-11 ideology of terrorism.<br/><br/>If one can usefully distinguish the film's ""form"" from what it's ""about,"" the movie adds nothing to the cinema. It's filed with cliché hand-held work, imbecilic under-cranking to show tension or emotion, lazy rack focus shots solving the seemingly impossible riddle of conversations in long take, and bleach-bypass processing that was already played out and annoying in the late 1990s ( see for example three kings (Russell, 1999). When the mossad bomb maker starts to break down the first half of the scene is played out in silhouette against the bright white roof of a train station. Cliché as that image is, Spielberg and DP Janusz Kaminski don't even have the courage to maintain it for the whole scene, cutting to ordinary exposures for the rest of the conversation between the bomb maker (Mathieu Kossovitz) and Avner (Eric Bana). Spielberg and his editor Michael Kahn stoop to imitations of hitchcokian suspense throughout the film, most annoyingly when we wait for the Mossad team to blow up a Fatah member whose child returns to his apartment to fetch her mother's glasses as we cut back and forth between her trajectory, Kossovitz holding the detonator and Bana signaling the mossad team.<br/><br/>In short, both the narrative and film form make revolution inconceivable by enforcing trans- historical humanism and the lamely updated stylistics of poorly remembered 70s thrillers."

","Although I admire Eric Bana and think he made a great interpretation of his role in this move, I can't help but categorize this movie as kitsch.<br/><br/>Spielberg should stay away from making movies about serious matters and movies that have something to do with Jews. He made Schildler's List into a pastiche. If I hadn't known Spielberg was a Jew himself I'd thought the movie to be a mockery of the Holocaust.<br/><br/>In the same way this movie, that is about national pride, revenge and assassinations of a bunch of bad guys, sucks.<br/><br/>When watching it I don't care how it goes for the ""heroes"". They seem no better than the crooks. One of the ""good"" guys says ""I only care about Jewish blood"". Seems like both sides follow the same rule: You kill our people, we'll kill yours. Both hate each other. So why should I as a viewer take sides? After Kingdom of Heaven this was the worst movie I've seen in a long while. Spielberg should instead of these ""heavy"" themes make movies a la Austin Powers and Harry Potter. <br/><br/>What a greasy MacCheese is to food, Spielberg is to movies."

","The Black September group that killed Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich on September 5, 1972, gives this movie a starting point to convey a completely disjointed and confusing array of bloody murders carried out by what can only be described as an equally fanatical Jewish assassin and friends.<br/><br/>The scene cutting is confusing, perhaps even amateurish, with no clue or subtitle to indicate where in the world the scene is supposed to be, and Jewish or Arab language dialog should have included subtitles, but there was apparently no budget or interest, or both, to offer clues to the audience as to where a scene was taking place, or what was being said when not in English. This aspect of post production was just left out.<br/><br/>Basically, Munich (2005) is a long drawn out movie with repetitive murders, explosions, blood and guts with little or no discernible message except that Jewish killers are as brutal as Palastinian killers, and apparently this is supposed to be newsworthy or important, since it pretty much summarizes the entire plot.<br/><br/>For a movie based on real events, there was absolutely no explanation about the Black September group, who they were, and what they wanted to accomplish. This was simply an awful movie, and if you see it, demand your money back before it ends or they might claim you got your money's worth, which is impossible for this pathetic effort at story telling.<br/><br/>Spielberg should have watched a few episodes of 24 or Alias to get the idea about how to make use of rapid scene cutting, and action sequences, to make them relevant to an underlying story. Munich (2005) looked like a pile of film clips spliced together for only one purpose - shock and awe - with no purpose and clearly no redeeming value.<br/><br/>Save your money, and even more important, save your time. This movie is a complete waste of both."

","This movie does provide a powerful, gripping and for most part realistic view of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy and its aftermath. Of course, especially the movie its view of the aftermath, is mostly, if not entirely, fictional and we will probably never know if events as presented in this movie actually really truly occurred. It however is not the movie its intention to provide a realistic and documentary like view on the events of the 1972 assassination of the Israeli athletes and what happened afterward. The movie does make the viewer think. Is violence always the best way to answer violence and what are the consequences of it. The movie is filled with deep and important questions like this that the movie does not try to answer but it leaves it up to us to think about and draw our own conclusions.<br/><br/>People often accuse this movie if picking sides. To me this just seems silly. It's not a question of whose side were the film-makers on, that really is not relevant for the movie. The movie does show both sides their motives and it does help you to somewhat better understand both parties and why they do the things they do. So is that the reason why this movie is considered to be controversial by so many all over the world? I don't think that is the main reason. I think it's because of it that everyone suddenly now has a face. The movie shows that terrorist are also humans who have a family and emotions. Not everything in this world is black and white or as simple as it first seems. You suddenly now see that the terrorist get nervous and unsure as well and doesn't seem to be so completely ruthless and heartless at all. This movie does a very good job at portraying this. This might be a shock for some people, who never really considered this or thought about. <br/><br/>The story is a very gripping and interesting one. Even though the movie is 164 minutes long, it's no bore. The events in the movie are always interesting and the questions asked in this movie forces you to think and perhaps might even reconsider some of your views. Basically the movie for most part is a good old fashioned espionage-thriller but with a realistic and gripping twist to it. The movie shows that ultimately violence leads to nowhere and in most cases only worsens things. It's a vicious circle and downward spiral, that leads to nowhere and ultimately only leads to more pain and suffering on both sides. At least that my view and interpretation of this movie. You can draw your own personal conclusions from it.<br/><br/>Really Spielberg does deserve credit and respect for having the courage to bring up such a sensitive but yet still relevant subject that is considered highly controversial.<br/><br/>The movie does a very good job at re-creating the '70's style and atmosphere. The settings, costumes, hair are all very good and realistic, as simple and irrelevant as it all might seem at first sight.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is at times highly impressive and delicious to watch. The musical score by John Williams was also great and just perfect for the movie. It was one of the best and most powerful scores of the year for me and in my opinion he should have won an Oscar for it as well.<br/><br/>Not sure if Eric Bana was the right choice as the main lead. I already wasn't the biggest fan of him after watching ""Hulk"" and ""Troy"". He doesn't really have enough charisma and is too boring. He also didn't really convinced me in this movie but I think that his way of acting and personality suited the character in this movie quite well. Daniel Craig was really good in this movie and he played a great character. Ciarán Hinds was also great as always and so was Michael Lonsdale, who is perhaps one of the most underrated and under-appreciated actors of the last decades.<br/><br/>The movie is for most part a very realistic and authentic made one. It however gets also a bit too obvious that this movie was made a bit in a haste. Not every storyline gets fully and well enough developed and the main reason of the Mossad mission gets a bit muddled in. At times you forget that this is a movie that concentrates on the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy. I think that is also the reason why Spielberg constantly puts on flashbacks of that event into the movie to help us remember. It however does mostly feel out of place at times and works distracting. Not the best example of movie-making and storytelling really. The movie also gets a bit too moralistic at times, which causes it to lose some of its credibility. The movie does at times also chooses the easy, simple and save road. As weird as it might sound, the movie does still have lots of humor in it. It's the typical Spielberg humor that is present in this movie. I wouldn't call it misplaced, since it worked well in the movie but it does make the movie a little bit less impressive and powerful to watch at certain moments. It's the only reason why I don't really this movie to be a masterpiece. But fact remains that this movie still is one of the most powerful movies that were released in the last couple of years. <br/><br/>An important movie about an important event in history. See this movie and draw your own conclusions from its story and choose your own interpretation of it. It will grip you and make you think and reconsider guaranteed.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"Madmax56","3","5","14","20 August 2007"," Munich Fails On Every Level
","The movie itself was weak. In a movie that is supposed to explore moral complexity at nearly 3 hours, most characters lacked any subtlety. None of the characters other than Avner (Eric Bana), come off as anything but cardboard. The dialogue was also atrocious, with characters constantly spouting out their moral and political philosophy in convenient pronouncements. Also, Spielberg made some odd cinematic choices. For instance, Spielberg waited until nearly the end of the movie to show a reenactment of the actual explosion that killed the Israeli athletes at the Munich airport, and he inter-cut it with a sex scene between Avner and his wife. It comes off as bizarre and arguably distasteful.<br/><br/>As for the film's historical value, it does cover itself by saying ""inspired by real events."" Certainly, I don't get my history from Hollywood, and I understand that making a good historical movie often requires taking some liberties. The reason is that, as it is, one of the primary problems to understanding the conflict is the amount of misinformation that is disseminated. It's upsetting for this film to come out, because it adds yet another prominent bit of misinformation out there that further fogs the truth. As Brett Stevens wrote: ""Vengeance,"" the George Jonas book upon which the film is largely based, is widely considered to be a fabrication. The book is based on a source named Yuval Aviv, who claimed to be the model for Avner but was, according to Israeli sources, never in the Mossad and had no experience in intelligence beyond working as a screener for El Al, the Israeli airline.<br/><br/>Sure, you can argue that the mission was secret and that there's no way of knowing what actually happened. But when it comes to creating a fictional version of Prime Minister Golda Meir and fabricating the quote that was used in all of the previews, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values,"" it becomes troubling.<br/><br/>What's even more frustrating is that in the film, Spielberg adopts the Palestinian narrative for why Israel exists (i.e. that Jews took the land and the world allowed it because of the Holocaust). The truth is that Jews started peacefully migrating to Israel in large numbers in the 1880s and had a large population there even before the Holocaust (not to mention a presence in the area dating back thousands of years). In once scene, an Israeli Mossad agent on the team says, ""How do you think we got the land, by being nice?"" And later Avner's mom, after recalling the Holocaust says, ""We had to take it, because nobody will give it to us."" So in other words, according to this film, there is no denying that Israelis took the land from the Palestinians by force, and the only dispute is whether Jewish suffering during the Holocaust justified it. This is precisely the attitude of anti-Semites who talk about how Jews exploit the Holocaust. But even if Spielberg wanted represent both points of view, he at least owed it to the Israeli side to have the Israeli characters make the best argument for their country's existence.<br/><br/>It is true that the film portrayed the Mossad agents sympathetically and showed the great lengths they go to protect innocent life. But while Avner and his fellow Mossad agents are portrayed sympathetically, the Israeli government itself is not. The government officials (especially Geoffrey Rush's character) come off as soulless amoral bureaucrats who are just using the agents as pawns. When Rush's character tells Avner to avoid killing civilians when he's explaining the mission, he seems more concerned that it would complicate the mission than he is about actually protecting innocents. By the end of the movie, the Israeli government becomes so morally contemptible to Avner that he refuses to go on another mission, moves to America, and even suspects the Israeli government of trying to kill him and his family.<br/><br/>On a moral level, this film has problems with naivety. Characters say things such as ""Just because Palestinians do wrong, we don't have to do wrong as well."" Or comments that suggest that assassinating terrorists involves moral compromises. I see no moral problems with killing terrorists who have plotted to kill your civilians in the past and will continue to do so. Especially since the rest of the world is caving into terrorism, with Germany releasing prisoners who were a part of the Munich massacre.<br/><br/>The other problem with the film is the idea that if you kill a terrorist, he'll just be replaced by somebody worse, so what's the point? If an organization keeps on having leadership changes, and its leaders are always in constant fear of being killed, and they have to hide out and go to great lengths (using more manpower) to protect themselves, they will be less effective. Real world evidence demonstrates this. Targeted assassinations by Israel during the Second Intifada were instrumental in reducing the number of suicide bombings. Al Qaeda is having more trouble carrying out large scale attacks against America now that we are going after them.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Avner evolves into a modern day liberal. He is compelled by patriotism and duty at the beginning but loses all of that in the end. In the final scene, Avner is: -Distrustful of his government (he asks, how do you know the people I killed were really terrorists? What was the evidence, and was it trustworthy?) -Naive (He asks, why couldn't we just arrest them?) -Defeatist ( He says, if you kill a terrorist, you just create a new terrorist, so it will never end).<br/><br/>Having reached all of these conclusions, he decides that there's no point to stay in Israel and fight terrorism, he may as well give up the futile battle, move to America, and live out his life in a fool's paradise in Brooklyn."

Parts of the film just dragged on and on without developing the characters or the story any further.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film, however, is the way in which foreign languages are used to create a realistic atmosphere. Throughout the film, bits of German, French, and Arabic are thrown in to make the environment seem more realistic, however, there is almost no Hebrew used in the film. Yes, in the beginning you here part of a media report in Hebrew, but as the film progresses, it is almost hard to remind yourself that the main characters are Israeli. It seems that Spielberg wanted the audience to believe in the Arab terrorists, the French money makers, etc, but lost his focus on the main characters of the movie. I almost jumped out of my seat when Avner walked into the Israeli Consulate in NYC and all that was heard in the office was perfect English.<br/><br/>The length of the film and inconsistencies with realism hurt this film's introspection into the right and wrong of revenge."

Occasional interesting bits of dialogue - such as the importance of home for a nation - hidden among all the violence and sentimentality and an irritatingly self-conscious portrayal of Golda Meir.

Then they killed a larger number of people by shooting them, which was a different method again, although very similar to the first method, which was shooting. And the interesting thing is that they kill them all in different cities, except when they kill a lot of people at once, which they do in the same city, or when they go back to a city where they've already killed someone.

","Two good, fair movies have been made this year about the eternal Israeli/Palestinian war.

""Munich"" is about the cycle of revenge and response caused by the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. It's a compelling movie, as unpleasant and uncomfortable as is the subject.<br/><br/>Spielberg portrays an Israeli hit squad that gradually loses its moral certainty as assassination piles on assassination. A key moment in the film is when when a young, idealistic Palestinian terrorist talks of the need of a homeland -- much as Israelis talk -- and the dawning realization on the assassin's leader, Eric Bana, that not much in the way of moral space separates the terrorists from the hit squad.<br/><br/>Unlike others, I did not care for the omnipresent ""French connection"" in the movie. One is asked to believe that an old man on a farm seemingly has all the information in the world at hand, including the addresses and bios of Palestinian terrorists. This was a cheap plot trick in my opinion, a quick and easy, but hardly credible way for the hit squad to find terrorists. Better would have been a gritty search, blind alleys, and a mistake or two along the way.<br/><br/>The obvious message of the movie is that violence begets violence and a better way must be found.

I think maybe you should go see the film and then you can go make up your mind.<br/><br/>Spielberg's message is that when we use violence, violence comes back to us and that is true. He humanizes both peoples; the Israelis and the Palestinians and through them shows the terrible tragedy that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br/><br/>Never at any one point does he make a moral judgement against anybody.<br/><br/>I don't understand. We're supposed to live in a democracy and Spielberg has the right to express the opinion through his movie, but for people to make up their minds either before they see it, or deciding to see it with a bias, doesn't help anyone.<br/><br/>It's a movie with open-ended questions, it doesn't judge, but raises very important, very relevant questions.<br/><br/>Is it wrong to question? I think a people or nation loses its soul when it's restrained from or refuses to ask important questions and looks at their own actions...that's what people in the movie are doing they are constantly self-examining themselves to see if their actions were right-for their peoples, nations, families. What is home after all? (as the movie asks)<br/><br/>That is not wrong-that is human! In short, if you haven't see the movie, go see it and then make up your mind...and PLEASE see it with an open mind and without judgement.<br/><br/>I think in order to be able to really look at peace it is important that we take a critical look at our own actions and words...they are not always right and we should ALWAYS question.<br/><br/>Thanks!"

","Anytime you go to watch a movie that's 2 hours and 45 minutes long and it seems like half that, you know you've seen a great movie. I heard this movie is controversial. I heard this movie is either anti-Semetic or anti-Arab. I think that anyone who sees it will see what they want to see and there are a few points within the movie where your views will be questioned.<br/><br/>Before seeing the movie, I suggest that you read up a little bit on the 1972 Olympic massacre and the aftermath to help ""fill in the blanks"", as the movie does not go out of its way to spoon feed who the characters are or recent events at the time to the viewer.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing the movie, I had known about the Olympic massacre and the aftermath. I didn't expect any surprises, nor did I see any in the movie. I did, however, find both the murders and the assassinations to be brutally frank in their depiction. I would suggest that if you're a political nerd like me and plan to see Syriana and Munich over the holidays, see Syriana first (if at all), but definitely check out Munich. You'll be astounded by the dramatic cinematography, the locations it was filmed on, and the story will blow you away. Like I said, there's something in this movie that will step on everyone's toes, but the viewer will probably see what he wants to see."
"rnfakh","9","3","7","24 December 2005"," Worth all $10.50
","Undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year. Munich delivers a value-neutral approach to the tragedy of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, focusing not on the ethical superiority or inferiority of the parties involved but on the ultimate human tragedy of war and violence. Eric Bana delivers what I think is his best performance in years; he exhibits a skillful balance of humanity and brutality that makes his character realistic and believable.<br/><br/>Accusations of anti-Semitism made against the film are, in my view, unfounded. It simply portrays the perpetuity of pain and suffering caused by answering violence with violence, without answering the question of whether such a response would be justified by either side. Don't let your preconceptions about the Middle East, religion or any other issue prevent you from seeing this film. Come in with an open mind and you will leave feeling both rage and sorrow for both sides in the conflict."

Basically, there are protagonists in the movie who believe that the end justifies the means and other who feel that all those killings turned them into something they never thought they would become.<br/><br/>I recommend that all IMDb readers see the movie for themselves and form an opinion. Consider this movie a prelude to a healthy discussion(does the end justify the means?)or a part of a larger debate(the situation in the middle east) but don't look for easy answers."

I remained puzzled throughout the entire movie whether this character was Israeli or not.<br/><br/>Then, we are introduced to a little old lady who seemed to be in authority. At this point, I couldn't figure out whether she was an Arab or an Israeli. (In the dim shadows on my mind, I remembered later, that Israel had a lady prime minister named Golda Meir. Could that be her, I wondered.) Next thing I knew, the main character had access to monies to be expended on assassinating those had perpetuated the Munich massacre. How did that happen; did I have a lapse in attention? Then the movie goes to Paris, Athens, Beirut, etc. I got confused. I couldn't figure out the timeline.

","All the hype about Munich got to me. ""Exclusive Spielberg's Secret Masterpiece, "" said the front page of the December 12, 2005 Time magazine. ""So sensitive it was kept under wraps, Munich is his boldest...."" I had to see it and was very disappointed. It was not much different from the original 2 hour-28 minute ""Sword of Gideon"" with Steven Bauer, Michael York, Rod Steiger, and Colleen Dewhurst (1986). Directed by Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days, Chase a Crooked Shadow, The Shoes of a Fisherman, Logan's Run, etc.)<br/><br/>If you've seen ""Gideon..."" you've seen Munich. The wonderful musical score by John Williams was enjoyable, as was the portrayal of Golda by Lynn Cohen and Avner by Eric Bana. I expected more from Spielberg and didn't get it. This is a movie I should have waited to see for ""free"" on TV. Two, maybe three, stars for this one."
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","4","20 January 2017"," Bombs and bullets can kill, but they never hurt as much as the truth...
","Avner (Eric Bana) is a former bodyguard assigned to lead the killings of eleven men for their involvement in the Munich attacks. There's no contract because the mission doesn't ""exist"" which means that it will be taken care of, with Israel's 100% efficiency. And while it will profoundly affect the executioner, this is not a character study, unless you consider the psychological mindset of a whole country as a 'character'. <br/><br/>First, I had mixed feelings regarding ""Munich"", but they all converged toward a positive appreciation. If there is one thing ""Munich"" ever proves is that Spielberg, while flawed as any human being, is a man of peace, and while it became trendy to support war and attacks in the name of patriotism, it is even more admirable to question it in the same spirit. ""Munich"" would be attacked on both sides, but as Spielberg pointed out, being attacked doesn't mean ""being contradicted"". <br/><br/>The title refers to the hi-jacking of Israeli athletes by PLO members during the Olympic Games of 1972 and what a sneaky irony that it had to be in Germany, as if history wanted to repeat itself. The operation ended in tragedy, as eleven athletes died, to the world's shock. It was a time where Palestinians had already lost the 'communication battle'. Things would change in 1987 with the first Intifada, when kids throwing stones at Israeli tanks replaced hooded terrorists holding machine-guns, thus contributing to the first 'change of heart' in favor of the Palestinians.<br/><br/>But in 1972, Israel was the offended country. The film is based on George Jonas' book ""Vengeance"" chronicling the targeted assassinations against Palestinian dignitaries accused of having pulled some of the strings that lead to 'Black September': eleven men, for eleven athletes, an ""eye for an eye"" move Golda Meir took all responsibility for. She personally believed that there was no time for peace. Why wouldn't they put these men on trial like Eichmann, who did far worse? Eichmann was arrested at a time where Nazism was terminated, and the new evil from the Israeli perspective was the Arabs, as long as these influential people lived, Israeli would die. <br/><br/>What I admired in the film is that it doesn't only discuss the victims' actual responsibility in the Munich attacks but even the sheer value of their deaths, because each one brings more ruthless successors, perpetuating a never-ending cycle of violence. I expected the movie to open with the blood bath that triggered the whole chain of events, but this was ignoring what a master storyteller Spielberg is. He punctuates the film with elements of that fateful night as violent interludes reminding the viewers why Meir took that decision, the climax coinciding with the killings. But this is not manipulation, as one could accuse Spielberg of. The point is that violence is ugly and blind.<br/><br/>Spielberg depicts each assassination with a Hitchcockian attention for details, one of them involves a bomb trapped in a phone and the biggest suspense comes when a little girl is about to answer the phone instead of her father. But for all the thrills the film provides, what struck me is the way the targets, or at least the first ones, are depicted as 'harmless' people, even sympathetic: one is an Italian-speaking poet and had just finished to translate the Arabian Nights in Italian, he's an intellectual and his involvement in Munich events has been denied, another one is a doctor and a family man, when he's interviewed, he insists that many camps were bombarded by Israel (which means that there are already people who paid the price for Munich). <br/><br/>It seems crucial for Spielberg to shows shades of innocence in the victims or at least be indirectly vocal about the Palestinian pleas, and never without really discrediting them, and it actually pays off. When a Palestinian says that they use violence like Israel does, it also means killing innocents, it indirectly provides alibis for the target assassinations as the men killed are still less innocent than civilians. And when a PLO member discusses with Avner about the Nazi guilt, I felt this was the director of ""Schindler's List"" reminding the audience that no matter what they think about Jews and Arabs, it is a war for a land, not some extermination project.<br/><br/>Now, to say that Spielberg sided with Palestinians would be too much of a stretch, but the point the screenplay (the book was adapted by Eric Roth an Tony Kuschner) is that violence can't be the solution to the problems it causes. And even at the end, when most of the men are eliminated, there's no real satisfaction or overwhelming effect, it is just about a job that had to be ""done"", it could have been unfair, but there's a key scene where Avner's mother says that ""Israel had to be 'taken' because no one would have given it anyway'. At least, both sides would agree on that. <br/><br/>Served by a great cast: Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Mathieu Kassovitz ""Munich"" explores the dark corners one country could be driven into, in order to ""make a point"", and it is very fitting that there's a part played by Michael Lionsdale because he starred in my favorite political thriller ""The Day of the Jackal"", and ""Munich"" is perhaps the closest that come to that level of documentary-like gritty realism. I didn't need to wish De Gaulle's death to somewhat 'root' for the Jackal, so I guess even an Arab could be fascinated by the level of organization put to avenge eleven athletes. <br/><br/>Maybe admitting that there's a lot to learn from the 'other side' can be a first step toward a reconciliation, but one of the tragedies Arab people must deal with, is that there's no Spielberg's counterpart in the Arab world, to the point that it took a Spielberg film so people could hear their voices."
"SnoopyStyle","6","2","4","28 December 2014"," Coldly efficient
","In 1972, nine Israelis are killed at the Munich Olympics. Prime Minister Golda Meir approves a covert operation to assassinate the eleven deemed responsible for the act. Avner (Eric Bana) is low level Mossad tasked to lead the secret mission. He was Golda Meir's bodyguard some two years ago, and he must leave his pregnant wife for an unknown length of time. Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is his case handler. The four men on his team are Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciarán Hinds) the cleaner, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) the bomb maker and Hans (Hanns Zischler) the documents guy. They are expendable and must deal with questionable people like Louis (Mathieu Amalric) who tracks down their targets and provide them with material.<br/><br/>There is a calculated coldness to the movie and Eric Bana contributes to that. I think Spielberg should have made this more emotional. The audience is detached from the characters. The action is coldly efficient without being exciting. This is not a thriller like a Bond movie. Neither is it a psychological study since Bana can't portray a tortured soul. It is very well made but I feel nothing watching it."

","If one looks closely at Spielberg's cinematographic career, one would find that he has booked a special slot for controversial films which are even thought provoking to some extent.He achieves this hidden effect by choosing themes about which people are bound to have diverse opinions. This is the reason why Spielberg has complete hold over his work as someone like Richard Attenborough had for his film Gandhi (1982).Munich is one of a kind film which must be watched with an open mind as a biased viewer might spoil his own viewing pleasure.There is no need to take sides as nothing is shown neither in black nor in white. Although some of the situations featuring an ensemble cast of talented actors are truly spectacular there are certain confrontation scenes which defy logic.Although Munich tackles the same Jewish question as Schindler's List,it is very different from that film because of its insistence on color and an elaborate cast of actors.It is one of those rare American films completely dominated by French actors especially Mathieu Amalric.He is the only shining light of this somber drama."
"dragonshield","8","2","4","29 April 2007"," A movie with the right amount of tension and excitement, one of Spielberg's best
","I had seen this movie before like over a year ago and now I watched it again last night. I like to think this is one of Spielberg's best works yet to date. Well it can be a bit dull at places, but it's still a great movie.<br/><br/>There's this certain tension throughout the movie, it's exciting and interesting. The whole story is very well put together and it has great characters. What comes to the role performances I think it's Eric Bana's best role performance yet to date. He also fits in the role like a blanket on a bed, he's pretty perfect in it. In my opinion the whole casting is succeeded very well. Other Mossad group members are played by Daniel Craig, Ciarán Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler and they seem to be just the right actors for the right parts. We also see Geoffrey Rush in the role of Ephraim, which is pretty nice after constantly remembering him as Barbossa from some kind of a reason.<br/><br/>The plot has enough twists and tweaks in it and though it's not of course so exciting as for the first time, I still enjoyed it very much. It's very believable, realistic. It's also intelligent with its twists and as we go towards the ending, it still has this certain energy, tension and surprises to keep you interested all the time. The screenplay's very good, but it's still nothing phenomenal, because of its (sad to say) dullness in places. Could be because I had seen the movie before, but I still would have liked some fillings here and there. Is it even necessary to talk about the directing? Well, it's Steven Spielberg and once again I think the directing is fantastic. Some of the parts are just so exciting you stand up and watch the whole scene without even blinking an eye. Just superb.<br/><br/>The movie was nominated for 5 Oscars: For ""Best Achievement in Directing"", ""Best Achievement in Editing"", ""Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score)"", ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"" and ""Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay"" and it still makes me sad that it didn't win any of the categories. It sure would have deserved at least one Oscar, as if you look at the movie in its wholeness, the pieces are put together very well and the movie doesn't struggle in any way imaginable. The music is composed by the all mighty John Williams and you can't go wrong there now can you? The music's still not in so big role after all, but it's still in the right places and it's great. There's no actual main theme or beauty worth mentioning in the music, it just fits in the movie in its own way so well that it just makes your heart beat faster. Especially in the so called ""action"" -parts there's this same music always playing, building up the tension when the other sound is cleverly put in the background. Even when the music's so simple in those parts, it's still so great.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie worth seeing. I agree that I should have reviewed this back then when I watched it for the first time, but later's better than never, right? Anyways, if you want to enjoy a good Drama/Thriller, then this's the movie you want to watch. It is very successful when it comes to those genres, both Drama and Thriller. There's some action in it too, but it still doesn't make it an action movie, or at least in my opinion it doesn't. It's just a great movie."

"bernick","7","2","4","14 May 2006"," A spectacular suspense film that is too self-conscious for its own good
","Munich"" manages the difficult feat of presenting Steven Spielberg at his best, and at his worst, demonstrating his considerable gifts in the way of pacing, creating suspense, and generating a response from his audience while at the same time greatly underestimating the intelligence of his audience. For every moment that inspires awe, there is another that inspires a collective cringe, as the audience realizes it is being trusted with nothing, and has been lead around by its nose by a director that is so determined to make sure we get his message that he is willing to abandon all subtlety in order to do so.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT Consider: The central character in Spielberg's ""Munich"" is an Israeli wet-work specialist named Avner. Avner is hired, along with several other men, to enact bloody retribution against those responsible for plotting the execution of Israeli athletes at the Olympics in the early seventies. His wife is expecting a child. In one scene, we see him coordinating the murder of a Palestinian sympathizer who has a young daughter. We know he has a young daughter because she is paraded around for several minutes, exchanges significant looks with the Israeli assassins, acts cute as a button, and is serenaded by vibrant, melodramatic music. This would be bad enough in itself-- surely, the Palestinian who is to be assassinated, an articulate, even-tempered man who seems as far from a terrorist as can possibly be imagined, is sympathetic enough on his own. But no. Spielberg not only drags in the child, and uses her as a device to create suspense when it seems like she might be in the line of fire. Not only do we get a scene where Avner is waiting in the hospital for his wife to deliver her baby, as a counterpoint to the violence he has just perpetrated.<br/><br/>END SPOILER It's a testament to Spielberg's considerable talent that his film is able to survive such embarrassing lapses in judgment, which occur often, but are counterbalanced by the sheer momentum of the film he has created. For the most part, ""Munich"" is a lean, brutal, fast-paced work of art. The film is impeccably organized and structured. We begin with a galvanizing recreation of the Palestinian attack on the Munich games. Then, we are briefly introduced to Avner, and his wife. Then, Avner is given his mission, and the rest of the film, more or less, follows a rigid structure of setup, assassination/action, and reflection that would become repetitive, were it not so well-handled by Spielberg.<br/><br/>Did I believe what I saw? Was I convinced that it happened the way Spielberg envisions it? Not really. Mossad, the Israeli spy network, has always been an organization that takes the loyalty of its members very, very seriously. It surely would never have hired men like Karl, the reluctant, very liberal member of the team, who incessantly questions whether it is RIGHT to kill any man at all (remember, this is supposed to be an assassin!) for such a mission. Similarly, Avner, the protagonist of the film, the leader of the Israeli team, is seen to undergo a crisis of conscience as a result of his labors. I was unsurprised to learn that the real Avner has never expressed such doubts-- the book on which ""Munich"" is based, and Avner's own comments (he's still alive) bear this out.<br/><br/>Further, Spielberg is so determined not to offend any Palestinian sympathizers that we never encounter any radical Islamists-- you know, the kind that blow up buses in Jerusalem, not because they wish to liberate Palestine, but because they believe that Jews are infidels who pray to the wrong god-- indeed, we never encounter any Palestinians at all who seem more extreme than, say, Mahmoud Abbas. Avner has an extended political debate with a young Palestinian who sounds like an International Relations major from Cal-Berkeley. Even the Black September members who executed the Israeli athletes are seen as scared kids.<br/><br/>But I digress. The ideas behind the film take a backseat, for the most part, to the dynamic action on the screen at almost all times. Rarely has film violence been wielded so effectively. There is blood and gore, but it is brief and far from exploitive. The aftermath of a surprisingly large explosion, which leaves a body hanging from a ceiling lamp, and a confused young couple wandering around, naked, bleeding from their eyes, and seemingly waiting to be told what to do next, is incredibly well staged. The spiraling sense of doom that accompanies the latter half of the film, in which it becomes evident that no one can be trusted, the team starts to fall apart, and the effectiveness of the mission becomes increasingly called into question, is something to be experienced as well. There is a subplot that is jump started by Avner's encounter with a lonely woman at a bar that has the logic of a nightmare-- not the ""War of the Worlds"" kind, but the kind Scorcese created in ""After Hours."" Spielberg has never strayed this far from the mainstream, and it's something to witness.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe ""Munich"" is worth seeing. It's not the message movie that many have made it into. It's a gripping work that exploits all of the resources of the cinema-- sometimes to its detriment, where emotional manipulation is concerned-- and even the more conservative members of the audience should appreciate it without feeling like Spielberg is spoon-feeding them liberal propaganda. I don't see ""Munich"" as a pro-Palestinian polemic-- I see it as an suspense film that wants to enthrall its audience above all things but doesn't want to be accused of neglecting political correctness. Accordingly, it makes concessions, to Palestinians, to the liberal supporter of their cause, and, yes, to the audience's intelligence."

People take for granted that Spielberg is going to turn out a quality movie. That in itself speaks volumes. The acting and camera work are superb. I especially like Lynn Cohen as Golda -- very convincing. Eric Baena and Jeffrey Rush are great and the the actress who plays his wife is wonderful.

If this were not such a well-made movie, people who support Israeli state violence would not be so incensed by it. The movie makers have graphically portrayed the violence of both sides evenhandedly--too much so for those of us who believe that the origin of the conflict lies in the way that the state of Israel was founded and has expanded well past its UN-defined boundaries, leaving the Palestinians with no viable state.<br/><br/>The notions that violence breeds violence and that ""an eye for an eye will leave the whole world blind"" have rarely been portrayed so movingly."

","This may be one of the best historical movies I've ever seen. Steven Spielberg's Munich is uncompromising in its vision and open for discussion as how races are portrayed in this movie. It doesn't show one race or another in a bad light, it shows them as equals. What also works so well here is that this is a really well made Hollywood movie in historical and political clothing. You have violence, really graphic violence and some sex, nudity for both audiences as well.<br/><br/>Eric Bana gives the performance of his career as Avner, the leader of an assassination group targeting the people who killed Isreali athletes at 1972 Munich Olympics. Bana picks up a very convincing accent and a conscience embodied within a hit-man. It's such a strong performance, but I feel critics are underrating Bana's performance. I think its his best.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig plays Steve, a driver who hardly EVER panics even under fire. What Craig does is try to capture his soul, despite the fact that his character is not sympathetic. It's daring, and it WORKS.<br/><br/>The 2 hour and 45 minute running time might be a buffer, but this is a VERY important film and one of the best movies of the year.

","""They're all gone,"" intones sportscaster Jim McKay. McKay and other ABC news folks of 1972 have their TV footage mixed with a quick montage of violent filmed movie scenes of the '72 Olympics where 11 Israeli Olympians were massacred by the Arab Black September group.<br/><br/>Five men led by a young Israeli named Avner are assembled to revenge the massacre of the Munich Olympians. The Munich Avengers hook up with a family that has been in private intelligence since the Vichy Government ran France during World War Two. Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is its patriarch. He becomes a sage to the Five. ""Never work for any government"" he warns. Well, its a little late to change that just now. At first everything goes swimmingly. The movie looks like other well made thrillers. These 'pros' who have never exactly done this kind of work in their lives 'seem' very successful. <br/><br/>Thriller afficionados will remember Michael Lonsdale as the French inspector who traced assassin Edward Fox across France in the Day of the Jackal 33 years ago. Older and heavier, Lonsdale is right at home as patriarch of the French family aiding the Israeli assassins in targeting their victims.<br/><br/>The Israelis find themselves sharing a room in Athens with five Arab Assassins but arrange a truce by convincing the Arabs they are part of the German Beider-Meinhof gang. Avner discusses middle east morality and politics with the Arab gang leader. Avner is seen by the audience as losing that argument. Later the forger has to 'fix' a foiled murder attempt in a hotel room. He is wounded. Several of the Arabs Avner's crew boarded with are killed in a gunfight outside. Carl (Cirian Hands) is murdered in bed later by a comely prostitute after Avner has turned the woman down. The Israeli avengers trace her to a Brussels houseboat where each fires a shot into her as she vainly attempts a seductive but grotesque striptease to save her life. An attempt to kill the architect of the Munich Murders is foiled when five Brits, posing as drunks, interfere. Avner's men are now aware they are being followed and watched. Who do the five Brits work for, the CIA or Britain's MI-6? The hunters are now the hunted.<br/><br/>The foiled Assassination perplexes and demoralizes. Their Israeli handler Ephraim calls Avner home to tell him their work is splendid. Not to them it isn't. Avner doesn't want to continue. He suspects they have killed Arabs not involved in Munich and balks at giving names and addresses of contacts to Ephraim. They discover the CIA has protection deals with some of their targets. The remaining Four don't know who is after them or for what. Two more die and a demoralized Avner and Steve(Daniel Craig) split up.<br/><br/>Afraid now, Avner flees to his wife and baby in Brooklyn. But unknown agents follow and scare him. Avener fears for his wife and child. He attacks a bureaucrat in the Israeli Mossad office in Manhattan. He is desperate now. Ephraim meets with him and admits some of the six killed were not Black September but old Israeli scores being settled. Avner won't cooperate with Israel now. And Ephraim won't help him if Avner doesn't agree to continue.<br/><br/>Except for a nightmare-freighted, overdone sexual episode between Avner and his wife, the film is effectively over. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner have carved this thriller into a political morality tale. The Israelis cannot assume the higher moral ground if they are as murderous as Black September. Every act of revenge sews the seeds of more violence and death. What is the point of that, ask the Authors? An Arab character argues with Avner that the Jews in Israel are outnumbered by the Arab populations that are all around them and growing in numbers much faster than the Israelis. The Authors are saying the Israelis will never win, that time is on the side of the Arabs. Israel will not win and will not survive.<br/><br/>I agree with them. The American War in Iraq will not succeed either. Americans and Israelis will both lose because the Arabs are fighting for their homeland. The Americans, and the Israelis who claim THEY are fighting for their homeland, cannot succeed.<br/><br/>Spielberg and Kushner have loaded the dice too heavily here. Avner and his four henchmen have an underlying innocence about international terrorism calculated to buttress this story and its moral. But would the Israelis really have chosen such a bunch of innocent plebes to carry out a mission as cynical, dangerous and important as this one? Its a great story but it won't play in Bagdhad, Tel Aviv or Peoria not to mention on the big screen."

","This movie was utterly amazing. I just came back from the movie theater and was so influenced and completely moved by it that the first thing I wanted to do was write my first comment (ever) on IMDb. It was extremely difficult for me to sit through this movie because I felt every tiny bit of pain and sorrow that I witnessed, within me. It was emotionally exhausting and I felt how it slowly took every strength that I had with every scene that I watched. I view myself as an Israeli above all and, as a human being I am a strong believer of peace. I love Israel with all my heart and soul and therefore I entered the theater with my heartbeats controlling my whole body, not knowing what to anticipate. It was so real...the whole production of the movie left me completely speechless. Every physical detail was nearly perfect- the scenery, the languages, the cast..absolutely phenomenal. One detail that touched me the most was the fact that Spielberg really highlighted the fact that the men who were sent to accomplish the mission were so careful not to hurt anyone who was innocent (the scene with the daughter of the terrorist and the way that every time before they killed a terrorist they made sure everyone else was safe-- the terrorists' wives, children and everybody that was nearby). It meant so much to me to see that..the fact that it was extremely difficult for these people to kill and their true humaneness. The message of this creation truly touched my heart and soul. In my eye, a movie that can move a single person in the way that it moved me, is a masterpiece. It made me want to wrap my arms around our whole universe; we ALL need love, we all need to remember to constantly LOVE one another and CARE for the world we live in. We all have the power to make a difference and we all need to constantly remember that. I thank Spielberg and the whole production of this movie for helping me remember that."

","Munich is a carefully crafted film about a man given the job of assassinating the eleven people responsible for the hostage situation at the Olympic games in Munich. Eric Bana gives a great performance, not Oscar worthy but definitely worth a nomination. As the story begins you get a first hand look at how the Arab terrorist entered the hotel and took the hostages, the entire hostage situation, the whole story of what happened with the hostages is gone back to periodically at key points in the film. However the most enjoyable part of the film is how it draws you into the world of this man and his team assigned to kill these eleven men. When he starts off the story seems very straightforward however as the story progresses the situations become more and more tense. Eventually things get out of control for the the group as what they do garners attention and at the same time they become more and more famous in the secret agency world for the killings. If you want to see a film that pulls at your emotions, does a wonder job of taking you back to the mid seventies and at the same time draws you in with a compelling story watch Munich. Furthermore, the social commentary of the film rings true today, the idea that no matter what you do you are never going to fix the situation in the mid east leaves you with food for thought something I always prefer when walking away from a movie like this."

","This movie is by far the best Spielberg since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The acting is good and does not overwhelm the story, which is the real star of this movie. The lesson of the movie, while simple and familiar to many, is expertly explored. Though you might think that a movie with this subject matter coming from a man named Spielberg might be pro-Israel in its consideration of the Munich kidnappings, it is not. It is a thoughtful and masterful exploration of the cyclic nature of violence, whether righteously committed or not. Surprisingly, it is also the story of how damaging and alienating terrorism can be to the human soul, with the embedded idea that even righteous violence is no solution at all. It's a long movie, and very violent - which underpins the lesson that all types of violence leaves blood on somebody's hands - but it was well worth seeing. Spielberg the master has done it again!"

This film should definitely be seen. Spielberg brings it to life, it is so real and draws its audience in so well. Although it runs over two hours it doesn't feel like it at all.

With some exception, the movie pretty well covers factually how the Palestinians responsible for planning the massacre were hunted down throughout Europe and individually killed.

"EUyeshima","8","2","4","3 January 2006"," Crisis of Conscience Explored in Vivid, Thrilling Detail by Spielberg in a Moralistic Mode
","Confounding expectations, Steven Spielberg has directed a relentlessly tense thriller based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and its aftermath that coalesces its often chilling, suspenseful elements into an almost ""Godfather""-like family saga about the obligation of duty and the crisis of conscience. The epic 2005 film doesn't completely work, but the unpredictable nature of the film keeps the momentum going for most of its 162-minute running time. Spielberg, regardless, should be lauded for taking well-remembered historical events within their context and making them resonate in today's politically charged environment.<br/><br/>Co-written by the estimable Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") and Eric Roth from George Jonas's fictionalized book ""Vengeance"", the movie opens with the familiar archived footage of ABC sports commentator Jim McKay reporting on the Black September terrorists kidnapping eleven Israeli athletes at Munich's Olympic village only to be gunned down hours later at the airport. The story then focuses on an undercover commando team instigated confidentially by Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir but officially disconnected from the Mossad, Israel's counterpart to the CIA. The motley group led by Avner Kaufman, Meir's former bodyguard and the son of a revered Israeli freedom fighter, is charged with finding the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the massacre and assassinating them one at a time. These are indeed acts of vengeance by a country who felt the need for respect as well as sympathy from a watchful global community, and the bulk of the movie is about how the team goes about with the killings.<br/><br/>I have to admit that there is a sense of movie convention in the characters who make up the team  Robert, the guilt-sticken bomb expert; Steve, the sometime intolerably cocky driver; Hans, the ice-cold documents forger; and Carl, the anxious ""clean-up"" man who by default, becomes the conscience of the group. However, the actors inhabiting the parts are all quite strong within these constraints, and there is particular standout work by Daniel Craig as Steve (he seems well poised to play James Bond in the roughhewn Connery manner) and Ciarán Hands as Carl. Alternating fluidly between coolly calculated actions and percolating indecisiveness and using his skills in the kitchen as a cathartic release, Eric Bana brings a soulful and increasingly haunting quality to Avner, the designated leader who somehow retains sympathy for his character while going about the business of killing. At times, he seems like an emotional cipher, but I think that helps in the story flow. And in fact, the complexities behind the politically motivated murders, which take place in a variety of exotic locations, are what drive the sometimes convoluted plot line.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush does a convincing Israeli accent as Avner's by-the-book Mossad contact, Ephraim, and Lynn Cohen  yes, Miranda's Eastern European maid, Magda, on ""Sex in the City""  has a few effective moments at the beginning as the conflicted Meir. The movie, however, is not without its share of flaws. First, there is the red-herring use of a French contact with a father who is apparently legendary in the field of political intrigue and information peddling. While Mathieu Amalric and especially Michael Lonsdale give fine performances as Avner's contact, Louis, and his worldly father, their characters feel more like plot devices from another spy thriller entirely, especially as they expose their dysfunctional family set-up over lunch at a château to which Avner must be taken blindfolded. There is also a beautiful woman of mystery at a bar, which actually feels like it was cribbed from a similar scene in, of all movies, ""The Sting"". There is another flaw in the extended coda where I feel Spielberg misjudges the emotional parallels in the rather contrived cross-cutting between the athletes' killings and a bed scene between Avner and his wife.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Spielberg is a master when it comes to the set-up of the action sequences, whether it's a plan that goes awry with a child returning unexpectedly home or a shooting spree near the docks of Beirut or the killing of a Palestinian passionate about his inextricable need for a homeland. Naturally, the post-9/11 atmosphere lends particular resonance to all these scenes, though credit Spielberg for not making an overtly political statement along these lines. As always, the craftsmanship behind the production is first-rate, in particular, Janusz Kaminski's dramatically lit cinematography and Michael Kahn's blistering editing. Make no mistake that Spielberg has most definitely made a morality picture about the unending cycle of violence in the Middle East and at the end of it, really doesn't take sides on the issue. Certainly the volatility of the topic has prevented a strong film from Hollywoodat least until Spielberg was willing to helm this one. Kudos for that move."
"coolcricket","8","2","4","2 January 2006"," grainy thriller of conscience
","Saw ""Munich"" today between rain storms. Bloody, like its subject. Pointless? No. The movie (about revenge and reprisals after a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics) seems to say that all this bickering, murdering and back-and-forth escalation betrays an attachment to tribalism rather than tolerance and understanding. Its subject seems pointless for those of us who have no real say in it, and who don't understand patriotism at all costs. And I really think we have no say. How are we involved in this conflict of hate? Because no matter how we vote, it is pointless. Humanity muddles on. Many of us continue to arbitrarily choose our teams.<br/><br/>Because the film never concludes, and can't conclude, we can only judge it as a polished production with excellent acting and seamless editing. Even as the killings begin to seem redundant, as the sequences of plotting and execution pile on, we must admit that this is the real deal; it is exactly what we are going through--the same sequence of violence begetting violence day after day in Iraq, in the Middle East, in the world.<br/><br/>There are some odd sex scenes in ""Munich"" telescoped by a moment in ""Schindler's List"" that made my mother flinch; but to me, Oskar Schindler's intercourse seems redemptive in that movie, as if he is clinging to life amidst death; but in this new movie, the sex has the effect of distancing us from the main character at a crucial point, because the assassin can't get violent images out of his head while he's attempting pleasure. I don't think the moment is inappropriate, but I think it could be misconstrued as a scene of mere propagation: he is creating a new soldier for the fight. I don't think that's what's going on. His wife covers his eyes afterward. She knows he is not seeing her, so she blinds him to regain his attention.<br/><br/>I knew what the last shot of this movie would be. That is, long before the movie ended, I guessed what the last shot would inevitably include, and yet still it works."
"losdzez","10","2","4","29 December 2005"," Riveting and compelling
","Normally not my genre at all, Munich was both thrilling and unflinching while thoughtful and balanced. Only now reading others' comments do I realize it was three hours long. (Although the guys climbing over the seats to use the restroom should have alerted me . . .) The great achievement of this film is its balanced, even-handed treatment of the issues. It doesn't attempt to lay blame or lay out a roadmap. There are no answers, only things to consider. What happens to us, what do we become, when we kill in the ""name of righteousness"". Is killing ever righteous? What happens when we look our enemy in the eye and hear his grievance? Can we kill him so easily then? Is vengeance worth the continuing cost in violence and mayhem? And what of our outrage being used by our government to make us instruments of their own unspoken agenda? Who wins when we set out, ""eye for an eye"", and how much of our humanity can we maintain while committing heinous acts in retribution? Note that none of these questions mentions Jews or Palestinians. These are human questions, questions of morality and of our souls and of our survival together on the planet.<br/><br/>Spielberg and Kushner present the facts in a gutwrenching way without trying to drag us to one camp or the other. They weave subtlety into what could at any moment become heavy-handed and belligerent, but doesn't. They force the two sides to look one another in the face, force us to look in the mirror, force us to see the excruciating nuance buried in the stark rubble of black and white thinking. We can continually blow up the other side, forever. And we have. And we probably will.<br/><br/>But we don't have to. And we can't continue without stopping to consider the consequences, the damage to our own souls, the perpetuation of the violence and death.<br/><br/>I'm hearing and reading of people refusing to see this film because they ""heard"" it was not balanced, or they don't like Spielberg, or they assume Jews can't write and direct a film that looks at the situation without tipping the scales towards Israel.<br/><br/>But the film is not about Israel and the Palestinians. It is about the human heart, the need for safety and identity that expresses itself in the desire for a homeland, desperation and the drive toward vengeance and the toll that they take.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent, especially Eric Bana. And watch for Ayelet Zurer, who was also wonderful in Nina's Tragedies."
"subscriptions","7","2","4","27 December 2005"," Brief summary of the plot and the message
","The Munich terrorist attack is merely the film's setup, resulting in Israel forming a team of assassins to track down and kill the terrorists responsible for planning the attack. The film follows this team as they locate and assassinate their targets, and eventually become targets themselves. The main character is the team's leader, who after the job is done is plagued by doubts about whether his actions were morally justified and by worry for his family's safety. He insists that his boss proves to him that all the men he killed were guilty, which the boss is unable to do, presumably making Spielberg's argument for using the more formal court system in order to determine guilt. He also asks whether his actions actually made a difference in light of the fact that all the men he killed were merely replaced by more violent ones, which his boss is unable to answer but which is implicitly answered by the fact that this conversation is happening in view of the still-standing twin towers."

","People should learn from history, and yet we keep on repeating some vicious circles. Much praise is to be given to Spielberg's courage for exploring a moment in history that many would choose to forget. There are outstanding moments in this film, from its near perfect direction by Spielberg, a man who seems incapable of making a bad film to Eric Bana's moving portrayal of a man tortured by circumstances he has very little power to change.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect, moving a little too slow at times and would have benefited by the removal of a few redundant scenes, but it carries a big powerful punch, one that it isn't easy to ignore. In fact, there were a few people discussing it outside the theater, and it amazed me how little they had chosen to understand.<br/><br/>It will probably be a controversial work of art, and that is what is supposed to be as long as it makes people ""talk"" instead of choosing other more destructive ways to solve problems. It is a movie that should be seen, discussed, and used as an example by people who want to make the world a better place."

","I went to see this movie with my parents. They remembered the massacre of the Israelis at the Munich Olympics, and told me that the movie would be good. It would not be full of action, though...and I think that's what disappointed some people at the movie theater, who were expecting people to kick ass and take names.<br/><br/>I thought Eric Bana was wonderful as Avner, the man hired to be head of the secret operation, and the character of Steve (who ""doesn't care about any blood but Jewish blood""), played by Daniel Craig, was perfectly portrayed as a man who wanted to rush gung-ho into things, but luckily had Bana to calm him down.<br/><br/>It showed the truth of killing and assassination: you cannot have a conscience. If you do, you cannot get anything done. Their first kill was hard (they follow the Arab home to his apartment building and do a 'clumsy' kill by shooting him through his bag of groceries), then it got easier and easier for Bana. Even later, he admits to feeling ""no remorse."" But Bana, the main character in this film, is not completely heartless. He cares very much for his family and his pregnant wife, though I did not think the sex scenes were necessary to show love for one another. A part that touched me was when he called his wife, and his baby girl said ""dada"" over the phone to him, and he started crying. This shows that under the guise of assassin, he was a family man. Later on, however, after they end up getting 7 out of the 11 Arab assassins, he becomes completely paranoid and storms into the Israeli Embassy in New York, demanding they leave his family alone. This is the price he had to pay for doing this line of work.<br/><br/>I am 23 years old, and I enjoyed the story. I wish I knew more about the tale of the Munich Olympic assassinations (I wasn't even born at the time) and wish I had read more about it. So if you don't know a lot about it, read a little on the Munich Olympic assassinations and the story behind Israel, and what they did. Don't expect this movie to be all action; Spielberg is very big on story-driven movies. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film, very provocative and well done. It kept me entertained. For his performance, Bana deserves a nomination from the Academy, as does Spielberg for his directing and his wonderful story!"

I found out that the movie had a lot of bad critics for not being accurate to history and I agree: The real operation of the ""Mossad"" called ""wrath of god"" was a highly skilled operation in order to track down the responsibles for the massacre and avenge the death of the athletes. In the movie, the team of assassins act like amateurs which is kind of disappointing cause the story becomes unrealistic. I expected from Spielberg to make better work out of the film. With that being said, I did enjoy the whole plot and how the main character, Avner (Eric Bana) loses faith in his mission and government. The other actors were fantastic as well.

","PROS:
~The movie underlines that there is a very fine line between justice and vengeance. It encourages the viewers to ask themselves some ethical questions about what is right or wrong. Spielberg chooses not to pick a side (at least he tries to a point) between Palestinians and Israeli: the first seek their own homeland and the second ones respond against every act of terror.
~Eric Bana gives a powerful performance. He initially believes that it is his duty to accomplish his mission only to realize that this situation can cost his saul. In other words, he leaves his beautiful wife (played by the gorgeous Ayelet Zurer) for a cause that leads to an endless circle of conflict (every leader is replaced by another one). The scene where he goes to sleep in the closet captures perfectly his paranoia and his mental breakdown.
~From the rest of the cast, Ciaran Hinds shines as the 'cleaner' of the team and he is the only member who constantly questions the purpose of their actions. Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Almaric as the source of Avner are respactable in their roles and they are actually the only ones who understand that everyone has their own agenda so they choose to make a profit themselves capitalizing on their knowledge. Last but not least, Geoffry Rush as the handler of Avner kills it once again and he shows an emotional detachment in the ending scene.
~Every mission of the movie offers a moral lesson to the main characters. In the first killing they test their ethical limits when they see a little girl be involved in their mission. Furthermore, the conversation with a hostile team is thought-provoking for the viewer and the hotel segment makes the protagonist reconsider their allies and their enemies.
~The music score by John Williams is haunting and adds depth to the movie. The cinematography is beautiful and the masterful direction captures perfectly the era of 70s.<br/><br/>CONS:
~The last intimate scene of Bana is rudiculous. The intercut between Avner having sex with his wife and the brutal killing of the hostages is so awkward because nobody wants to see Bana's orgasm at the same time with the happening of such a horrifying event.
~Although Spielberg's intention to present both sides of the coin with an objective eye, the side of Palestinians is uneven compared to the Israeli and a further examination of their actions was required for such a subtle matter.
~The character of Daniel Craig is out of place and one-dimensional. Moreover, it is kind of amateurish that Kassovitz's character is chosen for the making of the explosives without having the proper knowledge."
"blrnani","7","0","0","12 May 2020"," Answering two criticisms
","My colleagues here have given us some excellent descriptions and reviews, so i will just focus on these two aspects:
Firstly, there is the creation of the imaginary (?) French organization with international tentacles, which seems like a device that avoids revealing Mossad's real methods of going about occumulating information, including through the infiltration of 'enemy' organizations by operative who may well still have been in place at the time the film was made. It also serves as a useful device to deliver a few messages about ethics and political workings.
Secondly, there is the omission of the Lillyhammer and Salameh assassinations, both of which involved errors on the part of Mossad. But I don't think it was to protect Mossad that Spielberg didn't address them directly. I believe it was because they would detract from the basic point he was making in the film about the way vengeance exacts an emotional and moral price on the perpetrator, regardless of how justified their acts may seem to be. After all, even official state executors are changed fairly regularly, so how much more difficult must it be for agents hunting down their quarry amidst the goings on of ordinary human life? Indeed we would find it monstrous if they didn't suffer from conflicting emotions, since the alternative would be regarded as cold blooded fanaticism.
Spielberg has delivered an excellent work in the thriller genre, but there is a lot more going on here, for those who want to scratch below the surface and study the interweaving of complex psychological and political threads."

","It was the first major public attack on Jewish people since the horrors of the holocaust. Munich captures the complex relationship which the Israeli people had with, not only the Arab nations, but even amongst themselves. At a time where the Arab spring was in the height of its transitional domination of some countries, this movie is an entertaining look into Israel's militant secret intelligence agency, the Mossad. Munich does its best to be impartial, or rather, it does its best to expose the shortcomings on both sides, but ultimately it fails to properly portray some of the more colossal failures of the Israelis retaliation attacks. Especially when showing the collateral damage and murdering of innocent citizens the agents were responsible for on foreign soil.

I want to thank Steven Spielberg for believing in himself to tell this story but also have the confidence to tell the events of the film as they happened and not tweak things for dramatic purposes just an outstanding effort from this incredible master of film, John Williams Thank you once again for composing a score of reflection and memories but also thank you for remembering the events of that tragic day in 1972 and the same goes to Steven Spielberg thank you for remembering the past and that now allows to look forward into the future with a determination to win the battle that lie ahead they will take time and a long time at that but still thank you so much for remembering the past and commemorating the victims who died in 1972 and this review is dedicated to the countless people who died in Munich!"

","It is Spielberg's correct decision to allow characters to supersede, or at least equate to, the story itself. Not with many films you can boast that ""no understanding of characters, no story"". This story is one of the most intriguing ones ever filmed. But the revealing quality is even superior. From the very first scene of some Olympics athletes ignorantly helping the would-be assassins to enter the compound and subsequently executed their horrific mission, we see human faces reflecting heartiness, positiveness, deep hatred, and incredible self-absorption. The following scenes are nothing but human hearts driving the film. The script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth should be remembered as one of the best. It attempts to tell a murky and morally ambivalent story and turns it into clarity. The final conversation between Avner and Ephraim is perhaps the only one with intentional unclear message. His ""no"" to breaking bread is a simply a bureaucratic way of handling such an issue, or a deep sense of disappointment and disdain? Broadly speaking, we know which direction the Jewish Steven Spielberg would lean towards. We saw ""Schindler's List"" and his numerous interview of guilt complex as a Jew who did too little for fellow Jews. However, he daringly made this film to be an anti-hero story. A great doubt of an eye to an eye approach of life and religion is clearly exhibited. But there is nothing that the Israelis and Jews in general can complain about. On top of all that, ""Munich"" is an intensely exciting film to watch. Colourful and watchable. No dull moment. All words spoken are with a purpose. Political thrillers do not usually come out any better."

","Based on the true events that followed the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists, ""Munich"" covers the Israeli government's secret mission to exact justice and kill the terrorists responsible who escaped. Steven Spielberg once again tackles a controversial subject without making judgment on the protagonists himself. We follow the leader (Eric Bana) of the group sent on the mission of vengeance. His group is funded secretly by the government of Israel, but has no contact with them. They must find their victims through leads or info they get on their own, mostly through nebulous sources, who might be playing both sides against the middle. Noticeable is a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig who shines as one of the group members. Bana's character leaves his life behind for the mission, missing the birth of his child after his wife moves to Brooklyn in the USA. He struggles with the separation, as well as struggling over dealing justice in this manner, and possibly endangering his family. The film itself stirs up tension, but might have been edited a little tighter and less lengthy. Also, there is slight difficulty in some scenes in identifying who exactly is who when differentiating between the good guys and bad."
"yfm3594","10","0","0","1 October 2013"," a tragedy causes a chain of revenge
","This is based on the Munich massacre and Israel's vengeance after that. Avner Kaufman, acted by Eric Bana, is appointed as a leader of assassination team by the Israeli government to revenge the people who arranged the Munich massacre. Although Avner carries out the plan successfully at first, bloody days and unstoppable violence gradually deprive him of his mind. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is mainly known for his entertaining movies, such as Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or E.T. However, he shows another talent in this movie. In fact I can't believe he made this even now. He dealt with so difficult and complicated topics; a conflict based on history and religion and a chain of hatred. In making this movie, he didn't simplify the situation and events but succeeded in editing those as a single work. In addition, owing to the great directions, we can feel a gloomy atmosphere suitable for this bloody movie all around the scenes. As a whole, I think this is one of the masterpieces of movie world. <br/><br/>Is there a justifiable murder in the world? This movie put the question to us, but never tells us the answer. Violence leads to another violence. But nevertheless, we sometimes view that as necessary. I couldn't watch this without thinking over such a thing. Actually this movie doesn't leave pleasant aftertaste. However, I'm sure it's worth watching. Try this, and then, what do you think of it?"

","(SPOILERS) About the film, Munich, I was confounded by some of the ideologies, terrified by the expressed potentialities and convinced that those drunken 'mericans were intended to represent CIA interlopers.<br/><br/>Like the rest of mankind, I have a limited knowledge of actual events. Only historically and then only after some of the filters have fallen away, might we know what these individuals and governments were up to, went through, and to what degree/end they succeeded/failed. For political action films, my initial attentions focus on the realities of physical events (devices, vehicles, locations) and the acting (characters, dialog) not my perception of the truth at the time I am viewing.<br/><br/>Only recently have I learned to withstand my own predisposition to believe that ""...based on actual events."" means anything. Unless it is a first hand, objective accounting of a single perspective backed up by unedited documentation - it is fiction. To call it ""a memoir"" or ""based on a true story"" is just a disclaimer. Here is the simplest truth: someone fabricated a storyline and wrote it down.<br/><br/>Many reviews decried the freelance killing of the Dutch houseboat woman. While brutal, it is among the most realistic death scenes, ever. The subtlety of her reaction to having been shot, the manner in which she made a semi-conscious rationalization to leave the room, then defaulted to a familiar action (approaching the cat) the decreasing abilities to function that resulting in her with finality, but as though she was only short on alternatives, visit a necessary chair. It was a wonderful scene, acting-wise. And yes it was horrific. One thing I noticed is the number of comments about the shooters ""reloading,"" them ""shooting her again"" and then leaving her exposed. Unless there are several cuts, I saw a third man perform the ""coup De gras"" and then after one of the original shooters closed her robe, the third man brazenly uncovered her again and said, ""leave it..."" or to that effect. All the whining about nudity, grace, fairness and decency fails to sway my opinion that it was very well acted.<br/><br/>This film and those like it are about reality; bad people in a grossly mismanaged geopolitical world. (Wake up! Yes, it's a mess, and no, I couldn't do better at picking up after their droppings.) Those whose sensitivities are disturbed by the violence of political drama must to take some responsibility. Either do a little more research into what you choose to watch, or stop complaining about how the big mean world is being depicted. On the other hand - one might stick with fantasy...For instance, 1950's musicals or U.S. prime-time network television...the truly mindless stuff of life."

","Steven Spielberg, is the most efficient director in Hollywood. It takes a classic work of art to take you back into some period and make you experience what the people would have faced. Steve has done this with perfection. The execution of the film, has been absolutely spectacular. It makes you feel as if you are in the middle of the things and makes your heart go out to them. The script has been written in a brilliant manner and the scenes of the massacre are heart tearing, I am sure a few tears would be rolling down. The music and images drill deep inside you and leave a lasting impact. From the performances point of view Eric bana stands out, has been the best suited to the role. Perhaps this can be surely called one of his best performance ever. Daniel craig looks good as an aggressive israeli, but could have been better. Geoffrey rush and other cast has done a great job too.. All in all it was an eric bana film. Perhaps, that was the only thing lacking in the film, what could have been shown as a movie for the nation with a bigger perspective, in some scenes was left restricted to a single man movie. But that definitely does not take the credit away from it being a superb movie, which should be watched by everyone."

","Not to lose to much words, quote Rathko: ""'Munich' is an intelligent and gripping thriller"" and offers the ethical bias and conflict that lies in the question: is it right to fight enemies, which use all bloody possible ways and methods of achieving there goals, yourself with all possible (even illegal) methods? To be judge, jury and executioner? Is this right or do I become even myself then a terrorist? And where then lies the difference between them and me? Positive: The movie asks this question and can't it. Negative: The display of the inner doubts and bias is too clichéd and superficial to be plausible and the the persistent references of the Munich-Massacrer in the form of dreams of the main protagonists are just too kitschy and overblown to be a real outstanding film."

","Spielberg is a master... when he wants to be. Or, usually he is. Munich has to mark the first occasion where I've felt that Steven Spielberg has tried, succeeded, but still failed. Unlike the misguided A.I., this film is good -- it's quite good, in fact.<br/><br/>As has been the trick of late, the sepia tones and oversaturation are in play. The cinematography, the responsibility of Janusz Kaminski, is well-handled and beautiful.<br/><br/>But it is, in fact, this technical aspect which most weighs down Munich. It distracts unnecessarily from the action. In Saving Private Ryan, it reflected the bewilderment of the characters; here it seems to prevent us from seeing the action clearly. In truth, the bleeding colors and gold-red tinged moments represent the moral vacuum of the plot: is it justice, or murder, that Avner (Eric Bana) and his crew are exacting? Following the 1972 massacre of several members of the Israeli national team by Islamic terrorists, Avner is recruited by the Mossad to lead a team of assassins in the killings of 11 men of prominence in the Munich incident. Of course, this is a petty set-up that seeks to examine the rightness vs. wrongness of such an endeavor. Spielberg avoids the clichés by deliberately avoiding commentary. This is an exploration of ideas of nationalism and humanity and where they collide; nothing more.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional. Screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth fashioned a strong script, and the actors are given terrific material to work with. Daniel Craig and Bana are standouts, but equally stellar (and probably better) is Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>Munich is too long, especially since it never reaches any conclusion. There is no reward for any viewer who watches the entire film; the insights end half an hour before the credits roll. This might ruin the film for some, but the subject matter is contemplative enough to keep one placid through the end.<br/><br/>There did happen to be one scene which I picked as my favorite. Avner has sent his wife and child to Brooklyn while he continues working in Europe. He calls his wife, who is carrying his daughter in her arm. When he hears his daughter call him ""Dada,"" he wells up in tears. This scene is my favorite because I felt it summed up the film, that is, there are no monsters in the war of ideology; only humans."
"hnt_dnl","10","0","0","14 July 2008"," Perhaps Spielberg's most fully realized human film
","Interesting that with all the hype for MINORITY REPORT and AI, Spielberg's true masterpiece of the 2000s may just be this film MUNICH. MUNICH is perhaps that only film that Spielberg has directed that doesn't manipulate the viewer in some way and tries to take sides. In that sense, it's the most human film that he's ever done. It displays all characters, whether the 'good guy' Israeli Mossad agents, or the 'bad guy' terrorists that took part in the 1972 assassinations of the Israeli Olympians that are the agents' prey, as multi-dimensional, with beliefs, feelings, and humanity. The deaths in these films are as realistic as anything you'll see on film. No glamorizing, no over-the-top special effects. So you come away from it feeling bad for the victims, even though they perpetrated a horrific crime.<br/><br/>MUNICH stars newcomer Eric Bana in a great performance (how he didn't get a Best Actor nod is beyond me) as Mossad agent Avner, who leads a group tasked by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to assassinate the Palestinian terrorists who killed members of Israeli Olympic team. Included in this team are Steve and Ephraim (played by the fine actors Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush). These men are surprisingly plain, down-to-earth people with families and many interests, not the cold-blooded assassins that you would expect. They actually sit down with each other regularly to have meals together (Avner is an excellent cook) and converse about their personal lives. This part truly humanizes them to the viewer and makes the terror all the more real b/c it's hard to imagine these men as killers, so when we see them do it, we are mortified.<br/><br/>Being a true story based on horrific events, MUNICH is surprisingly not boring or downbeat. The characters are so interesting, vivid, and multi-faceted that you stay glued to the screen. It's almost amazing that this is a film directed by Steven Spielberg, who I greatly admire, because there is no sentimentality, manipulation, or heavy-handedness whatsoever. Even in some of his best works, that has been the case, but not here, which belongs among his best. The ending is truly not a Spielberg ending that you would expect. I think that MUNICH is the film where we really see a different side of Spielberg, not SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br/><br/>After seeing MUNICH, I really wonder how it did not take home the Best Picture prize of 2005 or director for Spielberg. I don't care that Spielberg had already won 2 directing Oscars. This should have been his 3rd."

","One of the reasons I like listening to George Carlin is because he examines big themes that encompass all of society, like war and racism, but also themes that concern individuals, right down to ""people who use quotation marks in the air while they're talking."" A similar thing draws me to Munich. Munich is about the conflict in Israel, but it is also about how a few men handle being assassins, and how one man handles having some of his closest friends killed. I really liked how there were a bunch of scenes where people died, but the death isn't dramatized or slowed down. It almost happens faster than you expect, which creates a good effect. Munich also does a good job of not being preachy. I think Spielberg said something like ""10 people could walk into this movie and come out thinking 10 different things about what it said about the Israel conflict."" Spielberg does a good job of giving a voice to a lot of the viewpoints surrounding the conflict but not hitting you over the head with any them, letting you wrestle with them. The events in the movie seemed to say ""This is real. People are going to die senselessly no matter what course of action is taken,"" but they didn't seem to be trying to pushing you to one side of the issue. Definitely a solid movie.<br/><br/>A minor point: The Mosad in real life is the most advanced intelligence agency in the world. The Mosad in this movie is pretty f**king stupid."
"rajdoctor","7","0","0","3 June 2008"," Munich
","After re-locating myself to Amsterdam, I have slowly developed an interest in understanding Europe, Jews, issues surrounding Jerusaleum and Palestine  listening and watching different viewpoints (mainly on CNN and BBC). I read in one of my Google searches that Munich was a movie that was discussed and debated a lot on many blogs about its stand on Palestine and Israel. With new Indiana Jones releasing this week and the commonality between them being Steven Spielberg, I decided to have a look at Munich  a movie I had missed while it was released for the first time.<br/><br/>The story line is simple  Avner (Iric Bana) is chosen by Israel government to eliminate the masterminds of 1972 Munich Olympics massacre done Palestine terrorists. Avner gets enough money and freedom to do whatever he wants to eliminate the people. The whole operations is planned to be done undercover without anyone knowing about the motives or purposes of the operations. Avner hires four other persons (one of them is Daniel Craig) and the movie rolls into the planning and execution parts of seven out of eight killings - one after the other. There are intermittent discussions within this group on political issues and difference between Israel and Palestine. In the end Avner finds his team being target of elimination and when he is the only surviving member of his team, he thinks they were used as a pawn in the big political game which does not help or benefit anyone.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book: Vengeance  The story of an Israel Counter Terrorist Team. It seems that Director Steven Spielberg invited four script writers and collated Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's scripts to make the movie.<br/><br/>Iric Bana is very good in the movie; he is so handsome and has acted also well. Daniel Craig is okay in the small role.<br/><br/>The movie focuses more on the execution of murderous attacks rather than the Israel  Palestine issue. So it is a big let down for those who looked up to Steven Spielberg to provide an interesting and intelligent take on it. What we see is a run of the mill, commercial take by Steven Spielberg. May be that was his intention. For me it became evident that the director wanted to project human face of the counter terrorist Jew sqaud  where they delay the killings because of some humane reasons. There were also many pro-Jew statements, and a few con-Jew statements were so disguised that one can easily miss them. I get a feel that Steven Spielberg was a big scared of the Hollywood Jews lobby.<br/><br/>I read that many Jews who wanted Steven Spielberg to take a strong pro-Jew stand took objection to this run of mill movie. I also found last sex scene of Iric Bana with flashback of Munich killing  so corny and 'B' grade.<br/><br/>Overall a good entertaining movie  if one does not expect intellectual discussions around it.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.75 out of 10)"

","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen): ""You know what movie I just saw again the other day, which is bleeping, like, mind-blowing and I haven't seen it since it came out is Munich."" Jay (Jay Baruchel): ""Oh, Munich!"" Jonah (Jonah Hill): ""Oh, man, Munich bleep rules."" Jay: ""Munich is awesome!"" Ben: ""That movie was Eric Bana kicking bleep ass! Through every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. Munich flips it on its ear. We're capping motherbleep."" Jonah: ""Not only killing but bleep, like, taking names."" An excerpt from the film ""Knocked Up"" pretty much sums it up for me. Munich bleeping rules. That's that. No questions asked.<br/><br/>When a group of Palestinians killed a bunch of Israelis in the 1972 Munich Olympics, the Israeli version of CIA - Mossad assigns the son of a war hero, Avner and four more people to hunt down and assassinate 11 people who had a hand in the Munich massacre. Avner is portrayed by Eric Bana. He played the role perfectly. He is the ultimate choice for the role of Avner. His emotions are so surreal it scares you.<br/><br/>The script is fantastic. I sometimes have problems with lengthy movies because sometimes its just two and a half hour of chock-full dialogues and the boredom sets in. But in Munich, I wanted more. The dialogues are there and at the same time the action is also present. Every hit they take is breath taking, like literally it will take your breath away. Its like going for a dip in an ocean and there's a shark behind you and you're scared as hell, that's the feeling that I felt every time they kill someone. Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zurer and Geoffrey Rush co-stars and every each one of them were A-okay for me.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg made an absolute masterpiece. Every little thing is perfect, the acting, the music, cinematography, editing every little bit is well planned and well executed.<br/><br/>This film is not black propaganda. Its an epic tale of vengeance, loyalty, betrayal and paranoia. Munich is a 10 and highly recommended."
"ericmcclain","8","0","0","24 October 2006"," Very intriguing film
","Spielberg has once again directed a film that not only entertains you but keeps you thinking long after the credits roll. Munich manages to tell a true story with just enough embellishment to keep it entertaining while sometimes blurring the documentary line. Sometimes in the film he reminds us we are still in the narrative realm by being somewhat melodramatic. The violence is there too making it look creepily real. The idea of squads of assassins roaming the streets waging a secret war on each other leaving civilians in their wake is scary to say the least. The film had me captured from the beginning until the end and congratulations to Spielberg for directing yet another great film that will probably stand the test of time."
"grandenchilada","8","0","0","17 October 2006"," Munich: or Spielberg grows up, kind of...
","I have to respect a movie that has managed to annoy both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian craziness. Some Palestinians are complaining that Munich's sympathies are more with the Israelis (what did they expect?); on the other hand, some formerly ultra-secret Mossad agents, even more secret than Maxwell Smart, have argued that the movie fudges the facts and that's not the way they did things (pray tell: just how do you do things at the Mossad?). All the carping is a fitting tribute to a movie that tries too hard to appease everybody. Good luck with that one, Steve-o! Munich is a really interesting mishmash. On the one hand, it has the directorial powers of one Steven Spielberg, a prodigy at film-making, who could not stop being entertaining and just plain freaking dazzling if a court order asked him to. On the other hand, the film was written by Tony Kushner, a playwright who likes to whip himself into a frenzy about big, hairy moral issues, and Eric Roth, the man responsible for serious-minded Hollywood spectacles like The Insider (Russell Crowe vs. Big Tobacco), Ali and the inexcusable Forrest Gump. This means that Munich is weirder than a mole enchilada with hummus and whipped cream on top. The Spielbergian magic is there in all its gripping glory, with sequences so beautifully staged, so tight with tension that they are not only a marvel, but, as in Spielberg's best work, they refuse to leave your mind long after you've left the theater. Sometimes he gets carried away and Munich feels like a spunkier, nastier version of a James Bond flick. Give him four guys with explosives and guns and watch him unleash spectacularly controlled mayhem. Yet true to form, he cannot ever let a movie happen without a completely gratuitous subplot about a father and son (it's his Rosebud), and he certainly cannot have a movie without heaping amounts of schmaltz. Still, Munich has the best writing ever seen in a Spielberg film. The movie illustrates with many intelligent twists the utter pointlessness of avenging murder with murder. As the plot unfolds, there is always a TV set tuned to another terrorist act, making it clear that the bloodbath is neither cleansing nor bringing closure to anyone. The writers give the audience a crash course on the long list of grievances of the Jewish people, and they insert the equally grievous list of the Palestinians, doing both with clunky dialog that hits the audience in the head like a ball of hardened falafel. There are several ridiculous scenes where checking your disbelief at the door is required, like one preposterous scene set up to facilitate an exchange between the Mossad leader Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana, gorgeous and fantastic) and one of the Palestinian terrorists. In it, Kaufman is extremely harsh and contemptuous of the Palestinians while the Palestinian makes his case for a homeland strongly and compellingly. The writing is sharp in a Israeli-Palestinian Conflict 101 kind of way, but the situation is absurd. It's a pajama party! Thus, I beg to differ with those who complain that all the sympathies lie on the Israeli side. Quite the contrary: you can hear the writers and the director spinning like the Tazmanian Devil on acid as they grapple with the kvetching of one side and the other (both of which I am sick of, if you must know). So even with all the cheese inside this blintz, my hat off to Spielberg and Kushner and Roth for making sure we remember that we Jews have a historical moral obligation not to behave like savages and that revenge is an eternal nightmare that turns people into murderers and the world into hell."

","Spielberg has done it again. This film, combined with the tremendous acting power of Eric Bana and the up and coming Daniel Craig among others really comes together to create this epic masterpiece, some might complain about its length, but I have to be honest, the shorter the film (a good quality film) the worse, I love to watch the same characters over a length of time and watch them evolve and become a different character than the one they were at the start of the film. Visually this film is on par with nothing, as it exceeds every boundary while keeping true to the gritty realism that permeates throughout it. I look forward to more work from Spielberg since he seems to only get better with age."

","I watched this movie with a certain hesitation. 1. Did I want to be reminded of this event in view of our current world situation, I was 19 when this happened and remember the news from the the time. 2. What has Hollywood done with this story, is it simplified, glorified etc.<br/><br/>I took the chance on two things, 1. Steven Speilburg, no more need be said and 2. Eric Bana, here is an actor who can give some serious credibility to a character and he does.<br/><br/>The movie is violent of course, the story is about violence and as Speilburg explains before the movie, it is trying to explore the ramifications of using counter violence and the pressure this puts on the people involved. This point comes out strongly as the story unfolds, to where we see the main character becoming a man haunted by his own ghosts and questioning his superior's' motives. Not unlike present times and current political situations. Although the story is dated, 30 years ago, it made me ask some serious questions. Did this event in fact escalate the terrorism to today's situations, did it actually achieve anything, apart from revenge and so on. If any thing this movie really provoked in me a new way of looking at current issues, and seeing the similarities from 30 years ago and now. As I watched this movie I found myself experiencing many different emotions, to mention one scene, where Eric Bana's character is talking on the staircase at the safe house with the PLO member Ali about their supposed ideologies. Many poignant points are made through out the movie, and while I found it to be politically evenhanded, there are still many questions which could be aimed at both sides of the conflict. The last scene in particular, with the skyline of New York in the background and the final conversation really left me feeling shaken by this movie. I actually watched all the credits and listened to the music until the screen went black, mostly because I felt too numbed to move and it was not due to the hard theater seats, I watched this on DVD in the comfort of my own chair at home.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie has definitely delivered the goods, although I believe that those goods will be interpreted in many ways by any one who watches this movie. I know this movie was made in 2005, however here in Japan it has just been released on DVD (8/21), taking into account recent and current world events, the timing for release of this movie if anything gives it a bit more punch."

","I wouldn't rate this with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, or some other Combat/War based films I feel are classics, but it's a solid movie.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent, I thought Eric Bana did a convincing job in his role. He basically gets across the point that he's a man torn between devotion to his country, his family, and his sanity. I enjoy films that focus the strain put on the mind of the warrior (or in this case assassin) much more than films that just glorify the actions of the ""hero"". The mental affects that a mission of this type, one that's so up close and personal to those targeted, they clearly should be a focal point of his character and I felt the film did a nice job of showing that stress.<br/><br/>The effects were nicely done and I felt that Spielberg did a good job of making sure the props and environment appeared early 70's ish. I also didn't feel a sense of political propaganda either; the Palestinians were doing what they felt was right and the Israelis were responding in a way that they felt was right. I felt that in this case a story was told rather than a justification for one side or the other.<br/><br/>It was definitely a solid film, in this case I only rented it but had I saw it at the theater, I would have left satisfied."

The majority of the film revolves around a group of 5 assigned to track down and kill the Palestinians who executed the murders.<br/><br/>Spielberg claimed at the time of release that this movie doesn't side with either group, but puts the story out there for us to make a decision. I certainly feel the movie leans towards the Israelis, which is no great surprise considering Steve's origins. It certainly doesn't glorify revenge, but it also doesn't show many repercussions for the Israeli assassins.<br/><br/>As usual the directing was great, the cast solid, but not spectacular, and the sets were excellent. Not overly gripping but was pretty good for what it was."

","Overall it was a great movie. I believe that Spielberg was given inside info on how the executions were carried out. I too believe that without the sex I would have given it a 10. I feel that the men probably did not have so much a feeling of regret as they got thru with their job. Also Israel should make the point that if you commit such crimes against citizens of Israel that you can run but you cannot hide. If the USA would have done the same to the criminals that held our citizens for 444 days in Iran then there would be less idiots always threatening America. Cudos go to Spielberg for having the courage to make such a film."

","Munich was pretty good. I don't have too much to say about the movie itself. What I will say is that I was happy to see it go beyond a revenge thriller, and I wasn't surprised that it did. Spielberg is a good director--he's very popular, and that can sometimes make movie critics and movie lovers assume that he's a sellout or whatever, but I think Spielberg is something like Hitchcock (I'm not saying that he's as good as Hitchcock, as I'm quite convinced that he's NOT): he's a good director who knows how to make audiences happy while, at the same time, producing some good cinematic art. This movie took its time, which I was thrilled to see, and in so doing it let us feel the discomfort that its protagonist felt--the array of emotions from grief and vengeance to hesitation and regret that go into a human being who's signed on to do some incredible inhuman things to other human beings. I recommend seeing this movie--it raises questions that politicians today have trouble raising without being blasted as unpatriotic or as terrorist sympathizers or whatever.<br/><br/>What I do want to mention, though, is the introduction that Spielberg opted to append to the beginning of the DVD version of this film. It's disappointing at best, and spinelessly cowardly at worst. I suggest that, if you have not yet seen the movie and plan to, you should skip Spielberg's intro and go straight on to the movie. You can always check out the intro afterward. You see, I tend to like artists best when they do their art and then shut up. I don't love when artists offer their own interpretation of their work, and I especially don't like it when artists engage in defenses of their work in response to criticism (either aesthetic or ideological). In the introduction to Munich, Spielberg rushes to defend himself from two charges--one: criticism of Israel, and two: advocacy of non-response to terrorism. His comments really angered me for a number of reasons. First of all, he made the movie, it raises good questions, and no intelligent viewer could possibly think that Steven Spielberg was making a movie that slammed Israel. The movie is too obviously a question, not an answer. As for non-response, I feel sick that Spielberg should make this fairly nuanced film, and then, in this gutless introductory apologetic, contribute to the black or white illogical that has framed the debate about the war on terror, as if violence and nothing are the only alternatives we have when choosing to respond to terrorist tactics. It burns me up to see a filmmaker make a complex movie and then almost take it back by issuing one-dimensional, wheedling commentary on his own fine film It's especially angering because he's so clearly responding to ideological criticism, not aesthetic criticism. I'd be less emotional in my response if he was defending his film-making or choice of cinematographer or editing, or whatever, but he's clearly defending his politics. ""No, no, no everybody, I love Israel. And of course we have to fight the war on terror, I mean, duh."" Give me a break. This is even worse that Francis Ford Coppola using his audio commentary on GFIII to defend his decision to use his talentless daughter to play Mary Corleone (talentless as an actor, anyway--my jury's still out on her skill as a director). <br/><br/>Munich is right to suggest that violence begets violence, and when both sides (as if there are only two sides, which is another fallacy) of a violent conflict are willing to fight for hundreds of years and countless generations of children, violence is the only tactic guaranteed NOT to solve the problem. He had the courage to make a movie that articulated that message, and I just wish he had the courage to let that message be and not back down in the face of (probably Zionist) criticism.<br/><br/>Bottom line: see the film, disregard the DVD intro by SS."

","This is one of the greatest pieces of art we will see in the past 20 years, and anyone is doing a disservice to themselves to not watch this film. The cinematography is perfect. I even read the book and I believe this might be the only film that is more powerful than the great book that inspired it. The end is about symbolism to a part of the book's theme and a great deal toward the end that the point of their mission. At the end Avner says, ""There is no peace at the end of this, no matter what you believe."" That is one of the main points and which is why this book and film are things to learn from. It is a must see for anyone who appreciates film or culture. There is not better film in Stephen Spielberg's repertoire than this. And there is a better score that ties every great shot together from John Williams that ties up any loose end and builds the drama of every philosophical question and symbolic presence."

","When I first heard about this movie, I had no clue what it was about. So I researched it and I found myself interested in seeing it. When I went to see it I was expecting a long movie with only partial action. But I was surprised at the action and plot of the story. I definitely think that Munich was one of Speilbergs best films. I liked how the movie was almost 100% accurate and how it had a great cast. Although it only had two real famous actors in it, I liked the rest of the cast too. I think Spielberg did a great job at showing his view of the Munich massacre. The movie also has a great amount of suspense. There are things you will definitely expect when it comes to the killings and there are things that you wouldn't expect. Overall, I think this movie was excellent, I definitely recommend seeing it. Another thing I liked is how it shows a group of five ordinary men working for a secret service, taking out the men who planned Black September, later on you will learn that these five men are not alone and that there were many groups like them trying to accomplish the same goal in taking out the organizers. I said it once and i will say it again, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it may seem slow in the beginning but it only gets better with the action and drama. Definitely a 10 out of 10 film."

","I may have to see it again soon to let it sink in. As it is, it's one of the most powerful films I've seen. The horror of Munich and its aftermath are perfectly captured, as is the ethical ambiguity prevalent in the Middle East conflict. The message is not clear in either direction, and that makes it very strong. Avner's descent from proud Israeli into a paranoid murderer is very well done and incredibly realistic. The back-and-forth nature of terrorism is also captured well, reflecting the near-absence of morality that takes place. That being said, this isn't a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Technically, it has its faults. It's a bit long, and it does drag at the end. It also switches dramatically from an action thriller into a thoughtful drama near the end. The script is also flawed, as there are too many holes and loose ends. I suppose that could represent the cloak-and-dagger nature of the era, but perhaps a bit more could have been explained. The directing was near-flawless, but the editing could have been a bit better. The production design is perfect. The performances are solid and there isn't a weak link. Bana stands out, as he should. The music is terrific; one of Williams' best scores, I think. Whenever that haunting theme came up, you knew that something was about to happen. It's amazing that this was shot so quickly, it's so well-done.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good film about terrorism and human morality. The assassination scenes were both action-packed and dramatically striking. The plot unfolds quite well during the meat of the story, but becomes lost near the end. I know that the ending was there to present a message, but it could have been done in less time, perhaps. The dialogue is a bit hard to understand at time, but the story is never that hard to follow. Overall, a near-great film that may become great after I watch it again. For now, though, I give it a B+."

I have to say this was one of the most moving films I've watched in the last few recent years due to the feel of the era itself. The intensity will grip you from minute to minute and will make you think more of this world today. The authenticity of the characters roles were outstanding, along with the reality of these type of incidents some still might ignore. From the beginning it's a roller coaster with intense moments that pull you to the edge of your seat. Even if you have had no interest in this film because of the tragic circumstances you should watch this film as a reminder of what can happen again and again to humanity when loyalty and bloodshed can't distinguish right from wrong."

","Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma. Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing. MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us. And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.<br/><br/>The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer. From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end. This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.<br/><br/>The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission. They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale). Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers. In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs. It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
"peterm1","Null","0","0","9 May 2006"," What is right and wrong?
","It is difficult to separate this film from its message and from its historical context.<br/><br/>This film reminds me that there are no simple answers, no right thing or wrong thing to do and that any response (or non response) will be wrong in some circumstances. This is perhaps more-so in a situation as complex as the middle east.<br/><br/>In one section of the film, Papa says something to the effect that history has been harsh with your tribe, acknowledging the brutal, ignorant and terrible mistreatment of Jews by other nations through the centuries and giving his personal approbation to Avner's actions. But the film reminds us that violence begets violence and as the exchange between Avner and the terrorist (when forced to share a safe house) indicates, both sides eventually end up looking something less than human.<br/><br/>Does this mean that a violent response to the Palestinian murders was wrong.....I am not sure, at least at that time in history. Isacc Azimov once wrote that ""Violence is the last resort of the incompetent."" Maybe sometimes we are all incompetent and feel we have no choice or no better option. had Israel decided to instead bring the perpetrators before the courts, would other countries have helped? Would they have done any more than mouth platitudes? Probably not, judging by history.<br/><br/>All I can say is that somehow this film captures the dilemma reasonably well without recovering old historical ground (Hitler kills 6 million Jews, and in consequence surviving Jews feel they need a home land. The UN grants Jews part of Palestine and the Palestinians naturally object and fight. Jews win and this sets the scene for a tragedy of global proportions that we are still playing out over 50 years later, and will, no doubt for a long time yet.) Perhaps what the film depicts best is the personal toll that such national strategies take. Yes, after Munich, killing Jews had a high price attached to it but there was also a terrible personal price for those who had to execute the policy.<br/><br/>Outside of the film, I am saddened that Israel has in some ways made itself a pariah (in some quarters anyway) for adopting harsh policies that respond in brutal kind to the Palestinians' own brutalities. I have always felt like the bomb maker in the film - that Jews should set out to be righteous, if not perfect and try to do the right thing. (But Jews also acknowledge that this is only an ideal and joke ""We are just the same as every one else - only more-so!"") perhaps thats what this film is about too.<br/><br/>So what to make of the film? I have not read all of the comments so do not know if anyone else has the same view as me, but I think of it as a tragedy in the true sense of the word.<br/><br/>Perhaps I can leave with one final comment. I was discussing Israeli policies with a (Jewish) friend, when she pointed out that in Israel we find a nation formed by survivors of the Shoah and which is in many ways still traumatized by it. In these circumstances, who can expect less than harsh responses to the brutal provocations of those who at their most extreme call for Israel to be destroyed and every Jew to be slaughtered. These words were so nearly played out in Europe that it must be hard for Israelis to know how to respond even if they wish peace, as I am sure many do. Sadly now, both sides are dancing to the tune of the extremists."

","Munich is the kind of film that few directors dare to make. It is the true kind of controversial film unlike those that claim to be controversial to attract attention. It tells the tale of 5 Israelis that were chosen by the government of Israel to hunt down those who were responsible for the Black September massacre of 11 Israeli atheletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. <br/><br/>The film version of Vengeance, the nonfiction novel telling the tale of this assassination group from the point of view of ""Avner"" the leader of the group written by George Jonas, has been regarded as either ""Pro-Israel"" or ""Anti-Israel"". I would consider it neither, contrary to its source material Vengeance. Spielberg is obviously Pro-Israel in real life but in the film I believe he states that Israel accomplished nothing by sending out the assassination squad headed by Avner except to show the point that Israel is not weak. Though did this symbol stop terrorist violence in the 1970s? No, it merely slowed down a few operations because as Avner stated when one head of Ephraim's monster was cut off, many others struck up in its place. Steven Spielberg's film shows how it is futile to fight fire with fire because all that results is more bloodshed. Or as Avner states in his foreward to the 2005 version of Vengeance ""'An eye for an eye' may seem an appropriate response, but it is not a solution."" The film tried to put out the message that violence cannot solve these kinds of things and that people do not realize the extents a human being will go to to protect his/her country. Munich is a masterpiece and I feel it was not appreciated enough in the year of 2005 and deserved to win the Oscar for best picture. Hopefully Munich will be remembered in the future for all that it tried to accomplish and the change that it made in me.<br/><br/>Also, just so you know I am a 15-year old and I have seen Munich and read the book Vengeance."

"Syrchek","8","0","0","16 April 2006"," This is one gruesome and haunting political thriller.
","Munich follows the story of the 1972 assassination at the Olympic games in Munich, Germany. A group of 11 Israeli athletes was kidnapped and murdered by a group of Palestinians, known as Black September. The Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was determined to find and eliminate the people who executed the attack Therefore Mossad sent five men who were all trained professionals for specific fields, erased their entire data and provided them with large funds. Their mission was to find the members of Black September on the territory of Western Europe and eliminate them one by one.<br/><br/>The film is specifically marked by Spielberg's precise handling and direction. Using long shots, slow zooms and other techniques he intentionally made it look like it was made in the 1970's. The set-design really deepens the sense of being there at that time and place in Europe. As we follow the group of five men, they shortly tracked down and murdered the first one of their targets. Every time they search for someone they move to a new location. They're paying large amounts of money to a source named Louie who provides them with precise info about the identities and whereabouts of their targets. But despite the incredible accuracy of their source, certain members of the group are becoming more and more paranoid and start to doubt about the justification of their mission. Particularly the group's leader, Avner. His head is becoming fuller with horrible images and even fictions about what really happened to the Israeli hostages on that faithful day.<br/><br/>There are at least three parts of the film I would like to stress out. First is the incredible throat-grabbing paranoia that is rising within the group. The danger of their work becomes evident when it's clear that their as much of an easy target as their victims are. The second stress would be about the gruesome and uncompromising graphic depiction of violence. It made me feel repulsive but simultaneously related to the guilt in Avner's head. The third thing that deserves a point out is the performing of all the characters which stays sober and never goes off the tracks to the very end. One thing is also interesting, it's how Avner is unable to recognize himself with the consequences of the mission. Facts just don't matter to him, rationalizing doesn't do him any good. He simply finds no legitimate reason for what he's done. To me this makes Munich a more or less unbiased statement about the events that it described. Besides Brokeback Mountain this is easily the most touching, haunting and quality film I've seen to come out of 2005 (so far).<br/><br/>........ +4/5 ........"

","As an ex-American living in Israel for the past 34 years, I would like to add my personal perspective to Munich. By my standards, it's a good film in that it is not only well made technically, but very thought provoking and engaging on an emotional level. I was not bothered by the fact that it took many liberties with historical fact, since it makes no claim to be a documentary. However, two major flaws caused me a certain level of discomfort. Why portray the Israel Mossad team as mostly non-Israel and extremely amateurish? Since this was so obviously and extremely far fetched, was there a some artistic point and if so what? Secondly and far more disturbing, why was revenge or punishment of the terrorists the only and constant driving motivation given for Israel's response,when the known and obvious factor of self-defense in an on-going war for survival was and still is the operative element in trying to prevent more terror from those who have declared their intentions openly and publicly. When all is said and done, there really are two sides to every conflict. This film may have somehow,and maybe even admirably, attempted to be somewhat even-handed. Maybe that's why others could find more to like in it than either an Israeli or a Palestinean. We, who are still embroiled daily in this on-going, tragic, and complicated conflict need much more than a decent piece of entertainment to help us struggle toward a just and viable solution. So...good movie,yes...but impossible for those who are here, living the reality to really appreciate and find much value in."

","Munich is an intellectual and violent thriller. It explains the events surrounding the 1972 terrorist attack on the Israeli Olympic team. This movie didn't concentrate on just what happened the day of the attacks though. It shows how the Israeli government responded to the attack from the Palestinian terrorists.<br/><br/>In the movie a team of five assassins is assembled to take out key Palestinian targets. They are unofficially employed by the Israeli government. To find their targets they use a French informant. This informant gives good information, but puts them in troublesome circumstances. Eventually three of the five team members are killed, and the team returns without completing their mission, but are still regarded as heroes. Munich showed a lot of politics that still pertain to today. It included terrorism from Muslim nations and the ongoing tension between Israel and Palestine. This movie provided an interesting insight to how politics were sometimes run back then. In the movie it even mentioned that the U.S. was funding terrorists, with the agreement that they would be safe. The government had its secret operations that were neither known about nor legal. They gave the assassination team no guidance besides a list of who they wanted dead. The team assembled wasn't even very skilled or qualified for the job.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the movie was the variety of weapons used in it. Plastic explosives, WWII bombs, sniper rifles, guns, and even a gun in the shape of a tube were all used. <br/><br/>This movie was very intriguing in its political aspects. It was interesting in the way that it portrayed how things were run back in the 1970's. It had tons of action and suspense, but managed to keep an interesting plot. Spielberg did a great job of retelling the events proceeding the terrorist attack of the Munich Olympics."

","Steven Spielberg is an icon. I know nobody who doesn't respect him as a filmmaker, innovator or producer. In any conversation about movies, you've got to mention Spielberg, in fact, the other day me and some friends were talking about him. It's difficult to explain what ""Jaws"" was at its time, and how a director could make box office hits like ""Jurassic Park"" that were actually good pieces of cinema.<br/><br/>The man never did the same thing. He always changed genres and took different roads and decisions. From the extraterrestrial world and his beautiful ""E.T"", going trough dramatic love (""Always"") and children adventures (""Hook""), to profound movies that really have something to say. Here we found the double-faced Spielberg we've seen since forever; the man who did ""Minority Report"" in 2002 and had fun with Tom Hanks in ""Catch me if you can"".<br/><br/>Both were good movies, don't get me wrong, but one was more audacious than the other. Last year proves the same. I was talking to my friends and I said to them: ""You have to choose one Spielberg movie to watch this year; only one. If you're stupid, you'll choose 'War of the worlds'; if you want to see good stuff, you'll choose 'Munich'"". Not one of them answered, but it didn't matter; because this year it happened: ""Munich"" was a good film and ""War of the worlds"" wasn't.<br/><br/>It comes after long periods of years, that Spielberg makes a movie like ""Munich""; a movie with a statement that means something to him. For this reason, it is a picture he directs with a lot of commitment, playing close attention and checking every detail. Ultimately, the film is beautifully shot, the images are breathtaking, the score is accurate (to expect from master John Williams) and the screenplay (Tony Kushner and Eric Roth) is disturbing; thought provoking.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film we witness the events occurred in the 1972 Olympics, in Munich. I was watching the images and thought: ""This is actually what happened?"". My dad gently confirmed my answerThe intelligent Spielberg made a subtle and right decision, leaving the paranoia off the critical scene, which was already real enough for any viewer to tolerate (you'll understand when you watch).<br/><br/>When a director cares about his movie, he shows things as they are, so we can reflect about them; and that's what I mean with audacious. Courage was to shoot that first scene; courage was to shoot a couple of strong sex scenes and some extremely violent, merciless killings. This is an admirable Spielberg because he has nothing to hide.<br/><br/>About the controversy of the film, I'm not taking sides; but if Spielberg is defending the Jews for their actions, he has all the right: he is a Jew. If he doesn't defend them; well he doesn't. Don't try to take sides when you watch it; it's something that happened years ago. Just listen, better watch, the statement ""Munich's"" director is declaring through his images. The story is so important, that the actors become smaller than it. Sadly, the movie is so perfect, that it becomes tiring, and not very good in the end. But I assure you: you will want to get to the end."

","Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is a vengeful and bloody recreation of the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and the subsequent retaliation by the Mossad, the Israeli secret service agency, in response to a day that will forever live in infamy; this day is known as ""Black September"", September 5, 1972.<br/><br/>Spielberg does a fine job presenting the factual aspects of the movie. Although many might disagree, I don't believe that Spielberg ever takes sides between the Israelis and Palestinians. However the problem with Spielberg's interpretation of this infamous and historic event is that he dwells too much on -in fact almost totally on- the revenge killings by members of the Israeli Mossad in response to the Palestinian terrorism and the gory details instead of telling us more about the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole, and the events leading up to Munich. These events include the 1948 Israeli War for independence and the six day war of 1967 in which Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Jordan, the real Palestinian homeland. Also not brought to the forefront in this movie was the Aftermath of Munich and how it has affected Arab/ Israeli relations today- almost thirty five years later.<br/><br/>Spielberg the master director of such box-office mega hits like ""ET"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and ""Jaws"", as well as historically poignant films such as ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Amistad"", misses his mark this time. Although Munich is a good film, it is certainly not a great one. If I wanted to see adventure, gore, and bloody scenes, I could have stayed home to see ""Supernatural"" on the WB network, or ""Twenty Four"" on FOX instead of going to the movies. Actually this movie reminds me more of a TV Land classic from the 1960's called ""Mission Impossible"", with all the adventure, stylish drama and espionage.<br/><br/>The movie stars Eric Bana as the leader of the covert Isreali operation designed to wipe out all of those responsible for planning Munich, those at the time believed to be hiding in Europe, and Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, Avner's (Bana) case manager. Lynn Cohen gives a convincing performance as the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, Golda Meir. Members of Avner's revenge assassin team include character actors Daniel Craig, Hans Zichler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheau Kassovitz.<br/><br/>Besides Cohen as Golda Meir, Bana, the lead actor gives an outstanding performance, which makes up for his other highly popular but pitiful role as David Banner in the dreadful ""Hulk"" movie, a poor re-creation of the great 1970's television series. Bana, in a more poignant role really hits his mark this time. I wish I could say the same for Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The Bana is determined to succeed in his mission, yet he is guilt ridden and apologetic. His character loyally serves his country, and Prime Minister who is somewhat apologetic herself, but realizes that when civilians of a sovereign nation are attacked the way Israel was on 9/5/72, there are people who have to be held accountable. ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"", proclaims Meir.<br/><br/>What Spielberg was trying to avoid which he shouldn't was finding an answer to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which usually begins with the Palestinians seeking political and ideological gain through force which immediately leads to swift and severe retaliation by Israel. The United Nations and the European Union are also responsible for this vicious cycle of violence for letting their global oil interests get in the way of a fair and just compromise for the Palestinians and the sovereign nation of Israel.<br/><br/>Basically I liked this movie ""Munich"" for its vast landscape of 1970's Europe and overall cinematography, and I admire taut and tense action thrillers. But this is a historical film that is missing something important, detailed history, and that is why I don't love it. 3 out of 4 stars."

","*** This comment may contain spoilers!!!! *** Ms. Croze plays the Dutch assassin and is a standout with only a few scenes. As far as I remember she is the only female operative in the movie but in reality all sides of the various conflicts use women. Mossad uses many women operatives in the field because they are less conspicuous than men and many groups like the Symbianese Liberation Army (which was mostly female) and Red Army, PLO, IRA, CIA, Black September are packed with women. This Mossad unit however consists of five men and they seem less than professional at times - almost every one of their attempts to kill a target seems to go wrong. Eventually 2 of them commit suicide one is murdered and the head of the unit Eric Bana goes into meltdown. Although this is definitely his best performance to date - he does seem to overact at times which is why he wasn't nominated. Daniel Craig is also good and seems to keep his head about him while the others fail. Overall this is a great Spielberg movie who fully redeems himself after such duds as War of the Worlds (a remake of a remake of a remake) and especially Artificial Intelligence which was just plain awful. The script here falls flat from time to time thanks to Tony Kushner who is a very preachy playwright (witness Angels in America) - some scenes are excellent like the ones with Golda Meir and the French informant Papa but those scenes were probably written by Eric Roth. This movie does not attempt to be a history lesson since it says it is ""inspired"" by actual events. Lots of dramatic license is taken like the scene where the Mossad and the PLO share the same safehouse. Would that ever actually happen? Despite some flaws like that this is a great movie worthy to stand the test of time."

","Munich is one of those movies which are quite hard to incorporate to any single movie genre. It includes at least action, drama, romance, thriller, adventure and maybe even a bit of comedy. It's like a mix of all those film categories in good ratio. Although, maybe the most surprising thing about the movie is that it is not so ordinary Spielberg film: it doesn't include such a happy ending (like for example Jurassic Park did), but in other hand it's more romantic, emotional and humorist compared to Saving Private Ryan. Concluded: Munich is a mix of thriller, action and drama movie and it contains a lot of violence and blood, but not as much as war movies as you can imagine.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is pretty intelligent: there are many twists and huge surprises and it's entertaining from the beginning to the end titles, during the whole time (almost three hours).<br/><br/>The camera angles works very well. The audience sees just as much as it should see. Not too much, not too less. The emotions are revealed clearly (thanks also to all the actors), but the acting isn't overacted, thought.<br/><br/>The music is once again composed by John Williams. Thanks to him, the music (once again) fits to the movie like nose to face and makes the film even more enjoyable. It would have been a huge mistake to put some metal trash music into this kind of marvelous art, I suppose. But I know that Spielberg wouldn't do anything stupid like that.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about the movie is that Spielberg reveals no doubt his critical political attitude in this movie (concerning about the real events in Munich in 1972). I don't want to spoil this subject anymore... In fact Spielberg tells one point of view about the happenings of the Munich bloodbath.<br/><br/>One of the most bothering issues in the whole movie (especially during the first minutes) was that Germans doesn't speak Germany but English. I understand that this an American film, but in my opinion it had been much better if all the Germany people had spoken Germany, not English. But that's not a big deal.<br/><br/>I don't have anything else to complain about this movie. All I can say is that Munich is a realistic movie about the real events of Munich bloodbath in 1972 Olympics, and it's made with a style. Once you've seen it movie, you're not going to forget it right away, and that's why Munich is really worth of seeing. So, what are you waiting for? Go and see it yourself."
"captainmarvel1331","10","0","0","20 February 2006"," Spectacular, but nothing we haven't seen from War of the Worlds
","I saw two of Spielberg's major films this year; (I believe these were the only two) War of the Worlds and Munich. So, I have decided to compare Munich to War of the Worlds and let the reader decide which one is better and whether they want to see Munich, assuming they've seen War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>Munich is ""loosely"" based around the 1972 Munich Olympics and focuses on the hardships that the assassins went through during the years of hunting the terrorists known as Black September who murdered 12 Israili athletes. The film has an extremely dark tone, although not as dark as War of the Worlds. The main character, Avner, who is the lead assassin, is a husband and soon-to-be father. He is assigned to hunt and kill the 12 terrorist members as long as he stays in the selected European nations. He has four other team members who you will unfortunately not have enough time to get fully acquainted with. This is the storyline of the film. <br/><br/>War of the Worlds, in character senses, develops more of a relationship with the characters in an even less time. This is one thing that puzzles me about Munich. The movie is almost three hours long and has about 5 more characters than War of the Worlds, varying what you consider ""important characters"". So, why does Munich only hint here and there at the character's emotions? I mean, Spielberg does give slight notions towards them, but not enough to fully impact what is going on in their head, except, of course, Avner. <br/><br/>The movie has way too much suspense as well. Because more than 2/3 of the assassins are killed by bombs, the film has so many moments of waiting and expectation. It's almost annoying. War of the Worlds does this sort of thing in the cellar scene, but not as exaggeratedly. <br/><br/>The best scene in Munich consists of AVner loosing his mind and becoming paranoid about who might be hunting HIM. THe scene is beautifully done, but uses so many shots from War of the Worlds and the same techniques that its nothing new. My friends disagree but I believe I'm correct. <br/><br/>Okay, the reason I'm giving this movie a nine out of ten is because I've had a revelation recently about the film. Why the other characters are not so focused upon, why the movie uses seemingly recycled shots, and why the movie ends abruptly and leaves characters behind so simply, and its because the movie is not about the other character, and its not about THIS and THAT and THIS. The movie is about Avner. Solely and completely. He battles through the experience and the tragedy of missing his child's earliest years. Its about what happened, and how. Its about the realization of the disaster and how it will affect Avner's life from there on. <br/><br/>Great movie, but not as compelling, entertaining, and moving as War of the Worlds."

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>This a good film but it has flaws. It has a fast rhythm(which makes its 164 minutes pass quite quickly) and yet if it would have been about 20 minutes shorter, it would have been even more effective. Some of characters are introduced and never showed up later(take for example the character of Mike Harari). The acting is good but not even. Some actors are shining above the others while some actors are merely there because the script required their presence.<br/><br/>Some people complain that the film is far from the true. The film has never intended to be a representation of the true but rather an interpretation for the events and as such it use the subject to say something that is as relevant today as it was relevant for the time it is dealing with. The obvious of what the film want to say is that violence leads to more violence. The less obvious is that in some point the hunter becomes the hunted, that there is always someone who will profit(making money) from all the violence, that there is a moral & personal price to pay when you kill people(even if you think that in the beginning it is for a just cause).<br/><br/>Go and see the film.

","Heavy Spielberg. After taking a walk in the park with Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal and pumping up some energy with War of the Worlds, Spielberg again conjures up heavy material in this movie about conscience, revenge (hence the title of the book it was adopted from) and the human condition in relation to it. Spielberg may have taken liberties in some areas, as a filmmaker he has done that in Catch Me if You Can or anyone for that matter is entitled to artistic liscence, but he captures the reality of the TRAUMA involved in each of the main players. Bana does a terrific job as do those who play his team, and also his wife. One thing I'd also like to point out is that Spielberg and DP Kaminski always always manage to photograph movies BEAUTIFULLY with an aesthetic that's both atmospheric and at times chaos-inducing such as some freestyle albeit carefully calculated hand-held and choreographed sequences. Safe to say that beyond a doubt Spielberg is a master in of biomechanics with respect to blocking and cinematography. You will also see him fabricate the most appropriate visual sensations during some of the most tense sequences such as the under the bed bombing sequence, you will momentarily see human appendage left over and rotating from a ceiling fan amidst Bana going through demolition seeing to it that his sexually active neighbors are safe after the mishap. And there are moments of cliffhanger and tension such as the telephone-bomb sequence. I need not say more, but that is one moment in the cinema when I actually said ""No!!!"", proving that this movie does manage to unnerve when it gets its moments albeit it is a drama by essence. MUNICH does not shy away from violence, but it is a movie that is sort of anti-violence, once again it echoes an innate ability to show compassion and remorse. This is also one aspect where Spielberg's talent and maturity shine as he always depicts his pieces in context of the human condition his movie preceding MUNICH may have been scorned for being a bombast marred by mediocre storytelling yet in that movie I will say it has excelled in portraying the human condition. John Williams, as he has done many times with Mr. Spielberg before showcases versatility and a different type of music, has avery Middle-eastern feel yet deviously and subliminally propulsive that has repetitive motifs of fear, anxiety. And the screen writing? As with most of the best in the art of adaptation of true to life events, the use of temporal displacement is deployed. You'll know what I mean when you see the delay of exposition and progression during the Olympic Massacre. It is flashed back all throughout instead of being depicted all at once. (Would have marred the pacing and flow that way), so I commend the screenwriters as well. While many will be irritated by this expected Spielberg routine: YES the movie ends somewhat low key it has moments of suspense but it is more histrionic and probably this isn't to everyone's taste. In the POV department, who are we supposed to be rooting for? It's instinctive to say Mr. Bana, yes that is a fact but ultimately we are supposed to be examining conscience and our own morales. The movie has also a lot of subliminal portrayals of these issues in society and in our lives, from a lady discussing Karl Marx's theories on right and wrong with respect to situational ethics and philosophy, to temptation of adultery and SEXpionage rolled into one. And the remorse and maybe even confusion that Mr. Bana's character feels, you will feel too in the end. It's NOT a feel-good movie but it's GREAT. Grade A-"

","MUNICH <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's latest work-of-passion is incredibly well constructed in many respects, but there's a lingering sense of ""something's missing here"" that kept me from ever feeling affected by what was going on in front of me.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics incident, an Israeli man named Avram (played with a heartfelt honesty by Eric Bana) is hired to lead a team of 5 men in assassinating the 11 men who had helped to organize the terrorist attacks. Avram and the men embark on their mission with a patriotic optimism, but as the time passes and the death toll increases, they all must confront what violence does to both them and also to further their countries cause.<br/><br/>To make a film that analyzes both the necessity and the pointlessness of violence is an incredibly ambitious topic for Steven Spielberg to cover. Adding to the difficulty is his approach of keeping every character in a grey area. There is no black & white when it comes to who the bad guy is. This is a profound angle to take, but in the end... isn't grey usually used to represent dull? By taking this middle road Spielberg succeeds in giving the film a clear message, and he succeeds in avoiding much controversy. It is a universal film that speaks to everyone with a virtually unbiased view. But he fails in creating a truly compelling 3 hour piece of cinema.<br/><br/>It is a long running time for a film that never allows you to become too emotionally involved with the proceedings. Even though we sympathize with Avram and some members of his team, Spielberg seems to be trying to minimize these emotional attachments. Avram's story is tragic true, but so is everyone's. While Spielberg's neutral approach seems to have emphasized and strengthened the power of his statement against violence, it weakens the film's cinematic strengths.<br/><br/>Casting was top notch, with a solid ensemble led by a subtle and moving Bana. It is surprising that Bana didn't break through with any kind of critical notices or awards nominations... however, in a year of such great male performances I would certainly not call him robbed. The rest of the ensemble is solid and fully realized, however, aside from Avram there aren't any performances which offer us great insight into the feelings of these characters. This seems to be the choice of Spielberg, who obviously wanted the film to be as neutral as possible. Nevertheless performances are great.<br/><br/>I also really loved the camera-work in the hit scenes. Every assassination attempt was paced brilliantly, evoking a great level of anxiety and frustration... just as they were supposed to. I also really appreciated the fact that Spielberg waited to show us what happened in the terrorist attack that started it all. By waiting to show the whole thing, and just revealing bits and pieces to the audience throughout... he managed to keep me questioning who was right and who was wrong the whole time.<br/><br/>The answer... no one. And it's the same general opinion I have of MUNICH. Spielberg was neither right or wrong in making the film the way he did. I agree with his approach of remaining neutral, but can't help finding the film to be less gripping. And though the message is clearer due to Spielberg's position, it's impact is weakened as well.<br/><br/>I respect it and am glad I saw it, but that's it.<br/><br/>... B- ..."

Daniel Craig is also amazing. consider for one moment what this movie would have been like with george clooney and brad pitt as the leads, the latter would be trying every obvious trick in the book to steal scenes. Craig on the other hand thoroughly leaves Bana space to perform and yet still manages to grab your attention <br/><br/>the score is also tense and gripping. costume and makeup really capture the era and show Bana's gradual physical disintegration from tanned and healthy to gaunt and world weary <br/><br/>the film straddles the line very well avoiding favouritism for either side. israel of course comes of worse as a result... Banas team slowly become jaded and uncertain about who they are working for. this sets the stage very well for the real world developments that were to occur later on down the line with 911 and its aftermath. A number of questions are intelligently presented here if you allow yourself to be receptive to them. for example how many leaderless 'teams' have been available in recent years, open for manipulation? and what would they be capable?<br/><br/>Mixed with some exciting action scenes, this is a tight story and is presented with good length.

Eric Bana is brilliant as the lead character, starting off so confidently and then living in fear as the tables turn. Also, interesting how real assassins work and had to cope with lack of technology such as cellphones etc which we have today. Having to be so close to the targets to set off devices made it hit them harder emotionally whereas today, assassins can be really far away from their target and achieve ""neater"" cold-blooded results. Scenery of European cities is touchable and the reconstruction of various memoirs from the 70's is well done, such as the fashion, transport, technology etc. A must see, gripping, serious movie.

I happened to have my 12 year old son with me (Sorry Mr Sensor) and he for all his tender years is usually spot on with his critique so I was looking forward to hearing his opinion especially as he had no recollection of the events on which this film was based. So, expecting the worst and almost hoping I was proved right in we went (Straight after 'Jarhead' in fact). Before the movie even started I new something big was about to happen, the 550 seat auditorium was full, not one empty seat that I could see. To the film. For me the very fact that there were no big names in this movie showed me The Berg was serious about this movie and that the subject matter was going to be treated both seriously and with sensitivity, could you imagine Cruise as Avner? Perish the thought. Terrorism, as we all know, is now a part of our lives and has been since the 60s and medias ability to bring it to us in full living color almost as it happens but what Mr Berg did here so very well was to both condemn it but give us an understanding of its purpose and futility at the same time. We all realize that as long as there is terrorism humanity will fight back. Direction was flawless, casting nothing less than a work of art, Cinematography outstanding and lighting nothing short of genius. OK there were a few continuity errors, so what, isn't there always and yes it was graphic at times but hey. As I said the real test for me was consulting my son at our usual post movie pizza joint.

And I was amazed that Spielberg showed the guts to get his hands on quite a difficult plot while other directors unleash big monkeys on major cities.<br/><br/>However I was afraid that, despite the fact that Spielberg directed it, the movie might be a bit, too American, too Hollywoodish, too action-crammed to be informative.<br/><br/>But recalling Spielbergs work in Schindler's List and trying hard not to recall War of the Worlds, I found a way to the cinema. Well it does have one thing with unleashed monkeys in common: don't buy a big soda. The movie will last until the end of time.<br/><br/>Which is on the other hand not bad, because it passes time quite well, without being exactly entertaining. Which it of course, should not be. You cannot expect to see a work-over of a terrorist assault and walk out with a big smile on your face. It's not going to happen. So the movie does what I was hoping it would do. Display a story that makes you think, makes you wonder about terrorism, wonder about it in a serious, unarmed way. <br/><br/>Well sounds too good to be true if you are out to see a movie like Schindler's list, and I dare to also mention 8 mm here. And yes it is. Spielberg got the script of a children's play book, or mickey mouse, or I do not know what. Except for the perfect display of the location (even the street names are right), there is no truth in it.

","For the past few years (since the Kubrick-inspired A.I., to be more precise), Steven Spielberg's production has started to show a more pessimistic reflection on what is going on in the world. Still, these films had some sort of happy ending. Munich doesn't. It's Spielberg's most violent and shocking opus so far, a voyage into the bleakest parts of the human soul.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the kidnapping and assassination of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich, 1972. The entire world watches this event in horror on TV, while Israeli PM Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) makes a very controversial decision: those responsible for the massacre will not get away with it. And this is when the film really kicks off: Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) and four other Mossad agents (Mathieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, Ciaràn Hinds and Hanns Zischler) are sent to Europe to track down and coldly execute 11 men, all involved in the Munich attack. Those five agents are initially eager to serve their country, only to become exactly like the very people they're meant to kill: each murder is expertly planned and committed, without any remorse. Avner and his men won't realize the truth (violence leads only to more violence) until it's too late.<br/><br/>That's the aspect Spielberg's most interested in: under the disguise of a gripping, merciless thriller (which the film is) lies a painful reflection on how monstrous a person can be. When we first see Avner, he's an ordinary man who's about to be a father (one of the director's trademarks), as well as an enthusiastic patriot. Two hours into the movie, he's a paranoid murderer, afraid of the fact that someone, perhaps even his boss (the remarkable Geoffrey Rush), might try to hurt his family. He accepted his assignment without any questions, only to be left alone with his doubts: what if his actions won't change anything? What if the war will go on once he's done his job? Spielberg stated this film is a ""prayer for peace"", and he's right, by proving violence isn't the best means to obtain it.<br/><br/>Most people will say Munich is the most unusual Spielberg movie in that it has no happy ending. That's not really correct. The truth is it has no real ending at all. It's probably the most shocking aspect of this masterpiece: after two-and-a-half emotionally exhausting hours of pain, anger and death, there's no sign of joy or reconciliation. The 9/11 parallels, hinted at in previous pictures, emerge in an all their brutality come the desperate epilogue: some wars can't end, not even on film."

","This is a very significant film. It hammered me hard, both with its action and with its powerful message. This is a dead serious movie. It is a mistake to think of it as a documentary or history. Fiction is better suited to portray the moral morass of terrorism better than any history. The protagonist's final resolution exposes the heart of terrorist darkness: whether carried out by Palestinian fanatics or the state of Israel,the entire cycle of terrorism is dehumanizing, savage and--in the end--futile.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that the plot lagged occasionally, but this is a minor flaw. The biggest problems I have seen are the many reviewers who believe they have identified a pro-Israeli or a pro-Palestinian bias. These kind of reviewers need to get a life: Munich is a balanced pro-humanity work of art. Forget Arabs and Israelis: this movie could just as readily be portrayed through Croats and Serbs, Serbs and Kosovars, Turks and Armenians, Hutus and Tutsis--anywhere the cycle of terrorism, ethnic rage and revenge has shredded the bonds of humanity."

The ordinary men are strongly affected by the very nature of the deeds they have taken upon themselves, even if they still find those deeds fully justified. They slowly break out of their ordinarity and innocence. ...to whatever is lying beyond. In several excellently acted shots Avner, returning home and hailed as a hero, discovers the abyss that has grown between his evolved self and the eulogical pride of his peers, family and superiors. What used to make sense to him, as it still does to his countrymen, has dissolved by too many a crossing the limits. Crossing the limits when exceptions -had- to be made. Exceptions from law and from conscience. From righteousness. <br/><br/>For, in each murder the agents are not lucky enough ""to simply kill an enemy"" (today the laguage would be even more distanced - perhaps ""eliminate a terrorist""). We are intimately with them as they have to take the ultimate decision to convert the breathing, fleshed, intelligent, warm, human, talking in his fright with body most sincerely, human. Human, to this moment full of memory and hope - ...to convert him into a dead corpse. To choose the moment they will cut away a future: now or 2 seconds later? ...or never.<br/><br/>Although later they try to avoid the shock of face-to-face execution by planting bombs, the Fate (director) each time leads them and us to discover the target as a human being. The overpowering blasts are incredibly realistic, both physically and psychologically! <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, the cities of Europe are recreated in a feast of visuals! With slightly unrealistic beauty they possess some fairytale quality! Spielberg manages to create a mythical dream about 70's Europe! He made me wish to go back in time when the terrorists, secret services and even cities were more innocent, human and romantic. Nostalgic.<br/><br/>This is contrasted by the series of powerful still shots of the consequence of murder. However they are all unenforced as if slipping unintentionally in the field of view of the camera. The most symbolic ones as if unwittingly distracted the cameraman's attention from his task of filming and made him stop there for a second, on an image that in my opinion could take its place in a photography exhibition. Thus every single death makes its point to us as well as it does to the protagonists.<br/><br/>This achievement is mirrored in the dialogue! The film abounds with crystallized one-liners by people fully aware of the tragedy of their self-destruction. Also, remarkably, the writers did an effort in putting us in the context of Israeli and Palestinian emotional worlds, to spare us from abstract moralizing and judgement on their violence and readiness for self-sacrifice. Unfortunatey, this ""from-above"" attitude is commonly prevailing in the placated West of today when watching on TV the news from Middle East."

","contrary to some posts here, this film is biased, but whether that is a fault of its production or a biased opinion of its producers is hard to tell.<br/><br/>my reasons for this are simple, if you sit down and thoroughly read through the facts of the Munich siege you notice a lot of things missing from the film, and some of it is shown in a light that makes the terrorists (and sometimes the Palestinians as a whole) look like they were cold blooded animals, what is depicted in the film is for bits of the actual story, known to be not true.<br/><br/>also, the film is based on the book Vengeance which the author of the said book claims to be the team leader, but many people with first hand accounts of all that happened during and after Munich dispute his claims to this.<br/><br/>other than that the film is OK, though some bits are horrific and are not for the easily distressed, towards the end of the film though it does tend to drag and the ending was a little pointless. <br/><br/>this isn't a film i'll be in a hurry to watch again and I wont be buying it on DVD, I feel Spielberg has regained some of his credibility in this film after the abysmal War of the Worlds, but he still has a lot to go"

","Having already seen the documentary ""one day in September"" I was intrigued to see the aftermath of this act of terrorism.<br/><br/>I think it was a brave step to tell this story, it does not always paint Jews in a good light, but for me that gave it a more balanced feel. There is right and wrong on both sides and again being treated like an adult, allowed to make our own minds up about the people involved was refreshing.<br/><br/>Overall though I thought it was too long, there were many scenes that could have been shortened or even cut. All the business with Louis father, too long, in the bedroom when he rips the bed etc, too long. This ended up detracting from the whole because I was willing the film to end. That said there are some well handled moments, using archive footage worked, as did the reconstruction of events with the athletes, I did find myself wishing we had seen more of this story.<br/><br/>So worth a watch, but I would also urge you to see one day in September which is far more powerful."

","I'm not a Jew though one of my ancestors is sure to have been one (at least my grandmother told me about that). So I can't say the problem of the Palestinian conflict is very close to me. And yet Spielberg's ""Munich"" made an impression on me though the movie has many weak points, and thus doesn't deserve high estimates. The most significant feature here is that it raises problems and questions and never gives answers. It's for you to answer and choose, and I consider it as one of the most important merits of ""Munich"". 1972 was a tragic year for Israel, and they had to respond somehow. The choice was to form some fight units to kill the Palestinian terrorist leaders. Avner is head of one of such groups, and the movie describes their assassinations. There's no much action, and much time is dedicated to discussion of who's right and wrong in the situation. The film is for thinking and not for entertainment."
"Phoenix1982","8","0","0","2 February 2006"," And the Oscar goes to...?
","Let me start by saying that this year's Oscar nominated pictures are, contrary to the popular argument, by no means weaker than the films we heard about so much last year. In fact, the opposite seems true.<br/><br/>Last year's battle was truly one of the giants - between Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx and... Jamie Foxx, Hilary Swank and Kate Winslet. All relatively, most indisputably big names, and not too many surprises at the end of the day (unless one counts MDB's eventual triumph, predicted by Ebert the night before).<br/><br/>That being said, we all know that the Big Five are more about the issues they raise than the people they feature, and last year the issues tackled could not have made a greater contrast with the big names behind the production. The best picture candidates studied the life of a peculiar individual, individual struggle with death, an individual's quest for identity, the life of a peculiar individual, and an individual struggle with death. Of course, one might and probably should further try to differentiate - Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland deal with the issue of life and death in a drastically different fashion, even as Ray and Hughes were two different and distinctive characters. Yet the sight that emerges reveals more than slight a tendency for intimate storytelling, or films that are interested in one's personal struggle rather than larger-than-life issues.<br/><br/>This year the direction of research and acknowledgment go the other way.<br/><br/>Among the Big Five, only Capote appears to look inward. Brokeback Mountain, Crash, Good Night and Good Luck, Munich all study issues critical to our day and age, i.e. life in our complex world in general. BM relates a story of two American men living a lie - a tragedy readily applicable to a number of gay people in this country, Crash studies racial stereotypes, while GN&GL masterfully reapplies a past conflict in the present situation by merely retelling a modern legend and letting the viewer's mind do the math.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Munich. I must say that Spielberg has been a disappointment to me lately. The man has far too much greatness and vision to be wasting his time on the likes of Minority Report, Catch Me if You Can, or War of the Worlds. There are a number of directors who could have done those and fared at least as well. To complete the picture of an utter waste of talent which Spielberg the director has been for precisely seven years now we'll say that, in spite of their occasional glimpses of greatness, The Terminal and A.I. both fared rather poorly in achieving their goals.<br/><br/>With Munich Spielberg repeats what he had already once accomplished with Saving Private Ryan (how that movie lost the Best Picture to an amusing, but totally inferior to it Shakespeare in Love, will forever remain a mystery), and that is an unbiased look at the events that, once having touched millions of lives, continued to change them in dramatic ways beyond repair and to the point of no return.<br/><br/>A brilliant study of an historical event with its consequences and ramifications, Munich wastes no time on individual actors' efforts. That is not to say that such efforts are not readily encountered courtesy of Eric Bana who wears his character every step of Avner's downward journey, or Daniel Craig who seems to be warming up for his first 007 outing, but merely that the circumstance they and other characters find themselves in is one of such magnitude that it becomes simply impossible to dedicate too much attention to these more than mildly interesting individuals.<br/><br/>As Saving Private Ryan once was, Munich too is chalk full of scenes of sheer and utter brilliance. A dialog between Avner and a Muslim springs to mind: one of the men yet does not know that the other is his greatest enemy and speaks freely on certain matters, meanwhile the other's face is a case study of generations that have lived through a war. There is no way I will hereby spoil Avner's eventual change reflected via, in perhaps more than one way a climactic scene, but I will say this: the pain of millions of people has never been documented out in a manner as frighteningly beautiful as that single scene.<br/><br/>Two things need to be said about Munich, as this motion picture begins to gather pace in the Best Picture race. Unlike Brokeback Mountain and Crash, two incredibly beautiful, thought provoking, and masterfully executed films, Munich strikes one with its lack of partiality. It does not criticize, but neither does it support any single decision that we watch its characters make. While Brokeback Mountain and Crash suggest alternatives (and Crash goes as far as implement such, too), Munich has really nothing to say with regard to its subject matter. Rather, when all is said and done, the viewer is left stunned and wondering if they agree with Avner's choice, or even if Avner himself sees it as right. This remarkable impartiality is, however, not the greatest thing about Munich.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of this film is its status of an eyewitness of the events far surpassing the suffering of the gay people in the present day United States, or the pain of the immigrants and people of color who often find themselves subject to life-long humiliation. The pain documented out in Munich surpasses that suffered by the above groups of individuals because the movie portrays death in such an ordinary way, and human life as worth so little a price, that the viewer cannot help but wonder if the whole affair might be one giant exaggeration.<br/><br/>It is not. And that is why on the night of the 2006 Academy Awards, after all is said and done, Munich will emerge with a single award - but one it deserves the most: the Best Picture."

View on the film: The Screenplay.This must be on of the best scripts written in the last ten years.The writers make sure to acknowledge the ""real events"" in the film.But make sure it does not take over the film and turn into a ""slow history lesson"".The other thing they make sure to do is build the main characters and build very good side-plots,so it does not turn into a movie about agents killing a bunch of people on a list (ie:Kill Bill).The acting: I have to say that all of the cast work great as an ensemble.Every role from the main characters to the support.BUT-i have to highlight Eric Bana and Daniel Craig.Who steal every scene in the movie (how did they not get an Oscar nom?),and make your eyes stick to the screen. Direction:Wow!.This is some of the best work Spielberg has done.While there are some bits that feel ""simalar"" to some of Spielbergs favourite directors (Hitchcock and Coppaler being the main ones in this movie)But Spielberg makes sure this is his own movie.Another thing he does well is to not let the violence go over-the-top.He makes sure to show how a killing of someone affects the characers in the movie.At first i was unsure if Spielberg was the right person for this movie,but its great to see i was proved wrong. Final view on the film: If you want to see one of the best movies in the last six years and one of Spielbergs best make sure to see this."
"teh_mode","7","0","0","2 February 2006"," Politically it ticks all the right boxes. Dramatically it is somewhat wanting.
","Attacked in equal measures by some as being anti-Israeli and apologetic towards Palestinian terrorists and others as Pro-state terrorism, Munich is actually quite balanced in it's views, and despite all the controversy and hoopla it has already caused actually has a rather simple message: Acts of terrorism, on any surface, never serve a worthy cause, and will only encourage more acts of terror. Spielberg does his best to lecture us on this, but unfortunately gets lost between a standard thriller and a political lecture.<br/><br/>The opening of the film plays out somewhat like an unnarrated documentary, interchanging between the reconstructed hostage situation of the 1972 Olympics and old news reel footage. This actually works, but also underlines the problems with the film. Are we supposed to view this unattached or should we look at how this effects the characters, rather than the world? Most of the film appears to play out with a scene of people sitting round a table talking, then things blow up. Sit around talking, then things blow up. And so on. And yes there are very impressive set pieces, some engaging moments - the flashbacks to the 1972 hostage situation are probably the most impressive. Unfortunately the film has made some sacrifices - notably dramatic weight. Spielberg is torn between doing a glorified documentary - a la Andrew Niccol's Lord Of War - or a political thriller. And as such we never truly feel for the film, in the same way as I felt when I saw Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). What impressed me the most about that film is an incredibly convoluted story about a subject that would never lead to widespread interest actually made for a darn good thriller. <br/><br/>The film is too long. It does take it's time in some of it's scenes, and I was reminded of other films half the length with the same message. Once it gets going however you will be impressed. The assassination scenes are all done very well, and much like war movies show how anything involving violence can go wrong and end up accidentally killing or injuring innocent civilians. However, what bogs these scenes down is when it then cuts to other scenes of people talking about the benevolence of their actions. Sometimes it makes for interesting listening - Avnar (Bana) is talking to a Palestinian terrorist about why they fight - but other times it just feels contrived. Do assassins REALLY debate like this? And if they don't, why doesn't it help the film?<br/><br/>The performances are all solid. Eric Bana is particularly well cast as our protagonist. Although it did take me half the film to work out what accent Daniel Craig was actually using.<br/><br/>The subject of Munich is especially relevant in the wake of 9/11. It is no coincidence that the final words of the film ""Have you learnt anything?"" are spoken with the World Trade Centre glaring in the backdrop. Undoubtedly this is one of Spielberg's bravest films and it certainly isn't a bad one. It is an important film that everyone should see. No doubt this'll probably end up with a caboodle of awards - and whilst it does end up as an overlong - especially in it's denouement - slightly trite piece of work, you will walk away glad that you saw it. It is undoubtedly flawed, but still effecting and thought provoking."

We need you now as never before, and this film illustrates that clearly. The old way of thinking is just that - old.Outdated.

"Dierk","9","0","0","2 February 2006"," Asking questions rather than giving a simple answer
","*Munich* is a complex movie, reminding us that film makers and artists have to rather ask complex questions instead of giving simple answers. It is much more than just a plot about the Israel-Palestinian conflict.<br/><br/>The movie is as much about war and what it does to people, about the difference in old-school wars against big numbers of enemies you can hardly discern when shooting and the modern war on small bands of terrorists you have to look in the eye, the beginnings of modern terrorism and the current state of it.<br/><br/>It's main theme is the problem that just causes may lead to terrible consequences taking one to the same moral level than one's enemy. Spielberg pictures life as it is: a continuum, not a series of distinct moments. You can suddenly find yourself on the wrong side without being able to point down to the one moment you went wrong.<br/><br/>Even after having watched the whole movie the viewer is unable to tell if or when the moral predicament gets awry. And that although the script gives us two Killings (and a ""collateral damage"") which are not on the original agenda.<br/><br/>Some critics take exception to the way the Israeli athletes in Munich are depicted as cardboard characters. But then, most of what happens in the Olympic village and on Munich's airfield is only shown in retrospect by Eric Bana's character, the leader of the Israeli killing team, who hasn't been in Munich. He envisions what we see and ultimately - in the world of the movie - don't know!<br/><br/>Not much of the original attack is shown from an outside, objective perspective: We see two US athletes helping the Palestinian terrorists into the village, how they get around in the deserted floors and how they enter the athletes rooms. There's also some glimpses of the media hype surrounding - and eventually sabotaging one attempt to free the hostages - the whole affair. Everything else is only Avner's imaginations."

"steventeen4eva","9","0","0","1 February 2006"," A Masterful Theatrical Work
","The summer of 1972 was a very important season for Munich. The Olympic Games had set off and the whole world was watching closely, waiting for the next world record. And so it was a huge surprise when on September 4th of that same year, a group of Palestinian terrorists, better known as Black September, kidnapped and eventually murdered eleven Israeli athletes. To add to the catastrophe, five of the kidnappers and one German officer also lost their lives. It looked as if the battle was over. However, the Israeli government felt that revenge had to be taken and in retaliation hired a group of agents from Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence agency, to assassinate those responsible for the attack that is now identified as the Munich Massacre. <br/><br/>These are the real-life events which paved the way for one of the finest movies of the year, Munich, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, one of the most notable figures in modern-day cinematography. Munich is extraordinary in its capability to reach out to the audience and also to evoke provocative questions. Highly intricate in its organization, Munich is able to manipulate the viewer and transform any feelings of ambiguity into resentment, excitement, abhorrence and sometimes even into disgust. Disturbingly graphic, mostly visually, Munich is scarring and like the scar it leaves upon the viewer, the highly controversial questions it raises linger on, even after the movie is over (the whole 2 hr 44 min of it). <br/><br/>The movie stars Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanss Zischler as the five Mossad agents (in their respective roles as Avner, Steve, Carl, Robert and Hans). Bana especially does a terrific job at portraying a haunted agent, who's often torn between the two opposing duties of work and family. The astounding Geoffrey Rush plays the role of Ephraim, the Israeli representative who must lead the Mossad to the right path (if such were the correct adjective) and Ayelet Zorer plays Daphna, Avner's emotionally-charged wife. Doubtless, the acting is terrific as the performers do a great job at thoroughly expressing their character's traits. But it's not the acting that's the winning component of the movie. Munich is the result of its highly excellent parts and as a result no one component or two sticks out(that was precisely why it didn't grab any Globes). <br/><br/>Munich is a masterful theatrical work and is radiant in its approach at combing politics with history. As expected, it was nominated for a number of Academy Awards as it's the type of movie that will particularly interest the academy, but no wins can be guaranteed. Although the theme of the film is highly controversial(especially since Spielberg is himself an Israeli supporter), Munich will speak out to the voters as it has to the audiences. And hopefully to all future viewers it will be recognized as the phenomenal,explosive hit it is."

","I have to confess to not knowing as much as I think I ought to about the continuing problems in Israel. The events of Munich 1972 were previously unknown to me other than the basic premise that there was a terrorist attack. For someone who may not grasp why even today Palestine and Israel are at each other's throats Munich provides some of the ideals at the core of the problem. The film, as with Schindler's List, doesn't hold back from showing you the realities of events that have happened, which perhaps adds to its impact.<br/><br/>The film as a form of entertainment may not hold the attention of some but instead is more of a case study into terrorism and counter terrorism. Eric Bana provides a really good performance as the central character helping form a human connection to the story. It is also not a specific side driven piece even if it is told from one point of view it doesn't sugar-coat everything. The reality is quite shocking and Spielberg's direction as usual is excellent, it is also helped by a good script that only begins to lose its pace by the end of what is quite a long film.<br/><br/>I would recommend people seeing this in order that, as with the holocaust in Schindler's List, it becomes more than just history, even with fictional characters and events mixed into the actual events. This makes it more real and increases your understanding and perception of what could otherwise just be events happening a while ago in far off places. The atmosphere is tense and is heightened by the music of the ever reliable genius that is John Williams. Along with Bana there are also good supporting roles for Geoffrey Rush and Ciaran Hinds who added two very interesting characters.<br/><br/>Munich may have caused controversy but you have to really try to fault Spielberg as a film maker. Whether its dinosaurs, terrorists or alien invasions he somehow finds an extra level that most other directors don't reach."

The film is completely objective, though viewed through the life of one of the Israeli assassins. When I first heard of the movie, I thought ""oh great, another biased film for the public to misunderstand"", but I was completely debased.

","While being one the most eagerly awaited movies in recent times, there was also a real threat that ""Munich"" would become lost in the controversy which would surely surround it. The story deals with the Isreali response to the murder of it's Olympic athletes in Munich 1972 (i.e. to order the assassination of those considered by the Israelis to be responsible).<br/><br/>Spielberg deals with the story in a surprisingly unemotional manner, choosing to allow Bana to sculpt the tension in front of the camera rather than forcing it from behind. While it would have been easy to allow the story to descend into an emotional mess or an action flick, Spielberg walks the tightrope masterfully and delivers a fine movie which shall draw criticism from both sides of the conflict around which it revolves (and this in itself is perhaps it's finest commendation).<br/><br/>Other actors to impress are Ciarán Hinds, Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale who glide effortlessly under Spielbergs direction. The only chink in the movie comes in the form of Daniel Craig who wrestles with a South African accent throughout the movie (and ultimately looses!). Fortunately his lines are limited.<br/><br/>In short, a very good film."
"DanielS-16","10","0","0","31 January 2006"," The Best Film of 2005!
","Steven Spielberg has made a master piece. For those who have never been to Israel in the opening scenes where Israeli's are watching the terrorist attack unfold in a coffee shop not much has changed except now the TV is color. There is no single star in this film, as all the actors contribute equally, and provide us with insight, and character development that is lacking in so many of today's films. I feel that this will not get many awards, and will not be a hit at any awards ceremonies. Why?? It isn't Hollywood enough which is sad.. There are no happy endings, and no major stars to cry on screen for us. What we do get is rock solid performances, fantastic locations and set designs. A cold un biased look at what happened. Spielberg used enough documentary footage, and recreations of real events to make us feel like we are really there. There is internal conflict and yet each of the team is driven by the ideology that the people responsible must die. There is a strong emphasis on ""Home"", and ""Family"". What it is and how it shapes us. For those who have never lived in the middle east or ever experienced a terrorist attack you might miss some of the depth of this film. I was born in 1972 so I never really saw, or learned about what happened in Munich. Black September was all but history by the time I was old enough to understand. The scene between the Palestinian and Avner was short but to the point. Both in the long run want the same thing. A home of their own, yet the Palestinian is where Israel was prior to 1947. Israeli's chose to go about things in a different way, however the goals where the same. As far as botched assassinations, I think they got it right. Not every job the intelligence community does goes perfectly and in fact there is some first hand comments as to the blown cover in the raid in Beirut. Anyone who travels and has children will be overwhelmed by the despair Avner feels when hearing his daughter speak for the first time over the phone. The plot is simple, and the acting is straight forward, but you will walk away thinking hard about what you consider important. I felt the assassination of the female assassin was poignant. It underscored the unflinching realism. Her death was not pretty or heroic.. None are. I can only say go see this film and be prepared to take a hard look at right and wrong."

The killings of both the terrorists and the assassins were horrific; I could not stop squirming in my seat. However I thought this was a great touch to the movie; it was brave enough to show the terror of what happened. It did not protect the audience by shielding the images. It showed everything.Sometimes people need to be shown horror in order for them to understand how terrible the events were.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of Black Hawk Down but Munich does not let you go home routing for the protagonist. It allows you to see why Palestinians and Israelies are raged at each other and what each wants. I could not say the Palestinians were monsters or that the Israelies were animals. I empathized with both and felt sympathy for the innocent.<br/><br/>This movie shows how hopeless it is to find peace if we act upon vengeance and destruction. The spite was there a thousand years ago, it was there in 1972 and it is still here today in 2006. Will it continue till 2050...it probably will."

Though the film is very well realized both visually and in terms of narrative, some of the characters seem to have more significance than they actually do within the plot. For example, the old woman who seems to be the leader of the Israilies is a very undeveloped and difficult to understand character. The film can be compared to several of my personal favorites, including ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (George Clooney), ""Catch me if you can"" (Stephen Spielberg) and ""Schindler's List"" (Stephen Spielberg). Its is an amalgamation of the above, featuring the usual ""Spielberg"" combination of seriousness and humor.

So at first, knowing Spielberg 's a Jew, i was a little afraid the movie might be pro- Israel, not really showing both sides of the conflict. U know, mean Arabs, poor nice Jews, that kind of thing. But happily, i realized -but once again i want to repeat i'm not especially involved in the conflict and i surely don't know much about it, except from what i read in the newspapers which i don't think is reliable- that Spielberg, didn't only show Jews as victims and Arabs as terrorists. To me, the meaning of the movie, is that in both sides there are terrorists and victims at the same time. When i see the reaction of people in this very website, i simply cannot understand how religion which is supposed to be all about love and respect can still lead to so much hate, and i mean, it's just a movie. Another message of the movie i agree with, through all the many wars mankind has lived, why haven't we learned the lesson yet : killing human beens shall never be a solution to any problem at all. I know i'm not saying anything new or really clever. I'm just a young woman, living in a world i mainly know by what some books or papers say about, i don't live in the place where the fight is going on, but from my point of view, which is certainly very naive and simple, it seems no god who requires children, men or women to be killed in his name deserves anyone to believe in him anyway."

","Munich is about the actions taken after the murder of 11 Israeli athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics. After watching it I have to say that it has earned itself a place in my favorite spy movies. The plot moves along fast enough to keep you interested and at the same time they still make progress with how much time they spend on a certain aspect. two thumbs way up for the filming done, not just because of the good portrayal of the true brutality of the nature of murder, but also when elements of the storyline are mixed together. Another element that adds to the movie is the fact that it is based on actual events further adding to the surrealism."
"cinematic_aficionado","10","0","0","29 January 2006"," It surely is a film that will make you think and question. But in what direction will your thoughts head for?
","For various reasons I wanted to watch Munich. The events of those Olympics themselves were of some interest to me and did not find the time to do some further reading. Also being a film about the Israeli revenge in response to the Munich massacre which was directed buy no other than Spielberg himself made me even more intrigued. This combined with the fact that the government of Israel responded negatively to this film made it a must see for me.<br/><br/>Munich is without a doubt a very powerful film. It has the power to display strong emotions that derive from one's allegiance to own country history and religion. Though rather long it is not tiresome in any way because it carries you through along, scene by scene event by event you question what you see and evaluate the decades long issue of the Jewish-Arab dispute which was now using Europe as a battlefield.<br/><br/>Naturally you will find yourself asking why. Why all this bloodshed? Why did the Arabs act the way they did? Why did the Jews respond in such a manner? Who is right and who is evil? Though questions will be raised no answers will be provided. The film itself does not aim to answer this; it is merely there to provoke some thinking.<br/><br/>My biggest question nevertheless is that since the events described in the film and the vengeance operation in particular is not how it happened in reality why would Spielberg direct a film which risks portraying Jews as cold blooded killers as the assassins of the Olympic carnage. The nearest think I have to an answer is that Spielberg has come of age. He remains devoted as ever to his religion and Jewish background; however he perhaps saw that Jewish people had some blame in all this and possible he wanted to show that above all he is American."
"Cloud67","10","0","0","29 January 2006"," MUNICH is a mirror. You see the year 1972 with the eyes of 2006!
","1972. The year I was born. The Munich Incident is one of my earliest memories. As long as I remember, I know this story, told to me by my mother. She just came to Germany in the early 70's and could't barely speak nor understand German. She saw it on the news and perceived everything visually.<br/><br/>The Olymic games are very important for the Greeks. The Terrorist Attack at the Games was an attack on everything a Greekk stands for  freedom, democracy and the Olympic spirit. Again, after an eon long period of fights between Greeks and any kind of Islamic Race, the Muslim fundamentalists trembled on everything that was important to our culture. This time, once more, including innocent athletes.<br/><br/>The pictures of Munich are, since then, burned in my mind. Every time I think of the ""evil"" in our world  I automatically think of Munich 72. And now, my favorite Filmmaker of all time, Steven Spielberg, takes that incident and continues that story.<br/><br/>Around the world, critics are bashing the film from every angle. Some say the film is too pro Palestinian, others it's too pro Israel. Some thing the Terrorist are to human (?!?!) because Spielberg gives them human faces. Yes, Spielberg maybe showing their fears and their cluelessness but it doesn't change the fact (in the film too) that they remain MURDERERS. They kill innocent athletes at a peace event. If they do had a reason for this or not  they are cold blooded killers. And this fact doesn't get changed throughout the progress of the story, as some wise-cracking-history-know-it-all-critics think as their interpretation. There are parallel isms: how do you feel as an assassin? The main characters are asking themselves if they are doing the right thing, if they are breaking the law and if they lost the pure meaning of being Jew - How Israel had, throughout the last 30 years, to change responding to such inhuman acts.<br/><br/>There is a shot of Avner (Eric Bana) on the balcony of the Olympic Hotel in Cyprus. His team is preparing the elimination of one of the man behind the Munich Attacks. The shot of him standing on the balcony is very reminiscent of the infamous shot of the masked Terrorist on the balcony in Munih at the Olympic Village.<br/><br/>Coincident? My Misinterpretation? I don't think that anything in this particular movie is coincident. Here's another Interpretation of Misinterpretation of mine: When the Terrorists, at the Olympic Village, try to climb over the wall to get to the Israeli Athletes: they get help from other athletes who think of them as colleagues. They help them to climb over the wall to get to their ""target"". The ""helpers"" are US-Americans.<br/><br/>Coincident? My Misinterpretation? Maybe. Everyone walks into this movie with his own assumptions. And this has to be that way, because Spielberg just puts a mirror in front of us. He tells the story and we set the turning points, exactly as we think  as we believe.<br/><br/>MUNICH is a dirty, honest, 70's picture. Janusz Kaminski's work is one of his best. There are many techniques of that era used, but they are never a fun gimmick. They just tell the story. Spielberg finally gives us his 70's Film, he didn't gave us in the 70's. In 30 to 40 years from now, audiences will think (as long as they don't know that the movie was shot in 2005) the movie is from the time when Coppola made his CONVERSATION and SCORSESE his MEAN STREETS. You can't even say that MUNICH is the most European film Spielberg made, because, since the beginning of 2000, Spielberg shoots just Spielberg movies. The are the best of both worlds. His ""Man-on-the-run"" Trilogy (A.I., MINORITY REPORT and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) is packed with Truffaut Moments: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is very often THE 400 BLOWS and MINORITY REPORT is a kind of FAHRENHEIT 451. Truffaut himself had a part in Spielbergs CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and actors from Truffaut Films (Nathalie Baye THE GREEN ROOM is in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and now Michael Lonsdale, THE BRIDE WORE BLACK and BAISERS VOLES in MUNICH) are now in some of his movies. So you have to search for the new millennial Spielberg in the European New Wave Films. Not only because he made the 70's Europa feel so real in MUNICH. The Film was shot, in most parts, on Malta, but Cyprus, Athens, Amsterdam, London and Paris look like the cities they used to look in the 70's. Even a little Hitchcock is in form of TOPAZ in MUNICH.<br/><br/>The excellent cast of MUNICH is another big plus. Eric Bana shows once more how multi-layered he is and Daniel Craig proves to be a very dangerous and ruthless choice of the 007 producers. Every supporting actor is perfectly cast, especially Geoffrey Rush, who (imho) acts his part like Peter Sellers would, had he be cast in the role. (Man, his Peter Sellers performance was very good!!!) The Music of John Williams is very reminiscent of his music of the 70's. The music is used very sparsely. Some scenes are so masterfully ""composed"" that you don't realize that there isn't any music, at all. The main theme is haunting and the theme of the Munich incident shattering.<br/><br/>MUNICH is one of the most important movies of the last ten years. There will be many debates about it's accuracy and it's meaning. And everyone will use his own assumptions.<br/><br/>The last image of MUNICH really brings everything to a point: It doesn't seem to be, by far, the end of the problem. And here we realize that Spielberg uses his (our) knowledge of our present to tell a story from a long, past, current time.<br/><br/>www.greekgeek.de"

One wonders about the accuracy and what has been included or excluded so as to not offend people. erg the role played by the German authorities in the documentary ""one day in September"" . but i guess its not essential to the narrative. I loved some of the killing scenes esp first killing - milk/blood /homeage / Manchurian candidate. also the dutch female assassin, awesome kill - was so surreal....kill appeared so simple it was terrifying. nice texture to the film, seems like they had some stock left over from ""SPRyan"" . The in your face, I'm not really trying to say anything twin towers at the - well i just kept thinking ""how amazing - it looks so real,how do they do that - good special effects"". There's politics in here but i don't think you can make everyone happy.and its not one sided like 9/11. I feel it was presented in a fairly neutral way. except end. Eric was excellent and Lonsdale aka french godfather was superb as usual. don't usually like Eric - hated troy. Huck!!! if i were hired to advise Spielberg i would have made the following changes. 1 had one of the crew / mos sad agents be a female. 2 make Daniel Craig's character more sophisticated - 3shown agents being more intelligent - erg like fox in day of jackal 4develop the CIA role in London, that was interesting 5 have the film end with one of those nowhere to hide lines like that from ""three days of condor"" 6 got Catherine zeta Jones in there as a welsh counter agent. because shes cute. 7 shown elements of racism on both sides <br/><br/>yes and made Eric go after Carlos the jackal."

","I don't remember another movie entering into my dream life. Munich did. Seamlessly constructed, one follows image upon image as in a dream and its substance seeps into your soul. The plot is carried so you do not have to use your mind to sort out the sequences. You can lay back to receive the story...the Dream. You are given enough time to digest the powerful images but none are cheapened -- sustained beyond dream time -- as artifice -- either to manipulate emotion or ideology. Each character rings true. You meet the assassins from your heart. The ruse of the word ""terrorist"" is made manifest. What empowers certain people to legitimize their violence and eschew the label, ""terrorist""? You understand that it IS a tough world out there, baby. That is starkly made manifest. This is not a film to be entertained by but to be enlightened by; enlightened, not in the sense of weight, for it is heavy...but in the sense of widening insight into the nature of Reality; to see its truth to help you walk your walk with a clearer vision. I honor Spielberg and Kushner Bana for their gift, their artistry. Thank you."

"russem31","7","0","0","28 January 2006"," Not bad
","Munich, the newest film by director Steven Spielberg is an okay film, not one of his best by any means but not one of his worst either. My real complaint was that it was VERY long (at 164 minutes - and it FEELS like 164+ minutes). Because of it's enormous length, the pacing for me was really really slow and made me look at my watch a number of times during the screening. And though Eric Bana and the supporting cast did a wonderful job in their roles, they are given an okay script (with a few touching moments I do admit) to work with - but also I felt very detached from the characters (I can't really explain why but whereas in other Spielberg's films I was able to feel the emotional pull of a certain character, this wasn't one of those films). Well, regardless, it is a Spielberg film and you should watch it if only for that reason - a 7 out of 10."

","Taking my seat in the cinema I was lucky. All I knew was that I was about to watch a film made by Steven Spielberg called Munich. Despite enough words written on the film to line a marathon course I had survived without reading any of them. Free from the burden of zealous opinion or prejudice surrounding the film itself I entered only with my own, that the film I was about to witness was created by the master of slushing sentimental slop.<br/><br/>After the first three minutes I revisited this prejudice. Yes this was the director who made ""Hook"", but this was also the director who made ""Duel"". Munich was shaping up to be in that class, taught, sharp and no blinks allowed.<br/><br/>This film is the work of a master flexing his muscles. Political and historical accuracy aside and is killing entertainment issues aside Munich is however-long-it-was minutes of invigorating cinematic splendour.<br/><br/>Spielberg masterfully creates a sense of Europe in the seventies and snaps in waves of tension. From the drop dead gorgeous Citroen to the evocative scenes of Rome and beyond this was powerful in your face escapism.<br/><br/>The camera work stylishly framed the story, which clipped along nicely. Casting was perfect, but I think the scene stealer was the French farmhouse of the informer family. This is my kind of getaway! Maybe I'm being overly sloshly and sentimental about Munich, but after all it was a Spielberg film! Only in this production the slosh and slop is kept to an absolute minimum, restraint being played expertly. Whether by accident or by design it worked.<br/><br/>If you are overly sensitive to the fibre thin politics of Israel and Palestine or about calculated revenge and cold blooded killing avoid this film, despite it's excellence. If you can stomach that, go and see this film in the cinema, don't wait for DVD. This is a cinematic treat."
"LimeyGeezer","8","0","0","28 January 2006"," Why Spielberg is still the best
","I haven't been too impressed with Spielbergs recent output after being left distinctly underwhelmed by WotW and Catch Me If You Can but this film is absolutely incredible. It takes a truly great director with the deftest of touches to be able to create a film that manages to get across the horror and pain of violent acts and the impact they have on those who commit them as well as the victims, while at the same time refusing to take sides or to be sympathetic to either point of view. The violent scenes are explicit without being gratuitous, shockingly real and, quite rightly, repulsive. Spielberg has said that if he does this film right, both sides will hate it and it's true - this film seems to act as a mirror in which anyone who has an opinion going in will be forced to face that opinion and their own conscience. Eric Bana is superb as the increasingly tortured soul tasked with serving his country, at first willingly - his doubt and paranoia growing over the course of the film. Compare this to the one-sided Black Hawk Down and it is clear why Spielberg is THE greatest director of our time. I am writing this days after seeing the film and it still with me, playing on my mind. A great example of how powerful cinema can be when done properly"
"mustafa_er","8","0","0","28 January 2006"," Were the Israilis who caused real terror ?
","After the ""War Of The Worlds"" disappointment - my opinion- we meet ""Munich"" made again by one of the Hollywood's genius directors. This time we encounter an austere and a thought-provoking theme; the unending conflict and struggle between Israelis and Palastanians. This film really fastens you to the plot and events and it makes you think hard who's side to support or blame. What's the message behind ""Munich"" ? Were the Israilis who caused real terror ? ""Forget the peace now, we must show them that we are strong and so on. (If so the Jew community might get angry.)Or the same old story where the blame is put on blood-thirsty Palastinians ? The time when Avner (Eric Bana) goes through the depressing cycle SS points out that Avner is questioning his assignment. Or does SS puts forth that the Isrealis are also human beings with emotions and sentiments like the everybody else and that they must/had to react when they are terrorized and attacked ? Or SS wants us to go home after seeing his latest masterwork and go over the events once more in our thoughts. This film certainly needs another viewing to perceive the message here. And because of the contemporary theme, it certainly is -imo- the kind of flick you'll watch it over and over. ""Oh, we are tragic men. Butcher's hands, gentle souls"" is one of the devastating statements needs to be read between the lines. <br/><br/>I wasn't even born when this unfortunate event occurred in the Olympics in 1972. I liked the film very much. Surely a must-get-the-DVD flick. Great acting, flawless similitude and depiction of 70's. This film's absolutely a striker ! I'm glad Empire gave ""Munich"" 5 stars. It deserves all the stars it got."
"psi_fla","8","0","0","27 January 2006"," Spielberg wrestles with moral ambiguity
","The Olympic village, Munich, 1972. Eleven Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by a group of Palestinian terrorists known as the Black September group. The Mossad strikes back by launching a team of Israelis led by Avner (Eric Bana) to hunt down and kill those responsible...<br/><br/>Before anyone starts asking if Steven Spielberg's Munich really is better than his ""crowning achievement"", Schindler's List, I think I'd better get to the far more important question - is the film a valuable artistic experience? To that, my answer is an emphatic ""Yes"".<br/><br/>From the moment you are transported back to Munich, you are ""in the moment"". That, to me, has always been the key to Spielberg's success. When his methods succeed, you are genuinely immersed in the experience. He can even handle sentimentality better than any other director. Unfortunately, when it goes wrong for him, it really turns nauseating; consider, if you like, the endings of A.I. and War Of The Worlds as examples.<br/><br/>Consistency isn't one of Steve's greatest strengths either. How many times have you seen him try to force an over-emotional moment into a dark film, even if it does work? (Key example: Schindler's List.) However, there are times when he manages to reign in the emotion successfully, resulting in more consistent works like the underrated Empire Of The Sun and Catch Me If You Can. Munich is worthy of inclusion on that list of works.<br/><br/>Yes, there is sentiment and ""shocking moments"" (which he is especially good at) but he carefully sprinkles them throughout, never letting them get in the way of the story. Rather, they assist the story brilliantly. In fact, remove them and the all-too-recognisable (if admittedly superb) camera-work of Janusz Kaminski and you'd find it hard to tell that Munich was a Spielberg film. It is a remarkably controlled, brilliantly staged and very well acted work. Of course, it helps that he has (once again) chosen a talented multi-national cast  Eric Bana, Mathieu Kassovitz, Ciaran Hinds and future 007 Daniel Craig all stand out. Bana especially; there is nothing remotely exaggerated or forced about his performance.<br/><br/>Perhaps most striking of all is Munich's moral ambiguity. Spielberg has been constantly under attack over the years for his ""black and white"" view of the world. (The way he treats the Nazis in his films, with the possible exception of Amon Goeth, is concrete evidence of this.) Avner doubts the rationality of the revenge mission early on and the rest of his team soon follow suit  unfortunately, some of them don't find out what is really going on until it's too late. The tables are eventually turned on Avner and the group. Once hunters, they become the hunted. They realise what it is like to be the ""enemy"" and wonder why they weren't more opposed to the movement he joined in the first place. A Spielberg detractor once said that the director could never make a film that showed that ""potentially, we are (the bad guys)""...well, he may not quite have made it, but with Munich, he's come as close as you ever can expect him to. The scenes that show the dying ""targets"" are deeply affecting.<br/><br/>The only serious problem with the film is the length. For all of its strengths, it just isn't taut enough for me to regard it as a masterpiece. That, my friends, is what prevents it from reaching the heights of Schindler's List. But that is irrelevant. Since when was Munich about topping the earlier film anyway? With Munich, Steven Spielberg has given us a thought-provoking history lesson that may, eventually, have more valuable historical impact than any of his previous serious films."
"evening_nightshade","9","0","0","27 January 2006"," A film even Socrates would be proud of.
","Were Socrates alive today, this is the type of movie he would love. ""Munich"", like the great philosopher himself, challenges traditional notions of black and white, good and evil. It is therefore unsurprising that Spielberg, like Socrates was centuries ago, has been much criticised for his approach on this matter. It would have been painfully easy for the director to take a 'Die Hard' approach to dealing with terrorism.<br/><br/>Instead, however, the subject is played not for its entertainment value. Rather, ""Munich"" forces us to question the morals of revenge killings. We witness as the death of every terrorist at the hands of Avner and his team is matched with further retaliation. With morbid fascination, we witness the disintegration of Avner (superbly portrayed by Eric Bana), particularly in the latter part of the movie, until he becomes like the man in Carl's anecdote, sleeping in his closet. His fall is distinctly Shakespearen, as he sees himself as little better than the men he has been hunting. Even the initially blood-thirsty Steve (Daniel Craig) is changed by the experience.<br/><br/>The camaraderie between Avner's team is subtly portrayed; their conversations do not feel forced, and the actors have a powerful chemistry. Likewise in the scenes with Avner and his wife, the cheesy dialogue is well and truly by-passed, bringing a greater realism to the film. These are not caricatures; these are men who engage with the audience, and give the film its greatest strength.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why Spielberg has been so heavily criticised by both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, the context is irrelevant: what ""Munich"" attempts to show is that there are villains and victims on both sides in war. As the hunters become prey themselves, we see the film's message: an eye for an eye, and the world goes blind. It is unfortunate that this belief will likely be buried under the political debate surrounding Israel and Palestine.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Munich"" is a power and thought-provoking film, which, like Socrates, is quick to dismantle the preconceptions of its audience. 9/10."
"tennismenace","9","5","16","29 December 2005"," Disappointing due to mixed message
","Spielberg, I'm afraid, is more concerned about pleasing Hollywood than he is in pleasing Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Everyone knows there are no winners in a war against terrorism and that terrorism begets terrorism. This is elementary, so the movie has to be more than just that.<br/><br/>Everyone also knows innocent people get hurt in terrorism, so again, this message is juvenile because we all know that too.<br/><br/>So what is this movie primarily saying? You have to first see this through the eyes of the protagonist - Avner (Eric Bana).<br/><br/>First, Avner went through a 180 moral metamorphosis here. In the beginning, he was all for these assassinations. By the end of the movie, he no longer wanted any part in it and even defected from Israel. He didn't like it when he realized he and his family could be targets like the people he hunted down. I think the movie wanted you to identify (and side with?) Avner's reasoning/conflict.<br/><br/>Second, I believe the movie wants you to be disgusted with vengeance and the scene with the Twin Towers at the end was put there to heighten these feelings even more (to make it personal to Americans). Ultimately, terrorism can and did end up at our (USA) doorstep. Was the Twin Towers a result of Munich? Maybe indirectly it was. Is America supposed to wink at terrorism and do nothing because vengeance is wrong and ultimately doesn't serve a useful purpose except begetting more violence? I think everyone knows terrorism is in America because America supports Israel.<br/><br/>So what? What should Israel had done in the face of Munich? Nothing? What are we Americans to do about terrorism today? Not support Israel anymore? The problem in the Middle East is much deeper than Munich. Because I believe Golda Meir and Israel's act of vengeance were projected in a negative light, I believe this movie ultimately will sway people against Israel and thus our support of Israel.<br/><br/>For that reason alone, I find this moving wanting. The Middle East Conflict is much bigger than any retaliation of one event (Munich). If Spielberg wanted to make a statement against retaliation, he should have picked a better forum than Munich."

","I really struggled to reach the end of this film. It seemed to go on forever, without any real narrative verve or purpose.<br/><br/>None of the main characters were properly developed and consequently I could not have cared less about any of them. There was no serious exploration of the morality or immorality of what they were doing or why. Just a bit of callously expressed indifference from the South African guy played by Daniel Craig, and a lot of pained expressions from the Eric Bana character.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it was obscure and incoherent. Often I wasn't even sure what country the action was occurring in, as the assassination crew moved from one anonymous victim about whom we knew nothing, to another. Every now and then a character would announce how many hundreds of thousands of dollars a particular hit had cost, but what reaction the film-makers wanted the audience to have to these figures I have no idea. Certainly the assassins never seemed to be struggling for cash.<br/><br/>There were a few impressive set pieces and the seventies period detail was nicely done. Yet when the film finally ended I was more relieved than anything else. It simply had no resonance for me whatsoever."

In the beginning you really have much potential, but three hours later you are left wondering what on earth the Academy saw in this movie. For a much more thought provoking and cerebral film, try Syriana. For it's faults Munich features a decent performance by Eric Bana, despite the somewhat contrived nature of his dialogue. Overall though I found myself laughing aloud at the ridiculousness of some of the scenes. Namely toward the end of the film, a sequence with Eric Bana enjoying the company of his wife interspersed with flashbacks to the events of the 1972 Olympics was utterly unbelievable, and to me, rather amusing. This movie has failed potential, and isn't worth the three hour investment of your time."
"MovieAddict2016","9","3","8","2 January 2007"," One of Spielberg's best - an important and thought-provoking film
","""Munich"" is not an easy film to watch - it is realistically (and sometimes gratuitously) violent, it is disturbing, it can be rather hard to follow at times, and it is quite long (at nearly three hours) - but it is a rewarding film that provokes thought...something which, unfortunately, many Hollywood films fail to accomplish these days.<br/><br/>It is very loosely based on the aftermath of Black September and the 1972 Munich Massacre in Germany, during which eleven Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists who had tried to use the hostages as leverage in a political battle.<br/><br/>Following the attack, the Israeli government assembled a crew of Jewish men to travel across West Europe and assassinate the figures involved in the planning of the events in Munich. The team of five is led by the character portrayed by Eric Bana, and he begins to wrestle with his own tormented conscious as he questions whether his actions are just or if he is merely being used as a pawn to carry out secret government killings.<br/><br/>The cast is top-notch, and it's one of Spielberg's most well-directed films in ages. It's refreshing to see this after a string of generic no-brainers such as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Terminal."" This echoes ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" as some of the riskiest material Spielberg has worked with, but he manages to pull it off without taking sides (as many have tried to twist it into some type of Israel-.vs.-Pakistan debate). He also manages to take the material - of which there isn't much available documented facts - and make it compelling and engaging without necessarily going out of his way to distort facts. In his DVD introduction, Spielberg explains that creative liberties had to be taken simply due to the fact that no one has ""come out"" yet and really released any definitive information on what, exactly, happened after the Munich massacre. The only thing that's known is that a group was assembled, and nine of eleven targets were assassinated across Europe in the months that followed.<br/><br/>The film provokes discussion and, although some better editing could have brought its runtime down a good twenty minutes or so, Spielberg proves once again that when he's at the top of his game he really is a great director - one can only hope that he begins to work like Scorsese and choose his projects more carefully."

However while watching this movie within 35 minutes i fell asleep. I then woke up and turned it off because not only did it put me to sleep it also was ruining my slumber. The film starts off fast then goes to a dulling slow pace. The acting of the terrorists at the beginning was far from ""terrorific"" it was very unbelievable. I looked forward to watching this movie for a while when i should of looked past it all together. The main character is not the type of person you can really tolerate watching for the duration of the film, and is also not very believable. Do yourself a big favor and read about the tragedy instead of watching the tragedy that is this film."

","This epic is a real turkey if I've ever seen one. CONTAINS SPOILERS! Apparently there is a misunderstanding that this film is bias, but it is certainly not. It more or less makes everybody look like morons. In the light of the Olympic Games topic the comparison that comes to mind is the picture spread all over internet depicting a sprinter with downs syndrome ripping the finishing ribbon pared with the text ""Running in the special Olympics, even if you win you're still retarded."" This pretty much sums this dilemma up. ""Munchen"" begins with the aspect of introducing us to a team of senior citizens supposed to be Olympic athletes. From there it goes downhill like a never ending landslide. (Appropriate title would be ""Never Ending Story 2"")<br/><br/>Analyzing the main characters is to painful: A beautiful leader (probably voted Americas sexiest man post-Troy) and obsessive kitchen chef/ future family father, a likable old geezer smoking pipe, a stupid blond girl that not even got her sex right (a male broiler but you catch the drift), an even older and lamer baldy, and of course a cute toy maker to emphasize the hardness of this compound.<br/><br/>As the masterminds they are, plan the perfect hits and act them out in Stanley & Laurel style. 1/ Planting a fat bomb in a mattress which the selected member of the team observes with his empty head pressed against the wall to this very volatile room. Brilliant secret signal is ""turning off the light"" thus retarded partners will response by triggering the bomb... What a surprise... the bomb has some unexpected explosive reaction when it explodes! The retard in the room next door almost buys the farm. *gosh* And the signal, a thought, What about power failure, lamp accident or something? Even if their outpost had one chromosome to many provided I am certain he would still have blinked the lamp to avoid any misinterpretations, and definitely not stand drooling three yards away from the explosion center.<br/><br/>Team is further hilarious, like when a bomb misfires one of these supposedly best trained secret service agents in the world goes bald geezer cowboy attacking the hotel and major team of terrorists with a hand grenade. The thought to drive away calmly and regroup professionally for a new attempt never crosses his fatigue mind.<br/><br/>My personal favorite must be when the get their hands on a sniper rifle. In order to use the sniper rifle they literally enter the very lawn of their victim reaching a distance possible to show the barrel up Mr. Salamis bunghole. Pressing faces against the window providing a really clever use for sniper rifle, fumbling in ordinary manor a 14 year (?) old guard literally walks up their behinds and surprises sniper and blond outlook. Then everybody goes Stanley & Laurel-style amok.<br/><br/>Some hilarious moments really lifts the movie to unsurpassed heights. Like these ""professionals"" could not even find their own bungholes without an expensive map obtained from the almighty Frenchman.<br/><br/>The same arranges a safe house in which suddenly the colleagues from the other side show up. I think they lie mumbling they are Black African freedom Fighters or something amusing. Following discussion with bad guy who has no clue whatsoever that something is wrong when Banadinovich promotes Jews positive. So much for this meeting between ravaging minds.<br/><br/>Spielberg sets a prime example in bad taste when he chooses to tie together the human aspects of this international tragedy through Erik Bana's pecker. Becoming increasingly incoherent as Bana pork's away on his chick getting flashbacks from moments he personally never experienced. (Clearly a flashback, not inspired editing) Did they not have time to shoot experienced flashbacks? (Inserting a Donald Duck episode that he actually had seen would have be more logic.)<br/><br/>I have no problem reading the subtext in Munchen, however I found it very boring. The only way to get excited is if you have a direct involvement. (Like being the two surviving terrorists) It would be plausible to guess that the average attention reaction is narcoleptic. Further, political forces probably sit at home laughing their asses off when Spielberg set the world opinion to sleep. The length lies directly in proportion to the boredom factor. I can not see the motivation for the lengthy experience other than guessing that very long movies does better at the Oscars or something? Of course when the story is in cardiac stagnation you could enjoy the competent scenery and attributes. Munchen is simply not what you reasonable could expect from the poster names.<br/><br/>While I mention the actors I had very high hopes on a certain pipe smoking favorite actor and further the promising actor that tries to smack Brad Pitt on the head when he walks around in Troy like a beach surfer imitating jump strikes from the ""Fist of fury"" arcade game without variation. The latter (Eric Banadinovich) characters development to dark paranoia is perfectly plausible, so why don't I buy it? In my eyes it feels plastic, fake and fatigue, I am certain that this will get more than one Oscar. Acting is not satisfactory, compare Jake Gyllenhaal & Heath Ledger's cow-gay performance comes across natural, Banadinovich run around in an emotional storm not even capable of capping an insect. Not unjust criticism, sadly pure facts.<br/><br/>Nice moments: First terrorist mastermind, old man shopping milk returning to his nice old style Italian apartment. The old man shows real feelings and the awkwardness of the killers setting emotions in work. Unfortunately counter reactions hits us like ricochets. First question the professionalism of our protagonists, The second is the following repetition of each and every following hit. In fact it makes the plot circumstance for the second strongest scene: Second encounter with the female hit-girl.<br/><br/>Anyway this post will probably be censured like everything else that is not positively reviewed in IMDb."

","This movie is a lot like biting into a half baked loaf of bread. The crust is tasty but once you get past that you've got an under baked loaf... or movie in this case. Problems abound in this sprawling and ultimately lackluster narrative. Once you get over the fact that they are assassins with really cool bomb the first half of the movie just falls flat on it's face. the second halves paranoid attack tries to gracefully recover from past missteps but does not seem to ever do so. All we get is a really wet Eric Bana making love to the the memory of the Munich massacre. I would replace love with a more offensive word and say that is exactly what Steven Spielberg did too. <br/><br/>If there was any theme to this movie at all it would have to be ambiguity. Yes, yes I know what you are thinking, is that possible? Amidst some hackneyed musing about home and country, film loses any sense of what it's really about. Unless that is the point. but I really don't think it is Steven.<br/><br/>Okay if you have a multi-million dollar budget, you expect that the filmmaker would take some care to make sure everything was in order. At time I had to stop and ask myself whether this was really a period piece or not because some much the movie feels anachronistic. Of course it is hard to replicate a time period but for heaven's sakes your Steven Spielberg if anyone was able to it would be you. Though it's only a minor problem it serves to highlight a larger one.<br/><br/>This movie was rushed. In my opinion what we have here is the equivalent of Picasso scribbling on a napkin. Sure it looks good and feels somewhat promising but that's only because it's a genius at work. One working with the tricks and spells his perfected for captivating audiences but putting nothing new on the table. Spielberg seems to have rattled this one off quite quickly especially given that he just released another movie this summer. in many ways I'm more disappointed for the movie this could have been if a great deal more care had been taken. <br/><br/>Eric Bana doesn't seem to be able to hold an entire movie to himself either especially one this long. See evidence of this in the Hulk and so forth. He may be able to work quite well given that the character material is rich I.E. Chopper but in this movie all we have is a cute accent. <br/><br/>All in all Narrative trouble, rushed direction and solid but not phenomenal acting don't leave us much to turn to. I'm still a fan but I hope the next thing that Steven Spielberg pulls out of the oven is a totally baked loaf of bread."

The implied notion that the United States interfered with Isreal's pursuit of these people was misguided and lame. At the end of Shindlers's List we saw how many people were saved,when this film ends the focus is on how many people died. I think the only lesson to be learned from this film is that sometimes things beyond our control happen and we can't waste our time fighting things that will never change.

","This is the usual battle of Spielberg the master craftsman versus Spielberg the middlebrow thinker. Much like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the movie this in fact most resembles, it's a back and forth kind of battle. In the end MUNICH much like RYAN works better in small bits: as a whole it's failure.<br/><br/>The movie's too long, irritatingly so. A good half hour could've been trimmed from this easily.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I think of Bana, I've liked him in other things I've seen of him, but he's pretty mediocre here. None of the characters we see are especially deep, but the other performers (particularly Rush and Craig) do their best with what they've got. No such luck with Bana, who's a stolid performer in the best of times.<br/><br/>This is a movie that thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is. The main theme is probably something like ""this is all pointless"", which by definition makes the revenge plot by-the-way. Which is the point, I'm sure, but it doesn't make for interesting cinema. Another way to say it is that large parts of this movie are just boring, despite all the explosions.<br/><br/>Okay, so the themes of the movie are presumably more important. Even if we probe deeper, though, the ""argument"" is overly simplistic. Once we get past the massacre itself, every Palestinian is seen as sympathetic and reasonable, while most Jews are crazy, or crooked, or naive, or creepy. The deck is ridiculously stacked, and that's not subtlety, that's comic book stuff. At the end of the movie, Spielberg and (more likely) Kushner hint at a lot of things they don't want to say outright: there are specific correspondences drawn between the terrorists and the Israelis, for instance. The validity of that point to one side, the reluctance of these two to give it a proper airing can only be considered an aesthetic failure.<br/><br/>In a year of overrated movies, this is one of the biggest."

","Steven Spielberg's brings to the screen not only a difficult episode but also a reminder to all, that terrorists will kill anyone anywhere in order to obtain a platform from where they can justify their acts of insanity. The murders of innocent Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games could have been avoided if the German authorities honored the request of the Israeli Government to rescue their own citizens. The hosting German Government did not even have a S.W.A.T team or even so much as a team of police sharp shooters as part of their police force. How could the German hosts think that they would be able to handle such an act of madness brought on by Black September? Golda Meir put it simply when it came to the security of Israel and its citizens, she stated ""I prefer the world's criticism rather than their condolences"" Enter the Mossad and it's ability to deal with terrorism anywhere in the world. Spielberg's direction of the film is fast paced and thought provoking. Those know and unknown actors bring you to the edge of your seat. I can only comment that the Mossad's handling of those that were sought for there involvement in the Munich massacre were dealt with less confusion than depicted in the movie. Mossad's in a sense was depicted as having handled the hostile targets as a group of Keystone Cops, how far from the truth. Why the Mossad was presented in such a manner is baffling. (Menachem)"
"francesco1221@hotmail.com","4","3","8","27 December 2005"," excessively violent, not excessively insightful
","I will certainly think twice before seeing future Spielberg films. War of the Worlds was a nihilistic film, and Munich isn't much better. Sure, there are a few scenes with talking heads that are thoughtful, but do we really need two-and-a-half hours of closeups of gunshot wounds, spattered blood, gushing aortas and naked corpses before we are convinced that violence is a bad idea?<br/><br/>The premise of the film is that vengeance is inhumane, even when it is conducted by Jews. I'm fine with that premise, but my question is: is Spielberg really interested in humane film-making? If he was, he would have stopped making films a while ago, because this film is, like War of the Worlds, inhumane in its own way: Munich is self-indulgent, overlong, and indefensibly gratuitous in its on-screen violence. Once again, we have characters who are poorly motivated and who are simultaneously wicked and civilized in ways that reflect a dualistic / schizophrenic vision of humanity, rather than one that sees human beings as fallen but capable of true heroism. Example: the main character's source of information in carrying out vengeance against the Arab terrorists is a man who we discover is the ultimate relativist -- he'll sell information to anyone -- but is at the same time a 'devout' Catholic who insists on saying grace before meals. Are we supposed to believe this character without at least some kind of back story? I don't know, but one thing is certain: Spielberg's anthropology is incredibly pessimistic and disjointed. His vision is one that doesn't leave room for grace. Indeed, in an article about Munich in Time magazine, Spielberg has this to say about the future of Middle Eastern peace: ""The only thing that's going to solve this is rational minds, a lot of sitting down and talking until you're blue in the face."" And that hasn't been tried already?<br/><br/>Does a director with no one to challenge his willfulness necessarily become Neitzsche- esquire? Consider these quotations from the Time interview:<br/><br/>""I've never, ever made a movie where I said I'm making this picture because the message can do some good for the world -- even when I made Schindler's List.... I made the picture out of just pure wanting to get that story told.""<br/><br/>""I'm lucky at this point in my career that I can make the movies I want to make without having a studio come in and second-guess me. I always say thank goodness for Jaws, because Jaws gave me final cut. I've had it now for 30 years, and because of that I only have myself to blame for anything that goes wrong.""<br/><br/>That last quote sounds humble enough, but the corollary is that if anything goes right, he'll take credit, which I think is a very limited understanding of what is a supremely collaborative art form.<br/><br/>At any rate, Munich was a bomb. I'm going to see Kong next, which promises to be a more intelligent film."

When the film started I was trying to analyze it as much as possible, shot by shot, but as it went on, I was sucked in, and forgot I was watching a movie. The scenes of violence are haunting, making you feel like you're watching a documentary. The Munich airport massacre, and the female assassin's comeuppance are especially eery.

","Steven Spielberg creates a thoughtful and thought-provoking visual essay on the morality of revenge set against the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes in Munich. Simplistic at times  understandably so, given the nature of the long and volatile history of the Middle East  the film effectively reduces the complex issue of Israel's territorial and sovereignty rights to a personal level. In a mesmerizing performance by Eric Bana who plays Avner, a Mossad agent contracted to hunt down those responsible for the atrocities in Munich, ""Munich"" unapologetically echoes the truth of the well-known apothegm: violence begets violence. A particularly worthy film  and a pleasant surprise from Mr. Spielberg."

"evanston_dad","6","3","9","2 January 2006"," Obvious Drama with Very Little Impact
","At the beginning of his career, Steven Spielberg had an almost perverse desire to entertain his audiences. As a result, we were spellbound by his movies. Then he decided that he was going to make movies that were ""good"" for people, and he produced dreadful stuff like ""Amistad."" Lately, he's been trying to merge the two approaches to storytelling, and his movies have suffered for it. His pure entertainments, like ""War of the Worlds,"" haven't been particularly entertaining, and his message movies, like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" have been short on message.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is further proof that Spielberg is just not an especially intelligent director. He wants to thrill us with a cloak and dagger story even while he's preaching to us. The problem is this: the thriller parts of ""Munich"" undercut the seriousness of the topic, yet they're the only really entertaining moments of the film. Tony Kushner has written a clunky screenplay that jars to a halt every twenty minutes or so to discuss the moral crisis at the center of the movie as if we've been invited to sit in on a civics class, rather than letting the crisis evolve naturally from the material or allowing the audience to do any of the work for itself, which it is entirely capable of doing. And the action movie sections, while admittedly exciting, are manipulative and reek of classic Spielberg. He just can't resist the pull of emotional bombast and resorts to cheap tricks in order to build suspense. For instance, in a scene in which the team of Israeli assassins has rigged one of their target's phones to blow up when it is answered, he goes out of his way to introduce a child into the scene to heighten the tension; however, Spielberg is so predictable that we know a child will never die so aimlessly in one of his films. A truly original director would have made that scene suspenseful without pandering to our base emotions. And late in the film, during a scene in which Avner, the lead assassin, is making love to his wife while images of what happened to the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics flash through his head, Spielberg's histrionics derail the movie altogether into pure camp. Never mind that Avner couldn't possibly be remembering what happened since he never actually witnessed the events in the first place--at a moment when the film should be gripping, it's instead ridiculous.<br/><br/>The movie has a terrific look, and reminded me of those gritty paranoid films from the early seventies, like ""The French Connection"" and ""The Conversation."" Indeed, the look of the film and the skill with which it's put together will give people the illusion that's it a more important film than it really is, and will likely get it nominated for a buttload of Oscars. But in a year of such great movies that have already covered much of the same ground, ""Munich"" seems even further away from being an important film than it might in a more mediocre year. ""A History of Violence"" pretty much had the final word on the cyclical nature of violence and how it eventually degrades human morality; and Steven Gaghan showed with ""Syriana"" that a political thriller can be intelligent and exciting all at the same time.<br/><br/>I was impressed with Eric Bana, mostly because I've only seen him in ""Hulk"" and ""Troy"" and since those two movies don't comprise the world's most stunning acting resume, I was pleasantly surprised that he has quite a bit of skill. One senses that he didn't need Spielberg and company to stop the proceedings for the periodic lectures they wedge into the film; he could have done just fine on his own. And no other actors really get much of a chance to develop characters we care about, which has always been and probably always will be a weakness in any Spielberg movie.<br/><br/>I'm not Jewish or Palestinian, so I think I can speak pretty objectively to the fairness with which Spielberg approaches the topic. He makes an admirable attempt to address both sides, but the film's sympathies obviously lie with the Jews, and there a few moments when it takes on a self-righteous tone that threatens to tip the balance. However, Spielberg is Jewish, so I could easily excuse this.<br/><br/>There's a haunting, powerful film to be made from the events detailed in this film, but ""Munich"" isn't it.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

My aunt leaned over and asked about Eric Bana, I had to explain who he was. He really shows himself to be a good actor.

","This was a wonderfully executed film. I am Jewish and it touched me deeply. Contrary to what one would think, Spielberg gave air time to both sides. His main premise, as I interpret it, is that the tit for tat killings are futile and neverending. The participants are caught up in a constant search for revenge with no end in sight. They are never free of fear. By proxy too the world is caught up in it as well and is never free either. Spielberg conveys that each side (Palestinian and Israeli) have justifiable anger. I agree with Spielberg it is simply a dangerous and impossible struggle. So many innocent people are caught in the line of fire and it affects one psychologically beyond repair. Still, as a Jew, my empathy lies with the character that said he cared about Jewish blood only. The Holocaust taints my perspective and I am sympathetic to the Israeli hierarchy caught between KNOWING that this is never ending and the righteousness of the Jewish heart wrenching historical experience and therefore its cause. At the end, I too, even with all the suffering, danger and loss of life cared about Jewish blood more than the others. THAT to me is evidence of how strong the passions are if one has the knowledge of the futility and endless violence but still can push even that aside and feel satisfaction when Israelis prevail!"

Perhaps... but not when it comes to this subject. A subject so close to my heart and to the heart of any Jew, including, hopefully, Mr. Spielberg himself.<br/><br/>Inevitably, any human being put in Avner position would have moral doubts. But, let's look at history and observe that the main character returned to Israel and led an elite tank unit in the Yom Kipur war of 1973 that shortly followed the events depicted (see Sword of Gideon made in 1986 with Steven Bauer). Those who know, know the psychological training an elite Israeli soldier, let alone a Mossad agent, has to go through. Someone in Avner's position would not have any qualms about ridding this earth of the scum that he'd killed.<br/><br/>To put it simply, Spielberg picked a wrong historical example to drive the point the liberal origins of which are very clear in the modern context of the debate about civilized approach to the war on terror, in general, and Arab/Israeli conflict in particular."

But because Hamshari is targeted as a terrorist and partly responsible for the Munich tragedy (without a trial and no evidence other than Mossad ""intelligence""), EVERY WORD OF THEIR DIALOGUE IS TAKEN AS THE RANTINGS OF TERRORISTS and therefore FALSE by the ignorant masses. It's an old trick that holly wood has been playing for decades; slip in SOME of the truth among the preponderance of lies (omittance) and no one will believe the truth.<br/><br/>And there are also shreds of truth at 1:30:00 but much less so because the Arab's prophecy about the short life of Israel is only a dream, unfortunately. The USA (and allies AE) are for Israel. It's all about AIPAC and the Israeli lobby of liars.<br/><br/>I don't condone what the PLO did in the 1972 Munich Olympics. That was a mistake. The world didn't know what motivated them (and US news made sure we wouldn't). The PLO were naive to think that it would change anything. Indeed, it only made things worse for Palestinians. But what makes these Mossad agents any better than PLO terrorists or CIA killers or ISIL mercenaries or psychopath cops? Nothing. Not a damn thing. They are the same! They plant bombs. They are sneaky, deceptive and bungling idiots to boot.

Honestly it made me feel like it was 10 hours long, that is how boring it was. Not that the massacre of athletes should be exiting, of course. It is real tragedy. And it is where you make drama.<br/><br/>But I would better watch Seconds from Disaster about the topic again than this Munich.

"datathinner","10","2","5","10 January 2006"," Spielberg makes another masterpiece
","This is an excellent screenplay on all parts. The acting is spot on, the writing was excellent, and the direction was astounding. Spielberg speaks out and reveals the ""war on terror"" for what it really is, a senseless cycle of violence that hurts people on both sides, and forces us to look at it from both points of view: make special note of the scene where Avner is talking to the PLO member in the safehouse in Greece. You could say that this movie drags on, but the director is simply giving the scenes room to breathe and giving the movie the closure it deserves. Also, Bullit fans will notice Daniel Craig's likeness to Steve McQueen (which I'm sure Spielberg intended). It more than makes up for his recent 2005 throwaway flick ""War of the Worlds"" ... I'm sorry, but Tom Cruise is so far overrated it isn't funny. This is quite simply one of Spielberg's best works to date."
"nived84","10","2","5","9 January 2006"," Spielberg goes for the jugular
","Right from the get-go Steven Spielberg goes for the jugular without pause or hesitation in the opening moments of Munich, his latest film about the events that happened after the 1972 Olympic terrorist massacre. Of course I wasn't alive to have experienced this myself, but what's up on the big screen is nothing short of breathtaking, and shocking. I almost feel as if I did experience it in the same way as many people did back in '72, sitting on their sofa's watching it on television. The opening scenes are brutal, vicious and gut-wrenching, and the same can be said for the rest of what follows afterwards. For those who may have thought that Spielberg might have been ""losing it"" or ""getting soft"", clearly they don't know crap, and obviously haven't seen this film. This is Spielberg's darkest and most razor-sharp film in years, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. There's just something about the way Spielberg does historically based non-fiction, you get sucked in, you're there...and he's always firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Munich is 164 minutes long, and from the start of it Mr. Spielberg demands that you pay attention. The film follows five agents working unofficially for the Israeli secret service to hunt down and assassinate the 11 terrorists that were believed to have been behind the planning the murders of the 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics in Munich. Leading the team is Avner, who's brilliantly played by Eric Bana, a man who at first feels perfectly fine about taking up this new assignment, but as their assassinations go down, one by one, he starts to feel as if it's all been for nothing. Members of his own team are being hunted down by Arab terrorists, who are getting back at Avner and his team for their assassinations. It goes back and forth, we kill them, they kill us, and it never ends. And in the end Avner fears for his life, his wife and his new born baby, that possibly around every corner, or in any car someone might be trying to kill him. Avner's paranoia is both very real and very haunting, and the things he has done in the name of his country have left scars that will haunt him for the rest of his days.<br/><br/>Munich is one of only a few films to come out of Hollywood that seems to support the idea that killing for revenge is not only a terrible thing, but ultimately pointless. The only other film I've seen in years that suggests the same thing was Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, another great film. Unlike films like Kill Bill or Man on Fire, Munich shows us that revenge is a cycle that never ends; violence begets more violence. And the story and situation that's presented in Munich relates strongly to what's going on in our world, right now as I write this very review. These are the kinds of films that people NEED to see, because they have powerful messages, and they NEED to be heard. This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of 2005. And if the Academy Awards weren't so political, this film should, at the very least get a few Oscar nominations. Why can't there be more films like this?"

Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br/><br/>We subscribe to just about anything about Israel and from Israel and we have received many reviews and mostly UNKIND words about this movie. Now after seeing it, we can't understand what in the world they are talking about. I guess interpretation is the only word that comes to mind. But we were not offended by anything in the film and thought it was magnificent. How anyone on the entire planet could ever think that Steven Spielberg who is the #1 supporter of Israel would ever do something that was unkind to Israel is just not worthy of comment. Steven has spent much of his adult life giving and giving and giving to the people of Israel and the Holocaust survivors. This movie was INSPIRED BY EVENTS it is not a documentary. It is simply spectacular and is a wonderful MOVIE. The entire movie is about a group of secretive Israeli's who seek revenge for this disgusting real life murders. In history, there have never been a single word leaked as to who these people were and what exactly they did.... That is not the entire truth is known or will ever be known. Eric Bana deserves academy award nomination and the entire cast are relative unknowns with the exception of Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush who is always terrific. See you at the Academy Awards master Spielberg."
"archileach","2","3","10","7 January 2006"," Well-made, dishonest, and morally confused film
","The movie, Munich, is Spielberg's attempt to preach his liberal philosophy. Sure he uses a disclaimer at the beginning of the film that it's ""inspired by real events"", what does that mean? Does that mean that it represents an accurate picture of what really happened? Not on your life.<br/><br/>In the first place, the title Munich is misleading. The film isn't about the murder of the Israeli Olympic team members who were held hostage and then brutally executed by terrorists. It doesn't hardly attempt to portray these victims as being innocent of any wrong-doing, let alone tell their story in a proper light or setting. Rather, it focuses on a theme of vengeance, and turns things around to make Israel the offender and the terrorists the victims.<br/><br/>In the second place, there are extreme liberties taken with the account of Israel's retribution. The movie is taken from the somewhat dubious 1984 book Vengeance by George Jonas. Jonas ""based"" his book on the tale of an Israeli who claimed to have been part of a clandestine hit squad who worked for the Mossad. However, Jonas wasn't the first choice as author of this tale. According to Time Magazine, the Israeli in question first offered this story to a writer named Rinker Buck. But when Buck checked up on the informant's story, it didn't hold up. Buck withdrew saying he couldn't write the book in good conscience because the informant was ""changing his story daily"".<br/><br/>Spielberg's level of truth for believing the merits of this story are obviously much lower that Buck's. Perhaps his disclaimer should've read ""inspired by a sensationalized re-telling of embellished events"". He goes on to corrupt the story further by having Golda Meir utter a slanderous and totally dishonest statement for her that ""every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"". We're supposed to believe that she would've felt that eliminating murderous terrorists was somehow a betrayal of her values? What a load of crap. This statement is a fabrication of the film's liberal screenwriter and gay activist, Tony Kushner, who has previously given his view that establishing a state means ""f*** people over"".<br/><br/>Third, Spielberg's reasons for producing a less-than-accurate picture of these events isn't meant to merely provide moralizing comments on past events, but rather to give him a platform to comment on the current actions of our country. Spielberg's methods are far too shallow to hide his motives in this film. The film ends with his protagonist having left Israel, now standing juxtaposed with the World Trade Center behind him. The message here is the over-obvious liberal cry that ""we brought this violence upon ourselves"". How did we do this pre 911, you ask? By siding with Israel then, and by fighting back against terrorism today.<br/><br/>Spielberg has certainly become confused since making Schindler's List, hasn't he? He's been interviewed several times about the message of this film, and has routinely pontificated that, ""a response to a response doesn't really solve anything. It just creates a perpetual motion machine"". Yes, his opinion is that killing terrorists makes us as bad as the terrorists. Well, didn't killing Nazis make us as bad as Nazis then? This is the liberal war cry of pacifists, but it's never held up ""under fire"", so to speak.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that really bothers me, it's having to listen to overt moralizing by the morally conflicted. One the prime criticisms of the Jews of WWII is that as a group they didn't fight back. Now Spielberg criticizes them, and us, for fighting back. Well, which is it? He can't have it both ways. What he doesn't seem to realize is that diplomacy only works when you have the means to use force if it fails. It failed with Hitler, it failed with the PLO terrorists in Munich, and it failed miserably with Saddam.<br/><br/>Steven needs to get off his soapbox and wise up. He's only sleeping safely in this country tonight because our military is strong, and is able to confront and deter terrorists who would like to cut his precious Jewish head off given half a chance. Pacifistic sentiments are no deterrent, and don't reflect the reality of the world we live in. Perhaps Steven thinks Osama Bin Laden deserves a good talking to, but thankfully a majority of us would still rather see him join Hitler in receiving his just reward.<br/><br/>Spielberg is an example of how being a great filmmaker doesn't necessarily make your films great. This is a well-made, dishonest, and morally confused piece of garbage. Munich sucks."
"calditz1","4","4","16","1 January 2006"," Unfair and inaccurate
","For a story based on a ""true"" incident, Munich made up an awful lot. None of the top level Palestinians were ever killed (or taken to trial by an international court) and Spielberg really makes like the slaughter of Olympic athletes was justified. SPOILER: The interweaving of the athletes killing and a sex scene near the end was, come on people, stupid and nonsensical. Okay, I'm not a movie purist (for example, I never saw ""The Piano"" because it would have lined the pockets of a pedophile and I don't believe that any ""art"" transcends the maker), but don't sell a movie like Munich as being ""based on a true incident"" unless it actually is based on the incident. Unfortumately, the revisionist and politically correct history portrayed in Munich will be taken as actual history by a lot of people who will feel sorry for the Palestinians for all the wrong reasons. Spielberg should stick to movies like ET if he wants to do fantasy and to movies like Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan if he wants to do historical (and accurate) based stories. Disappointing movie ."
"msfried315","3","4","16","31 December 2005"," Spielberg took too long to develop his message, which was unclear
","I remember watching the Munich massacre on live TV. I knew that Israel had commissioned certain agents to eliminate the persons responsible. Why did it take Spielberg so long to develop this well known plot. The movie should have been cut by 1/2 an hour at least. His message was very difficult to ascertain. The only message that I perceived from this movie that there is no hope for any peace in the middle east. The killing will go on until eternity. For every person the Jews kill, the Arabs will kill a Jew. When will it ever stop? Spielberg obliterates the distinction between the Mossad, the CIA, and the KGB. According to this movie we never know whether the men assassinated were the actual perpetrators, or political killings. If that was his message, it could have been clearer."
"rlipton","4","3","11","2 January 2006"," A misguided mess of a movie
","First, I really don't care how the mainstream or reactionary Jewish community reacts to this film, and I'm not interested in accentuating the positive in this movie, I thought the movie showed weak and/or bad faith and I'm still not clear on why this movie was made. Further, I'm indifferent to whether this movie is true to life or simply made up, I'm only interested in what the movie seems to be doing in a relatively unsubtle way. Oh yeah, I'm also a Jewish American<br/><br/>The main message is something we have all heard before, ""why do they make us act the way we do"" (WDTMUATWWD) everything else flows from this, although there is some small attempts at getting a Palestinian perspective, its mainly add on and clearly is not a part of the main ""tone/structure"" of the movie. Any details of the lives of the Palestinians, one is a poet/translator, another an upper class/refine man living in a fancy part Paris with his wife and daughter (who plays the piano in front of the bomb maker killer) is inundated by the personal life of the main Jewish assassin/murderer/soldier (take your pick). The audience has no real choice not to sympathize with this person because we learn so much about him and to a lesser extent, the other killers. And all, to a greater or lesser extent, seem like pretty okay people. So, even if you knew nothing about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Munich, Sabra and Shatilla, etc, it doesn't matter, you would end up rooting for the main killer as a function of how much time we spend with them and how little with their antagonists.<br/><br/>Even if you think the actions necessary, what is the point of making the killers sympathetic? They have a terrible job to do, are probably pretty awful people to be in this business in the first place?. Unless, whether intended or not by the film maker, the terrible damage being done to Eric Banna's psyche falls under the rubric of WDTMUATWWD. This also dovetails with the mytho-poetic Israeli purity of arms, ""yes we kill but we kill because we have to and we kill only those we have to"", (there are variants on this, see Operation Iraqi freedom). Perhaps this damage was to be a microcosm of what is happening in Israeli society generally as a result of the occupation, this is unclear compared to the larger structures of the movie. <br/><br/>Too, there is a great deal of back and forth, as you might have heard, between the assassins which bolsters this myth of troubled/tragic/noble killers. And this isn't just a problem of the peculiar Israeli WDTMUATWWD syndrome, its a general settler colonial problem whereby the occupiers feelings, motivations and actions are always privileged relative to those occupied. We see this all the time in the NY Times, extensive coverage of a suicide bomb going off in a Jerusalem bus, lots of stories about those on the bus killed, (as it should be), but when it comes to Palestinians, we almost always only get numbers here , or, as in this movie, the most glancing reference to the fact that the Palestinians have lives too. <br/><br/>There is also something else quite troubling that occurs in the movie, the main assassin is always having PTSD flashbacks to the events that took place at the Munich Olympics, which doesn't make any sense at all from the stand point of the character, he wasn't there. A particularly troubling scene at the end of the movie has him ""flashing back"" in the middle of having sex with his wife. This is a the ""imperial we"" type of flash back, we are all meant to flash back, the killer doesn't flash back to all those he personally killed, some gruesomely, but to the seeming original sin of Munich so we don't forget the primal cause in all this mess. This is Spielberg at his didactic worst, very ham fisted.<br/><br/>On a lesser level, the idea of the upstanding assassin has him not going to bed with the comely hit woman at the bar, only to pass on this privilege to his comrade. (who she kills) This side story sucks, so I won't go into details, except to note that apparently the main assassin will kill with abandon yet not cheat on his wife, I suppose this is believable at some level, but it certainly feeds into the purity of arms idea of upstanding soldiers, pure in all respects. <br/><br/>And, believe it or not, Ehud Barak is mixed in, his execution of a leading Palestinian terrorist/activist/militant/family man, while dressed in drag is featured. Not clear what this was meant to show, but having an actual personage who was the leader of a country portrayed (accurately) as a close up, hands on assassin puts an extra spin on somewhat current events, particularly given Barak's explicitly racist statements about Palestinians. <br/><br/>The scenes with Golda Mier made my blood boil, a nice little housewife fighting courageously against all those who, for no apparently rational reason want to kill Jews. Again, it's a question of focus, if Palestinian leaders would have been portrayed thoughtfully mulling options then we would have a ball game, of course this doesn't happen. The recent movie Paradise Now was far better at problematizing the violence, it was short and very low budget. James Journey to Jerusalem was also much better in this respect, going to the core of current Israeli society. It's a question of focus, artistic vision and simply put, courage. The film maker somehow lost all of this and I'm really sorry for T. Kushner (who I admire and respect), but he got sucked into a misguided effort."

"hiskih","3","2","6","30 December 2013"," Disappointing propaganda
","This overlong film is so visually ugly, monotonous and repetitive that I only watched it to the end because I wanted to see how it portrays the Lillehammer incident, in which the Mossad murdered an innocent man mistaken for one Ali Hassan Salameh. The characters repeatedly say that Ali Hassan Salameh is their main target and two failed attempts on his life are depicted, so everything seems to point toward the Lillehammer case as the dramatic highlight and turning point. To my surprise, it is not mentioned at all. All we get is the end credits telling us that Ali Hassan Salameh was killed by the Mossad in 1979 (not mentioning the other casualties of the hit).<br/><br/>Why? The only answer I can think of is that the filmmakers did not want to show Israeli agents killing an innocent man, even by mistake. They wanted to show the mighty Mossad as capable of everything except mistakes, yet its crafty agents so humane that they suffer heavy stress for killing terrorists (in reality the agents involved denied any such thoughts). This omission makes the whole film a piece of pro-Israel propaganda, not that such a thing ever was a surprise from Hollywood."

Okay, that could make for a good action movie. I thought that it would have some good action scenes, maybe a little suspense. Boy was I wrong again! I can sum up this movie pretty simply, using dialog the characters might as well have used:<br/><br/>""We found this guy, now let's go kill him. We can't shoot him let's set a bomb. The bomb didn't work. Now we have to go in and shoot him. We shot him. He's dead, let's go find another one.""<br/><br/>Repeat scenario above. For what feels like four hours.

"mattrochman","4","2","6","13 August 2006"," Mediocre effort given the opportunity
","For some reason, I wasn't mad about this film. Aside from the ""underlying messages"" of the film, I think the actual film making was wrong. <br/><br/>To begin with, the actual events of the Munich hostage situation is littered in sections throughout the film. While I can see what Spielberg was trying to do, I somehow would have preferred it if either: A) the events of munich were not shown at all; or B) the events of munich were shown in order and sequence at the opening of the film. <br/><br/>Second, the film couldn't seem to make up its mind in relation to focus. At times, I felt as though I was watching a scene in a film like True Lies or Mission Impossible and at other times, I felt as though the film was trying to deliver some poignant points about Israel and conflicts in the middle east surrounding it. It's not that it's impossible to have two separate focuses in a film, but I just felt that this film did not adequately pull it off with enough coherence. <br/><br/>Third, I felt that the character's ""attack of conscience"" seemed somewhat out of place or rather overstated. Let's face it: they are Mossad assassins sent on a mission following Munich. I found it difficult to believe that they were so distraught from carrying out assassinations. Otherwise, what are they doing in that line of work in the first place? It was just a bit too forced in my view.<br/><br/>Forth, the film addressed a perspective: if we kill the head of ABC, he is simply replaced and the violence continues. Well its not as simple as that. It's a bit more of a gamble in my view. Sometimes head is replace by someone who is worse ideologically, but far less competent. Other times, the head is replaced, but takes the group in a different direction or loses the faith of its members. While the members that dissociate may become part of another group, it would be in israels advantage to fight or negotiate with fewer splinters within the same ""cause."" <br/><br/>Fifth, in relation to the Arab-Israel tensions/conflict, the film really didn't say all that much more than we already know. It's a circle of violence with no end in sight and revenge gets them nowhere. So there really wasn't a fresh perspective - more of a rehashed viewpoint of a conflict where most people with all sorts of views on the subject tend to oversimplify and ignore external factors that are at play on many occasions."

"tuco73","6","2","6","14 February 2006"," Mossad portrayed as humane....
","I think this was one of the best late Spielberg movies: it has an interesting plot, suspense, action, it is less cheesy than usual... you are led into the picture from the beginning and cannot get out till the end... Obviously being made by a Jewish director we cannot expect a complete balance in the portrayal of such delicate situations and reasons behind them, but we can all see he must have made quite an effort to try and be impartial. In the end, contrarily to the old and unfortunately (for some, because Biblical) still valid saying ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth"" the quite simple message is that violence leads to more violence and this is not the way to follow... Beyond Spielberg's usual nice and moral messages (which I cannot digest easily anymore), still a few things didn't convince me in this movie. Who can really believe that Mossad (Israel's very efficient secret services) are so humane and have the conflictual thoughts of most of the components of that gang in the movie? If that was the case I doubt they were so efficient in killing and retaliate, as it happen-ed/s in real life... Can we possibly believe that all information came from a source which we never get to understand who they really are or work for (seems quite a dangerous and unconvincing part of the story)?? Why do we keep seeing Eric Bana having the nightmare of what happened in the airport (even when he has sex!!) if he wasn't there that night? Shouldn't he (especially if he is so humane...) have nightmares of the people he actually kill himself??? And, as usual, the Palestinians seem to be some kind of poor and dirty desperate fanatics, while Mossad have reasons to eventually do even worse things and then, being so enlightened and humane, to have conflictual feelings... Come on Steven!"

","I really cannot believe what I just saw.<br/><br/>Each epic film he makes has the power to write historic events into the minds of the viewer in ways beyond any experience could manifest.<br/><br/>With such power at his hand, wouldn't an abuse of that power be a crime against humanity itself - I ask?<br/><br/>This brings me to the issue I would like to raise.<br/><br/>The Hollywood machine has always been seen as being Jewish controlled, and when Spielberg made Schinders List - the whole world felt the pain of the Jews during those dark times. A political film? Yes. but the period was quite far into the past - and clearly enough evidence was at hand to say that the film could be an accurate story to represent that time/ events in history in a light of truth. An acceptable work of cinema art - and wonderful performances matched with a passionate effort all round.<br/><br/>But now, with the release of his most political film yet... Munich - it seems that his loyalties are clear. And much to my disappointment, this film goes against everything that true film makers should stand for.<br/><br/>Is it that after 23 films, his 24th must pay tribute to the financial forces that have helped him make the last 23 - with little or no intervention to date?... has he been pruned by the Zionists to finally show his true purpose in later life? - A cheap merchant of propaganda for the neo conservative/ Zionist world bankers, who are attempting to enslave us all into a global fascist state?<br/><br/>It seems Spielberg has made his loyalties clear, and they don't rest with the peaceful human beings on this planet fighting for freedom, but the evil forces at work to promote this never ending war on terrorism. He has clearly sided with the real terrorists - the establishment that hold us in constant fear to control us all and take away our potential for a peaceful future on this planet.<br/><br/>Artists have a responsibility at this crucial time in history. To bring us the truth, and to shine the light for humanity. - but it seems that now is crunch time - ""you are either with us , or with the terrorists"" as Bush bluntly puts it.<br/><br/>After seeing this film Spielberg has made his stance clear, which deeply disappoints me. It's a similar feeling to finding out that Michael Jackson was a child molester (not that it's true) and all of those memories that have become part of the person I am have been shattered.<br/><br/>Munich is a blatant Zionist propaganda film.<br/><br/>From the start to the finish, you can feel the shame in the acting - and as the controversial story unfolds.. the pro Israeli viewpoint is as clear as can be.<br/><br/>I accuse all involved in that film of selling their soul.... true artists - certainly not. more like mere pawns in the illuminati's agenda to brainwash us all to believe what we see and hear - and to not ask questions.. after all how could someone like Steven Spielberg tell lies... they wouldn't go to the trouble of making such a big budget film and get it all wrong, would they?<br/><br/>Well, the answer is not so simple. There are so many inconsistencies in that film. Too many to mention here. I assume whoever is reading this, has already seen the film and may have read some of the main points brought up against this film.<br/><br/>To make a film about one of the most controversial political events in history is asking for trouble. And to package it up with such a pro Israeli, and very obvious link to the 911 tragedy/ war on terror, is even more astounding.<br/><br/>The killer for me was the very last shot of the film showing the New York skyline (with the 2 towers in the background) and the text overlaid "" NINE of the ELEVEN terrorists involved in the Munich killings were killed"" - - Spot the Subliminal???? do they really think that we are that dumb?<br/><br/>If you ask me this film is an insult to the intelligence of whoever watches it... and confirms that these powerful Zionists think we are like sheep who will simply accept anything we see in the cinema.<br/><br/>It is also a known fact that Hollywood does screening tests on small audiences of around 200 people before releasing a film, and makes changes to the edit based on this small snapshot of people's views... do they think we are all the same (like sheep) or what??? <br/><br/>The film Munich to me was not a work of art from the heart of a true film maker, but a reluctantly made payback to the dark forces that have funded this amazing director for his entire career.... is it crunch time now to show which side YOUR on?<br/><br/>Shame on you Steven Spielberg, you have turned your back on us all.. and you are too damn intelligent and talented to be excused for ignorance on this one... At least we know who's side your on now."

I know that Schindler's List was an exception to this rule, but an overwhelming majority of the worlds population don't really need to examine their belief's to decide where their sympathies lie in terms of the holocaust.<br/><br/>For those that don't know the film shows the Israili retaliation to the Munich Olympic massacre by the Black September group. The film is nicely played and the script is good, but the film is far too pc for anything interesting or memorable to come out of it.<br/><br/>I suspect the movie is trying to convey the inner turmoil that goes on in the minds of terrorists, be they state supported or from any of the terrorist organisations around the world. I say 'suspect' because it completely fails in the objective. The film doesn't engage and an opportunity to consider what it must be like to be a member of Black September or Mossad is lost.<br/><br/>The film's Oscar nod says more for Spielberg's reputation in Hollywood than it does for the quality of the film. The film also gives little insight into the conflict that continues to threaten world peace to this day. I saw a very interesting documentary about one of the victims relatives.

Even when Mossad send assassins, they (assassins) suffer, because they are a goodhearted nation with honor (yeah sure). It is WRONG to kill innocent people (like in Munich), but there are many stories of killing Palestinian children by Israeli bullets shot by Israeli ""soldiers"". Come on, give me a break: when Israeli people kill civilians - they are soldiers, when Palestinians kill civilians - they are terrorists. I would really like to see a movie that shows suffer of Palestinians and how poor they live. Why? There are always two sides of the story!"
"andrewrobson79","4","2","6","6 February 2006"," Main problem with this film
","Munich tries to convey the belief that the killings of names on the list of 11 merely resulted in retaliation by Black September (e.g. the Embassy mail bombings), and a worsening cycle of tit-for-tat violence. I disagree with this. Black September was nothing more than a nom de guerre for the PLO which it used as cover for the worst atrocities. The PLO committed violence because it received greater diplomatic recognition from the UN and other organisations after having done so. If you read 'Why Terrorism Works' by Alan Dershowitz, you will see how, throughout the last 40 years, Palestinians have succeeded in advancing their case over far more worthy ones, simply by shooting and blowing up more people than other terrorist groups."

I think it is very hard to portray modern history in an objective way, and to be honest l don't think this was a very good subject to film, without spoiling it for anyone the violence is sharp and unrelenting but there is to much talk between the action and that is where it looses it's way, see it and then make your decision...l give it 4/10"

But this movie? It has no rhythm, it is excessively long, acting is too often too bad, some scenes are excessive (blood and gore, without any reason for that) and, in the end, nothing remains of a tragedy that shook the whole world. Coming to actors, although usually good, Eric Bana is simply embarrassing (it seems like he took a ""sad and suffering look"" from the first minute to the last...no changes were allowed). Geoffrey Rush takes his role directly from Gordon Jackson's Mr. Cowley (The Professionals) and seems to have fun with it, with the difference that Jackson is better....Lonsdale is the only one saving the bunch. Honestly, I don't see any other ""real"" actor in here. According to me, a very weak movie that confirms the end of Mr Spielberg's state of grace......I hope there won't be any further Indy...."

","I really wanted to like this movie! It's a great subject and I thought that a movie that generates so much discussion would at least offer me something to talk about. However, it didn't live up to expectations. I think part of the problem was that Spielberg went for the straight narration of the story, with a strangely weak main character. Eric Bana was good as Avner, but didn't really portray his moral conflict well. The other characters weren't fleshed out well at all. Geoffrey Rush was quite good in his limited time on screen. Ultimately, the most powerful moments in the movie are the documentary-style opening sequence involving the terrorists and their hostages and the end sequence when you see what happens at the airport. Some powerful, gripping images here although the final scenes are cut with Eric Bana (Avner) making love to his wife, which completely didn't resonate with me at all.. <br/><br/>The movie is gorgeously shot in the ""bleached color"" look by Janusz Kaminski. The detail from the 70's is amazing, production wise. I didn't look at the watch once, because I found the subject matter interesting but from an accomplished director like Spielberg, I expected a better movie. Strangely, I felt the same let down after seeing Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Munich could have been a masterpiece, but Spielberg wasted this opportunity. It's a shame because I think this was a great story and he could have done so much better than what we see on screen."

","Spielberg's film ""Munich"" is a remake of the 1986 film ""Sword of Gideon"" starring Michael York and Rod Steiger. The true story of the terrorist incident at the 1972 Olympics and the Israeli response. This film is grittier and more graphic than the original, though many scenes are taken verbatim from it.<br/><br/>One problem I have is the title. Kind of like ""JFK"" which wasn't really about JFK, ""Munich"" isn't about Munich. It does recreate the original incident, but better to see the 1999 documentary ""One Day in September"". The final scene with the World Trade Center photoshopped into the scene was effective, but the point that was to be made was too nebulus. What is it exactly Spielberg is trying to say there? Again if you see ""Sword of Gideon"" much of ""Munich"" is redundant, and in a sense a rip-off, especially as it isn't being marketed as a remake, trying to sweep that under the rug. The good points are the realism of the camera-work. I think Spielberg reaches too far by taken incidents and trying to extend them into universal themes. Schindler's list was not the quintessential Holocaust film as some believe, it was a specific story (War and Remembrance would be the quintessential one). And likewise this is so far from a quintessential film on terrorism, but it wants to be."

It wasn't about how hard life has been on the chosen people - it was actually about how hard the chosen people can be on their enemies.

This mission is stark, violent, and tragic as well as human and personal as Spielberg offers a human face to all the characters both Israeli and Arab. This a powerful movie that offers its viewers a harsh, tragic look at a husband and a young fighter for his country who undergoes a personal struggle for meaning and devotion to his country and his family while trying to negotiate the often murky and dark world of intelligence and betrayal.

"joncha","9","1","2","12 October 2018"," The hunters become the hunted
","This is a thought-provoking movie, to say the least. At first you get the impression that it will be a straight-forward account of revenge and retribution, the killing or assassination of the individuals responsible for planning the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the story is much more complicated than that. The Israeli assassination squad, although supposedly professionals in their field, do not carry out their tasks with the cold blooded efficiency one normally sees in a James Bond or Arnold Schwartzenegger movie. They fumble with their weapons, hesitate to pull the trigger, set unrealistic parameters regarding ""collateral damage"" and then are overcome with guilt when any ""non-target"" is killed. Finally, the hunters become the hunted, realizing that the underworld of paid informants can also be turning over information about them to their enemies. Paranoia (displayed primarily by Avner, the team leader) that is created by ""being hunted"" is combined with the realization that the ""targets"" of their mission may not have all be directly connected to the Munich massacre and the total purpose of their mission may never be explained to them. Added to this are the ""unintended consequences"" of their actions, as they realize that each individual they eliminate is often replaced by one or more successors who are even more dedicated to the goal of destroying Israel. And, as Avner's conversation with the Palestinian Ali shows, each side in the conflict can demonstrate a moral purpose to their cause, justifying whatever actions they may take, no matter how those actions violate the morality of their society. What began as a tale of black-and-white issues becomes, in the end, a morass of decisions, actions, consequences, and, sadly, a failure to reach any conclusion or closure to the anger and suffering caused by the initial act of terrorism."

There was little that reminded you that this was a ""Spielberg movie"". For me, it was just a ""heavy experience"". I *will* give credit to Eric Bana, who I thought did some amazing acting in this!

","As intriguing as the movie was, I was somewhat disappointed because I thought it would be about the planning and execution of the massacre that occurred at the Munich Olympics of 1972. I could have researched that information, so my error in not looking into it. Director Spielberg appears to have taken a non-ideological and non-political approach to the story, where it could have easily slipped into showing favor to one side or the other, Israeli or Palestinian. Not knowing how accurate the story was in all it's facets, I was dismayed by the idea that the American CIA would be working in concert with an Arab terrorist, as in the case of Salameh, the mastermind behind the Munich tragedy. There's also the stunning revelation of a sketchy underworld in which information is bought and sold to the highest bidder without regard to affiliation or loyalty. <br/><br/>The main thrust of the story seems to be the emotional conflict Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) goes through as he gets deeper and deeper into the mission of finding and exterminating the Munich extremists. Basically, low level Mossad members are recruited to carry out an assassin's mission after relinquishing any semblance of identity with a government or agency. Not that it's impossible to ferret out, as the actions of Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and his father demonstrate. <br/><br/>Because so many modern films in the realm of action and adventure feature absurd, over the top violence, this one dealing with assassinations on a global scale seems almost tame by comparison, even if the results are death and destruction on a formidable scale. I have no problem recommending the movie for it's story and content, though I would have, as I have said, preferred to see something substantive about the Munich tragedy itself."

","The Summer Olympics in West Germany in 1972 proved to be shocking and sadly triggering. 17 people died: 11 Jewish Olympic coaches or athletes, 5 Black September Palestinian terrorists, and one German police officer. The true violence and wrath occurred when the Jewish government lead a secret operation to hire four assassins to hunt and kill the Palestinians responsible for the deaths. Eric Bana plays Avner, a security agent who is requested to lead the operation. The four men encounter various attacks and end up assassinating many people responsible for the deaths. However, many other people become targeted through the mission due to their encounters...even the four Israeli assassins. Bana gives a flawless performance and portrays a scared and disturbed by violence type of hero who doesn't try to hard when holding his gun. He plays a realistic type of man and is not forced. The story of the Israeli assassin assignment was kept quiet for many years to avoid criticism, but later was revealed allowing legendary artist Steven Spielberg to create this powerhouse film. Every action sequence is not overdone or forced like most films these days, and has realistic violence that serves a purpose and shows a compelling time in history. Spectacular film making from every field brings this genius thriller to the world to show a compelling drama. The thrilling excitement provides an intelligent thriller that is eye-opening to show how Israel has dealt with terrorism for years. The true purpose of the film is to show how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict haunts the lives of many people, which is used through Eric Bana's intriguing character. Avner is so haunted by the violence he experiences that the conflict between the two groups devours him. Spielberg isn't showing how the Israeli's were innocent or how he Palestinians were cruel, instead he shows how each side fights over this land and how the conflict and war on terrorism will continue to affect the world for centuries."

"Degree7","8","1","2","27 September 2013"," What is the price when fighting for one's home?
","5 minutes into Munich, and Spielberg proves that he is one of the most gripping directors in this lavish, rich, and textured drama. The tragedy of the 1972 Munich Olympics is realistically portrayed in a gruesome and unapologetic fashion. As the film opens, the beating sounds of drum machines fills the air, and we helplessly watch as a dozen men are helped to scale the fence housing the Olympic athletes. We sit riveted as the would-be terrorists unveil their weapons from their bags, and plan to throw away their lives to commit mass murder.<br/><br/>And so Munich goes on, unflinchingly, to realize the after effects of the Black September attacks, and the Israeli response to the aggression. Avner, played convincingly by Eric Bana, is a three dimensional human being. He and the rest of his crew are ready to assassinate their targets without remorse, but he has strong family values and an unwavering love for his country. And so he goes unquestioningly, at the beck and heed of his superiors. What starts out as an optimistic mission of extracting justice on their enemies soon deteriorates into a world of paranoia and endless violence for these characters, many of whom meet gruesome ends. Avner is not recognized by Mossad, or the military, and doesn't even exist to his country. He is off the record, an amoral cog operating in political world. As a result, this isolation from any real ideology sabotages his sanity. <br/><br/>Munich illustrates that the wars of today are fought between secret armies, and spies spying on spies. Eventually it becomes hard to tell where the enemy is, and where the pointless violence begins and ends. The only other people choosing to be apolitical in this conflict, like the French team of Louis and Papa, say they are in it to protect their family. And yet, they count the hundreds of thousands of dollar bills that Avner gives to them in exchange for the heads of Arab sympathizers. The money follows the fighting, and shows how a war of ideologies has been hijacked by factions looking to make a profit. Honor and integrity come at a high price for everyone involved. <br/><br/>As the body count piles up, Avner and the audience begin to wonder. At what price does the fight for home and family become too much? It becomes clear that even when Avner is reunited with his family, he comes home to an apathetic Israel, and even his family life is haunted by the trauma of his deeds. <br/><br/>Munich details a world where extra-judicial killings mean that terms like ""justice"" and ""righteousness"" become useless and ill-defined words that have no place. All parties soon become apparent pawns in a game of politics between nations. By the end of the film, Avner, living in exile in New York, is told by his superiors to ""come home."" But it's apparent that he doesn't have a home to come back to."

","Purposeful and insider-like, Munich comes at you from often filmed angles of guilt and revenge. But Spielberg shows us a scandalous Israeli government eye-for-an-eye reaction delivered by a thoughtful Priminister perspective. That scene set the subconsciousness of the film. The hit squad assembled was shockingly amateur, but the underlying theme takes over the film as Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush and Daniel Craig debate the controversial choice of becoming the terrorists that they are desperately trying to destroy. Black September haunts this film throughout, drives the hunt for those responsible, but it is the viewer who's left to mull around the price for freedom."

Since America did not do enough to stop terrorism that we ended up paying an enormous price for our lack of effort? Was it supposed to be some ironic forbearance of the future? Up until that shot I was enthralled by Munich, but I left the theater angry about the final scene. Many ""unknowns"" were answered in the movie Munich.

When Golda says words to the effect that they will now send the world a message that it's not OK to go around murdering Jews any more, that summed up the essence of the issue for me: there is now negative feedback in the system.

I didn't know what to expect from this movie but after seeing it, I was very impressed at how Spielberg tackled the issues without taking sides. He presents the facts and the dilemmas that arise with a fine understanding of the complex situations.<br/><br/>'Munich's execution is similar to that of 'Saving Private Ryan'. It's raw, it's graphic, and it's dark. The colours are a little washed out and this makes the images look more gloomy but also real. The minimal yet efficient use of music is a clever choice and the camera-work is superb. <br/><br/>The screenplay is fantastic. I don't mind long movies as long as they don't bore the viewer. The story is well told brilliantly maintaining the suspense and element of drama. The characters are beautifully written and they come off as humans on screen rather than caricatures. With 'Munich' there was not one moment when I felt that it dragged. The pacing was well maintained.<br/><br/>Without casting Hollywood bigwigs, Spielberg opts for an impressive International cast. and I love movies that have actors from different parts of the world. Here you have Australians Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush (who're cast as Israelis), a British Daniel Craig, a French Matthieu Kassovitz, an Irish Ciarán Hinds, a German Hanns Zischler, an Israeli Ayelet Zurer and a Canadian Marie-Josée Croze. All these actors do nothing short of excellent. The film itself rests on Bana's shoulders and the actor proves that he can carry a complex film.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Munich' is a stupendous political thriller. Spielberg has succeeded again and it is no surprise why he is known as one of the greatest and most versatile filmmakers of today."

One is action thriller and the other is documentary.<br/><br/>Spielberg charts a third course and delivers a thoughtful examination of the effect that carrying out a vendetta has on those who carry it out. Given the nature of the source event, one might expect Spielberg to take sides, but this film is very balanced: it shows but does not judge.<br/><br/>All the cast are quite excellent, and they have a lot to do - as much of the film is spent sitting round the dinner table as actually engaged in retributive action, so there is ample opportunity for detailed character to be shown.<br/><br/>One wonders if watching this film might actually have an effect on those engaged on both sides of those conflicts which have been going on for generations."
"Ozzy2000","10","1","2","7 March 2008"," Spielberg support for the return Palestinian homeland from Israel
","Steven Spielberg explores the assassination and murder of eleven Israeli Athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by one of the many Palestinian Liberation groups known as ""Black September"". Spielberg demonstrates that extremism of the Israeli Secret Service Mossad in exacting revenge by the perpetrators of the Munich Massacre. He clearly shows how the Israelis acted illegally in murdering the members of Black September and the futility of revenge. Spielberg masterfully manages to present the views of the Black September who committed the terrorist act as a means to tell the world that they want their homeland , Palestine back from the Israelis. It is refreshing to see films that give some understanding of the injustices committed against the virtually unarmed Palestinians when their country was taken forcefully by the formation of Israel in 1948. Although Spielberg is of Jewish background he has managed to produce a film that condemns Israel and presents us with the concept that the Munich Massacre may have some justification. He did however fail to highlight the fact that the German Government deliberately failed to save the Israeli athletes by putting the hostage incident in the hands of proved incompetent German Police and Public servants almost ensuring the death of the hostages. A huge fault with the film is that Israeli Mossad Operative Avner ( Eric Bana) has flashbacks of the incident which could not have possibly experienced which made me really wonder about the over rated Spielberg directing skills. Bana's moribund and monotone droll depiction of his character combined with Geoffrey Rush's character , head of the Mossad makes the Israeli's look like incompetent but determined clowns who come close to murdering innocent children. No mention is made of the Israeli Stern gang and their acts of Terrorism.<br/><br/>This is a very significant film which should be shown in all schools so they get an alternate view to the Israeli-American view of the Middle East."

","""Munich' is a gripping drama about the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy involving the death of Israeli athletes. I was not disappointed after watching the movie, but it certainly wasn't the best movie of Spielberg's career.<br/><br/>The story evolves around Avner (Eric Bana) who along with four other men are sent to eliminate the Palestinian culprits one by one.<br/><br/>At first I was hesitant that Spielberg would make the movie overly biased in favor of the Israeli perspective but I found that he did a delicate job of promoting his beliefs while never crossing the line of propaganda. There are scenes where there is Palestinian sympathy as well.<br/><br/>But the movie is more than just an Israel v Palestinian examination. It's about the path and development of Avner's character. From a naive, inexperience agent to a paranoid, political hit-man who begins to question the validity of his assignments and his role in the whole 'game.'<br/><br/>That to me was the strength of the movie, the character of Avner. However there was an ensemble cast which also carried the movie with excellence. Daniel Craig (Steve) played a great role as an aggressive Israeli hit-man, Geoffrey Rush (Ephraim) was wonderful as the Government officer relaying orders and the best surprise was Michael Lonsdale (Papa) as an engaging role of an informant providing information to any one who pays for it. These characters were tremendous additions which further strengthen the movie.<br/><br/>So why is this movie only rated a 7 and didn't win best picture for 2005. I believe the main reason is length. The movie is just too long. It runs at 2 hours and 44 minutes and doesn't need to be. The problem is the movie follows the group as they seek out 11 individuals one at a time. This means that there are 11 assignments and each assignments has their own ebb and flow, their own climax and downfall. However by the fifth or sixth assignment, the slow pace begins to get repetitive. I believed that this was the only weakness of the movie.<br/><br/>However despite its length, Spielberg created an enthralling story with some tremendous characters and that is what made the movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 stars"

",""" Its strange, isn't it? To think of oneself as an assassin?"" One of my favorite movies from 05. The public massacre of Israeli athletes spurs Israel's relentless intelligence agent, Mossad, into action. While the world reels from seeing the '72 Olympics marred by murder, the agency orders Avner ( played masterfully by Eric Bana) to retaliate against the Palestinians responsible.<br/><br/>Under the long-distance commander of government agent Ephraim ( Geoffrey Rush), five diverse operatives form an unconventional counter-terrorism team, in which they set out to track and kill their pray. As the men grow to realize they are enmeshed in a morally and politically complex story, they begin to question their roles.... only to find that no answers are there.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is a little too long, and I could see how a someone could simply turn it off...... but, for me- it feels very efficient, and absorbing. There were really only two scenes, I thought were ridiculous, the first one was the contrived meeting with the PLO terrorists in the same safe house and the second were the lame sex scenes, that I could have done without.<br/><br/>But, for me: The film's most exciting moments are in the details of assassinations. The bomb at the hotel, with the newlyweds and the very own target right next door to Avner.... the first assassination, the Hitchcockian suspense surrounding the little girl answering the phone, when she is not supposed to be there, the commando night raid, the killing of the Dutch Assassin. However, my all time favorite scene of the film- takes place in the rain soaked London, where Avner and his team are trailing one of their targets, and they are assaulted by a bunch of Americans- who turn out to be CIA, protecting their 'asset.' Current 007 himself, Daniel Craig's performance as the most gung ho of the group, leaves you wondering what he's got in store for the Bond Franchise as well."

","I did not think I was going to like this film but was surprised to have been drawn into a very human side of terrorism and revenge. Possible spoiler+++++The story brings forward how the path of revenge leads to unexpected consequences and becomes an inescapable interlocking of fates. The main characters are never the same once they have started to kill and the cycle of revenge finds them in a fight for their own emotional and physical lives. It is a very profound lesson in what unseen consequences can result when feeding hate. Unlike similar films, the bloodshed was not overdone and appropriate to the scenes The film definitely needed to be cut down but worth seeing."
"lazur-2","8","1","2","28 June 2006"," the complexities of reality are tough to recreate
","What are the motives for killing another human being? To gain fearful respect? Revenge? Strategy? Preemptive self-defense? Fear? Pure hatred? Reflex? The paradoxical belief that it will end the killing? The truth would seem to lie in an indecipherable complex combination of all of these things. This applies to both our motives and our enemies. The problem is that it's not only impossible for us as the audience to know the killer's motives, but for the killer himself: 'Sold' on the necessity of this work, it soon becomes apparent that they are pawns in an unending system of violence, which will be rationalized by whatever means effective. One big difference between this film and so many otherwise somewhat similar movies is the realistic strategy of the killings: They are not trying to engage in combat, but rather to kill their targets in what may strike the viewer as an innocent moment. Such behavior is usually reserved for the ""bad guy"", but introspective moments show that our guys are indeed as 'good' as 'good guys' can be. In real life, even the worst murderer in the world in having an innocent moment 99.99% of the time. It changes nothing of their crime, and to challenge each terrorist to a duel is simply the stuff of fiction. Nonetheless, as motives get muddled, mistakes are made, things get personal, and the hunters become the hunted. As time goes by, it eventually can be no other way, unless the killer is alone and irrational. These soldiers do not have such a luxury. Only 8 out of 10 because there are moments of confusion in the editing in of the Olympics, no reason Bana's character should have such a clear vision of the murders, and the out of character behavior that gets their otherwise cautious,(and already warned),cleanup guy killed by the Dutch hooker/hitwoman."
"Pookyiscute","7","1","2","27 June 2006"," Not Spielberg's best piece.
","While the first half of this movie is simply magnificent, and keeps your heart rate at all time high, by the end of the second half, you're ready for the film to be over. The last half of the film is slow, and boring. It really covers too much information, that we could have surmised on our own without having to be shown or told. <br/><br/>Spielberg always captivates audiences, and you might find that since this is also a film based on true events, it's very similar to 'Catch Me If You Can', which he filmed in 2002. Not that the stories are similar at all, but the way it's filmed, is in a lot of ways, almost exactly the same.<br/><br/>I was so impressed however, with the cinematography and how Spielberg was able to make it look like it was actually filmed in the 1970s.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story, you might get confused at times. I knew the story going into the film, and I was still confused. It's not the best Spielberg film for two reasons. That's one, and the other is that it's far too long. Like most of his films, he likes to take his time setting up the story before he gets into the actual movie, however, sometimes that's not always necessary. Sometimes, you can have a great film without going into a lot of detail. We're not reading a book here. This is a visual art form of story-telling, and so sometimes small details are not always necessary. <br/><br/>Eric Bana was excellent, and he resembled Christian Bale so much in this film, at times I thought it was the 'Batman' actor. All of the actors in the film were great, especially the team that's sent to assassinate the assassinators. A little bit of life's ironies are thrown into play, which also makes the film that much more realistic, as well as the times when you don't know exactly what's going to happen, to whom, or when.<br/><br/>There were times of pure tension, and other times of pure boredom. But, I think it works well for the most part, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film (at least the first half), and I would definitely recommend it to those who want to see what really happened in 1972-73. It's an amazing story. And, it just goes to show what people do to back their own."

I don't usually vote very high, but after I saw this movie, I think I can recommend it to anybody who likes a long during, drama/action/comedy.<br/><br/>The actors are showing some real talent, although they aren't really famous I think. It proves that an actor doesn't have to be famous at all, and can still be a good actor.<br/><br/>The very best scene in the movie I found the one with the little kid and the telephone. Although you see what's going to happen, you don't know where it ends, and also the choice of music was very good in this scene.<br/><br/>There was only one shot in the movie I didn't like. It is when Avner is at the Terra's of a restaurant in Rome. The camera tilts down, and after that it's going to zoom in on the table where Avner is sitting. You just can't go to zoom in a good movie. That's my opinion."

In the helicopter scene, historically, wasn't there a grenade thrown inside? I remember when this massacre happened, It was a completely useless act for the Palestinians, it did much more harm to their credibility, than good.

","In a year of really good movies, I believe MUNICH was the best of them all. It's a big movie that because it struck me on so many levels, felt very personal. While I realize that some people like to minimize Spielberg's work at times, this movie proves yet again that there is no filmmaker who can make a movie hum like he can. MUNICH is really a thrilling ride but it is not fun at all. It's exciting but it's painful. It's long and it feels like it never ends but (unlike A.I.) that was okay because it just works so well. In fact, I believe that this was Spielberg's message -- this movie is going to keep going and going, just like the cycle of violence that is represented. To make such a statement resonate, and do it in a way that sucks you into the story and the movie as an entertainment, shows just how ambitious and successful this film is."
"tnrcooper","8","1","2","22 March 2006"," Good but middling acting
","I was hopeful that Mr. Spielberg would take a stance recognizing the plight of Palestinians, and while not endorsing suicide bombing, understand the circumstances that give rise to it. Again, this is not an endorsement of suicide bombing. It is wrong and harmful and only perpetuates the violence and ensures that more Palestians (and more Israelis...and more Palestinians...and more Israelis....and more Palestinians...and more Israelis) will die. However I was hopeful that, in contrast to many corporate media outlets, that the Palestinain plight, and the political weakness of their position, not to mention their poverty and occupied land, would be recognized by Mr. Spielberg. <br/><br/>I had not wanted to hear what happened in this film so that I could watch it with no expectations (somewhat similarly to how one tries to see a film before reading the book so one doesn't compare it (and usually unfavorably) to the book). Unfortunately I heard or read somewhere that Spielberg did depict the Palestinians at least as wronged people and gave some sense of reality to their plights. I must admit, as the Mossaad operatives went about their business just taking people out at great cost and often with others caught in the crossfire also dying, I wondered at what point (and whether what I'd heard was right) that the operatives might realize that bloody vengeance was so destructive and inefficient. <br/><br/>I must admit, I was not at all impressed by Eric Bana. I think he had about the expressiveness of the shoes that I have on right now. Yeah, he was playing a stoic guy, an everyman type chosen by Mossad specially because he was so everyman looking. But nevertheless, I found that even when it seemed that the continuous retaliatory killings were going on forever, even when you could see that it was taking its toll on him, while he looked somewhat more gaunt, I didn't think he expressed very much at all. Geoffrey Rush (travelling back in time to look like Henry Kissinger?) was as vicious and soulless a government contact as one could imagine. He was truly, it seemed, incapable of expressing any concern or shades of emotion about the plight of his agents or the worthiness of their mission. <br/><br/>As mentioned, it seemed it took a while for the plot to seize one and for the toll of revenge killings to take effect on the men. However I think that Spielberg's approach was fairly successful. I must admit the cloudiness of the motivations of the funders of the revenge hits mystified me. Perhaps the fact that he employed plastic that was stronger than the group had wanted was Spielberg's point-that an open-ended terror mission really can have no positive outcome-but I was a bit puzzled that a man (Avner) who should have known that his was a very nationalistic mission, would trust someone who he knew nothing about, to fund his mission. I'm not sure just who Papa (Michael Lonsdale) could also have been working for. Obviously doing such divisive, controversial work would limit the numbers of parties he could have been working for, but at the same time, if he really believed in Avner's mission, could he really have had so little soul that he would have agreed to fund people who were working in opposition ===to===== Avner? Then again, I guess they were probably that opportunistic. Also, Papa's chat with Avner, the sort of ""don't trust anyone, don't ask too many questions, etc."" seemed amazingly banal and after-school-movie-of-the-week-ish. Also, I questioned Avner's paranoia about Mossad possibly being out to take him out. I guess he might have been paranoid and that might have influenced him but it just seemed that he was extremely irrational. Sure, he knew better than anyone how ruthless Mossad was but that seemed completely nonsensical, no matter what he'd said to Ephrain or how he'd butted into the office of the Israeli embassy. <br/><br/>So overall, a good film, powerful, pretty fair; still, I must admit, for such a big-budget picture, Bana was very unimpressive. I think Spielberg makes his points fairly persuasively though and illustrates with his account of one (important) story, the futility of ""vengeance"". Also, the use of the flashbacks as nightmares for Avner was, I thought, an effective way to show the violence of September 1972 and also reveal how such speculation on Avner's part (what he was doing for Israel) might have haunted him. Additionally, OK, before I jabber on a bit more, I think the commitment of Avner to do anything for Israel was not really indicated because it seemed odd that such an apparently mild guy (even though he had been a premier leader) would be willing to sign off on such an open-ended, ill-defined mission. It is reasonable that he would do this but given the depth of character that we see, it doesn't seem believable that Avner was such an ideologue. Again, this goes back to the limited range of Bana's performance. OK, really, I'm done now."
"asalem182","8","1","2","15 March 2006"," Everyone's Looking for A Place to Call Home
","I had many doubts when I knew Spielberg was making a movie about what happened in the 1972 Munich Olympics. The subject matter is controversial, the middle east conflict is not solved yet, and I felt the project was rushed, as Spielberg began shooting the picture only 6 months before it was released. Anyway, after seeing the film, I'm happy to say that Spielberg has proved me wrong.<br/><br/>Munich tells the story of a secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and kill 11 Palestinians suspected to have planned the Munich attack. The squad is lead by Avner (Eric Bana, in an amazing performance). At first, Avner is excited about the mission, because his bosses and his mother kept telling him he's doing a great thing for Israel. But slowly, he starts losing his sanity (spends his nights looking for bombs under his bed), his friends (3 of his teammates are killed during the mission), his home (he tells his wife to move to Brooklyn so he could see her more), and most importantly, his humanity (during the last assassination, he enjoyed humiliating the victim).<br/><br/>The last assassination in particular was a wake-up call for Avner. He's discovered that he's not only wandering away from the planned mission, as the last 2 people he killed had nothing to do with what happened in Munich, but he also realized that no matter how many Palestinians he kills, these people will be replaced, and in most cases, the replacements are even more violent than the predecessors.<br/><br/>That was one of the few problems I had with the film. I thought someone like Avner, so terrified during the first assassination, that one of his teammates had to pull the trigger instead of him, would start questioning what he's doing earlier than what happened in the picture. In the film, he started doubting his mission after the 8th assassination. Another flaw would be some cheesy scenes. For example, during one part in the movie, the Isreali squad have to share a room with some Jordanian bodyguards. They almost have a fight over what music to play; Arabian or Israeli, anyway, they agree on playing some American jazz, and everyone in the room starts laughing. I know this was supposed to be a metaphor, but I thought it was a bit silly.<br/><br/>These minor flaws aside, the film is fantastic. I really liked Spielberg's portrayal of the Palestinians. They're not the bearded, stupid guys maniacally shouting ""Allah Akbar"" we've seen in tens of movies before. No, Spielberg's Palestinians are lawyers, teachers, poets, and family men. The same can be said about Avner. He's a loving husband who cried when he spoke to his newborn on the phone. Yet, you will fully understand why these supposedly ordinary characters would start killing other people. They're all fighting for a justified reason; All the characters in Munich are looking for a place to call home. I also liked how the film didn't present a solution to the problem, and frankly, there's no solution for the middle east conflict right now. Unfortunately, this circle of violence will keep growing bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the film is very good. I thought it was one of the best films to portray the 70's. From the sets, to the costumes, to the haircuts, even to the grainy picture, everything is pitch perfect. The assassinations were well executed, shocking, and very violent (beware, this is a hard R). And although the film is 160 minutes, I was not bored for one second. John Williams' score is amazing, and I'm not surprised it was nominated for an academy award.<br/><br/>So, I'd recommend Munich. It's Spielberg's prayer for peace, and it's a well made one."
"johnyjoe","9","1","2","14 March 2006"," The best movie of the year.
","Maybe it's the fact I wasn't around when this incident took place, or that I was never even told anything like this took place, but I seem to be one of the few people who thought this movie was a masterpiece, and deserving of Best Picture.<br/><br/>What Spielberg pulled off with this film is a serious and disturbing recreation of a horrible event from, of course, the Jewish perspective, as Spielberg is Jewish himself. That's what really confused me about the controversy around this film. It shouldn't have offended anyone politically in any way. It's a movie... you have to show a side in a movie. Spielberg showed the Jewish side, but didn't justify it for us to be convinced it was the correct way, but rather to show us the state of mind of the people doing these assassinations, and why they thought their acts were justified.<br/><br/>When I went into this movie I was expecting a movie not unlike Schindlers List, and of course I didn't get what I was expecting. What I got was an entirely different kind of movie, but one almost as (if not just as) astounding as Schindlers List.<br/><br/>The length wasn't a problem for me at all, because this movie held my attention through the entire 3+ hours. I don't care how long a film is, as long as I'm entertained the full length I'm content, and thats exactly what this movie did.<br/><br/>But, of course, this movie is not one that will entertain the masses of teens and pre-teens who prefer non-stop action as opposed to a damn good story and slow-but-thoughtful filming. Not that Munich didn't have action. In fact, this movie was one of the most intense, gory, and brutal movies I saw this year, but for every 20 minutes of edge-of-your-seat action there was another 30-40 of plot and substance. This, plus the lack of publicity this movie got (compared to Brokeback, Crash, and a bunch of bad action/horror movies I've already forgotten), not many people are going to see this movie. Also, the snubbing of the Oscars will create the illusion this movie failed to those who judge their movies on how many awards they've won. Sadly, this movie will be forgotten over the ages, and that's a damn shame.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, please, just see it somehow. It's an astounding Spielberg film that will not disappoint.<br/><br/>K.T."

","Steven Spielberg is the King Midas of the movie world. Everything he does is spectacular and even with the films that you may not like (i.e. war of the worlds) there is absolutely no denying the brilliance each film holds.<br/><br/>Munich is no exception to this. The casting was perhaps one of the highlights, as it was almost (though surely unintentionally) reminiscent of a crew from the original series of Mission:Impossible. At this point, allow me to say that by making that point i am not suggesting Munich is tacky or a popcorn film, (besides, the original series of Mission:Impossible will remain a classic), i am simply hinting that it was understandable why the film didn't win a Globe.<br/><br/>However, the film addresses some issues that some people may get the wrong idea of. Most prominent is the Israeli issue. I have read a fair number of reviews and certainly spoken to a fair few people that feel Munich is almost appraising of the terrorist actions. This is not the case. What the film does is highlight the appraisal the terrorists gave their own actions and how they did it (on TV) and how they seemed self-contained and perhaps 'untouchable' from any official prosecution.<br/><br/>This is where Avner Kaufman and his team come in. They are recruited to execute those responsible for the terrorist actions. This is the 'meat' of the story which touches new territory for Spielberg and like i said, he does not disappoint..."
"panasit","10","1","2","12 February 2006"," With such horrifying subject matter as real event terrorism, most people might overlook how beautiful and stylish this movie is.
","I didn't even want to see the movie. It was, believe me, my last choice for a movie to see. The premise certainly wasn't appealing. And I am so much looking forward to seeing Hoodwinked. So... wasn't my choice. BUT... oh man, was I surprised.<br/><br/>I walked in expected to be preached at about revenge and the seriousness of Middle East conflict, and how it will all be so corny and predictable (why not? Catch Me if You Can was). Oh, how I was so wrong.<br/><br/>One big thing, it's exciting and cool. I know terrorism is a grim subject matter and war is not funny, the Munich thing was based on true story and it was horrible. But darn it, I can't describe it in any other way. This movie is so cool. Go blame Steven Spielberg for making it with such style (he didn't do it in any of his last movies, I don't know why he starts now). It's even more artsy than Crouching Tiger. Each killing of the terrorists were as delicate and well crafted as the ones in Godfather's final scene. Add that to various beautiful European cities in the background, it was just pure pleasure to all of my senses.<br/><br/>It's funny how a movie like Crash, which was advertised to be a complex movie with many plots, turns out to be very simple and easy to understand (and it was very good in its own right). Where a movie like Munich, that make you think the plot is so simple, a group of people was asked to kill all the terrorists that was responsible for the Munich massacre, turns out to be so much deeper than... any movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I might sound exaggerated. But I have seen a lot of movie that is trying to do many things in the short amount of time it was given, thus making it feel incomplete or rushed, even after 3 hours (Pirates of Caribbean, King Kong, Capote). Munich didn't hold back. It has tons of story to tell and it will tell it. It went from one scene to another with care. Unlike in King Kong and Capote, if a guy is going to enter a building, you will see him walk into it. Not seeing him sitting in one building in one shot, then immediately the next shot he's doing something else in a park. This movie is so confident with its timing, it went on and on without a hint of hurry. .<br/><br/>Think about this. There are 12 terrorists that the main characters have to kill and only 3 hours to do it (this is a long movie). Walking in, you are probably thinking that at most they will kill 8 or 9. Or they may kill large number of them in sort of a quick montage with orchestral music playing... Nope. Every terrorist killed has a plot line that comes with it. It's like a bunch of short movie. And it just keep going and going and each one is better than the next. Then we have CIA, French intelligence, Russian mafia, and Israel's own people getting involved, but it doesn't feel out of place or pretentious because each time a new plot was introduced, it was done with care. And the characters think about the situation, talk among themselves about it, then react to it. This movie takes its time to tell us its story, and in return, we take our time to think and understand it fully, even during our first viewing Like most kids growing up in the 80's and early 90's, I'm a Steven Spielberg fan. But most of his skill shines by making a movie great with his directing despite its weak or simplistic writing (Raider of the Lost Ark, Hook (actually it's still not good), Jurassic Park, Jaws, ...even up until recently, War of the World, Saving Private Ryan, and Catch Me If You Can). I think this movie, along with The Last Crusade and Schindler's List, Spielberg's skill finally get matched up with a highly skilled writer, and that results in a great movie that will be remember for a very long time.<br/><br/>Munich is so delicate and have so much class, it inspired me to do more with my own art. Crash and Brokeback may be 2005 front runner, but if it is not the best (I'm cheering for both Crash and this one), it is ONE of the best movie of the year. I think, with Godfather and Casablanca and Amadeus in mind, Munich is one of the greatest movie I have ever seen."

"timknight295","8","1","2","2 February 2006"," most disturbing film I've ever seen
","This comment contains spoilers.<br/><br/>This film particularly shocked me with one scene in which three men murder a young woman using single shot projectile devices. I have never been so horrified by a scene and after seeing this movie I have had to remind myself that after all I was only watching actors and special effects technology in order to calm myself. It wasn't the part where blood starts pouring out of the woman's chest before they finally shoot a bullet into her brain that disturbed me but the moment where Steve calmly and gently grasps the woman's shoulder and says in a casual way 'where are you going? wait!' while he is reloading his weapon as she is slowly walking away from them in total shock having been shot by them in the chest. It horrified me to see a man acting so calmly and practically while in the process of killing a young woman. It is a moment in the film which shows a man showing an absolute absence of empathy for another human being. Even though the viewer may assume that Steve is meant to be one of the 'goodies' the relaxed way he handles this assassination can only be described as evil. Avner's handling of the assassination shows a tiniest hint of compassion for his victim when he covers up her body once they have finally killed her, while the other character's behaviour shows he feels vengeance towards her for assassinating his friend. It was also shocking to see her hugging her pet cat after being mortally wounded as this humanised her and me feel painfully empathetic for her character, it made me feel that although she was an assassin by profession underneath her hard exterior she was a sad, lonely young woman who only loved and was given love by her cat. If the men in this scene were carrying standard pistols they could have killed her almost instantly but armed only with single shot devices they fail to kill her on the first attempt and have to go through a lengthy reloading process and this prolongs the assassination and makes the scene so horrifying. I think the reason they are only armed with these devices makes sense in terms of the plot because only these devices could be smuggled by the team into the country where the female assassin lives, but I'm sure that Spielberg had a reason for making this scene so disturbing.<br/><br/>I don't think the scene was gratuitously violent because it shows how horrible gunshot wounds, and, in fact, violent deaths in general really are. there are plenty of highly entertaining films and TV programmes, like 'HEAT' and '24' filled with people getting shot, and they are well made, but they don't make you appreciate how horrifying the combination of bullets and human bodies really is. The whole film, particularly this scene, makes me feel that the film's message is that no one deserves to get shot or blown up, even assassins and terrorists. Assassins and terrorists are still human beings made of flesh and bone with hearts pumping blood through their bodies just like everyone else- and two wrongs don't make a right.<br/><br/>Avner knows by the end of the film that after his actions he can't claim moral superiority over anyone and in a world without morality he is living in a world where 'people are capable of anything'. He realises far too late at the very end of the film that the proper way to deal with the terrorists was to arrest them and gather evidence against them but this is only after he knows that all the men he has murdered will only be replaced by similarly evil characters and that one of his assassinations also resulted in an innocent woman being blinded.<br/><br/>I think the film's message is that vengeance, no matter how sophisticatedly carried out, is always crude, dehumanising, ultimately unfulfilling and always immoral.

","I have now seen all five of the 'best movie' and 'best actor' category movies for the Oscars. It is my belief that Eric Bana should have been at least nominated for a best actor spot, if not actually receive the award. In my opinion, his performance was outstanding. To me, a good actor is able to make you forget you're watching him/her as a person. Russell Crowe's performance in The Insider is a good example of this (I think he should have won for that performance instead of Gladiator). Eric Bana also pulled off the same difficult feat and I applaud him. As much as I respect Phillip Seymour Hoffman as an actor, I don't believe his performance as Truman Capote was much of a stretch for him. His mannerisms as Capote have been reflected in some of his other performances and I was constantly reminded that I was watching Phillip, not a convincing portrayal of Capote. The only challenge for him would be his voice alteration since his natural voice is much deeper than Capote's. I believe that Eric Bana should have been nominated instead of Phillip this time around because I forgot I was watching a pretty boy actor from the movie Troy and was watching a man who wrestled with himself; relishing his vengeance, justifying his actions, and finally realizing the vicious cycle he was perpetuating and acknowledging his betrayal to his own moral standards."

","It's not a usual Steven Spielberg's film; this time, the director that got us used to commercial and sentimental productions, has examined the consequences of Munich Black September with a thought-provoking movie. It is definitely very violent but greatly acted and surely compelling, moreover explores the political situation of that time in a meticulous and thorough way, showing at the same time how Israel operated after those terrorist acts. Perhaps runtime is too long but Munich is not at all the kind of movie that bores the audience, on the contrary it is so gritty and deep that you don't even realize it's getting a bit too long in the final part."
"siliberman","6","1","2","31 January 2006"," A variation on the context of violence with a bit of realpolitik thrown in
","Forgive me if these comments about Munich veer excessively towards the negative, but the movie telling (in fictionalized form) of the reprisals against the Black September murderers of the Israeli athletes in Munich in 1972 is a mixed bag, not all of it appealing.<br/><br/>For instance, if you like seeing macho men being sent on secret missions which involves the killing of eleven men strewn around Europe and New York, the kind of killing today so ubiquitous in thrillers both in the cinema and daily TV, then it may be for you.<br/><br/>If you like such rat-tat-tat violence, remote-controlled telephonic assassinations, targeted detonations and pouring blood and gore, even though there is little cinematically new about it, you'll certainly get pleasure from it too; and particularly if you enjoy a bit of stuntsmanship en passant.<br/><br/>Further, if you are intrigued by political and military cynicism at the highest levels, amoral connivance and the transfer of information for hard cash, and a touch of cat-and-mouse pursuit and counter-pursuit, then sure, it's OK too, but well short of a thriller by, say, a John le Carre. And if you think that you might learn something new about Israeli-Palestinian politics and their respective people's impasse, provided that you are a regular reader of the daily press and watcher of television news, the film has very little, if anything, that you would not have heard before - and that in a handful of very brief exchanges in a movie that runs on to some 165 minutes in all.<br/><br/>Mercifully, Munich does contain a few redeeming human moments in which even brutalized killers are shown to possess scruples and consciences over what they are doing both politically and morally, and to suffer nightmares over their actions and the paranoia of the hunter becoming hunted, and, like the leader of the team, to weep over his separation from wife and child in the service of his mission. distressed about being separated from pregnant wife and newborn child then I guess it might be worth sitting through the movie.<br/><br/>In the light of all this, whether Munich is a ""good"" movie ultimately depends on the eye and taste of the beholder. Technically, it's well made. But, from what I had read about it beforehand and about it being allegedly controversial, I wouldn't have bothered, my major reason for having gone being the wish to see for myself what the supposed controversy over its political content was all about. It appears that the major bone of contention has been the argument as presented by a PLO fighter to an Israeli for a Palestinian state, which thereby appears to posit a kind of parity between the Palestinians' rights to a sovereign state and Israel's right to remain to its homeland as it exists today.<br/><br/>Profound, you may think, and new? Then, by all means, see the movie. You might, for any of the above reasons, actually be induced to see it. But remember one thing here. What you will be seeing is one factual event - the assassination of the eleven-strong Israeli Olympic squad in Munich 1972. The rest is a fictional reconstruction of the retaliation meted out to those responsible for these killings organized by the leaders of the Black September movement, a mission of reprisal which, as one commentator in high places in Israel said, uses a great deal of artistic licence quite out of keeping with procedural reality and normal Israeli governmental and security department protocol.<br/><br/>A long screed this, and, in the end, non-committal. Yes, I know. Let's just say that, on its own terms, as film, it was reasonably absorbing. If gung-ho thrillers appeal to the viewer, this will afford him such pleasure as he may want; the performances reasonably meet the rather narrow dramatic range demanded of the actors; the cinematography is accomplished.<br/><br/>But is it truly good, high grade, prize-winning material? Suffice it to say that one can more profitably spend one's money on more edifying fare."

Daniel Craig is also does a fine job and Geoffrey Rush gives his usual above average performance.<br/><br/>This film is very well made, I have given it 9/10 because the story is good, the performances are great and there are clear messages behind the content of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie does justice to the Munich event and provides insight into the current climate in which terrorism is such a big issue.

"AlienByChoice","10","1","2","30 January 2006"," A movie no one is likely to like
","The reason I gave Munich such a ridiculously high vote is not the acting, nor is it the script or anything else. It is for the guts Steven Spielberg had to make a movie that appeals to no one. It's his personal statement, and as such, the general audience simply is not capable of appreciating it.<br/><br/>The younger audience comes to see the Israeli version of a 1970-s James Bond take care of the bad guys, and leave disappointed, after having slept through most of the movie. Teens beware - IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!<br/><br/>The older audience appreciates the portrayal of the 1970-s, but dislikes the whole issue the movie is about. Most of them do not know enough to even understand the events that take place on the screen.<br/><br/>The Jews and the Arabs don't like it because the movie is not pro-Israeli (it really isn't), neither is it pro-Palestinian (it really isn't). Furthermore, as they are directly involved in the conflict, they know the facts and have long since formed an opinion, hence Munich is of no use to them.<br/><br/>The only people to fully appreciate it are the few who know the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, can understand a bit of Arabic and Hebrew, have cultural awareness and yet have not taken sides in the conflict. I doubt there are more than a few thousand of such people in the whole world.<br/><br/>Therefore, this movie is a tremendous achievement. A bit of advice though - if you decide to watch it, do some reading first. Read about the events, read about the conflict. And as you enter the theater, leave all your opinions behind - bring nothing but pure knowledge with you."
"Pavel-8","7","1","2","25 January 2006"," Good, but a missed opportunity
","Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is a return to the director's serious nature. Although the spy thriller subject matter is closer to ""Minority Report"" than ""Schindler's List"", the tone is far more like ""Saving Private Ryan"" than ""War of the Worlds"", an interesting dichotomy that both aids and abets the film.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is inspired by true events that occurred after 1972 Olympics tragedy in the titular city. After several Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by Palestinian terrorists, the Israeli government recruits five men to exact revenge (read: assassinate) upon those who initiated the kidnapping. The movie concentrates on the drama of quintet's actions and transformations as they undertake their collective task, viewing like a taut thriller, but featuring more development among both characters and plot.<br/><br/>Where ""Munich"" diverges from typical espionage movies is also where it predominantly excels. The reality of everything distances this film from even good genre flicks like ""The Bourne Identity"", not necessarily in quality but in nature, because the fully realized actions and consequences of ""Munich"" create an entirely different, more genuine world. The main characters, acted to a tee, all face moral dilemmas, evolving wonderfully through the quieter in-between scenes and more impressively during the more intense portions. Likewise the pace eschews the typically breakneck, impulsive speed at which most such films flow, opting instead for a deliberate approach that accelerates when necessary, making those moments all the more gripping. But the handful of pin-you-to-your-seat scenes are not enough to carry the entire film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a remarkable storyteller, a fact reinforced by manner in which he balances the action and character, continually bouncing between assassination attempts and dialogue-heavy development scenes. At times though this unevenness, accented by two discordant scenes, robs the film of a driving sense of urgency, leaving one with the feeling that it coulda/woulda/shoulda been better. One of those scenes, involving revenge, is shocking and discomforting, but at least effectively makes its contrasting point. The other, one of the closing scenes, is flat awkward, an ill fit both chronologically and emotionally. So out-of-place are these two moments that they nearly overshadow two hours of impressive drama.<br/><br/>Of course, this is nearly a three hour film, but would have fared better had it been trimmed down or at least reorganized. The decision to reenact the events of ""Munich"" was not a bad one, and it provides some of the movies most lasting images with classic archive footage and the reproduction of known moments from alternate angles. But intercutting these scenes over the course of the film interrupts the flow, particularly since the flashbacks are portrayed through the thoughts of a character who wasn't even there.<br/><br/>Despite the uniqueness, the film never kicks things to the next level. ""Munich"" is always interesting, but rarely captivating, thanks to some combination of factors. Maybe the minimal amount of music retards the drama. Maybe the tone of the heavy subject matter isn't conducive to Spielberg's style of story-telling. Perhaps though, more than anything, one can't help but think like the main character, wondering what the point is and where everything is going. Big and difficult questions are asked, which is commendable. These are emotions and choices that are notably similar to those felt and made in today's post-9/11 world, making Munich a still pertinent film that has the chance to be immensely powerful. But the answers provided are either non-existent or too simple, leaving the viewer feeling cold.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Still good, occasionally brilliant, but ultimately less than it could have been. 7 of 10, recommended only if you're interested."
"caleb1883","9","1","2","17 January 2006"," This is a great movie about the emotions involved in the aftermath of the attacks, but lacks historical facts
","This movie is done in the vein of the countless other historical epics that Spielberg has directed, and will move anyone who sees it. While it is based on true life events, it appears as though it is mainly directed toward connecting the events in the film to our modern day struggle with terrorism, rather than simply stating the facts. Largely unknown to most of the ""Munich"" audience, another movie was made for TV based on the same novel by George Jonas almost exactly twenty years ago called, ""The Sword of Gideon."" I watched this movie about two years ago, and while it doesn't convey as much emotion as ""Munich"" (i.e. lower budget and non-inventive camera work), it does cover a larger time-line with many more facts. There tends to be definite political statement made in ""Munich"", and therefore I would recommend seeing both movies to get the big picture. If at all possible, watch the ""Sword of Gideon"" first to get a more historical background, and then watch ""Munich"". If you just watched ""Munich"", and are wondering what happened to Avner beyond where the movie leaves off, watch ""Sword of Gideon""."
"Jonny_Numb","8","1","2","15 January 2006"," murky morality, powerful execution
","""Munich"" is a pseudo-docu-thriller that is brilliantly stylized and performed, with a rollicking pace that makes its near-three-hour run time pass with surprising efficiency. While this dramatization of the events that followed the massacre of 11 athletes at the 1972 Olympics at Munich is, at heart, rather basic revenge fodder, and its message of ""Who are the REAL terrorists?"" is less than profound, Steven Spielberg makes every moment count. Eric Bana is an Israeli leading an innocuous team of everyman 'experts' (one skilled in bookkeeping; another in explosives, etc.) across Europe to search out and kill the masterminds behind the Munich massacre. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the issue at hand is NOT the 'bad men,' but the principle of violence/vengeance itself, and the effects it has on the morality of the individual; Spielberg uses flashbacks of the actual Munich crimes as a simple method of iterating this. The group of men exhibit a heartfelt rapport on par with the company in ""Saving Private Ryan""; the violence is handled in a similar way, with gritty choreography and cringe-inducing sound effects that drive the feeling home. Of all the films that have come out in the wake of 9/11, ""Munich"" might be the most attuned to our current attitudes and mentalities, while giving us a fittingly ambiguous answer to the question of violence itself.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

It haunted me for the rest of the afternoon after I left the theater and it is still leaving a huge impression on me.<br/><br/>Eric Bana's heavily emotional Israeli drives the movie, but of course there is excellent help from the supporting cast with the likes of Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush. It is beautifully shot: the action scenes will have your heart racing in each one, guaranteed.<br/><br/>John Williams also delivers again, creating a haunting, memorable score that is just one of the many ingredients that makes this a classic.<br/><br/>In conclusion, though this film can be quite violent and y at times, it is a must see for those are old enough to see it. I am an 18 year old high school senior, and this film changed my life. I would suggest for everyone, no matter what your beliefs. In my opinion, Munich should be the film to take Best Picture this year."

","I have just seen the new movie ""Munich"" and found it very interesting. However, as I watched, I recognized scenes I'd seen in another film many years before. After doing some research, I see that ""Munich"" is not the only film depicting these events. I think the writing in a previous film was a little better, but ""Munich"" is definitely worth seeing. Perhaps other films should be seen as well before judging any of them unless the viewer is only interested in entertainment. The messages of both films are difficult to determine, but they are both very entertaining. ""Munich"" is based on a novel and viewers would be wise to keep in mind that these films are not documentaries. Much more independent research should be done on the subject if the actual history is of interest."

It's great that he is trying to get people to see things in a different light but it just seemed to be too long, which hurt the film the most. It was hard for me to understand what was going on as well, due to the fact that I know nothing of the matter before watching this film. Going in all I knew was about some event that happened at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The film shows what happened on that day and the days that would follow.

Cinematography: 10 out of 10, Music: 10 out of 10 !<br/><br/>My main criticism relates to the abundance of unrealistic plot holes throughout the film (especially taking into account that this is a docudrama!!! )<br/><br/>1) After Louis Dad revealed to Avner that they strictly DO NOT sell secret info to governments. Avner went ahead with his group 'and his bought info' without any concern. Even after running into the Arabs in Athens in the safehouse -which I understood as clearly arranged by Louis and company(no?) ...and then a week later Louis and Dad once again make a definite reiteration to the gang that they are clearly being hunted by the Arabs ...yet somehow Avner and crew need another 6 months to figure that out?????<br/><br/>2) Why on earth would Avner and crew put all their trust in their entire search for the 'Munich' Arabs in Louis' hands in the first place? Don't they have ANY other means? <br/><br/>3) the 'sensitive' peaceful demeanor portrayed by the Israeli gang was from the beginning completely unrealistic. These guys are terrorists too, ya know, HELLO!! Terrorists are violent motherf**kers, period.<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>In addition, I felt that the last paragraph (at film's end) had the opportunity of giving the film closure. Sadly, Spielberg left us with a short blurb about how the rest of the 'Munich' Arabs were killed off, whom at his point I had almost completely forgotten about! I mean ...What about Avner ? Where did HE end up?<br/><br/>Perhaps in short form I would state the following: Great concept, amazing actors (Eric Bana), beautiful cinematography, beautiful music ! Somehow 3/4 along the way things get tedious and muddled . Eventually leaving us all quite confused... Help!"

","Spielberg should not get away with this mindless violence. There is virtually no character development at all. The plot in it's entirety is known within the first 5 minutes of the film. Consequently you can easily leave your seat 3 or 4 times to get popcorn, drink or use the facilities and return having missed nothing at all. For all who loved the flying limbs of Private Ryan, there is more here for your delight. Yes we do have imaginations and we did not come to see FX.

"docbonkerz","6","3","12","28 December 2005"," Give your viewers some credit, Steve.
","I'll cut right to the chase here. This movie is, among other things, a shameless effort on Mr. Spielberg's part to cast Israelis in a positive light. He was clearly trying to send the message that Israelis kill sparingly, judiciously, and grudgingly. Anyone with a television should know that this is not the truth. I have always respected Spielberg for directing films that were believable as well as meaningful. In that respect, this was by far his poorest work.<br/><br/>I was particularly annoyed with the scene where the Israeli assassins made great effort to avoid killing the young daughter of one of their targets. Most of us have seen many news reports (even in the American media) of Israeli helicopters and fighter jets launching missiles into crowded Palestinian streets to assassinate a single man riding in a car, and we're supposed to believe that Israeli assassins gave two shits about one little Arab girl? The Israelis are notorious for their liberal and undiscriminating use of lethal force. Come on, Steve. Give your viewers some credit.<br/><br/>I did, however, very much appreciate the story's allusion to the fact that all the tit-for-tat fighting builds paranoia on both parts and only serves to escalate the violence. Additionally (and although I'm sure it falls on deaf ears in the White House) I thought the reference to the fact that killing one ""terrorist"" will only result in many more taking his place was highly appropriate.<br/><br/>Underlying messages aside, I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Although a bit slow and repetitive, the cast was well picked and acting was very believable. Eric Bana turned out to be an excellent choice for his role, which was surprising considering his embarrassing role of Hector in ""Troy""."

","As usual in Hollywood movies, ignoring decades of oppression of the Palestinians by Israelis, depict the Arabs (Palestinians) as mere terrorists, savages whose only way of life is to kill Jews. I am an atheist (ex-muslim), I don't hate Jews just like I don't hate Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus. In fact, I hate religion and I detest terrorism and violence in any form (physical or emotional),  and firmly believe that violence is never a solution. But when it comes to the Palestinians, decades of suicide bombings, assassination missions, kidnapping of Israelis for prisoner swap, killing, torturing etc, I can hardly blame them, they are reluctantly goaded to this horrible life style. This is not a way of life, nobody wants to live like this, but when someone loses his home, his land, his freedom, his life  basic human rights trampled on with tank treads, morals will wither and disappear and blind hatred and violence will arise.<br/><br/> No western movie has ever depicted the Palestinian oppression by Israelis, how they destroy their homes, their farms, their properties, killing their sons or whoever resists, desecrating their beliefs, plundering their land with their expanding colonies  the list goes on. But the Media always show the Arabs as attacking and the Israelis as defending, never the other way around. No one on earth (including the Arabs) condones what the Palestinian militants did in Munich, it's appalling and inhumane but has anyone ever thought why they did what they did? Those young Palestinians must have had families, children, friends, life . Like other people on earth they must had their own dreams, prospects , why would they do this!!! Can anyone Imagine the pressure pushing them toward this kind of violence, this desperation to embark on mission impossible (kidnap the Israeli Olympic team to swap them for Palestinian prisoners) knowing they don't stand a chance? that no one is gonna let them take those hostages no matter what?<br/><br/>I'm an Arab but I hate the Arab culture, their obscurantist traditions and customs, their stagnant civilization and most importantly their predominant and violent religion: Islam. I know the influence of Islam on violence (especially in the middle east), a religion whose more than half of its scripture dedicated to hatred and killing of other people ""infidels"", a religion that honors terrorism and deem it the ultimate good that leads to heaven. Muslim people have become terrorists, not only because their religion tells them so, but also because the west have always had their hands in the middle east, undermining the stability of the region and the sovereignty of its countries under the guise of democracy and freedom, mostly to make sure the OIL stays under their control, and probably some other strategic purposes. As for the Palestinians, they not only had their share of foreign intrusions, they had their land taken.<br/><br/> The movie was biased and one-sided, it was not entertaining, and the message it delivered was wrong. I feel sad to see such hatred from both sides, and even sadder that the rest of the world does almost nothing to stop the atrocities committed and endeavor for peace between the two sides, instead they take sides with the oppressors, it's a shame. We are all human beings, we all have 46 chromosomes in each cell of our bodies, we all laugh when we are happy and we all cry when we are sad ... but it seems that the silly differences between us that we human beings created by default will always tear us apart no matter how high our thinking become and in spite of all the biological evolution breakthroughs that eventually led to our existence, we are higher animals, yet interestingly we are the only species on this planet where members kill or mutilate each other, simply for joy !<br/><br/>what a doomed review, neither of the two sides are gonna like it, I bet not even the moderate and open minded of them, but then again, who cares... <br/><br/>nobody likes the sordid truth? ... <br/><br/>sooo what?"

","this is what I liked about this movie: the exploration of the ambiguous nature of revenge; the committed actors; the way the ""targets"" were often humanized with dialogue and character detail; the fine photography; the historical research, the international sets; the mostly appropriate music; and the perfect costumes and hair design by Joanna Johnston and the extensive makeup team, which anchor the film squarely in the 70's.<br/><br/>this is what I didn't like about the movie: the unnecessary gore, which in my opinion actually distracted from the emotional impact of the events described; the weird use of women's bodies (more on that below); the frequent moments when the dialogue veered into ""everything-is-an-oblique-metaphor"" land; and the plot elements that were unconvincing (these were not minor; more on that below, too).<br/><br/>I don't think I'm really giving spoilers below--I tried to word the descriptions very generally- -but if you don't want to know anything about the action of the film, stop reading here.<br/><br/>it was annoying that, when a female character is killed, the actress has to go out of her way to show her naked body to the camera for as long as possible, even to the point of creating a goof--the robe is covering her nether parts when she sits down, and suddenly not covering them when the camera pulls back. I found the scene where a character flashes back to violent scenes while having sex--leading to lengthy cuts between ""sex"" and ""death""--both irritating and unoriginal (I saw an extremely similar scene in an episode of ""Miami Vice"" that Don Johnson directed).<br/><br/>As for the unconvincing parts of the plot: I wish the story had focused a bit more on the actual ways the agents might have found their targets, rather than having them rely so much on a mysterious mastermind who has apparently unlimited knowledge of everyone in the world. I really don't think that's the way it happened.<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed by the film--it had a lot of things to like, but I really didn't care for the way this story was told. I think Steven Spielberg has a large sadistic streak, which causes him to make his viewers suffer through as much slow-motion gore as possible, and IMHO, it's not helping him make his points. I think a few of the violent shots were necessary to show what really happened, but when it comes to lingering over them, all that makes me do is think about squibs. I got much more emotional impact from the scene where a character cries, than from the scene where a character slowly bleeds to death, and the brilliantly re-created view of the Munich terrorist on a balcony was much more chilling than the close-up view of someone getting shot in the mouth."

Truthfully, I was pretty much lost throughout the film. I sat there wondering what is going on. The scenes move too quickly and jumped around several locations all around the world in a period of time too short, adding to the confusion. It did feel like an intelligent thriller, but the plot was way to complex for me to comprehend half of what the characters were trying to say.<br/><br/>On the lighter side, I loved the locations the film was holding which had the genuine retro theme in Old world landscapes. The explosions were done very well too, not to mention the great acting from Bana and Rush.<br/><br/>Perhaps I did not possess the intellect to appreciate this film, but this is certainly not Spielberg's work I've imagined to be, not to mention touching on a very sensitive issue.

I was never quite sure if it was trying to tell a real story about real people or not. The acting was generally very good, but the whole thing was confusing from the start, and overly long. I was not impressed by any of the set scenes,somehow it never quite got into gear.

","Spielberg loves to show violence - be it with a knife, a gun, or using sex to depict violence in the body, mind or spirit. There is usually this twisted edge to his films, I include Schindler's List in this for sure...but Munich is a very bizarre film. I am not sure what Spielberg was trying to do with the film. Having lived in Israel during the Munich massacre, I was very aware of Israeli culture, language, behavior and most of the scenes that take place in Israel are just very poor in portraying the Israeli world. It may seem incidental, but to use 'Yiddish' phrasing rather than Hebrew phrasing was truly annoying. Eric Bana is miscast. Sorry everyone, he just is not believable as a young Israeli Mossad agent. The rest of the Israeli Mossad team - well they too just don't give me the feeling that I am watching Israelis. And from there the film goes down hill for me. Spielberg lost me within the first 5 minutes. <br/><br/>I could write a scene by scene criticism of the film, but I have to be honest, the film is boring. 1972 was a very interesting year on the planet. I never felt like I was in the year 1972. Add to that, Spielberg and the script, does not give me enough insight into Black September - he doesn't give me their motivation for the massacre. <br/><br/>I have to say that in comparison, the film, THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL which also explores the world of terrorism and the Israeli Mossad was a very good, solid, informative, on the edge of the seat film. I wish Spielberg would stop being mediocre and give us something we can really get our teeth into."
"mrcaw1","6","2","7","1 September 2006"," Major Disappointment
","This COULD have been a good film IF the director had been disciplined enough to decide on just what kind of film genre he wanted to make and then stuck to it.<br/><br/>Instead Spielberg goes from action/adventure to caper to political thriller to drama all the while throwing in some not so subtle propaganda.<br/><br/>No wonder the movie was almost three hours long! The film would have worked so much better if Spielberg had condensed some of the killings into one montage. Not JUST because the movie would have been shorter but because the montage would have emphasized, cinematically, the fact that the killings were starting to get out of control and become blurred...instead of just showing the same basic scene over and over again.<br/><br/>Spielberg needs to look at some of Francis Coppola's films to get a lesson in what a good montage scene can do for a film.<br/><br/>The other thing that really bothered me about the film is when a director manipulates the audience into thinking that he's somehow above the fray of politics and that the film being shown is somehow morally on a higher ground. It especially bothers me when the film in question, winds up being very politically pointed, though the director would be loathe to admit it.<br/><br/>And I'm not arguing whether I agreed or disagreed with the politics in the movie. What I'm saying is that there ARE political sides taken, though perhaps not the obvious ones demonstrated by the characters in the movie, but still, political views, by the director were espoused. So if that's the case, at least be straightforward about it instead of manipulating me and and further publicly stating that the movie was above ""politics"".<br/><br/>Case in point: The movie ends when two characters in an outside location in the NY Metropolitan area walk away from each other and the viewer is left with a shot of the skyline of NY City.<br/><br/>You guessed it...The twin towers of the World Trade Center are the most noticeable reference point in the shot. Hardly a coincidence in a three hour movie dealing with terrorism.<br/><br/>Obviously Spielberg was again, stating his political agenda loud and clear. Which is fine, but the movie, like its director, refuses to accept ownership of its own beliefs.<br/><br/>And on a more personal note, I thought one of the later scenes inter-cutting Bana having intercourse with his wife while yet another terrorist attack was being perpetrated was not moving...it was just gross.<br/><br/>Again, Mr. Spielberg should watch some of Mr. Coppola's films to see how ""GOOD"" montages are done.<br/><br/>I do want to say though, that Eric Bana is a strong leading man who has a lot of charisma. He should have a long career ahead of him."
"dromasca","5","2","7","24 June 2006"," a low for Spielberg
","I love Spielberg and much of his work. I first loved 'Duel' a minimalistic piece of horror in the early 70s, then he created a genre in 'Jaws', and he brought charm and sensibility in the alien stories in 'E.T.' and 'Encounter'. Later he tried to broaden his themes with 'Schindler's List' and 'Ryan' which were not masterpieces, because of the limits of Hollywood cinema approach, but yet were good films. I am afraid 'Munich' is a low.<br/><br/>The Israeli TV made a few series about the life and moral dilemmas of Israelis that have to fight terrorism and defend their country by using non-conventional means. I am sorry to say, but these movies realized from the Israeli perspective with tools of tele-novellas are better and more true than this movie. Moreover, a bunch of Palestinian and Israeli movies recently were much better in catching the roots of the Middle East conflict and the psychology of its players.<br/><br/>Much was written about the lack of authenticity in 'Munich' in re-creating the Israeli and Palestinian characters, or the numerous location mistakes. I was not that much disturbed about these aspects, but much more concerned about the lack of artistic truth. Palestinian and Isralis in the film behave in schematic way, they are represented through the stereotype view of a person remote to the conflict. The moral dilemma facing the Mossad agents is falsely represented and badly timed. The dialog in in Athens between the Israeli and the PLO agents which could have been a rare opportunity of truth is missed completely and turned into some kind of TV-like debate. At best the film looks like a routine international thriller, at worst it is close to the ridicule, when it tries to fake 'deepness' in rendering the nightmare of the terrorist acts in badly staged black&white flashbacks, or the sex scenes which try to be maybe some way for the main character to consume his anger or doubts, but look just grotesque.<br/><br/>I hope Spielberg will overcome this low in his career, and get back to themes that he has better chances to understand or he dedicates more time and passion to really understand the issues at stake. Frankly, I miss a good dinosaurs movie."

","My wife said this was too important an event to make into such a poor movie. But:<br/><br/>If your idea of a good movie is limited to gory special effects, chases, mumbling talk, arty photography, then leave your mind at the door and enjoy this movie. But,<br/><br/>If you want a movie that tells an important story in a logical manner, portraying an easy to follow course of events, then this is not your movie. These events happened more than 30 years ago and this overly long movie would be hard too follow even if a viewer had a good knowledge of those events. And,<br/><br/>If you want a history lesson which portrays the difference between good and evil then this is absolutely not your movie. This is political correctness run amuck.<br/><br/>Munich is Steven Spielberg's version of the story of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by 11 Palestinians at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the secret hit squad of Israelis who were assigned to track down and kill the Palestinians. In the movie a couple Palestinians give a brief discourse about the land taken from them and given to Jews to form Israel as the reason for their actions. The implication is that all points of view are equal and the Palestinians actions are justified, i.e., forget history.<br/><br/>Possibly Spielberg forgot some things since he made Shindler's List and Survivors of the Holocaust, i.e., Hitler and the Nazis murdered 6 million Jewish men, women, and children; the Palestinians bomb shops, pizza parlors, etc. and want to eliminate Israel; Iran is developing the A-bomb. Gathering Jews from all over Europe during WWII and putting them on trains for transport to Treblinka to be gassed was time consuming whereas a few A- bombs dropped on the nearly 6 million conveniently gathered Jews in Israel is all that is needed and is the goal of today's Hitlers.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie the Israeli who headed the hit squad is very disturbed over killing 5 of the Palestinians and questions if his actions are murder. This is bizarre. What is Spielberg's purpose in asking such a question? Aren't the athlete killers and those who bomb pizza parlors and the Hitlers and the others who want to kill all Jews - men, women, and children - the murderers?<br/><br/>This movie is demeaning to the Israelis who fight and sacrifice their lives to protect Israel and equates them with the murderers who indiscriminately kill women and children, disturbing in that there was no public outcry over this history twisting film, and appalling because history void minds nominated Munich for Best Picture and Best Director. <br/><br/>Elie Wiesel is correct - Apathy is the greatest sin."

Then Avner feeling awful, doubting himself and trusting nobody just didn't fit in with his profile. Then Ephraim was pathetic the whole movie and the script had some very poor, and logically unbalanced lines. <br/><br/>Anyway there is a lot to tell but i never liked long reviews.. <br/><br/>So.. if you wanna watch a movie that tells things how they were you got the wrong movie. if you want one that talks about how bad it is being a killer and what it could do to your life you got the right one.. and still i think they did a poor job at showing that.<br/><br/>PS This movie is 2005 right?

"cflpeace","10","2","7","2 January 2006"," This is an important, courageous, and powerful film.
","Three adjectives come to me in describing the film I saw last night: important, courageous, and powerful.<br/><br/>I consider it to be among the most important films -- and certainly the most important of Spielberg's -- because it has us look at one historical event in order to understand a crucial parallel reality: namely the direction our nation is going in places like Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. When Avner asked if Israel was actually going after the Palestinian leadership as opposed to the terrorist leadership, he asked what we all need to ask: is the U.S. government's ""response"" to 9-11 -- bombing the people of Afghanistan, bombing and occupying Iraq, threatening Syria -- actually an attempt to stop resistance movements to U.S. imperialism as opposed to stopping terrorism?<br/><br/>And the whole film asks us to reevaluate violence in ""response"" to terrorism: whether it's the U.S. government's support of Israeli terrorism in Palestine or its own terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, we need to ask Avner's questions about whether violence solves anything -- whether or not we understand that our government is simply using 9-11 as an excuse to carry out a pre-developed plan to take control of the region for their corporate agenda.<br/><br/>The fact that our government is stirring up these tensions in a region where three governments (including Israel's) are nuclear-armed and hate each other makes this film even more important to the survival of the planet.<br/><br/>Secondly, I consider this, by far, Spielberg's most courageous film. It's always important to make films that expose racism (Amistad) and anti-Semitism (Schindler's List), but those are pretty safe topics. But to question Israel, even letting Palestinians voice their anguish at the occupation? In a world where non- Jews who do so are branded ""anti-Semitic"" (really ironic since Arabs are also Semitic) and Jews who do so are called ""self-hating,"" this takes guts -- even if you are Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Now, I've read angry critiques of the film for not going into the horrendous attacks of Israel on Palestinians before and after Munich, as well as of the film's portrayal of remorse in their agents while the reality is that Israeli soldiers do often kill children with impunity. While justified, these critiques don't take into consideration that the film does go as far as it does, and in the political climate that we have. The film does, after all, have an Israeli character ask something like, ""How do you think we got our homeland? By being nice?""<br/><br/>Finally, I believe this is Spielberg's most powerful film, simply because he's so skilled at doing what he sets out to do with issues that are so important. I have long thought that he is an extraordinarily powerful person; after all he can get strong men and women to ache and even cry over a character played by a thing made in his prop department or over an African American woman entering into a lesbian relationship. I've long asked, ""What if Spielberg were to ever take on a truly controversial and important subject, like challenging Zionism, imperialism, or war?"" I believe he's begun to rise to the occasion with this film.<br/><br/>I wish I could personally encourage him to do so more. There are so many other subjects he could take up: the refuseniks (the courageous Israeli soldiers who, in growing number, are refusing to fight in occupied Palestine), or Mordechai Venunu (the Israeli imprisoned for revealing that his government was secretly building nuclear arms), or Palestinians and Jews who are today participating in nonviolent actions against the occupation, or even stories of Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews whose friendships were shattered by the forming of Israel in 1948.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Spielberg. May you continue on this path of exercising your immense power for the lifting of humanity."

","If Israel was really full of weak minded, left-leaning, incompetent pseudo-Intellectuals than Israel would not exist today. Let alone would they assign members of this mind set to an elite Mossad hit squad.<br/><br/>From this movie we are supposed to believe Mossad is so incompetent they use an inexperienced team leader, a bomb maker who has no experience building bombs and a clean up man who questions so many things that it is completely implausible he would be doing this sort of work. Insulting to say the least! While the real Mossad agents spoke openly saying they had no regrets and the film is completely and factually untrue.<br/><br/>First of all I suggest everyone read up on the REAL history of Israel before you watch this Propaganda film: <br/><br/>Google ""Israel (05/06)""<br/><br/>Spielberg irresponsibly has supposedly elite Mossad agents constantly questioning the evidence behind the terrorists they are assigned to kill but freely lets the terrorists spew their propaganda without it ever once being questioned, debated or a single fact shown to prove their absurd claims. This happens over and over in the movie as he attempts to ""humanize"" people who will kill woman and children civilians for their ""cause"", yet Israel is criticized for killing the killers? Spielberg not only demonstrates his complete lack of knowledge on the subject but deliberately misleads the audience to further his political agenda. No one has ANY right to take a factual event and turn it into a propaganda work of fiction like this.<br/><br/>Then of course the incompetent Mossad team foul up three separate bombing assassinations due to their incompetent bomb maker, the wise clean up man falls for a blatantly obvious beautiful assassin, and the courageous and wise forger commits suicide out of ""guilt"". Oh please, Spielberg you are a fool or does he think we are?<br/><br/>A very good in-depth review:<br/><br/>Google ""'Munich,' the Travesty""<br/><br/>And for those interested in the real cause of the problems between Israel and the Arabs:<br/><br/>Google ""Walid Shoebat - Former PLO Terrorist who speaks out for Israel"""

","...of what I'm sure is a good adaptation of events that occurred specifically after this horrific event. So in that sense, I'm sure our famous director deserves praise for his efforts in bringing ""Munich"" all together in realistic fashion and with no ""embroidery"" to it's content. I just found there was not enough dramatics, suspense or excitement in the aftermath plan, to hold me in my seat with anticipation of things to come. The men involved certainly wern't technical marvels nor did they appear overly confident in following through their mission..all which lost the spark for me in recreating the events. I guess one goes in to these pictures thinking the way Hollywood makes spy and intrigue movies with all it's special effects, huge dramatic action sequences twists and turns etc. etc. You won't find a lot of this in Munich...nor probably should you. It's an interpretation of events that took place after wards..and I'm sure this is realistically how it was. Just don't go in to the movie expecting a ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Mission Impossible III"". You'll be quite disappointed. If it moved a bit quicker and, was 30 - 40 minutes shorter, I'd of given it a higher score than 5."

","In the interests of making it appropriate, I should probably make this review go on for ages and include a lot of heavily accented muttering and be really obvious in what I am trying to communicate with little by way of anything novel or new in there. At the same time, I should probably have a strong central effort to it, and make the whole thing look pretty. And that, pretty much, would be a fair summation of this mixed-bag from Spielberg. The subject matter was interesting and could have been substantially more thought provoking than it was. Eric Bana was good throughout, but the surrounding cast seemed a little muddled, and whilst the attempt to show a fluid morality was praiseworthy, the end result was just a bit flat and cold. Additionally, a good 30 minutes could probably have been lost without harming the end product. On reflection, I seem to have given the film a bit of a kicking, but that is probably just mainly down to disappointment, as it promised but did not deliver."

","Spielberg's latest film tries to demonstrate the futility of an endless cycle of death between Israelis and Palestinians. He belabors the point (literally) to death. While some would see this film as putting Palestinian terrorists and Israeli mossad agents on par, both equal messengers of violent death, I see it in a different light.<br/><br/>In the film, Israeli agents are wracked with guilt, afraid of, and eventually, losing their soul. Palestinian terrorists, on the other hand, don't seem to have any moral dilemma; They want to kill Jews, and have no compunctions at all about doing it.<br/><br/>For some reason, perhaps his Jewish roots, Spielberg tries to present both sides of the issue, failing miserably. He is completely confused between legitimate Palestinian claims for a state of their own, and the methods they use. There is no excuse for terror, ever. Whats next, a sensitive expose of the tortured soul of Osama Bin Laden? A musical about the Bader-Meinhof gang? As an Israeli, I have come face to face with terrorism, and it's not a pretty sight. Your average Palestinian terrorist is not a sophisticated man of the world; He is a fanatic who wants to kill you. And as the bible says: ""He who comes to kill you, kill him first"".<br/><br/>Thats the message I wanted to see."

","Munich (2005) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's brilliant film telling the story of what happened after the 1972 Olympics is a sad, depressing and incredibly violent film that hopefully people will go see. I know there's all sorts of controversy already surrounding this film and while I do think the film favors the Israeli's there's no doubt its message hits right at home without being preaching and without Spielberg adding a B.S. happy ending like he's done throughout his career. Spielberg is being very brave here in how he tackles the revenge subject and especially in the way he shows the violence. Again, had this not been Spielberg the film probably would have gotten a NC-17 rating because of the gore and violence but not once is it shown in a stylish way or in a way trying to make it look like a good thing. The film starts off depressing and Spielberg keeps it that way all the way till the ending. The performances by the entire cast are wonderful and the film hits on all levels. A crowning achievement for Spielberg, which is a lot better than Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. My father loved this one as well."

Even if they didn't expect the ""documentries"" to be composed of falsehoods.<br/><br/>Spielberg's brilliance was in creating a new hybrid ""Historical Fiction"" category, thus putting his audience to sleep, thinking they were watching actual true events.<br/><br/>This was smart because: He could therefore focus on the murderers as victims, humanizing them. (Not bothering to show the murdered athletes until the movie was over).<br/><br/>He could create a fictional ""self-doubt"" imposed on the Israeli hit men, where none actually existed.<br/><br/>Look for him to clean up at the Oscars as the self hating Jewish community rallies around this commercial failure of epic proportions."

Although not as horrible as Ron Howard whose sugary pap and inability to restrain himself, and whose goody morality is really awful, Spielberg has become a ham-handed movie-maker who makes a point, and then with contempt for even the general audience, makes it over again to make sure they got it. If ever anybody is riding on his reputation it his guy. The movie fails even on the basic thriller level, the background of the agents is shallow, and though many boring minutes are spent doing nothing, explaining the reasons why these agents do what they do is lacking. That the main protagonist would be sent by the toughest agency in the free world to do what he is s ent to do is ridiculous. A really fake Hollywood agent. I can say do not see this fim except by rental at home--this doesn't even rise to the level of a good t.v. movie.

"ddangtruong23","7","1","3","25 January 2015"," A terrific tale that exceeds normal expectations
","'Munich' is not really a movie about Israel vs Palestine, nor it is about right vs wrong, but it is, in fact, a movie about human beings in the conflict between humanity and loyalty. <br/><br/>Steering clear from all stereotypes and expectations, this movie soon shows that it doesn't take any side as it is neither pro-Semitism nor anti-Arabs. The main characters are never seen as heroes, and you will find yourself questioning many choices they make, while their enemies, including the terrorists, are presented with small but amazingly effective details to show their humanity and their struggle, all of which force us to take a step back, and reconsider our prejudices. I especially like the part where one Munich terrorist tells his hostages to calm down and that they will soon get released. Although that doesn't come true as the rescue effort forces them to retaliate, it still shows us that those people are also humans, but were put into the wrong environment and situation, just like the main character himself. <br/><br/>Another great aspect is certainly the characterization. This movie has so many impressive supporting characters, many of which only appear for a few minutes but are still able to leave big impacts on viewers' minds. Characters like Carl (Ciarán Hinds), Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), and Papa (Michael Lonsdale) are perfectly cast, and so well-portrayed.<br/><br/>But then, 'Munich', unfortunately, still lacks so much to achieve the masterpiece status. Firstly, many scenes, including the ones that are supposed to be thrilling, seem so slow and dragged-out, which make them very anti-climactic. With the runtime of nearly 3 hours, the movie definitely should have been more tightly edited. Secondly, some scenes, such as the death scenes and the sex scene near the beginning, feel very awkward due to bad acting from the extras, and bad camera work. Sometimes I just can't believe I'm watching a movie made by the same man that directed 'Indiana Jones' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. And finally, I'm not really convinced by Eric Bana's performance. The actor is usually effective in other movies, but in this one, he seems quite bland, especially when put next to all those fantastic supporting actors. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Munich' is a very admirable effort by Steven Spielberg. It has so much depth, and it broke away from many traditions. However, it still could have been much better, had he not rushed the production so much."
"pfgpowell-1","7","1","3","30 April 2010"," Admirably evenhanded, but ...
","The film Munich is fiction, although it's fiction based on fact. How much is fact and how much is fiction I don't know. But then there is also the important point that some fiction — honest fiction — can contain and convey as much truth as fact and that 'fact' is all too often something of a moveable feast: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, a distinction which is relevant in Steven Spielberg's film Munich. The acts of terrorism it portrays, the slaughter of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, and the subsequent vengeance meted out by Israel, is so wholly horrifying that to talk of film as entertainment would be obscene. Thankfully, Spielberg is such an outstanding and sensitive filmmaker that at no point does one feel that Munich is in any way intended to entertain. He also attempts, and, I think, largely succeeds — despite himself being Jewish — to remain evenhanded. No one comes out of this smelling of roses, not the Palestinians, not the Israelis, not the shadowy French middlemen and not (their roles are oblique but by no means unimportant) the Soviet KGB and the US CIA, both cynically involving themselves for their own ends. And although of necessity any moral discussion of what the Palestinians do and how Israel reacts cannot in such a film be too detailed, Spielberg also, in my view, admirably remains neutral. As a 'document', although a fictional 'document', Munich gets the cigar. But as a film, I have various quibbles. Visually and narratively and in so many other ways Munich is never short of excellent. Spielberg as an almost innate gift and, for example, tension is organic and not racked up artificially, as is the way of some filmmakers, by all kinds of flammery backed up by some portenous score. The acting is also superb, especially that of — former Australian stand-up — Eric Bana. What rather jarred with me was the ease with which Bana and his group of assassins can move around with ease, can cause extreme havoc, yet are never troubled by the police or a country's secret service. Obviously, were this long film to spend any time at all establishing matters in all the many countries in which the assassins operate, then it would become even longer. But for me the fatal flaw is the shadowy Frenchmen who facilitate the assassins' work at every turn, locating targets, organising safe houses and the like and without whose assistance the assassins would never even get started. Only two of them have speaking roles, a father ('Pape') and his son 'Louis', although there are obviously far more of them. To put it bluntly, they play the role of deus ex machina (although they appear throughout the film rather than at then end to effect some kind of resolution) and without them Spielberg wouldn't have a film. These people are the real cynics, working for the best paymaster and even, it is more than suggested, working for both sides merely to make more money. There is a curious piece of cod philosophising by Papa in which he attempts to justify his cynical approach by suggesting that all governments are 'bastards', but this is such cartoonish stuff that it can hardly be taken seriously. But that is a criticism — and in my book a major criticism — of the 'film' Munich. There is, though, more to Munich than that, and I am prepared to accept that others might not share my sensitivity to such a detail. And that apart, Munch is an extraordinarily good film, not least because it is — my quibble apart — also an honest film."
"ShootingShark","6","1","3","16 August 2009"," Intriguing But Rather Hollow Morality Tale Of Israeli Secret Agent Assassins
","Following the kidnap and murder of the Israeli team at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September, a team of Mossad secret agents are tasked with killing all those known to have planned the attack. Avner, the lead operative, goes about this grim work with skill and resolve, but slowly finds himself increasingly paranoid and disillusioned with the futility of revenge <br/><br/>As with all of Spielberg's work, this film is immaculately constructed, with exceptionally fine attention to detail as Rome, Nicosia, Beirut, Athens, London and New York in the early seventies are brilliantly reconstructed. It's also particularly well edited, with several sequences stylishly intercutting between scenes to great dramatic effect. It also tackles one of the most difficult political issues there has ever been - the Arab-Israeli conflict - with feeling, intelligence and objectivity, and those who have derided it as both pro and anti-Zionist propaganda are, in a word, wrong. However, the movie's mixture of politics and thriller don't work very well - the action scenes aren't that tense, the gun-battles don't have bite because we don't know the victims and the deaths of Avner's three colleagues are puzzling and inexplicable. Avner's descent into guilt and indecision over his actions is laudably acted but weakly written - the morality of being a paid assassin is explored with much more vigour and honesty in films like Leon or Grosse Pointe Blank. The problem with movies ""inspired by real events"" (man, I hate that phrase) is that filmmakers feel a moral responsibility to report like journalists, rather than entertain, which is what movies do best, and so often settle for a watered down middle ground. Compare this film with something like Brian DePalma's Mission Impossible; it too has stylish European layouts and moral dilemmas aplenty, but also fabulous car chases, sneaky intrigue and neato spy stuff, since it's unfettered by any chains to reality. Well played throughout by an unusual international mix of actors; the five Israeli agents are really an Australian, an Irishman, an Englishman, a Frenchman and a German ! I particularly like Hinds as the bespectacled cleanup man, who seems the most professional but ends up making the stupidest mistake, and Lonsdale and Cohen both have flashy parts as a Don Corleone-style patriarch and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir respectively. This is a moving, extremely well made, thought-provoking film, but in the end its potted mixture of history and fiction make it dull and sober.

","""Munich"" is a based-on-a-true-story film directed by Steven Spielberg about a group of agents who are hired to assassinate the Palestinian terrorists who murdered the 11 Isreali athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. The film stars ""The Hulk""s Eric Bana as the main character.<br/><br/>I thought it was a fabulous movie. It did have more nudity and sexuality in it than any other Spielberg movie that I've seen, but aside from that, it was very good. It had a really good message in it, which is: Did we make the right choice to assassinate the terrorists? Should we have instead brought them to justice? This all sprouted the controversy around the film. But aside from that, it was a very good film."

","Viewer's are advised to watch this movie carefully right from the starting. This flick is one of the most intense and realistic one I have ever seen. The quality of this production is pure Spielberg! It does not contain any unnecessary background music to thrill the audience. The way the picturisation is done it seems the viewers are themselves the characters. The actors played their roles perfectly to give it a fresher feeling. Their Israeli-accent English is impressive! Screenplay and direction is flawless. The violence, gore and blood made the viewing breathtaking. The ending may seem to be incomplete, but in every way it was acceptable."

","I can almost forgive Spielberg for the waste of War of the Worlds. I would say the only flaws I see may be due to the source material. i don't know because I have not read the book. I know it is politically correct to feel bad about killing people, even if you'r'e an assassin, but hearing them whine about it all the time was pretty annoying. And the way Avner reacted to Israelis when it was over. Why would he be so upset with everyone? Why in the world would he accuse them of trying to kill him? I guess the point of the story is that if you go around killing people, and you didn't start out crazy, you'll go crazy. I guess, but that isn't exactly a universally significant insight. By the end, I got so tired of this aspect that I truly cannot even remember how it ended."
"general-melchett","9","1","3","6 November 2006"," A great thriller, let down by Spielberg's love of unnecessary nudity.
","Munich was probably one of the best films of 2005 - though it may not have made huge box office grosses, the film itself was honest, powerful, moving, and shocking in parts, with a lot of character and humanity. All of the characters had human sides to them, and we really got to understand and feel for their struggles as the film progressed. It didn't pass on the gore, and when we see the athletes actually getting murdered about 25 minutes in, it is one of the most gruesome and heart-rending things transferred to film. Spiffing. Steven Spielberg has made this film for his religion, and to show us that we are fighting the same sort of things these days. This film was not made to make a load of money - it was made for a purpose, and served that purpose well.<br/><br/>Munich should have got ten stars, but once again, Steven Spielberg's love of nudity has brought him off the perfect mark. In Schindler's List, the nudity was necessary, but in this film, it really was plainly there for the purpose of letting Spielberg have bums on show once again. I've always respected Spielberg's talents as a director - nothing is too far for him. But the murder of the naked woman about two hours into the film is just disgusting - definitely not for family viewing. Avner and his wife's times in bed should not have been seen on this film, and though he was a rich, humane character, we really don't want to know what happens behind closed doors - even though his wife played quite a significant role in the story. The ending was the main problem - hugely powerful and artistic scenes intercut with shots of Avner heartily rogering his wife. Definite thumbs-down. Shame, really, as this film was top-hole - it was more than just a rubbish family film with talking animals, which frequent cinemas these days. But Steven Spielberg has to get this into his mind - the actors don't have to be ""au naturel"" to get you any Oscars and grip the audience, especially in a film like this.<br/><br/>I hugely enjoyed Munich, but it unfortunately isn't Spielberg's best - Saving Private Ryan is the best. And as long as he wants the whole world to see actors in the nude, his films won't be perfect in my eye. On the whole - Munich is a powerful, well-written film, that is only let down by one thing. A stunning job! 9/10"
"socrates99","8","1","3","30 May 2006"," A Strong, if Flawed, Endorsement of Revenge
","What a surprise this was! I expected a maudlin, cloying tale of ethnic woe, but instead, this is an almost perfect close-in thriller where your mind is likely to be racing as quickly as Eric Bana's. As far as I'm concerned, despite all his technically wonderful achievements in Sci-Fi, this is Spielberg's best film. True, he's probably unsurpassed for his ability to scare you even as you marvel at sights you can barely take in. But this film seems so much more difficult.<br/><br/>I am hardly a friendly audience given the subject matter, but I was more than glad I rented the DVD. Here he is telling the story of people who are not interested in telling their story, and somehow it's believable, engrossing and almost defensible. Of course it's something of a let down that all his main characters are rather admirable, but to Spielberg's credit, that humanity is not entirely the domain of the protagonists.<br/><br/>And the action sequences are probably the most realistic I've seen anywhere. Where else can you sit and safely watch what seems like a real gun fight? I have two objections but they're important. In one of the scenes, a Palestinian child is deliberately protected from the mayhem. To my mind this is an attempt to rehabilitate a people known for killing Palestinian children almost without hesitation. It was a huge mistake, in my opinion, for Spielberg to pretend otherwise. THe other distortion is the argument unanswered in the film that the Palestinians have no home when Palestine was their home for more than 2,000 years, far longer than the Israelis ever had it.<br/><br/>Does no one remember the footage of that little boy killed by head-shot by Israelis while huddling beside a wall with his father? Or how about the countless children killed almost as target practice for doing no more than throwing stones? But the chances are no one will question Spielberg's accuracy. Only someone who uses alternative sources on the Middle East is likely to see the Big Lie so innocuously inserted into this enthralling film. Most will succumb to the deluge of counter-spin generated by the well connected Israeli PR people. Spielberg knew that this film contained these poison pills when he edited this otherwise excellent film and I, for one, lament his lapse of courage."
"dee.reid","10","1","3","9 May 2006"," When you live by the sword, you'll die by the sword
","There's no question that ""Munich"" is sure to spark debate about the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the state of Palestine. The two powers have been going at it for years: when one strikes, the other reprises two-fold, and that's a lot of blood. For the most part, Steven Spielberg's take on the real-life events that unfolded in Munich, Germany in 1972 is a bold and explosive vision.<br/><br/>The events first open as Palestinian militants disguised as tourists storm an apartment building where 11 Israeli athletes participating in the '72 Munich Olympics are staying. The gunmen themselves are eventually killed in a shootout with German authorities but not before they've killed their 11 hostages.<br/><br/>Israel's prime minister makes it a point to not compromise their own deeply-rooted values, but if they don't act they'll appear weak to the rest to the world, so action must be taken. (So perhaps her decisions aren't so much motivated by out-and-out vengeance as they are politics.) She dispatches a team of five men, led by Avner (Eric Bana), to track down and eliminate the 11 men responsible for the massacre (and according to my information, nine of the 11 men were killed).<br/><br/>Based on the book ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" by George Jonas, Spielberg's ""Munich"" also makes a point to explore the nature of revenge while trying its best to not take sides. We know how Spielberg feels about Israel and his own Jewish heritage, but we also see that the man put his heart into this vision. The violence in ""Munich"" is quite graphic and unsettling but it's still a powerful experience, as we the audience is forced to confront a growing problem within the Middle East.<br/><br/>Though it seems both powers are at a stalemate, one character in ""Munich"" is blunt that the battle could take hundreds of years and many lives, but eventually the ""promised"" Holy Land of Israel will fall to Palestine simply because the Palestinians want it more.<br/><br/>From the way things are looking now, I think he's right.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""Munich"" tries to cram too many shots and explosions per minute, leaving the characters behind. On the other hand Spielberg was obviously trying to carry a message, but the movie came out is too shallow to really immerse you and make you feel what he is trying to tell. There are a few key dialogs, but they sound a bit artificial -- maybe they could sound better, but not in this movie. Eric Bana also does not seem to keep up with the leading role, which in a way may be intended -- it is unclear if Avner is in control of the events or vice versa, but still his acting could be better. Overall, the movie is substantially worse than I expected.<br/><br/>A suggestion: see ""Sword of Gideon"" (1986) if you can find it, doesn't matter before or after ""Munich"". IMHO it develops better portraits of key characters, and generally gives the story a much better texture. It concentrates on people and ideas rather than the events, and that's what this story is all about. The messages in these two films differ somewhat, and you may agree or disagree with either or both, but either way ""Sword"" is absolutely worth seeing if you are interested in the subject. I would also suggest watching the documentary ""One Day in September"" (1999) before watching the movie(s), for more detailed background.<br/><br/>Also, don't take user ratings too seriously for these particular moves, because as someone else correctly noted here, many people pay more attention to political aspects than cinematographic."
"chennaite79","6","1","3","3 February 2006"," Not so great
","Munich, as the title says, is based on real events that happened after the Black September. Directed by Steven Spielberg, with an ensemble of cast, this movie is definitely a watchable one. But, it did not live up to the hype it has generated.<br/><br/>After all, the movie looks like a plain revenge drama. I do not know much about the black September, but just watching the movie makes me feel that this (the movie) is a biased one. It presents only one side of the image. There were too many sentiments (family/religion/country) spread throughout the movie, which really tested my patience. The last one hour was just a drag and there was no story to tell. Unlike Spielberg's other movies, this movie is not for an universal audience."

The Terminal was phenomenal, Catch Me If You Can was breath-taking, Schindler's List was heartbreaking...<br/><br/>But Steven has taken it too far. For the first time, he has openly used the tactics of shock value using unnecessary nudity, gore, and a mixture of both in the scene where the assassins kill the woman in the boat. If Mr. Spielberg did not have his name in the credits, I would never have guessed he was even involved in this film.<br/><br/>However, it was well edited, well scripted, well directed. The suspense is fit for a Spielberg film, but the ending was complete trash. The last 15 minutes of the film, the audience is at the backs of their seats looking at their watches thinking ""C'mon, Steve...end it already..."" The plot was terrible enough to bring my 10/10 for everything else, down to a 5/10. Worthy to see if you're studying film, but it was not entertaining in my opinion."

","This is probably Spielberg's average film. It is not a classic, it is not great, it is not terrible. It certainly is a good thriller, like a deadly chess game. Many have said that it is a great film, a classic- bullshit! It is a well shot film but it does not have a great story. Who the hell wants to watch a film about vengeance that does nothing in the end. Peace is the moral- something that cannot be stressed amongst the Israeli's and the Palestinians. It has some surprising scenes of frontal nudity and brutal violence that are always stressed by Spielberg for whatever reason. In the end, the vengeance the hit man leads turns into a whole bunch of nothing that the hit-man recognizes himself as he is slowly losing his team. Spielberg surprisingly then shows us a sex scene between the hit man (Eric Bana) and his wife in conjunction with the murders of the Israeli athletes and John William's score which is emotional. Again, Spielberg shows us more violence and tries to pull off a classic scene- you're not going to do that during a sex scene- the scene of the murders is already not classic. Spielberg was trying to pull off a Godfather sequence- ain't gonna work. The only thing I admired about the movie was the message- vengeance will not solve the problem, only peace will. 6/10."
"nuxvomica-1","5","1","3","16 January 2006"," Not a review, some background info.
","The events portrayed are detailed in the superbly written and researched book by George Jonas entitled ""Vengeance"". Based on interviews with Avner, and meticulously annotated, it reads more like a top class airport thriller, with all the machismo excised.<br/><br/>Also this is not the first depiction of these events. The 1986 movie ""Sword of Gideon"" made a brave attempt, but ultimately, was let down by poor casting and time restrictions which bypassed many of the key events.<br/><br/>For a superb documentary on the Olympic massacre itself, I would recommend ""One Day in September""."
"anhedonia","5","1","3","15 January 2006"," Doesn't quite pull it off
","Steven Spielberg was never going to make anyone happy with ""Munich."" Pro-Palestinian factions would find it offensive because the film never delves into why those Arab men took the Israeli athletes hostage (and ultimately killed them), and Jewish groups would find the Jewish characters doubting themselves and their philosophical dilemmas offensive, too.<br/><br/>One of my earliest memories of world events was what happened at the 1972 Munich Olympics. I've always been fascinated by what happened and the aftermath. So I was looking forward to this film.<br/><br/>I tried to view ""Munich"" as a film, not as a political treatise on Arab-Jewish relations or anything else, though it's tough not to see it in that light. I tried to see this film as a thriller loosely based on facts about the Israeli response to the events at the 1972 games. ""Munich"" would make a great double-feature with the 1999 documentary, ""One Day in September,"" which raised questions also about the hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner that led to West Germany releasing some of those who held the athletes hostage.<br/><br/>As a thriller, ""Munich"" works in spurts. It's a hit-or-miss film. Spielberg is a terrific visual artist and knows how to frame his shots. But the script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth is so loose - and I don't mean with the actual events; that is a given - that this thriller never comes close to being as taut as it should.<br/><br/>Spielberg's working with a hugely talented cast. But, with the exception of Eric Bana as Avner, the others in his group seems awfully wrong for their parts. Most glaring is Daniel Craig's character, Steve. You're never quite sure what ethnicity he is. In one crucial scene, he's passed off as South African, yet his accent is anything but.<br/><br/>Spielberg's decision to handle the hostage-taking and subsequent botched rescue at the airport as flashbacks Avner sees don't really work, especially the final scene. What was he thinking? It's almost as if Kushner and Roth realized they hadn't shown the assault at the airport and so decided to tack it on in an incredibly odd manner.<br/><br/>As far as being a political treatise, Spielberg tackles the Palestinian issue, but also seems to use the Israeli response to Munich to discuss life in a post-9/11 America. Golda Meir's comment that even democracies have to compromise their principles for the so-called greater good seems to be a clear allusion to the Bush administration's attitude since 9/11.<br/><br/>But that's where it seems to end. Spielberg doesn't seem to be taking any stand. He's neither admonishing nor endorsing anything. And this middle-of-the-road attitude doesn't seem to quite work. It's as if he's trying to be as inoffensive as possible while making a political thriller.<br/><br/>Characters also chat about the morality of what they're doing, especially when they're asked to assassinate people based solely on the word of their intelligence agency and they get to see none of the evidence. They wonder where the evidence is. And the answer they get from the higher-ups is that they don't need to know. (Much like this administration not bothering about trivial issues such as due process since it believes holding even U.S. citizens incommunicado, without charges or allowing them to see their lawyers, is perfectly alright.)<br/><br/>Where ""Munich"" ultimately disappoints is that - rather surprisingly - Spielberg, Kushner and Roth fail to create a compelling story out of what should be riveting stuff. Their plot turns tend to get redundant, even predictable, though there's one well done sequence in the rain. The film needed more of that.<br/><br/>""Munich"" is by no means an awful film. It runs too long - cutting 30 minutes would have done wonders. The characters also seem strangely aloof. We're never drawn into their predicaments, moral dilemmas and anguish. And, in the end, they just come off mostly as talking-heads."
"Nezz","5","1","3","14 January 2006"," I want Raiders Spielberg back.
","This must just be the year of me being damn hard to impress. That's my story for Film 2005: Bored. (and yet my favorite film of the year, one that I have seen three times and still want to see again, is yet another adaptation of one of the most well trod stories in the English language. Go figure.) For starters, it's way too long. Way, way, way too long and ended about half and hour before it ended. Spielberg, Kushner and Roth went out on what felt like 1001 tangents, striking out with random thoughts and moments that just add to the jumble of thoughts and ideas that lead to my next point.<br/><br/>What the hell was the point of this movie? I suppose at the end, I'm meant to take it for a statement of the impotence of violence, but I found it almost impossible to hold on to that feeling. It was a little 'too little too late'...too weakly expressed at the end of a very, very long, bland and violent (amazing how it can be both) morality tale. Paradise Now did a much better job with this idea, I think.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's Spielberg, so it's well crafted, and there were a few moments that I really enjoyed - during the Beirut mission, the staccato of the rapid gunfire matched with the clanging footsteps running down metal stairs was especially striking. I did hate the sequence with 'threatening to blow up the little girl'...hated with a passion. Cheap, cheap, cheap.<br/><br/>I have a question about the languages used in Munich. Now, I've never really experienced a multi-lingual society, so I don't know in a practical situation how much English would come into play. When dealing with characters of several different nationalities (one of which is a native English speaker), it makes sense to me for the group to be speaking English. But when it comes to scenes of just Israelis, would they be speaking English? Or is the English to make it more understandable to the audience, to not bog down a major expositional scene with subtitles? And if this is the case, how is that any better than Rob Marshall's use of English in Memoirs (which in the end only bugged me because of a). the way it negatively affected the performances and b). the way that they pulled out Japanese whenever they felt like they wanted to be mysterious or exotic)? Just a question.<br/><br/>In short, Boo. I want Raiders Spielberg back."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","3","14 January 2006"," Great story obviously but oh dear, those clichés
","I remember the events of the Munich Olympics 1972 fairly clearly. I was 17 at the time, and resident in England. It made a big impression, watching it unfold on the BBC, the vivid images played out on TV. The slaughtered athletes, the botched German security job, the debate over continuing the games (they did but shouldn't have.) I remember the hijackings, Leila Khaled, Black September, Bader Meinhoff, The Red Brigade, the IRA, all that early terrorism that rather passed America by in the pre-9/11 world. So I was predisposed to appreciate this story, and it was certainly time that the story was told. I can't exactly say that I was predisposed to enjoy it. Is it right to enjoy a true story about a real-life slaughter? You can't possibly analyze the story, all you can do is analyze the telling of it, which is what I'll try and do.<br/><br/>To me, this movie is a classic example of how to ruin a really good story by throwing every cliché in the book at it. There were parts of it I loved. Eric Bana's performance, for example, was really outstanding, by far the best I've seen him give. It certainly works on the level of a thriller, as we watch the shadowy team of Israelis track down the shadowy team of Palestinians across Europe. I found the mental disintegration, self-doubt and mounting paranoia of Avner very believable, and the individual details of the kills were quite fascinating, although the lingering shot of the bullet wounds over the pretty Dutch assassin's breasts was perhaps slightly overdone.<br/><br/>The trouble is that Spielberg doesn't just set the scene for us as we move from country to country, he hits us over the head with it and then grinds our noses into it just in case we missed anything. To give a few examples. London. In the space of half a city block we are shown two red telephone booths, a red post box, a red London bus (double decker of course), a Mini Cooper, a Ford Zephyr and a black taxicab. And just in case you missed any of those, it's raining. This is London, OK? London. L-O-N-D-O-N. All it lacked was a Cheery Cockney Chappie to run up to our hero and say ""Mornin' Mate"" for it to have included every London cliché from A to Z (although had that happened I might well have got up and left.) Then there's the ""Oh look, it must be Paris, I can see the Eiffel Tower"" scene. And everyone was smoking at the table and mentioned cheese frequently, so we'd know they were REALLY French, not masquerading Belgians. Was that the Spanish Steps in Rome? We have bikes and canals in Holland, and Hey! it's Brooklyn, she lives in a brownstone and there are the friendly neighbors sitting on the steps! All Spielberg spared us was an aerial shot of the Acropolis in Greece. Is it a necessity for geographically challenged American audiences to be bludgeoned over the head with all this visual imagery so they'll have no doubts about where they are? Did someone in the props department find a locked closet with ""Europe"" written on the door and insist on using everything they found inside dating from every European movie made since 1930? The head-tossing sex scene towards the end, cutting between the violence and Avner's trauma also made me shake my head in disbelief that anyone as good as Spielberg could throw in such an obvious cliché.<br/><br/>The London street scene actually reminded me of Austin Powers, and that really wasn't the memory I wanted to retain of this movie, because it makes some very good points, chief amongst them being that for every terrorist you kill, ten more will stand up to take their place (especially true if you kill parents in front of their children.) And that exacting revenge has a terrible effect on the avenger. And did the Americans really make a Faustian pact with Black September to keep terrorism out of the USA? Interesting and thought provoking stuff, and yet it was thrown in almost as an after thought. That one question would make a great movie all by itself.<br/><br/>But I'm afraid mostly this movie just made me sigh. Am I getting too old to go to the movies any more? Is there anyone left out there who can make a movie devoid of cliché? Because for me this ruined what should have been a deeply moving story. But at least it has left me wanting to know more about the story, more about what happened after Munich, so it wasn't a total loss. Maybe I'll go and look for a book about it. With no pictures."

","OK, so it's from Spielberg, which means that it's above par. That being said, it's not one of his finest work, and not because it's controversial: there's something missing. I can't pinpoint it, but though the message comes through loud and clear, and the ca. three-hour affair goes down easier than a pint of Guiness, there is a tiny little something missing, which probably will preclude it from winning an Oscar or being remembered in 1000 years.<br/><br/>So the cast is not to blame in this one, Eric Bana is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors, after his awesome performance in the pitiful Troy, he really delivers the goods here, so do Croze, Craig, Kassovitz and the rest of the gang. The acting is top notch. The cinematography and the story flow down smoothly, there is just nothing bad to be said. The final scene and closing picture is memorable and without letting any spoilers escape, I will just say that as I left the theater, it survived in my psyche for a good half an hour, and I am not even American.<br/><br/>Had this movie been made by anyone other than Spielberg, I probably would have built it up to the ceiling. Considering his body of work, and the expectations he now commands, (all to his credit), this is a satisfying effort, that could have been better. The message is well-taken and nevertheless appreciated in these troubled times. It definitely should be seen at the theaters and it probably should be bought on DVD as well.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (Avner) - 10/10 - Hypnotic work, this guy is scary.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig (Steve) - 7/10 - Decent work, it still is not too late to give up that Bond work. Mark my words, it will destroy you.<br/><br/>Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert) - 8/10 - Almost forgot that I was watching one of the best French directors alive.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush (Ephraim) - 8/10 - Unrecognizable, yet effective<br/><br/>Marie-Josée Croze (Jeanette) - 9/10 - Very nice performance.

","The mixed reactions to this movie isn't surprising, there are few movies that balance action and psychological drama well. Unfortunately, what that means for movie views is that those that are attracted to the first part of the film may not understand or like the ending and vis versa. If you appreciate exploring social problems in the cinema, you will probably love this movie. If you hate following complex and at times psychologically driven plots, you may want to wait to see this film. The acting is excellent, the interweaving of stories through the main character is thoughtful and well placed, and the direction and shooting of the film, as always with Spielberg, is great. <br/><br/>I would very much like to see this movie pick up a few Oscars. I haven't seen many movies that I think accurately capture the internal struggles that have existed and continue to exist in the Middle East.

"jtbrat3","6","1","3","6 January 2006"," The word is ""ambivalent""
","It seems to me that ""Munich"" is not pro-Palestinian, though it may be less pro-Israeli than one would expect from the director of ""Schindler's List"". What distinguishes ""Munich"" is Spielberg's determination to portray the Israeli retaliation for the massacre of its Olympic team in morally ambiguous, rather than heroic, terms.<br/><br/>There are no villains in this film. The Israelis are conscientious, morally complex, and sympathetic, not to mention diverse. So are their adversaries. Avnar, for example, is more interested in his baby, his wife and his cooking than in getting revenge against Black September. He takes the mission reluctantly and carries it out with increasing pangs of guilt, pangs which ultimately lead him to leave Israel. We don't see the Palestinian characters at such close range, but what we do see - innocent artistic pursuits, family lives, good-humored banter, honest patriotism - hardly makes it any easier for the Israeli team to kill them.<br/><br/>What Spielberg has done is to produce a film that argues against violence in general, which he sees as an endless and futile cycle of action and reaction. Seen this way, is Black September's assault on the Israeli Olympic team an unprovoked attack or a retaliation for previous wrongs? Is Avnar's mission a justifiable form of retaliation or just another link in an endless chain of violence? Everything about the plot and the characters emphasizes the alleged futility of the mission and as we watch, the team begins to lose confidence in its own rectitude as well as its competence. It is hard to kill people at close range who appear perfectly decent. Have the higher ups identified the right people? What happens if an innocent person, even a child, happens to get in the way? Then, each time the team scores a kill, they hear that their enemies have launched a new attack in response. They wonder if they are really getting anywhere. They also wonder if the entire business has not compromised them as decent people. Are they really any better, or any different, from the Black September organizers they are pursuing? By the end of the film, Avnar is so disillusioned with the mission and the bosses who recruited him, that he leaves Israel to live in Brooklyn. His nights are sleepless and his days spent looking over his shoulder for assassins.<br/><br/>Those who agree with this point of view - which is essentially rather close to pacifism - will rate the film very highly. Even those who don't agree - and I am one of them - will give Spielberg credit for having made a complex and interesting film that provokes thought, while rejecting easy answers and simplistic formulations."
"dclark_54","7","1","3","6 January 2006"," Bad Message
","I found the new Spielberg movie to be very well done, as would be expected. However, I found the message in the movie appalling and disheartening. To try and equate the wrong doing on those two sides is ludicrous. The Palestinians make it part of their interest to kill the innocent, while the Israelis had unfortunate victims in what can only be considered a mission for the future protection of other Israelis. I would be lying if I said that this movie did not have an expected view point but nevertheless I found it to be odd. We have no problem demonizing the Nazis for killing millions, but we fail to see that the radical muslims would do the same if they had the means to. Somehow we want to find the good in them, like some sort of pet project.Spielberg has really sold his soul on this one. But what do you expect from Hollywood?"
"dtuero","Null","1","3","23 December 2005"," Thoughts on ""Munich""...(Spoiler)
","Just saw Munich this afternoon in NYC on 42nd street.<br/><br/>Like most everyone else in the city today, I got off early from work and caught the 3:10 showing of Munich, (the 2:40 was sold out) Ten dollars and seventy five cents, thank you very much...<br/><br/>After an endless bombardment of pre-movie videos and trailers... (Can't believe someone thought that remaking ""The Pink Panther"" with Steve Martin was a good idea..boggles the mind)..Munich began not so promptly at 3:25. Using the vintage video footage of Jim McKay (RIP) and Peter Jennings (RIP) triggered memories of the actual event for me, since I was a Spud of 16 or so in 1972. <br/><br/>Munich is a very compelling film, but not the best of 2005, I still prefer ""A History of Violence,"" as a superior piece of original film-making. The character studies were superb, as were nearly all of the acting performances...no complaints there..but ultimately you leave the theatre with a sense of survival and perhaps in a mild state of shock, simply because of the intensity of the story..reminds me the way I felt after seeing ""The Killing Fields."" Not exactly a ""feel-good"" experience...<br/><br/>But<br/><br/>I was fascinated to see how a ""Black-Ops"" mission would be set up and run by a small team of special contract agents...takes a whole lot of money. So although I didn't regret seeing Munich, not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone else, only to people interested in the Historical aspects of the story. Gotta admire Spielberg though-- he took on a very tough assignment, and did a remarkably balanced job bringing it to the screen. Kudos<br/><br/>Eric Bana is likely to receive a Best Acting nomination. Kind of bizarre seeing two Aussies (Geoffrey Rush was Bana's ""handler"") playing Mossad agents. They pulled it off. Though Rush's accent wasn't nearly as authentic as Bana's...<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Munich"" is really more of an accomplishment as a mostly-truthful historical recreation, than a fun movie-going experience. And that ain't necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>Best scene: The Short Wave radio in an Athens safe-house picks up a Motown station..and the inhabitants can agree on the universal appeal of American Soul Music...<br/><br/>Doug Tuero Newwwwwww Jerrrrrrrsey"

","This is a good movie. Keep that in mind. But it doesn't hit with the same weight of other Spielberg movies. Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List both were able to reach into deep, dark, god-forsaken places inside us and twist; Munich kind of prods, trying to find those same places without comparable success. Certainly, this movie has its moments; Spielberg is a cinematography genius. But the inconsistent tone and feel are quite distracting. Munich jumps from action to romance to drama to moral screed back to action to thriller...Never does it remain constant enough to draw the audience in and finally reach that place it seeks. Go see it; it's an important film. But don't wait for Spielberg or Eric Bana to pop up on the stage for any awards."

They really should see the film first. The entire Bush Administration, the Senate and Congress should see it, too.<br/><br/>The point is not that we should not respond to terrorism.

Almost all of the characters were the same names. Both were excellent movies, however I am a bit disappointed that Spielberg has not done something more original. Perhaps there is some story behind these two films that is not so obvious. Having said that, the story is excellent, the message is compelling and I would definitely recommend seeing it.

At its best, it lets us, the audience, do the important work, such as weighing the morality of revenge when it seems to be costing much, much more than the bargained for price, or drawing lines, such as when is it ""terrorism"" and when is it ""making a point""?

I was expecting to see a very high quality, well made movie, as Spielberg is capable of making (on the order of Schindler's List) and was anticipating to take a position on the ""political"" side of the movie. What I found was a really bad movie and not much more. It was completely tasteless in the ""sex scene"" at the end where Avner is passionately screwing his wife while seeing scenes of the massacre in his head. It was just disgusting. This was after a movie with no certain direction, full of really bad dialogue, below average acting and an uncomprehendable presentation of the Israeli revenge team. Why did they try to make them look so unproffesional? Why does the movie have almost nothing to do with the massacre except as a background theme? Why did they put that corny, far fetched, unnecessary scene with the Israelis and Palestinians in the same room? What did Kushner want to say and show, besides that he is a really bad story teller? Don't bother wasting the three hours on this movie that I did. Watch the documentary on the Munich massacre instead. There you see a well made, intriguing film, without any political hints and fictional settings and tasteless scenes. Shame on you Spielberg."
"scaves","4","2","10","8 January 2006"," Food and Death
","Very very mild spoilers; but then again, I don't even like to watch the previews, so these minor, vague revelations may not be counted as giving anything away.<br/><br/>I went to this movie with high expectations; I thought that having made the excellent _Schindler's List_, Spielberg would have purged this serious, political film of the frivolous, shallow, sentimental, and sententious nature of many of his others. There may be nothing shallow in this film, in that it deals respectfully with both the promise of Israel, its importance to its people, and its terrible political dilemma; and it does address the flawed ideology of vengeance. But it is dull, dull, bloody, full of sumptuous meals, and dull. After the first tense revenge killing where the untrained assassins nearly botch it, I looked at my watch and thought... are they going to go through all eleven? It seemed that that was the scenario for the first hour. The second hour was hard to get through--the incredible violence and gore putting one into a state of numbness--and the final forty minutes was a torture of boredom. We hadn't eaten, and I kept focusing on all that food. What was that food supposed to signify? It may have been a powerful iconic message-- of devouring, of family, of life, of SOMETHING-- but it was lost in a plot that got increasingly confused. Food and death. The cook who kills. The toymaker who makes faulty bombs. Toys and bombs. Now this target. Now that. The main character, whom one should care about, was so insipid as to incite no sympathy. I found Louis and his Papa far more interesting, actually, than Avnan. The final spoken morals seemed tendentious and obvious. Spielberg at his worst: meaning well, earnest in his religious and political faith, but narratively naive."

","I thought this was a war film, with the title location and being directed by Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), but actually it turned out to be much more interesting and bold than that. Based on the true story, set in 1972 at the Olympic Games in Munich, eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September, and then murdered. In retaliation, the Israeli government recruits a group of Jewish Mossad agents to track down and kill all those responsible for the murders. These agents are: Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig, the year before becoming James Bond), Carl (CiarÃ¡n Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are relying on paid informants to help them find those responsible, and when they do, they use quite extreme methods to kill them, most involving trigger bombs. As the bodies pile up, the sleepless nights increase, loyalties blur, and they question the morality of the mission. Also starring Ayelet Zurer as Daphna, Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, Moonraker's Michael Lonsdale as Papa, Mathieu Amalric as Louis, Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir and Moritz Bleibtreu as Andreas. The performances are all fantastic, the explosive sequences add to the drama of the film, and Spileberg's direction ensures a brave and effective thriller film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"

Spielberg, a master of re-creation, doesn't fail here. His interpretation of the Black September is terrifyingly real, aided by Kaminski's camera-work and Kahn's editing.<br/><br/>The movie runs too long.

And that is after THE TERMINAL and WAR OF THE WORLDS.<br/><br/>However, because of the wretchedness of the script and general waste of the actors (who all attempt to elevate the awful material) it is apparent that this is one of Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski's finest works.<br/><br/>The use of ""70s"" styles in zoom, color palette, movement are combined skillfully with more modern techniques. However, all this is in service of an apologist diatribe about why Israel should behave like animals because they're ""enemy"" is willing to sink lower.

"eric262003","7","1","4","2 April 2017"," Engaging Throughout, But Far From a Masterpiece
","Set at the 1972 Olympics emanating from Munich, Germany, Palestinian terrorists close in on the Olympic village targeting at the Israeli athletes making them hostages, while a massive shoot-out at the airport leaves several terrorists dead and all the athletes who only wanted to compete against others thriving to capture some medals, only to be left out with lives lost and hearts broken. Stunned by such tragic events, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) sends Mossad agent Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana loosely based off of real character Yuval Aviv), under the supervision of Case Officer Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) to take down the 11 Palestinians who were involved in the chaos. Avner is accompanied by South African driver named Steve (Daniel Craig), a Belgian toy-maker turned bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), an Israeli soldier and cleaner named Carl (Ciaran Hinds) and a Danish forger named Hans (Hanns Zischler). Together, they are met with a secretive French informant named Louis (Mathieu Amalric). Avner puts his mission in question as he abandons his pregnant wife wondering if he'll survive or perish.<br/><br/>No question about it, ""Munich"" will have you pondering, but the focus at times falls off kilter with a ridiculous continuity error with poor soul falling dead on his chest by being annihilated by a large bag of shopping in the lift lobby of his apartment domain. It was such a wonderful scene, it needed to be shown again. And then I ask myself, why? It was kind of distracting me for a while until some scenes later when publicly orchestrated discussions from various alliances are situated in cafes, bookstores, the streets you name it, they're omnipresent. What's odd is that although they're supposed to be secretive, they're out in the public spectrum where passersby can see and hear what they're talking about.<br/><br/>This is what I mean by off kilter direction and editing. It really questions the focus of the people behind the camera. Although we're heard ahead of time that that the film was based on actual events, but it's complex to determine which events are real and which stuff are for dramatization. Unless you lived the moment, we don't know the whole story. And I should not be sitting here chomping away at continuity errors or awkward shots, I should put emphasis on the more logical measures the Israeli's should have done to the Palestinians besides the eye-for-an-eye revenge. The logical measures could have had the Israeli's capture the terrorists and exploit them on live television in front of millions of people for the scumbags they really are.<br/><br/>The whole concept of espionage is met with welcomed interest, especially the scenes by members of the clan led by the well cultivated Louis (played by the talented Amalric), the only person who hold the key to the whereabouts of the Palestinians behind the carnage. Michael Lonsdale was superb in his performance as Louis' Papa further elucidates the divergences that penetrate in this environment where their lives are always by the numbers.<br/><br/>The main star of this film is Mossad agent Anver (Eric Bana) and I have a bit of curiosity when it comes to casting. As good as they are why did Steven Spielberg cast Australian performers like Eric Bana as Avner and Geoffrey Rush as his Case officer Ephraim? With the cultural intensity as heavy as this it's mandatory for specific cultural casting. My assumption lead me to believe that Aussies are easy to cast and speak fluent English and can adapt to any accent thrown at them. For better casting I would have cast Israeli actor Lior Ashkenazi to play a Mossad agent just like he did in Eytan Fox's brilliant film ""Walk on Water"".<br/><br/>It's enigmatic to pinpoint which parts of this movie are factual and which parts are fantasy. The editing is highly questionable. I don't think vengeful killings will resolve any peace within Palestine and Israel. And even though this movie will keep you intrigued it still went on for too long. A lot of that lengthy time's energy sparks a ton of awkward moments.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great film based on this interesting event. I would suggest the wonderful Kevin McDonald Oscar winning documentary from 2000, ""One Day in September"". The stories there are accurate and the interview with the lone surviving Palestinian was provocative."

","Good story, good film-making and good casting, but the movie is a bit spoiled by its lengthy development and the story gets blurred by political propaganda. Instead of focusing on events or characters, the scenario likes to stray into emotional blackmailing, with some scenes awkwardly turning to be overly dramatic, adding unnecessary emphasis on the good reasons and innocence of the Israeli people and stretching the dialog to depict and justify their ""good intentions"" in borderline ridiculous ways. That and the little speeches full of political messages.. really not sure all those not-so-subtle arguments add anything to the movie, just load it with biased views and unpalatable justifications.

I'll avoid the topic of historical and ethical clumsiness in this film because opinions on them abound and this review would become a book.<br/><br/>When Zwaiter fell forward onto his groceries he then magically flipped onto his back for the next view. Judging by the weapons, he was shot with at least .380 cal rounds yet a smaller (.22 centrefire?) calibre cartridge case was picked up. With 10 torso shots (though a grocery bag containing glass vessels of liquid: deflection/retardation) and none to the head, many people could survive.<br/><br/>The film continued it's ineptitude so remorselessly that I only watched to get the thing out of the way. The characters are thin, foolish and laughable, particularly Steve (Daniel Craig) dancing and suggesting they go to Libya to extend their mission. In the scene with Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Avner (Eric Bana), sensitive topics are discussed in a public place using plain rather than implied language.<br/><br/>If this were just an action-thriller the theatrics and ineptitude would be fine but it's supposed to be a serious topic about an abhorrent government policy and that makes a mockery of its overall intent. Whatever it may be. The point is well enough made but I had little sympathy for Avner by the close of the film. The cast do a passable job, Geoffrey Rush is his usual professional self but Daniel Craig needed to talk to a South African for longer to get his accent right."

Meanwhile, there was thousands of massacres in the history and some of the have been still going on somewhere in the world.

It was like Kushner&Roth couldn't finish it what it really had to, although they also knew what the real end. I don't like the bed scene near the end, either.

Pretty trite, unless you can deliver the emotional punch of Paradise Now.<br/><br/>The documentary footage and reenactment of the Munich fiasco does have an emotional impact for those who lived through those days. But, what value does this film add for them?

Eleven Palestinian operatives for eleven Israeli victims. <br/><br/>The lamentable point of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle is that retaliation does not work for Israel because of their political objectives.<br/><br/>That is, the expulsion of non-Jews from Israel and the occupation of occupied territories by Jewish settlers. That is why the actions of this group of Israeli operatives were futile.<br/><br/>On a historical note, Israel ceased its operation after the wrong man was killed in Norway.

This was the time of David Bedford the great British middle distance runner; he was breaking records for the 5000 and 10000 metres almost every week and he was set to show it to the world in the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.<br/><br/>We turned the television set on one day and all hell had broken loose; we didn't understand what was going on; we couldn't understand why anybody could find something more important than the Olympic Games; why couldn't they, at least, let us see the 5000 metres final or even the 1500 metres? But it was serious; every time we watched the TV there was a hooded man standing on a balcony; the camera was fixed off and commentators all around the world spoke to their respective countries and filled time as we watched the fixed off shot.<br/><br/>We thought that the Olympic Games would be abandoned but it was not to be; one morning we got up and we were told it was all over; the entire Israeli team had been killed at the airport; it was reported that the Germans had opened fire on the helicopter, taking the hostages and terrorists to some destination or other, and that all on board the chopper had been killed.<br/><br/>They decided to cancel the Olympic Games for one day in respect for those killed and then they resumed; David Bedford, the greatest middle distance runner in Britain didn't win anything; the 5000 and 10000 metres were both won by a Finnish runner who, it was alleged doped his own blood.<br/><br/>So this film is supposed to fill in the blank spaces for us, the people who were transfixed to our television sets all those years ago; I'm not sure whether it does that or not or whether it just gives us the interpretation of a Mister Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>It tells of the Israeli cabinet meeting deciding to send a crack assassination squad to kill the master minds behind the Munich massacre. ""We have 11 Palestinian names; each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead."" This could have been a riveting thriller but it isn't; it was directed by, arguably, the most successful director in movie history, written by maybe the most successful playwright living, Tony Kushner, and Eric Roth a successful screenwriter.<br/><br/>So what went wrong because this isn't a great film; maybe they should have contacted people from the other side? The film starts off okay but then goes into soap opera and propaganda; just look at some of the lines from the movie: ""The only blood I care about is Jewish blood."" ""We kill for our future."" ""We kill for peace."" These lines make you ask yourself what this film would have been like if made by Martin Scorsese; as it is it tries to be too many things.<br/><br/>It tries to be funny; for example; the bomb maker  and I'm not giving anything away and spoiling anything, doesn't make the device big enough for one killing and makes it too big for another killing  this is shot for comedy and nothing should be funny about it; one victim is shot as he carries a bag full of groceries  now why did they do that? So that he could be shot through the shopping bag and that the bag could leak of milk  you know the scene we have been watching it for years but this was shot by one of the most successful directors in the history of movies  just not good enough.<br/><br/>At one point the assassination squad are given a 'safe house' in Athens only to find that they are sharing it with other terrorists; there's a bizarre scene as if they are at a boy-scout jamboree and shouting out their troop names; IRA, ETTA, Bader-Meinhof; then they settle down and all sleep in the one room; this gives us an excuse for the two leaders to talk and philosophise about their beliefs with the leader, Avner, not letting on he is Jewish, of course, but the scene is a clumsy effort to educate and preach to us  the audience and we know how the relationship is going to end.<br/><br/>The film is also very annoying in its use of the zoom lens; I thought zooming had gone out of fashion since the seventies but no; it's just lazy and saves them using tracks and cranes.<br/><br/>There are some nice performances from Ciarán Hinds and Geoffrey Rush but what a let down."

"peruviansilver","7","1","4","4 September 2006"," A good movie but not a great movie
","The most important thing about this movie is its central message, that revenge is a circle. It is also particularly important to focus this message on middle east conflict, because as everyone knows, the rest of the world is constantly drawn into this cycle of violence. I think Spielberg has done a noble thing in going after this issue.<br/><br/>Also important is the criticism Spielberg makes of governments. I believe that a government should never compromise its ethics, no matter what the cause. Sadly, reality has shown us that our governments can be just as evil as the terrorists. If we become our enemy to fight them then what are we fighting for? When this happens there are no good guys, and the conflict becomes pointless.<br/><br/>However, the implementation of this film leaves something to be desired. I believe the violence and gore was excessive. In fact, the scene with the woman having blood squirting in a nice clean stream out of her chest was really not necessary.<br/><br/>Some might argue that this was realism. Of course, it might have also been realistic to have her fall backwards onto a jagged board and have her beating heart speared like an olive and spraying the whole room. Maybe we could have seen her hungry cat snacking on her liver several days later. No one could say that it probably wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>It appears that those in Hollywood have decided that an affective way to stimulate movie goers is to show them shocking violence. Of course, they are right, it does stimulate the mind in a primitive way. However, it is also an easy, lazy minded way to stimulate us. Much easier than actually telling a good story, making us think, or inviting us to a different reality for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>My other criticism of this movie, is that it moved from assassination to assassination quite linearly, and monotonously. It was like watching a long train go by and trying to read the writing on every car. After about the third one, I was loosing interest. A couple of shots of newspaper front pages for some of the killings would have been more efficient, and would have saved them a ton of money, and made the movie better.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was pretty good."
"matlefebvre20","6","1","4","21 August 2006"," The athletes were shot, the movie is too
","After the blockbuster ""War of the Worlds"", Steven Spielberg quickly followed it with a very different of movie: an historical drama about the killing of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich by Palestinian terrorists.<br/><br/>The situation of 2005 was often compared to 1993. That year, Spielberg made the most-successful film of history (at the time): ""Jurassic Park"". It was quickly followed by what was about to become Spielberg's undisputed masterpiece: ""Schindler's List"", which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.<br/><br/>While ""War of the Worlds"" is a terrifying and spectacular sci-fi action thriller, ""Munich"" is a very ambitious project, but it ultimately fails to satisfy our expectations.<br/><br/>Let's examine the film point by point. The beginning scenes with the Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli athletes start the movie pretty well. We feel the interaction between the terrorists and the hostages. The mêlée with the terrorists and the police at the airport is thrilling. Unfortunately, it's very uncomfortable to edit it as a Avner's (Eric Bana's character) flashback. It would have been even more convincing and real if it was told in a linear sequence at the beginning of the movie. However, it could have meant that Spielberg would have had to chop out the TV footage, which are quite fascinating.<br/><br/>It tries to be a thoughtful drama about Israeli-Palestinian relations, but it never involves us in an interesting way. It depicts Israelian dialects and traditions, but that's all.<br/><br/>Characters try to be interesting and dramatic enough, but the most interesting are the gang members. Eric Bana is very touching and professional by moments, but he often acts too much spontaneously and we don't believe him. Steve (played by future-super-spy Daniel Craig) is cool and he acts quite well in mood-enhancer scenes, such as the moments where he and an Arab companion argue about the station they will put on the radio.<br/><br/>The plot is too much complicated and the only thing we know for sure is that they have to shoot eleven Arabs who are supposed to be related to the Munich events. We quickly lose ourselves in the action and dialog doesn't help. I never knew the name of some important characters before I saw the credits.<br/><br/>Because it was so much discussed, publicized and aimed by high expectations, ""Munich"" is the kind of work that brings Spielberg back to Earth. It's not because you have a good concept, a good name and a good streak that you're gonna have a good movie. There are fairly good moments in the film, but it's not what it could have been. ""Munich"" is good, but it's also disappointing."

","Did the film makers actually bother to do any research or just make this up as they went along? I suggest anyone interested in the real story behind the assassination teams dispatched around the world relating to these events dramatised in the film seek out documentaries on the subject and study the recent material now in the public domain.<br/><br/>I find the most risible aspect of this picture was the choice not to mention the botched assassination of a Morrocan waiter working in Scandinavia wrongly identified which brought the whole state sponsored campaign of selective targets to light and should act a warning that no matter how sophisticated your intelligence is, there is always the inevitable errors that lead to innocent casualties."

","I went into this film expecting another Schindler's List masterpiece. Despite the hype, what I ended up viewing was an overwrought, predictable, and plodding work of mediocrity.<br/><br/>First of all, Munich tries too hard to be ""artsy"" in its pacing, cinematography, and dialogue. Though it tries to portray itself as a Greek-type morality and tragedy play (i.e., ""are we becoming the same monsters we're killing?""), it largely fails.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ********************************** The story progression is predictable. I could easily foresee every ""plot twist,"" such as the phone bomb scenario. We knew the little girl was going to somehow reenter the house. Likewise, Avner's tirade in the Jewish consulate was forced and predictable.<br/><br/>Spielberg has, of course, had many great successes. Despite the poignant subject matter, this film was 2.75 hours of my life that I wish I could get back."
"powerfull_jedi","4","1","4","18 May 2006"," So this is your solution, Mr. Spielberg?
","I felt a lot of things when the movie ended, convinced was not one of them. Munich follows the exploits of an assembled team of hit men assigned by the Prime Minister of Israel lead by Avner(Eric Bana) to take out the plotters of the terrible Munich terrorist homicide. Spielberg claims this movie was a tribute to the deceased athletes, but after I saw the movie I couldn't tell if he was honoring them or spitting on their graves. The story immediately starts with the Palestine terrorist group posing as athletes making their strike(by the way,don't be shocked by the little US-backs-up-the-talibans node, you'll see later in the film why they did this and but be shocked by the fact that in the movie we never learn why Black September did his). After the hostage situation(though we don't see exactly how it ends), we are treated with a briefing room where the Isreali PM Golda Mier(Lynn Cohen) and his military intelligence plan the counter-strike,enter former PM bodyguard and Mossad agent Avner, who is selected for this job as they travel to various locations in both Germany and France, while Headquarters wires them money every now and then(Don't ask me why do they paid them in US dollars and why should they keep all the receipts), they spend most of the movie taking out all of their targets and occasionally buying inside information from «people who refuse to work for governments», that is until they realize someone else is also stalking them(we never know who they are and what's the CIA's part in all of this?) and Avner starts getting paranoid and questioning his assignment(and also having visions of the massacre he did not witness,odd to say the least), especially when some his teammates are killed one by one. For the most part, it's entertaining(but hardly Oscar material) even if a little long, there's a degree of graphic violence that can be quite shocking. The musical score is decent, however the storyline and the message it conveys is what turns people off. In case you didn't know, this was based on a book by George Jonas, who's source was supposedly a former Mossad agent, this source had approached another writer but he passed on it, citing that the source kept changing details and most of the stuff he mentioned didn't click. George Jonas's work has been pretty much debunked ever since, but Spielberg in the wake of the post 9-11 world decided to pick it up, give some spin and adjust the context, just like an old nasty forum topic,to be brought back to life like a zombie only to pray on the uninformed and on the easily influenced and on top of that it lectures as by blurring the clear line between justice and revenge(in a very childish manner, mind you) The plot often is so unclear(no explanation for Avner moving his family to New York, no background on Louis, sudden unexplained changes in the characters,a bomb maker who only knows how to defuse them, absurd murder situations, a PM who claims going after killer was against their values) it really feels like it was based off a fiction novel then an actual account of these supposed events. Jews are portraying as willing murderers and Palestinians are portrayed as just terrorist(though the plotters look like harmless and sociable types, gee, just like the Israeli athletes). In the end, Steven what you're saying is that your solution to something like 9/11 is: either a) pretend nothing happened and negotiate with terrorist(assuming of course, they won't do it again) or b) chase them down and in turn become the very thing they swore to destroy. So your solution is that self-defense is just as bad as being striked upon. And that World Trade Center shot basically says: The US hunting down Osama Bin Laden, his al-quaeda buddies and the countries who sponsor them is no different then Osama Bin Laden's disposable pawns killing hundreds of Americans, Spanish, British and others. Sadly, Steven, you fail to realize that unlike you, the President of The United States is responsible for the safety and freedom of his people and the free world and I doubt bringing Osama to justice is against their moral values. Make no mistake it's a decent thriller, but it's best not to take the facts the movie throws at you as gospel. But if you want a movie that explores the difference between justice and revenge in a more mature fashion without preaching go watch Batman Begins(Yes, seriously)."

","I really find it hard to believe that all the hype concerning Munich fails to even mention a film entitled ""Sword of Gideon"" that was made some 20 years earlier. That film, starring Steven Bauer, Rod Steiger and Michael York raised the same moral issues as Munich but in a much more subtle way. I found Spielberg's ""hit you over the head"" commentary on the moral of the film condescending. I also believe the acting in ""Sword of Gideon"" was much better. The story line in ""Sword of Gideon"" was more logical and left the viewer with very few unanswered questions regarding its development.<br/><br/>I really think somebody (hopefully an honest critic) should compare the two movies so that others can learn of the existence of ""Sword of Gideon and then decide for themselves which movie is better."

","Munich takes a bold look at the MidEast conflict by examining the 1972 Munich massacre and it's aftermath. Steven Spielberg, widely revered in both Hollywood and the Jewish community, puts his neck out by (finally) criticizing Israel and it's politics, if just a little. Israel would make you think it's an anti-semitic film, but in actuality it is a fair look at the pros and cons of both political views. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig lead a Israeli assassin squad ordered to hunt down and kill all those responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes. While the movie has some really exciting scenes and tries to be fair, it is way too long and sometimes seems lost, like it doesn't know which direction it wants to go next. Spielberg could have easily trimmed a half hour of fat off the film. There were some really good scenes in the movie, but they were few and far between. I commend Spielberg for taking risks and giving Palestinians a few moments in the movie to speak; i just wish he packed up all the good stuff in a tighter package. 6/10"

","With the splendid ""21 Hours at Munich"" in the back of my mind I sat down to watch Spielbergs doc-drama or perhaps fleshing out of the latter. The overshadowing question that gradually develops for me long before the first half of the movie has passed by is, where is this movie going or what is it about? Several clues might be found in the first assassination in the film of a write/translator who to an engaged audience praises the power of the narrative and equally throughout a recurring theme of a never ending replacement of 'targets/names'. The new target/name, we discover, far worse than the first and perhaps not so dissimilar to the dialog which struggles to reflect on events. As a snippet from the dialog at the end of the film sounds, '...I could go on and on ...'. And so it does only tempting the audience through change of exotic era-true cosmopolitan scenery and clockwork-carnage."
"Chris_Docker","2","1","4","14 February 2006"," Spielberg goes out his comfort zone - was it worth it?
","As someone with limited sympathy for the politics of either Israel or Palestine, I went to see this film with no little degree of trepidation. As the film got under way, I felt I might be pleasantly surprised. It was a thriller, based on a historical incident, and well-told. With the demise of the Cold War, stories about secret service plots, espionage and counter-intelligence seem too few on the ground, and criticising a Spielberg film for being pro-Jewish seems as silly as criticising James Bond for being pro-British.<br/><br/>The film takes the 1972 terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich as its starting point and then follows one of the hit squads assigned to revenge the attack (it is based on a book that straddles fiction and non-fiction lists called 'Vengeance').<br/><br/>As targets are identified - some of them a bit too old to have been the young Munich assassins - they are wiped out with varying degrees of skill, lack of skill, or bungling. The assassinations generally inflict unintended civilian casualties, and the assassinated are quickly replaced - often by better and more numerous terrorists.<br/><br/>Avner, the leader of our hit-squad sent by Israel's intelligence service (Mossad), eventually starts to succumb to doubts about the legitimacy, effectiveness and morality of the operation, as well as general paranoia (some of which seems reasonable) about whether the mercenaries selling him information are also selling information about his own whereabouts to enemies, or whether Mossad will endanger him and his family if he chooses not to take further missions.<br/><br/>This is where it all goes badly astray. Spielberg excels as a storyteller, not as a philosopher. With the remarkable Schindler's List, he told a story of bravery, of the non-violent and successful resistance and escape from the Nazis. The heroes were clearly defined and worthy of universal admiration. With Munich, he forces us to consider the current Middle East situation, where neither side is universally considered blameless. Avner's musings about the wrongness of violence are unconvincing and impotent. Although the film includes a few shots of Palestinian hardship, it nevertheless came across to me as a confused apologia for Israeli over-retaliation - in a similar ilk to Oliver Stone's cancellation of US guilt in Vietnam in 'Born on the Fourth of July' ('it was bad but necessary / well-intended, so let's move on').<br/><br/>Spielberg said he wanted the athletes to be remembered - but the film hardly shows them - you would be hard pressed to remember their names or anything about them from watching Munich. The martyrdom process that both the terrorists and Israeli assassins engender however is dwelt on for over two hours. It has come in for criticism from the Israeli government and the author of the book on which it is based. Spielberg said he hoped the film would produce discussion - it probably has and will, but possibly not of a useful or constructive kind. This, however, is my very personal view. By raising questions it might conceivably arouse productive debate within the Jewish community. My low rating is because it left such a bad taste in my mouth."

Anyone looking to catch up on their sleep will be pleasantly surprised. This thing sucked. Political ideologies aside, it was just plain boring. The fact that Israel sanctioned the assassination of the Munich terrorists would itself seem to foster an interesting enough screenplay but Spielberg manages to take any excitement and/or intrigue and bog it down with tiresome dialogue, bad accents and contrived characters. I found myself looking at my watch repeatedly wishing this steamer would end. Spielberg, check your ego at the door next time and leave the directing to someone with a pulse."

","I went to see this movie after watching the trailer and hearing about it a few weeks before its release. This was my kind of movie and i went to it with good hopes and an open mind. I am not the kind of person who gets political or hates Israel or the Arabs, i watch movies as movies. I must say that this movie could have been a lot better if many things were fixed. It felt all wrong to me. First of all this hit squad was sloppy and simply incompetent. Everything is sloppy and it makes this movie very unrealistic and it is difficult to buy the story from beginning to end. Avner is a poor leader, his source of intel is questionable, he is not a professional Mossad agent, the whole movie feels like he doesn't know what he is doing. He is supposed to be a highly trained agent, efficient and and a pro at what he does, his crew is underequipped and the bombmaker turns out to botch several jobs. This top secret hit squad is supposed to be so clandestine that not even Mossad can contact him, but since many of the missions are disasters, eventually Avner himself gets tracked down. The dialogue is confusing, and frankly there is too much of it. I feel the people who made this movie tried to do too much with it and ultimately made it confusing, unclear, and long and boring. What needs to be changed is this... Less talk, more killing, a more realistic hit squad, and some clarity on this source guy. Mossad should have been giving intel to Avner. There is so many things that feel wrong that it took away a lot from this movie. This movie was about revenge, ones conflict with himself about killing people who he doesn't even know did anything wrong, a government who sent a hit squad to kill arabs to scare the arab world, and make us think about whether all this killing will eventually end and there will be peace."
"bud11388","10","1","4","4 January 2006"," Munich: Spielberg's best film in years
","In my opinion, Munich is Steven Spielberg's best film since Saving Private Ryan. From the opening scene with a depiction of the Munich massacre to the very end in New York, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It was one of the few times that I could feel my pulse racing during a movie. Spielberg does a great job of building up the tension for each assassination attempt the Israeli team tries on the members of Black September. Each time it seems that something goes wrong so it leaves the audience guessing what will happen next. Munich moves like a thriller but also is a morality tale on violence and revenge. Every member of the team heavily risks their own lives to complete their mission. The greatest example of the toll the mission takes on the men is Eric Bana's character. He has to leave his wife and newborn daughter, almost gets killed by his fellow team member, and begins to question whether the people they are after are really tied to Munich or not. By the end of the film, he becomes so paranoid that he hardly sleeps and is always watching his back.<br/><br/>Without a doubt Munich is Spielberg's most provocative film yet. Schindler's List was more of a tale about one man's change of heart and Saving Private Ryan asked the question of how much is one person's life worth. But Munich asks what is the price for killing someone. It seems to show that there is a heavy price and no reward. The men they kill are replaced by worse people and each of the members of the team become physically and emotionally destroyed in the process.<br/><br/>Munich is not Spielberg's best film, that belongs to Schindler's List. But in my opinion it could come an easy second with Saving Private Ryan. Bana gives his best performance yet and should at least be nominated for Best Actor, if not win it. Spielberg should get his third Best Director Oscar as he proves once again that he can tackle any subject no matter how controversial. Although I have not yet seen all of the movies that have gotten Oscar attention I think that Munich is the best film of 2005. If you have not seen Munich yet, I suggest that you do and get the rare experience of seeing a movie that not only thrills you but also makes you think."

","I would like to disagree with comments that I've just read from pfarmer891 about Spielbergs Munich. I think that the main message was totally overlooked and your comments were mostly concentrated on facts that sometimes are useless. So what if the Fiction movie is not totally based on facts, but do you think you can actually get those facts straight in a conflict like this. If the movie ads on in order to created a clearer message, I believe it's not a crime. And I don't think that the message was the standard Hollywood ""why can't we be friends"". I thought it was the message of desperation and hopelessness about the situation in Middle East. And it makes the story even stronger when we look at out the same conflict in 2006 and realize that nothing has changed, because the violence has continued. If Spielberg would have taken sides, then that would've been a standard for the modern Hollywood - Israel is the victim and Muslims are all terrorists. I thought it was a very brave move by Spielberg to try to analyze the conflict from words of both Israelis and Palestinians. The ""safe house"" part of the movie might have seem ridiculous to you, but why, is it impossible now for people of those to nations to sleep under one roof? If you believe that, then the conflict is inevitable in your world. I think people who go to see this movie, should not come there trying to dissect every setting and decide if it can be fact or not, but look more deeply into the meaning of the film. Try to get rid of all the previous conceptions and just watch it from both sides and then see if you can decide who is right. I think that's the point, that it's no one. Too many people have died to naively believe that any of the allegations of the truth, be it from Israelians or Palestinians, can be justified."

","Mr. Spielberg has now sadly been drawn into this phenomenon we call terrorism. No civilized person will be allowed to be neutral on this subject in the coming years. Paving the way, as always, is the art world... heralding the coming of the subject of terrorism and the Middle East in particular as they invade popular culture and the debate begins to be democratized as it seeps out into the masses. <br/><br/>Before Cinema, Governments, Zealots and Radicals made their own rules, playing the power game of nationalism and politics free from the scrutiny of those they govern. Now, we are learning how deep the hatreds run among the players and how ruefully unprepared our elected officials are in combating it. Dramatized though it is in parts, Munich lets us peek at the sick momentum that builds within and without world events and the inevitable cause and effect that will ultimately, it seems, decide which group or cause will one day triumph. <br/><br/>I am saddened that Mr. Spielberg, who I'm sure, like all of us, would rather live in a world where there are no ugly realities to inspire such films as this, would feel compelled to tell the story of the Sword of Gideon. I long for the days when we could watch the summer blockbuster escapism, blissfully unaware that outside the theater was a desperate world fighting to remain civilized. The French arms-dealers who traffic in information and lives are such a great illustration of that time, swathed in their cultured hermitage, able to ignore the collateral costs of their family business with at least as much passion as they reserve for their cheeses and wine. <br/><br/>The Spielberg of the multiplex cinema generation has moved into darker, more uncomfortable waters, the only guide for the filmmaker and his audience is our own conscience. Here then is the echo of the mind that made E.T., Saving Private Ryan, Amistad and The Color Purple. He knows us so well, he's sure that inside we are as decent and civil as he is and he knows he merely has to show us the images and we will choose the right path. But they must be images we have not already been desensitized to, because the journey of Munich is not one we can observe from afar. In this journey we must be participants. Because we are of course active participants in the reality of Munich, in the debate about terrorism, in the prayer for a lasting peace, in the hope that men will someday care more about this world than they do the next world."

","""Munich"" is an very good movie but not Spielberg's best. I was alive at the time of the 1972 Olympics and watched the whole drama unfold on T.V. For many Americans, it was the first time we'd ever seen the ugly face of terrorism. This movie is that always dangerous combination, a docudrama, a film 'based upon real events.' In using George Jonas' 1984 book ""Vengeance,"" Spielberg makes a critical error, for the book was widely criticized as inaccurate by knowledgeable sources, including former Mossad chief Zvi Zamir. The film is up to the usual high standard of Spielberg's past work - the film is intensely interesting and has excellent production values. However, it succumbs to some idiotic B-movie staples of past Holly wood fare, such as have two opposing groups - one Israeli and one Palestinian - share the same safe house, in which they meet with guns drawn but later become pals and house mates. Ridiculous. I enjoyed the movie but Spielberg takes a surprisingly soft view on terrorism, considering that he is a Jew. The PLO and the Mossad agents come across as morally equivalent, a view I do not share. Spielberg descends - for at least part of the movie - into standard Hollywood ""Why can't we all be friends"" bathos. Pretty simplistic and not very good history either. This movie is a fine example of why it is dangerous to rely upon Hollywood and movies for an accurate view of history. ""Munich"" is fictional, but uninformed viewers may take it as fact, which is a disservice to those who died. If you want a better view of terrorism, rent ""The Battle of Algiers,"" a fictional movie but one universally praised for its accuracy. In fact, so accurate is ""Battle"" that would-be terrorists and also counter-terrorists screen the film. Of course, Spielberg's film is the better entertainment of the two, so pick on that basis. I give the film an 80 out of 100, or a 'B' grade. Nice effort but flawed. I wish he'd been willing to take a stronger stand morally. Whatever acts have been committed by both sides since then, Israelis were the victims at Munich, not the PLO."

","With Academy Award winning director Steven Spielberg's new film, ""Munich,"" he redeems himself for the past three years which have turned out disappointing films from him (Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, War of the Worlds, even AI) by going back to his Jewish roots and making a film whose topic affects his beliefs (as he did for ""Schindler's List""). He also tackles a genre he has rarely tackled before in his career: a thriller The events at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany are shown in four different parts throughout the film: Raid, Capture, Transport, and Tragedy. The film opens up with Spielberg's depiction of raid of the Israeli athlete's complex where Arab terrorist storm the building. With flawless editing by Michael Kahn, archive footage from 1972 is incorporated into the preceding event. However, even though the capture, transport, and tragedy aspects of Spielberg's depiction of the events is yet to be seen, it is the archive footage that tells what is happening and which provides the basis for the film's plot.<br/><br/>When the Israeli officials (including Golda Mier) decide to seek vengeance on those who killed the Israeli athletes at the Olympics, they propose to Avner (Eric Bana) to assassinate those who planned the Munich tragedy, with a team of other people played by Daniel Craig (aka the next 007), Mathieu Kassovitz, Hans Zischler, and Ciaran Hinds (in a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination).<br/><br/>However, while hired to assassinate, the team comes upon a number of obstacles from almost killing the pre-teen daughter of a target, to finding the targets by means of a headstrong Frenchman, killing an unplanned target, and the raging inner-demons of Avner's soul.<br/><br/>As Avner's soul progresses, he is haunted by the fact he can't see his wife and newborn daughter. Even when he hears his daughter say 'dada' on the phone, he breaks down completely and seeks for the woman he met in a bar. As his soul is ravaged by his inner-demons, he begins to come senile, even to the extent to sleeping a closet because he believes someone rigged in mattress with a bomb.<br/><br/>This film is the best of 2005, and Spielberg's movie of redemption for his aforementioned films. I can see Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director, Editing, Supporting Actor (Ciaran Hinds), Score (John Williams), Writing (Adapted), and Sound Editing."

The film was very violent, however, I believe the violent scenes were done in an appropriate way, if there is such a thing, so that it was more painful than absolutely, gut-wrenchingly gory--don't get me wrong, there are some of those scenes too, but the focus was more on the plot than the blood and guts.

"mryerson","Null","1","4","28 December 2005"," Munchen ist phantastisch
","I have seen Steven Spielberg's new film 'Munich'.<br/><br/>I am largely an admirer of Spielberg's body of work. I think Schindler's List a chilling, singular film of a harrowing story, some sequences in Saving Private Ryan as close to actual combat as anything I've ever seen in film and Duel a model of efficiency in storytelling on an obvious budget. To a lesser degree, I enjoy his science-fiction/fantasy although this is not my favorite genre.<br/><br/>And now he's made a film which takes its story from the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, by Palestinian 'terrorists'.<br/><br/>I use quotation marks here because the very term 'terrorist' has been so prostituted over the last forty years, made to serve obvious and, in some instances blatant, political agendas, it has become a largely useless term, it has become hard to know when it is being used truly to identify someone as a terrorist or even if terrorist is still a meaningful word at all.<br/><br/>I wondered here about Spielberg's choice to make this film and what exactly his 'story' would be. I trust Spielberg, I didn't want to be disappointed, but my antennae go up when a filmmaker decides to make a film, the very essence of which may turn on the pernicious usurpation of the term 'terrorist'.<br/><br/>Spielberg has been a gifted filmmaker from the beginning and, over the years, he has developed these gifts to a high degree. The film was visually and emotionally evocative, powerful will be a frequently used term. Nuance, however, has never been his hallmark, I wondered how deeply the contrasts would be drawn, how much black and how much white, how much gray.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a much greater filmmaker than I had imagined.<br/><br/>Oh, as drama, it has its faults. It seems overly long and some plot devices seem contrived, for instance, the general level of (in)competence displayed by the Israeli assassins should have been explored (it is not) and the family of French information brokers seemed implausible. But next to the remarkable achievement of successfully threading a moral needle which has eluded us all, these things grow pale indeed."

","Munich is one mess of a movie. Not because it is a bad movie. Matter of fact, it is an excellent movie.

In this case, you should know that Black September really happened, but it's the cause and affect that is being dealt to the public. It's the cause and affect this movie is really about. Whether the after-effect really happened, it doesn't matter. A mess was made and someone needs to clean it up. How do we fight fire? - with fire of course. How do you clean up a mess? - make a bigger mess.<br/><br/>That reminds me, this is a Spielberg movie that is nothing like the War of the Worlds he released earlier this year, but had the name not been used already, they could have called this one War of the Worlds, too. All the worlds - personal, political, familial, sociological, and any other you can think of - go off course and face possible annihilation. Gravity sucks you in and you can't escape. Maybe it was the black hole. No matter, you will become as engrossed in this movie. If you can forget about what you know politically or religiously, you will be ahead of the game.

You either need an interesting historical figure to base the movie around, or you need an interesting historical event that's on-screen progression will enthrall people. ""Bridge of Spies"" and ""Schindler's List"" had both of these elements. ""Munich"" has neither.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are all interchangeable with one another and have no real personality. The five members of Eric Bana's team are all the same person, except they each have a different skill.<br/><br/>The historical story chosen doesn't have anything of interest happening in it either. It is just a typical revenge story. Even more detrimental, it does not feel like there is a satisfactory conclusion to the story. It just isn't a very interesting piece of history to make into a three hour long movie.

The movie is well written, well shot, well acted, and well directed for the most part. There is one scene where the way it was put together was confusing.

","***Spoiler Alert*** In the movie ""Munich"" it provides a theatrical look at the events that happened to the Israeli Olympic Team in 1972, along with detailing the events that happened afterward, or the untold story. The untold story about how Israel sent a hit squad to kill the eleven people who orchestrated the kidnapping and massacre of the team. The hit squad is led by someone who is not used to being the lead man of a group of people who are put together just to kill people, Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana). He finds it hard in the beginning to kill people but after killing a couple of people he begins to find it easier and easier to do so. This ends up being the moral dilemma for him that he is killing people and doing a good job at it. As him and his team are going on about extracting vengeance he learns that now he one of the people being hunted. And then begins to see his teammates being executed. The lighting in the film also transition with the attitude that Avner is feeling and the distress that he is feeling. During the beginning of film when he first sets out to conduct his hit job the lighting is somewhat light but then as his team continues to kill and they are ones being hunted the lighting changes to dark along with the mood and the feelings that the team has for the killings. This film could be compared to very loosely to ""Windtalkers"" directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage where the ability to kill someone and losing your teammates becomes the theme of the movie."

"JAM-31","7","1","5","3 November 2007"," Enjoyed the movie, disagreed with the message.
","Spielberg has described ""Munich"" as his ""prayer for peace,"" and that theme has overshadowed most of the real events this film is based on. It tries to see the actions of both sides, Israeli commandos and Palestinian terrorists, as equal. This brings down the film in an idealistic and preachy way.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this film, I was very excited that Spielberg would be directing it. I thought he could bring attention to the way Israelis have suffered under terrorism in the way he brought attention to the holocaust in ""Schindler's List."" Most of what I know about the Munich massacre and its aftermath comes from Aaron J. Klein 's ""Striking Back,"" one of the most recent studies of the affair. What that work states is that the targets of ""Munich"" were high profile PLO members. The Israelis were anxious to fight offensively, not defensively, against Arab terrorists. Most of their targets did not have a direct hand in planning Munich. But in the film Eric Bana's ""Avner"" is not informed of this until the end, and it is presented to us as if the Israeli government is being shady, just eliminating people it had old rivalries with. The purpose of these assassinations was 1. to prevent terrorists from committing future attacks, 2.to deter terrorists by making them feel unsafe, wherever they were by knowing that while they sought the murder of Jews, they too could never sleep soundly at night, and 3. revenge.<br/><br/>""Munich"" doesn't express well enough the motives for the reprisal killings, and the Israelis who take part in the operations are depicted as too somber and glum--Israel could not survive if its agents and leaders acted this way. Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, in the film, states the film's often quoted line, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" In reality, Meir knew well that the perpetrators needed to be hunted down and punished, mercilessly. The impact of the targeted killings, especially the operation ""Spring of Youth"" in Lebanon, is not given proper significance in the film. ""Munich"" implies that each of these missions was a bloody, unnecessary mess that lead to more tit-for-tat violence. ""Spring of Youth"" made Israel's enemies look at the Mossad with tremendous fear and awe; that Israeli agents could hunt down and kill supreme heads of the PLO in an Arab country, while their targets lay in their own beds. The ""deterrence"" motive definitely seems to have been achieved by these operations. Although controversial, ""targeted killings"" have proved to be very effective. Israel brings the threat of death to those who plan terrorist attacks, and as a result, the terrorists spend 90% of their time hiding and only 10% of their time planning attacks. Avner says in the film, ""Those we killed are being replaced by worse."" This is a myth held by the world. True, everyone is replaceable, but often when a highly experienced, skilled, and charismatic Arab terrorist is killed, his replacement is a young person who can't understand the intructions of his weapons because they are in Farsi. Targeted kills are a blow to their organizations, and it is particularly demoralizing to terrorists when their ""best"" leaders are elminated.<br/><br/>My other complaint about ""Munich"" is that it feels rushed. Spielberg needed to slow down here, and he should have story-boarded the film. The Munich massacre is sped through too quickly, and there should have been more about how the Germans, with no anti-terror squad at the time, maddeningly bungled the rescue mission of the athletes. What Spielberg instead focused on was the violence (this is one of his bloodiest and most gruesome films to date). The final sequences, involving a concoction of scenes of Abner having rough, sweaty sex with his wife and the murder of the athletes, is bizarre and does not sit well. Many might find it offensive.<br/><br/>What do I like about the film? Well, at least Spielberg tried to make a personal film about the conflict. You can tell that his heart goes out to both sides in an idealistic way. The cinematography, lighting, set pieces, vehicles and costume design appear authentic and dead-on. It has a suspenseful opening and tense moments throughout. It is skillfully cast and all the actors do very well--especially Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Omar Metwally, and Daniel Craig, who needed more scenes. Craig is the toughest, most gung-ho character and has the more memorable lines in the film, like ""Don't f**k with the Jews,"" and ""The only blood I care about is Jewish blood."" The movie gives us great exotic locales and interesting character faces, and a noir-ish feel with a look into a shadowy world of espionage. The film seems at times more about the toll taken on government agents who do hard and ugly things loyally for their governments than about Israel and the Palestinians.<br/><br/>What we have in the end is a film that wears its heart on its sleeve. It is Spielberg's ""prayer for peace,"" with some loss in accuracy as a casualty. Grade: B."

","I have to disagree with most of the critics. This film is not a masterpiece, but nothing more than a propaganda manifesto of political correctness, currently very much ""in vogue"" in 'developped western societies'. I rarely mix politics and films, but considering the aim and message of this movie, I cannot help myself from doing so in this case. I will therefore refrain from commenting on the technical and artistic aspects of the film and concentrate on the essence, which is highly politicized (to avoid any misunderstandings, I would like to clarify I am not Jewish, nor do I have any affiliation whatsoever with Jews or Israel).<br/><br/>This is a typical case of a film praised by all only because it has been made by a great director, and it carries a message almost everybody nowadays wants to hear: hear no evil, see no evil... It is far too simple to sit and preach peace on earth for all from a quiet place and at a safe distance, totally out of contact with reality, the harshness of the real world. Unfortunately, the reality is very much different from the one seen by looking out of a window of a multi-million dollar Villa in Hollywood. Life is a brutal game of survival; always has been, always will be. No matter how much we would like to think that the world is now a better place, that humans have evolved to being a non-aggressive, peace-loving species, the truth is nothing has ever changed since the dawn of time. We are still the same power-thirsty animals, fighting for dominance and survival. Only the means and the form of that fight have changed. We are fooling ourselves if we think that after the end of the cold war, now the world will quietly settle down and cuddle into an eternal period of universal peace. How blindsided can one get? There are wars everywhere, massacres perpetrated daily...<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the end of the cold war, the Russians still like to think of themselves as a superpower, they still see themselves as the 'anti-western' power, they still fear us and hate us, nothing has changed. The Chinese, very much the same. Do we honestly think they are our friends? Or do we prefer to do so because it is good business? The 'Islamic nation' on the other hand, is a story to itself. Do we really think we can simply sit together with the fundamentalists and talk it over? 'Talk it over' with people whose major ambition is to blow themselves up in order to try to kill one of us? Do we really think that they will be content with any kind of agreement? It hurts to think that so many people can be so foolish to believe such nonsense nowadays. Have we already forgotten the scenes of jubilation on the 'arab street' after 9/11? Mark my words: they will not stop before either they destroy us, or we destroy them..., whether we like it or not!<br/><br/>Freedom and peace are not a given, they have always come at a price. If we want to continue being free and to live in peace, we will have to fight for it. Just wishing for it to happen is not good enough! That is an important lesson we must never forget and remember to teach our children. This is why I consider the message that the film bears not only to be bad, incorrect or unrealistic; I consider it dangerous."

The Director (Spielberg) is a notorious supporter of the dovish Israeli ""Left,"" and someone who wants to disarm the American people with the exception of government employees and his own bodyguards. The screenwriter has stated on more than one occasion that the nation of Israel should not exist.<br/><br/>I'm Jewish myself as well as an American Reserve officer holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel so I guess nobody can point and claim that I'm an anti-Semite. But more than anything, I'm an American who knows what's needed for the survival of the world's democracies.<br/><br/>This movie is very well done and as with all well done propaganda pieces, the underlying themes are slowly revealed in the later half. These include: (A)Arab terrorists just want a little understanding. (B) Israeli's are a cold hearted bunch of efficient killers. (C) The only claim that Jews have to their biblical homeland is their ability to take it from the misunderstood Arabs (although few Arabs lived their prior to the late 1800's and they were mostly tenant farmers for Ottoman Turkish absentee landlords). (D) Finally, the most all consuming philosophy: ""Violence is never the answer to violence."" And with that last bit of nonsense, the movie ends and you are left to wonder why America fought the American Revolution, World War I, World War II, etc. You are left to ponder whether anything is really worth fighting for because everything is relative and there is neither good or bad. There is no difference between violence or responding to violence for self-defense or national survival.<br/><br/>How could such a well made movie make one feel so empty! Maybe because in spite of all it's violence, ""Munich"" is devoid of any sense of direction."

","You come to expect certain things for a Spielberg movie, namely a great story, direction and flavor.<br/><br/>Munich possesses few of those qualities.<br/><br/>Being vaguely familiar with the events which inspired the movie, I eagerly awaited Spielberg's take on the story. While not quite expecting Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, I sincerely thought that this movie was an Oscar candidate.<br/><br/>The movie starts out well enough, but seems to lag at times towards the end. The lack of depth of the characters, save for Eric Bana's, is the ultimate failure here. What Spielberg did for a couple grunts in Saving Private Ryan (Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Hanks, Adam Golberg and Vin Diesel), he is unable to recapture here.<br/><br/>We don't care what happens. People are being sought out and executed in a systematic fashion. You almost feel bad for the targets...almost. I do not believe that to be Spielberg's intent, as the film is supposed to illustrate to Mossad's quest to bring to justice those responsible.<br/><br/>The movie is far too long and runs out of steam. Too little is done with locations and the only other saving grace, other than Bana, is the performance given by Michael Lonsdale (Papa). 6/10."

","Steven Spielberg's name on the promos initially seemed like a stamp of quality. But soon, my curiosity faded when Munich which munched on and on for nearly three hours which really let me down. But, it's not too bad either. The gusto with which the movie begins makes it seem like re-creation of an action flick from history. The impeccable Spielberg stuff is seen in the film's technical stuff which can transport a viewer to the 1970's and makes one empathize the deaths of the athletes at the games.<br/><br/>Munich is the story of the aftermath of 11 Israeli athletes being killed by a Palestinian terrorist group called Black September during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Four Agents of Mossad which is the Israeli version of CIA are under the leadership of Avner, (played by Eric Bana better known for his role as Hector in Troy) are sent for assassination of those responsible for the Munich massacre in what was historically called the ""Operation Wrath of God"". These men who are chosen by the Prime Minister Golda Meir herself are to leave their families for an indefinite time till their job is done.<br/><br/>The movie shows some gruesome assassinations and the errors that they make which actually make the movie far more realistic than the usual smooth action flicks. You see, Spielberg had a historical story to stick to. But in his eagerness to portray the feelings of the protagonist about the assassinations and his pining for his family, the movie was at least stretched by 20 minutes. The worst thing is that the movie's best points are made in those stretched parts. This one is only for those who love watching slow movies.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"
"myr-2","2","1","5","28 March 2006"," Mr. Spielberg disappoints again
","This movie continues the trend of mediocre or outright weak movies by Mr. Spielberg that started IMHO with ""Minority Report"". ""Munich"" has quite a few technical flaws that leave an impression that the story was too big for a director to handle. Also, there were a few instances (may be more than a few, but I'm not a historian) when actual facts have been manipulated to fit the story. This is particularly wrong when author positions himself as an ""independent"" and ""not taking sides"". The acting was very good though, Bana has done a brilliant work. Unfortunately, bright acting with poor directing doesn't leave much better impression than bad acting itself. All in all, in recent years Mr. Spielberg has been far more successful producing rather than directing."

","""Munich"" is not about Munich. Nor is it about events which followed the massacre of Israeli athletes. It is about Steven Spielberg's ego. And how far into audacious he can drive it without becoming Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>This movie's tagline boasts, ""The world was watching in 1972 as 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. This is the story of what happened next."" Well, not exactly. It's what author George Jonas, screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, and film-maker Steven Spielberg *think* happened next.<br/><br/>""Munich"" opens with a brutally-graphic hostage-taking sequence; Palestinian guerrilla group Black September killing and cudgeling the Israeli barracks into submission; news programs worldwide replaying that famous footage of the masked terrorist on the balcony we all remember watching obliviously as kids.<br/><br/>But before this sequence  four glib words: INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS - simultaneously endowing the movie with *faux* import whilst granting Spielberg ""artistic license""  in other words, granting him the impunity to lie off the hook. The source material for this film solely being Jonas' self-admittedly uncorroborated book (""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team""), makes this movie as much a fantasy as ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark."" <br/><br/>As Lew Wallace's decorative details in ""Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ"" (1880) achieved ""fact"" status simply through their compelling documentation in a powerful work of art, (even though the supposed Christian source tome, the King James Bible, is devoid of those details), it is only a matter of time before Spielberg's fiction will be regarded as doctrine if no further documentation of these events is made. (I doubt anyone will remember Michael Anderson's ""Sword Of Gideon"" in 1986  lesser movie, from same book.) <br/><br/>Eric Bana (still trim, taut and Troy-riffic from his last feature) is Avner, a Jewish family man and Mossad agent, called upon by Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Mier (Lynn Cohen) to lead a covert team in blood-revenge for the Munich massacre. Much is made over Mier's rationalization of morality  every ""Munich"" reviewer revels in flaunting her line - yet Mier only verbalizes (euphemistically, at best) how every individual behaves in every situation they encounter  by ""negotiating compromises with their own values"", i.e. using ""circumstantial morality"". There is *no* Kantian ""outside morality""; it is *all* Nietzschean nihilism. Truth cuts to cure. Was it not blood retribution that George W. Bush called for (admittedly less articulately) in retaliation against September 2001's terrorist attacks? Did not America rally behind him like maniacal rednecks out for Middle Eastern blood? <br/><br/>Where was your morality then, Christians?<br/><br/>More intriguing than morality conundrums is the mindset that would allow a person to pawn themselves out to a government who admit openly that they will deny your existence - and probably try to make you *truly* non-existent  simply for performing a duty for your country. (Maybe the government stance on anyone sociopathic enough to accept their ""uncivilized"" assignments in the first place, is to summarily excise those unbalanced personalities from society.) Whether the vengeance squad questioned the morality of their actions is simply ""writer's speculation"", and is a storytelling staple akin to anthropomorphizing animals: to add dramatic flesh to the plot and to better identify with the characters  but can people who enter into such one-way self-sacrifices be understood or ""humanized"" at all?<br/><br/>Avner's team, four misfits from various middle-class walks of life, includes Robert the toymaker-turned-bombmaker (Mathieu Kassovitz), who bears a disturbing resemblance to Arnold Horshack, and who pulls the short straw to perform the first execution with Avner. In a flustered scene, their hesitancy at pulling the triggers whilst facing their target - questioning the target insistently with no defining answers - illustrates that even with purchased ""intelligence information"", Avner still has deep-rooted doubts as to whether their targets are the actual terrorists. But again, we must ask: when the original Mossad agent dictated his tale to George Jonas, did he merely add this trait to his personality to humanize himself? Or did Jonas add this element to elicit sympathy for the titular ""heroes"" exacting revenge - for without this hesitancy in killing, wouldn't that make them as evil as the terrorists they were executing? <br/><br/>Avner's operatives complete 5 of the 11 killings before the movie  and, we presume, the piecemeal intel the real-life assassins had to work with - runs out of steam. Munich's powerful performances, masterful cinematography and direction are tempered by its slipshod conclusion, which leaves no resolution to the storyline (supposedly ""true"", so left dangling and expecting forgiveness), and a hundred rhetorical questions in its wake: does retaliation benefit economically or politically?; how does a retaliatory individual or nation return to their former steady state?; will Arnold Horshack ever graduate?...<br/><br/>Having wiped the term ""politically incorrect"" from his vernacular after ""Jaws"", ""revenge killing"" would seem outside the Spielberg canon  but as long as both predators and prey in ""Munich"" sport indeterminate Middle Eastern accents, Spielberg could rest assured that ruffled feathers would only belong to pundits unimportant to the funding and distribution of the film. Minority groups could whine over unfair depictions, but their placarding of theaters and seeking of reparations would only lend impetus to the film in the western-dominated avenues where it is slated to reap its income.<br/><br/>Anyway, after the bloodlust directed at all Middle Easterners after the 9/11 debacle (in such an arbitrarily juvenile manner that Public Service Announcements had to be aired actually describing the ideological, religious and national differences between foreigners of Middle Eastern descent), how much does White America *really* care about Arab nations assailing each other's jugulars - in a world INSPIRED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG?<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

I think Eric Bana did a good job with what he was giving, but was actually sad I went to the theatre to see it. I would have enjoyed it better at home on DVD, so I could pause at some point to PEE. If this were a docu-drama by some first timer, it would have been o.k. But fell way short of my expectations. I wasn't old enough to witness the actual events, or hear about them on T.V. The first 15 minutes or so, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. The heart of this movie could have been completed in a 30 second p.s.a.

","This was certainly one of the best movies that I have ever seen, I enjoyed the more 'realistic' and personal view of the Israeli retaliation against the Palistinians' terror attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Also, the tension in the movie only builds as the end nears, outlining the dilemma that a person in any comparable or metaphorical situation must face when making such a decision. The dilemma is whether or not 'action' will solve anything, will make the situation better off than beforehand and in retrospect, be worth it in light of what might happen as a result. Anyhow, I think that it is unfortunate that King Kong has grossed twenty times more than Munich so far, Kong was good, but Munich was definitely better.

I suppose everyone breathes a sigh of relief 'he read BOTH sides of the story' well no actually because if anyone cared to really uncover the truth behind the truth, you would find the world a very chilling place to be, where you would take the life of your own just to make the other seem the villain. Pathetic really since those responsible have to lie behind smoke screens and continuously remind the world of what has been done and is being done on a daily basis to them when they commit worse on their neighbours.<br/><br/>Spielberg loses credibility when he pushes forth a distorted and rather shameful one sided opinion, but then again, he is what he is.

","Apparently the film ""Sword of Gideon"" was not enough when it came to depicting the Israeli response to the terrorist attack on the Israeli Athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Mr. Spielberg had to make his own version with the help of talentless gay playwright Tony Kushner. Spielberg's version is anti-Israeli to the core and usually can be counted on to pay homage to any unpleasant trait any Jew might have (and share with the rest with the human race). There is an excellent documentary (""One Day in September"") on the events at Munich but many of those who see Spielberg's ""Munich"" may not have seen that documentary .Things that should have been emphasized about what occurred in Munich get lost in the run-through that Spielberg has provided to begin the film. That no one among the geniuses of the police and media was capable of thinking that the terrorists might have television sets is frankly even now beyond belief. (There were even battery TV's that terrorists could carry with them in those years.)Roone Arledge and his wide world of sports helped kill the Israeli wrestling team in a way few would think possible.<br/><br/>Spielberg's ""Munich"" trashes everything in a similar way.

"hairgrow","4","1","6","22 October 2006"," Three wrongs don't make a right
","The story: During the summer Olympics in Munich 1972, the Israeli delegation are attacked and killed by Palestinian terrorists, who want the world's attention for the lack of a Palestinian state. In an attempt to strike back, the Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency) appoint a bodyguard (Eric Bana) to lead a strike-team. Their mission: To kill 11 people responsible for this and other terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>The verdict: While the attack is a historic fact, it's blatantly obvious Spielberg either didn't do any research or has been terribly ill informed when accepting the rest of the script. (Another possibility could be poetic license, as ""inspired by real events"" is stated at the beginning of the movie). Anyone reading this knowing anything about the Mossad, the world most organized and respected intelligence service, will probably laugh of the idea that they would use a couple of guys with regular jobs who've never killed before for such delicate missions.<br/><br/>With this in mind, the film becomes almost unwatchable and certainly way too long. There is some reasonable acting, some quality pictures, but never did I have the feeling of watching a film that justified it's huge budget. Spending just a few dollars more on a reasonable script could have made this okay. Instead, it's boring most of the time and has a couple of very funny moments (not a good sign for a movie about such a serious subject). The script proves it's awfulness once more near the end, showing Bana having memories of events he wasn't even near at the time they happened. Depending on your mood, this scene can be either appalling or hilarious.<br/><br/>Concluding: The Palistinians should stop killing innocent people, the Isreali should stop building a wall on ground that isn't rightfully theirs and Spielberg should stop turning turd-like scripts into movies. Three wrongs don't make a right."

","OK, Spielberg never claimed he was going to be impartial, and he is a Jew, but I still find taking sides so obviously greatly detracts from the film (I have no sympathy for the Palestinians, incidentally). This film is a plain glorification of, and propaganda for, Mossad. What I find particularly unashamed is the charming way the hit squad's informers are portrayed -marvellously polite & articulate, building a loyal relationship with Havner in spite of all their talking to the contrary, living as an extended family in a sunny farmhouse in France, the whole place packed with a classroomful of cute children and sexy ladies... Come on, Mr Spielberg! Why couldn't they be some shady hi-tech gangsters housed in the back of a brothel? Much more likely, too! And are we supposed to believe that Mossad outsources its information-gathering activity? And that someone exists who can fill that job? The one scene I really hate is when the Mossad hit squad and the Palestinians meet in the same safe house by chance (!) and both sides not only survive the encounter but they even choose to shack up together for the night!! It appears Spielberg always must include a situation which is remotely ""funny"" even in so serious a film as this, but that scene made me loose my suspension of disbelief completely. Lastly, I notice the film shows more than two Israeli athletes being murdered by the Palestinians during the initial assault -has Steven researched the subject that well, or is he just taking an artistic licence? Personally I would much rather he had stuck to the main facts as they stand, even if that means having to spare an extra gory scene with an Israeli victim."

The scenes depicting the Munich massacre were terribly realistic, but the terrorist when shown a few years later on was made to look like a Sunday School teacher. The five Israeli assassins did not come across as being particularly serious about their profession or even care that much about the assignment. When required to shoot their first target they fumbled so much I couldn't decide whether this was deliberate direction or misdirection. The movie had the assassins using different weapons, but apart from the obvious advantage of say, remotely detonated explosives over strangulation the movie didn't really explain why the different attack methods were deployed. The movie only hinted twice that the assassins were careful enough to clean up after themselves. Not only were they not thorough, they ran away from the scene. This would never have happened in real life. The assassins handled on site equipment without wearing gloves or even trying to destroy fingerprints. The director should know that forensic experts can find fingerprints on exploded surfaces. Also if a revolver is used, there are no spent cartridges to leave behind as clues as to what weapon was used. The movie didn't show how the informer managed to get any of his in"

It sets you on a roller coaster, the good parts, true to Spielberg's roots, being the action parts that pump adrenaline into your system and shock you. The bad parts, especially the last half hour, are painfully slow and empty. My biggest problem with these parts is the lack of any sort of imagination. In the beginning and throughout its best parts, Spieberg uses neat camera tricks and well-timed scene cuts that capture the audience and make you jump in your seat. But as the movie progresses, it becomes less imaginative and more clichéd. By the end, the only thing to his credit is the Spielberg lets you feel how tense the character feels. And then the movie just ends at an unclimactic scene and then the (sadly) now typical written words scroll the story of future events to bring some sort of closure to the story. This is inexcusable after a 3 hour movie. It is amazing how the ""well written"" movies of our day defy the simplest rules of writing and cut the ""end"" out of ""beginning, middle, end."" The message was a cliché about the meaning of home and failed to carry any weight, especially in the end when they rush to try and force it on the audience seemingly to compensate for the action scenes. The acting, especially by Bana, was great. Geoffrey Rush didn't bring much to the table, which disappoints me, but at least he didn't take things off of it and it was fun to see him. In the end, just as War of the Worlds failed capture the imagination and magic of his previous sci-fi films, Munich lacks Schindler and Private Ryan's weight, brilliant consistency, message, and ability to stay with you beyond the walk to your car."

The problem most likely is that only so much of the actual events are known. There are some mysteries that remain to this day I suppose. The movie gets a bit into the ideologies to most likely humanize the Mossad and the Terrorists. I think that since we are bombarded with the events of the middle east every day it wasn't important to include the discourse.

Speiberg throws in a little sex and mixes violence in the oddest creepy way just like Schindlers list. This is the total moral collapse since his great debut Duel. I forgot.

","Let me just get this off my chest before I start so you people know where I stand. When it comes to books to movies and historical movies I do not care for artistic license. This movie is included. I understand that the violence and revenge is futile in the middle-east. But after the '67 war and the Munich terrorist attack you want me to believe that a special agent born and raised in Israel whose father was some apparent Israeli hero feels remorse for killing Palestinian terrorist leaders who feel no remorse at all? The movie is good no doubt but for someone who actually knows the times and the history then the idea of this becoming some sort of internal conflict wouldn't have happened....as it obviously didn't. If you would make a movie about a Israeli soldier in the wars after '67 Mr.Spielberg going through this type of struggle then I would believe it. I'm sorry but some character development is just not believable from the start."

The film is composed of repeated and not so inspired scenes that set up and show violence, each scene a little different, each scene a little tense, but each scene 'no name brand' action all the way. Stock characters, stock scenes. No villains. Who's a villain, the fat diplomat-guy sitting at his desk whose daughter plays the piano? Maybe he is, but from the movie's perspective we don't even know him. Not enough depth. No heroes: even Avner is not really well drawn. We got platitudes from his mother, and faithfulness from his wife. You don't ever see Palestinian counter-planning. And to think, Spielberg has been accused for being even-handed, or making the Israeli-Arab conflict into something smacking of moral equivalence. Not true. Had you seen Palestinian strategy at work you might have had a case to make for moral equivilance. But this flick was derivative of lots of other movies. ""Capone"" showed the possibility of a little girl getting blown-up in a bomb in a more dramatic way than did this movie. We got a touch of Hitchcock, a touch of the Le Carre spy who grows weary of the game. On and on. And it was all too long. And that shot of the Twin Towers? (They're coming here, too!)

It had slim to no character development, so much so that I hardly cared when most of the Israeli crew was knocked off. The execution of the entire story was immensely dull. It's like the producers sat down with the author of the book this is adapted from and had the following discussion:<br/><br/>""How can we make a film reminding people of the horrible atrocity at Munich, but still give it enough of a plot to make people want to see it?""<br/><br/>""How about we make it a revenge story?!

The argument has been made that, though the history may be flawed, the film should be judged on it's artistic merits. That is all well and good, but when filmmakers, especially those with the influence of a Spielberg, adjust history to fit their worldviews, people in the real world are influenced and may suffer. The fact is that a group of terrorists, who spoke in terms of martyrdom, and in the midst of a wave of global terrorism, decided to target unarmed athletes at the 1972 ""Olympics of Peace.""<br/><br/>Israel's response was reasonable and measure, if not without mistakes, undertaken by professionals to target those involve in an ongoing campaign to kill its citizens. Spielberg's naked attempt to draw some kind of moral equivalence is vile. In totalitarian states that sponsor terrorism and teach their children suicidal hatred, fanciful plays on reality such as this are of no consequence. But in democratic societies, were voters are influenced by largely fictional films pushing the phrase ""inspired buy actual events,"" voters are moved and policies influence, which can and do put real people at risk. <br/><br/>I'm sure, however, that opinions like this count for nothing in the semi-reality that Spielberg lives in."

It seemed no expense was spared in getting the 70s look. I wonder though if Munich was a German production (it would be called München) what tone it would take.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig (pre-Bond) is a standout in this compelling movie, and it's as though Munich primed Mr Craig to be 007, who wouldn't be afraid to go to Tripoli to achieve his goals on behalf of the Government.<br/><br/>Sure there are a duplicity of complex moral issues in Munich (Germans know it as München). Interestingly, the title of the movie, the name of the city that hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics resonates to the point that the title of the movie is just that, Munich, not something like a verb.<br/><br/>The end scene where Avner (Eric Bana) has sex with his wife, intercut with scenes of the gruesome deaths of the Israeli hostages on the Munich air strip at the hands of the terrorists, was I'm afraid ludicrous and tacky in my humble opinion. I'm surprised no- one exercised any veto on this. I mean really, it would be akin to John and Laura being the beast with two backs in Don't Look Now, intercut with whatever gruesome occurs in the movie, or Nick Curran banging Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct, intercut with scenes of Johnny Boz being ice-picked to death. I can only wonder what the relatives of the Israeli hostages thought when they saw this scene. If aliens, well more specifically E.T. were to land on earth and watch the Munich sex scene for the first time, they would get a rather grossly distorted view of sex amongst humans I guess.<br/><br/>Sadly this fine movie airbrushed the very insignificant event of Mossad's revenge going tragically too far by murdering the wrong person, a Moroccan-born waiter named Ahmed Bouchiki, who had no part at all in the events at Munich."

","Munich (2005): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, Marie-Josee Croze, Ciaran Hinds: Place and time regards the aftermath of the 1972 murders of 11 Israeli athletes and the squad sent to terminate those responsible. Director Steven Spielberg succeeds in realism with a powerful setup then it becomes repetitious as the team tracks and kills its targets with various bomb devices. One flaw is its inability to involve viewers. That is not usually the case with a director such as Spielberg but this is not a high point in his career. Basically, this is no Schindler's List. Eric Bana leads the mission but the role is one note until the second half of the film where he examines the vengeance and the paranoia overlooking his life. In supporting roles are Geoffrey Rush and Daniel Craig as well as Marie-Josee Croze who are at the mercy of characters that never seem to come to life. Their roles are more observed than developed and that is a major drawback. This is unfortunate considering the talent in front and behind the camera involved and how flat the material becomes. Strong theme regarding revenge and whether it is warranted. Spielberg doesn't applaud revenge so much as address its madness and whether or not it actually resolves. The film is technically well made showcasing European photography but for Spielberg it is secondary to his masterpieces. Score: 5 / 10"

","Steven Spielberg knows how to make a movie. He has such a knowledge and understanding of the medium that is truly unparallelled. He was probably born to do it, and he proves it every time, even when he (sort of) fails. Munich is not his best work, not even close (I would say it's on par with Lincoln, maybe with Amistad, but far below Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan among his more political movies), but the opening sequence in itself is a testimony to his formidable talents.<br/><br/>That sequence, the recreation of the terrorist attack and massacre at the 1972 Summer Olypics, is no less shocking and effective than the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. The way it was shot and edited reminded me of Paul Greengrass's in-your-face documentary style (United 93, Captain Phillips) that makes you feel you are really there in the middle of events. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not really live up to the beginning, though it raises important moral questions and never feels oversimplifying. It just cannot sustain the level of suspense and since its core message (nothing is ultimately black-and-white and revenge may not bring peace and resolution) is not really new, the movie becomes somewhat boring as it drags on a bit too long.<br/><br/>Eric Bana, however, is great, as always.

","Munich (2005)<br/><br/>In the wake of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, a team of Mossad agents are tasked with hunting down those responsible.<br/><br/>After a gripping re-enactment of the Black September Palestinians storming the Olympic village, intercut seamlessly with archive footage, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) puts together a team to seek revenge. A potential maelstrom of dodgy accents (Australians Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush playing Israelis, English Daniel Craig playing a South African) is mercifully avoided and the team start working down their list of eleven Palestinians who are in hiding throughout Europe.<br/><br/>Here are the stronger moments of Munich; the early assassinations are tightly paced set-pieces where Avner's (Eric Bana) hesitance to murder people is apparent. Eric Bana is excellent as the tortured Avner, and makes the most of an out of step script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, struggling to maintain the constant globe-trotting and hazy time scale, with a quiet, affecting central performance. What Bana can't pull off is the sense of a close knit team that several of the film's key dramatic moments depend on. At almost three hours long, the team's dynamic still feels underdeveloped and two members, Hans (Hanns Zischler) and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) are reduced to heist movie archetypes; the numbers and explosives guy. <br/><br/>Then there's the weird stuff: a mysterious French intelligence group led by Bond villain father and son Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric. Forgetting that the group was never supposed to exist, so sits strangely in a film that takes authenticity seriously, you get the sense the film could have benefited from losing this plot strand altogether, in favour of developing the team. There's also the team's reactionary murder of a female assassin, who is shot naked on her houseboat. It's played to portray Hans perverse titillation as he re-opens her robe on her bloody body, but feels jarring and false, as we haven't seen enough of Hans to believe he's become that damaged. The inexplicable use of high contrast in many shots, works against the excellent set design and costuming by making the '70s agents look like they're recording a grunge music video. It also sometimes bleaches out the sky giving scenes shot on location a fuzzy, green screened look. <br/><br/>Spielberg's message appears to be 'an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind', which is a noble, if light thematic fare for a film of it's length. In it's final moments, Anver predicts that the violence will only get worse and points out that everyone they have killed has been replaced by someone worse. Spielberg pans back to a lingering shot of the distant World Trade Center; a forced gut-punch in the wake of a story which fails to engage an audience with it's human drama. <br/><br/>**<br/><br/>A well intended misfire that could have done with a shorter run time and by focussing as tightly on it's main characters as it does on it's set-pieces."

But then, almost 3 hours, slow move, too much moralistic stuff, totally unnecessary sex scenes, brutal violence and too much blood make this seemingly good film a wreck. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig are both good, but not so very well to persuade us. The whole film slides along very slowly and it adds to the creepy dark air.

A lot of the dialogue, particularly at the beginning is foreign and some of it isn't even subtitled. When Spielberg started his movie career, he was touted as the modern day Hitchcock and I would go along with that. His early films such as Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan etc were all entertaining films which held your attention to the end. Of late, he has concentrated on 'pet' projects personal to himself and a select few which have been mediocre at best at the box office. This particular film is based on real events and follows the 'work' of the Israeli Secret Service tracking down and eliminating the Arab terrorists they believe had a hand in the killing of Israeli Olympic athletes. But even this takes such a long time, you give up caring. As I said, it had the potential of being a first class film. Instead, Spielberg has made a mess."

Indeed, since my birth, i hear always two things: we face a crisis definitely worse than 1929 and Israelis and Palestinian are fighting. So, that's 40 years at least without peace. <br/><br/>One reason that is explained in this movie is that both sides are stuck in their revenge attitude: thus killing make things worse because it exacerbates violence instead of stopping it. This message is all the more powerful here because it's official, state approved assassinations that are executed. <br/><br/>Sure, as the title is ""Munich"", we expect to see Spielberg's vision of the tragedy. So, I was surprised that Spielberg doesn't show it at first. We see bits all along the movie and we must await the end to see it completely. If the wait has push up the drama, those last moments are mixed with a love scene (maybe as a parallel for life/death) but the sex is too nightmarish.<br/><br/>Beyond politics and history, the story is also a existentialistic one when the puppet killers realize that family is as sacred as nation. <br/><br/>With such thematic, I think Spielberg has reunited a excellent international team for the cast. If I can't really enjoy the movie because it's about men dedicated to kill (and maybe a bit too long and repetitive), it made me at last ponder loudly. <br/><br/>Hopefully, it closes on an appropriate last shoot because as it happens also in NYC, i was also thinking that in regard to the subject, it would be unforgivable if the Twin Towers doesn't appear!

","It's a long time since Spielberg has lost his primal directing skills. Not that he has become a bad director, but it seems to me that all his movies since E.T. are plagued with heavy sentimentalism. The wünder kid of the 70s benefits from almost unlimited backup and this makes all his subsequent films big clean streamlined products, and no longer lovely chiseled flicks for a wide audience. Actually I do think all that makes highbrow critics describe Spielberg as an auteur is the exact bs he revels in and develops to the point of heavy sentimentalism.<br/><br/>In Munich, there is the protracted hero, a good and sentimental Israeli patriot. Because with Spielberg private life or patriotic duty are loaded with the same sore sentimentalism. It's not something than tells the viewer about the hero, it's just stock Spielberg sentimentalism, meant to give the audience its fair share of base emotions. Spielberg nonetheless tries to avoid depicting Isrealis as the absolute good guys and Palestinians as the Arch Evilmen. But he is so at a loss for a firm viewpoint... All he is able to give us is this dumb ""nothing's pitch black, nothing's bright white"" tautological storyline. This is sentimentalism for dummies, no wonder the movie goes nowhere. It's just a routine spy-job movie. Munich as very little to do with this, and that's why we are fed with this protracted rendering of the Munich tragedy spliced in 4-odd parts and spilled over the main 2h30 course.<br/><br/>The casting and acting are really good, but the locations, sets and photography give too much of a surreal aspect to the story. It looks like a dream, never too close to a real nightmare (contrary to what the hero is supposed to experience): Spielberg sentimentalism is totally at odds with the subject matter. Interesting subject, wrong execution < wrong director."

Nobody is noble, nobody is clean, nobody has character.<br/><br/>Do you want to spend two hours of your life watching people being murdered, one after the other? Are you unaware already that people behave atrociously, murderously, to others? Why do we need a movie like this to remind us of something we are reminded of on a daily basis? What exactly is the movie trying to teach us that we don't see in our own souls already? <br/><br/>I didn't even find any of the characters compelling. Not Avner, who turns out to be a pretty weak guy. His wife is stereotypical, and the scene where he cries upon speaking with his daughter maudlin. <br/><br/>Nor are the lesser roles fleshed out. We never really learn about Avner's team, who they were, what paths in their lives brought them to where they were...they are introduced flat out, a few words spoken of each and bzzzzt, that's it. Nor, with the exception of Dr. Hamshiri, are any of the quarries of the team made anything close to real human beings...they are just people to be offed. <br/><br/>I just can't see why people like this movie so much. It teaches nothing we don't, or at least shouldn't, already know...it can't be termed anything but a downer...I'm sure folks didn't walk out of the theatre HAPPY, the characters are cardboard, and the plot predictable.<br/><br/>Sometimes I think people rate films on reasons OTHER than the quality of the work. Israel has a lot of sympathizers in the United States, and any movie which puts her in the position of plucky (if brutal) underdog is always going to draw acclaim not for its quality as a filmwork, but rather because it offers a popular viewpoint. ""Munich"" is the example par excellence of this sort of reviewing."
"richard-810","6","0","3","18 July 2008"," Typical Spielberg, for Better and for Worse
","On the plus side, the cinematography is as good as it gets. Spielberg is an undoubted master of the field and as a lover of cinema, I regard him as one of the truly great exponents, a genius. On the downside, his stories tend to feature a cloying sentimentality (AI, Saving Private Ryan etc) and this aspect inevitably detracts (at best) or ruins (at worst) the overall experience. And so with Munich, we get the standard Spielberg package. I strongly feel that if a movie is to feature a series of historical events, particularly a recent tragedy such as the events portrayed in this film, then it should be factually accurate and this film is not. There is no mention of the innocent waiter who was murdered by the Israeli squad as a result of mistaken identity for example. Now I'm not trying to make a political point here. As far as I am concerned, those responsible for the murder (that word again which I use intentionally) of the Israelis at Munich (or the murderers of innocent unarmed civilians in any circumstances) deserve everything they get. The suggestion that a series of unlikely methods of killing the perpetrators was used  exploding beds and so forth  each different from the previous, is complete fiction. Without wishing to sound too pedantic, the danger with this approach is that many people believe that what they are watching on the screen is fact. One IMDb reviewer comments that 'Spielberg gives us one hell of a history lesson'. He does not. Overall then, a decent action thriller, no more and no less."

","After seeing the filming of Munich, the entire story came back to me. The movie is well done, but much too long and dragged out. For some obvious reason, the anger I felt in 1972, during and after this monstrous event. What anger? Of course the terrorists, who managed to get into the Olympic compound, and carry out their dirty job. The Germans, who did nothing and just let things happen, as they did. The Olympic committee, for continuing the games, as if nothing had happened, and the uncalled for reactions of the people responsible for this lack of caring. Stevem Spielberg, for managing to put a human face on the terrorists. His excuses at the beginning of the film, were uncalled for. Those terrorists, as well as the terrorists today, are inhuman monsters. When I heard the mention of releasing 200 of their prisoners, I saw no change today, where they kidnap, kill and request releasing terrorists, which we already did and they went back to their old terrorism. At the time of the these happenings, my neighbor in Michigan, who was at the Olympic Games, took the first flight home. She was sick and disgusted. She was not Jewish, but saw the inhumanity of the terrorists and the arrogance of the Germans. Angry? Yes! The movie is excellent, but it hits home and shows the terrorism, which has lasted to this day.

","I did not like this movie because of content. The acting was good and the script was believable but the subject matter was very disconcerting. What happened to the Israeli Olympians in Munich is not depicted all at once but is broken up into several different flashbacks throughout the film. Each one gets more intense until the end when all the athletes were killed and the terrorists along with them. The audience is supposed to feel so bad for these twelve men when a character in the film casually mentions that over 200 Palestinians were killed in retaliation. But that's not enough. Now an elite hit squad must be assembled in order to make every mastermind behind the operation pay with their lives. And of course the hit men make sure they don't kill any children, they just create an orphan. No I found this movie extremely biased and inappropriate considering the happenings of the world today. Its not okay for a nation that is not sanctioned by the UN to enflict vigilante justice on people who could very well be innocent. It's not okay for two hundred people to die and then the movie goer is supposed to feel bad because 12 Israelis died. How come Spielberg did not show the charred bodies of the civilians lying on the ground after they were bombed indiscriminantely by Israeli tanks. I just think he should have depicted both sides a little better instead of brushing by it in order to appease the liberals. Well I hate liberals but I'm sure they are appeased."

","Update on the below: Can no one comment on my query about this weird, baffling indoor mist or fog that appears in nearly all of Spielberg's films????<br/><br/>The merits and weaknesses, as well as the political complexities of this film, have been chewed over and plowed up for 71 pages of IMDb, and I do not have the time to read any more of them. Since this film is now being aired on HBO hereabouts, I'm presuming there will be 2007 comments now made. This is one of them, but I'm focusing only on one personal objection to nearly every one of Spielberg's films. Perhaps somewhere in the above 71 pages, this objection has also been raised; my apologies if so. <br/><br/>What I'm commenting on is the fact that in so many INTERIOR scenes of his films, including MUNICH, there is this foglike miasma drifting past the people and the furniture. Nobody ever comments on this fog. Nobody seems to notice it. There is always some source of light illuminating this interior fog, usually the sun slanting through the windows. It's present in ET, AI, COLOR PURPLE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, on and on ad nauseum, and now in MUNICH. It occurs in three interior settings of Munich. I am baffled as to what Spielberg is trying to convey with this annoying technique. Every time I witness it, regardless of the nature of his film, I am distracted from the rest of the scene. This cannot be the singular decision of Spielberg's cinematographer; it has to be at the director's order. Why? Were this dusty mist occurring in just his sci fi films, well OK. But it isn't."

","This film wasn't necessarily counter-programming to Mel Gibson's 2004 film which contained subtle anti-Semetic undertones, but it delivered a message that I paraphrase Daniel Craig with saying in the film: ""Don't f#*k with the Jews."" Steven Spielberg has shown a more mature style in his film-making since 1993s ""Schindler's List,"" where he does not portray the story's villains as cartoonish, cardboard-cutouts as he did in 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" He manages to capture and display not only the sheer ugliness of the violence, but the pointlessness and awkwardness it begets as well. Beginning with the disclaimer ""inspired by actual events,"" the viewer witnesses events both real and staged of the massacre of the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. The aftermath is slow to begin with but picks up momentum and rising suspense at times after its second reel.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (from Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"") does an exceptional job as the Israeli assassination team's leader Avner Kaufman. The supporting members of the team including the future James Bond Daniel Craig are just as talented, and Geoffrey Rush plays the old salt of-a-boss with perfection. The movie intercuts occasionally with flashbacks of the massacre- progressively with more and more details until its finale. What intrigued me about this film so much was the accuracy of the details in the recreations that were matched so well to the actual terrorists in the documented footage. The Palestinian's terrorist leader actually did wear a white hat that resembled a pith helmet, and his deputy really wore a cowboy hat that was captured in the film as well. Even the mock-ups of the West German Hueys at the airport were accurate. Spielberg and his crew did their homework with this. There is a documentary on DVD called ""One Day in September""(narrated by Michael Douglas) which recalls a play-by-play account of the tragedy of the Munich Games as well as the arrogance of the Olympic Committee, and the incompetence of the West German anti-terrorist command. Before a viewer criticizes the length of the film or its melodrama, rent this video first and then proceed with a critique.<br/><br/>I gave this film a seven because at times it seemed over-long and some of the scenes were implausible (like the Mossad/Palestinian meeting in the safehouse). Yet Spielberg shows a neutral point of view that was appropriate for this film in terms of violence begetting violence. The result of this message in the film angered a lot of people in Israel and also in many parts of the world, because nothing was accomplished by the film's end. One of life's critical ironies as well as concrete truths."

","Steven Spielberg's remake of the 1986 Sword of Gideon is a fine production but as I watched it the storyline of the 1986 production was being replayed almost exactly. Spielberg shows little in the way of originality in his film. Too bad he didn't acknowledge the 20 year old film as a source. Sword of Gideon is a better title for the piece. The cast was a good one in this latest production of the story of the assassins who hunted down those responsible for the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Although it is clear what happened at Munich it was not particularly clear exactly how all the athletes were killed nor how many of the killers were killed during the hostage taking. For dramatic effect, I suppose, Spielberg has chosen to present much of this as flashback in the form of nightmares of the Israeli assassin group leader. Detailing of this part of the story up front would have helped the storyline."

This was further enhanced by the gratuitous sex scene with his pregnant wife!I can say I neither laughed nor cried once during this movie.

","In my view, Steven Spielberg has not done a good enough job with this film. Actually some parts are sloppily made, and the casting is by far perfect. Several actors are not suitable for the character they are portraying. Considering rather the original dramatization from 1986, titled Sword of Gideon, with Steven Bauer playing the lead role is by far better than this one. Of course there are weaknesses in that too, and this is where Spielbergs version gains momentum - through the special effects. However, the part about ""pffum-pffum"" is clearly lacking in Munich, which gives less depth to the believability of the story. Maybe a Directors cut with certain scenes shot over again could be a potential solution?"

","OK- I was nervous about watching this film because ever since approx. 1993 Mr. Spielberg has been in this ""tell the story as graphically as you can"" mode. Grant you, Schindler's List is outstanding - it told a very sad story and very graphically. The trouble with producers/directors today is they have all forgotten the key to successful entertaining: you have to be an ordinary person who knows what ordinary people like to see. Now which do you suppose is the most entertaining war film: something like Sergeant York or Saving Pvt Ryan??? Saving Private Ryan was a great film but left me feeling so overwhelmingly sad, I could not watch it again. Sergeant York (w/Gary Cooper, re: WWI) is a film that anyone can watch over and over again because it leaves you feeling proud and happy. To all of today's directors and producers I say this: Life is very complicated in this day and age. I truly believe more people want to watch something to help them ESCAPE from real life and/or make them feel proud and happy when they leave the theater. PLEASE STOP with the true-to-life extremely graphic crap. Also - what exactly was the purpose of the sex scenes?? What extremely poor taste to include the sex with a pregnant woman scene!

","Steven Spielberg's Munich has been compared inaccurately with Schindler's List. I find a resemblance not with this masterpiece, but with one of the less remembered films of Spielberg: Amistad.<br/><br/>Why does Munich remind me of Amistad if Munich is the story of the revenge the Israeli government took after the Munich assassinations and Amistad is the story of a group of African slaves unjustly taken to America and their trial? Simply, because in both Spielberg shows how excellent and terrible he is.<br/><br/>Amistad has one of the best moments in Cinema History I've ever seen. Of course, I'm talking about the slaves' story told crudely as it is. Spielberg is terrific at these dramatic, overwhelming scenes. Still, the rest of Amistad is boring, pretentious and looks extremely false on screen. This is exactly the same problem Munich has.<br/><br/>There are two great scenes in Munich: The attack on Beirut and the different scenes of what happened at Munich. Spielberg creates memorable, crude scenes that don't let us even move. But the rest of Munich feels fake and pretentious. The dialogs sound extremely fake and overall most scenes are boring and confusing. Why? Because Spielberg is not at the small stuff: Give him tough, dramatic scenes, not two people speaking. Oh, and PLEASE...DON'T LET HIM DO ANOTHER LOVE SCENE. Munich's two love scenes are two of the worst I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Now, about the acting: Eric Bana can't act. His performance is ridiculous and predictable. Daniel Craig delivers a good performance but ultimately his character is shadowed by everything else on screen. Mainly because his character is poorly written. There were two fascinating performances on-screen in Munich, and neither of them got over 3 minutes of screen-time. I'm talking about Omar Metwally as Ali, an Arab terrorist and Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister. Metwally's performance is subtle yet harsh, just what the whole movie tried to be.<br/><br/>I've already written about the screenplay and how it has fake dialogs. But, I haven't mentioned the screenplay's greatest fault that was accentuated by Spielberg's poor directing in most scenes: Contrary to popular belief, I thought the characters' feelings of guilt, regret and fear weren't showed correctly on screen. All you see is Avner (Eric Bana) ripping his bed and destroying his phone, but his feelings aren't shown correctly on screen.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, Munich has genius scenes that are shadowed by the rest of the film.<br/><br/>** out of ****"
"Eric_Leiston","6","0","5","24 July 2006"," Worked Better as a TV Movie
","Spielberg turns the story of the Munich massacre into a detail laden often incoherent big screen patchwork. Eager to convey the dilemma of moral ambiguity, not to mention how Europe looked and sounded in the 70s, his movie also contains emotional trickery that also failed to deliver in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Like many of Spielberg's works, the back story becomes the first sacrificial victim. The movie is also conflicted mainly because it wants to be serious and high minded and yet is based on George Jonas' entertaining but highly improbable account of the Israeli operation to bring the planners of the Munich Olympic massacre to justice. As one example, the whole houseboat scene of the assassination of the hooker assassin, with the bicycle pump gun no less, (but the cat loved the hooker killer, come on Spielberg, will you ever learn to reel it in?) seemed better in the earlier version of this movie, the made for TV effort ""Sword of Gideon"" starring Michael York. By the way, at no point in Spielberg's self-important commentary on the DVD does he mention that he re-made a cable movie. The ghastly last scene where the main character makes love to his wife with images of the final moments of the Munich hostages has to be one of the worst moments of Hollywood film making."

Gandhi but it simply enough when he said: ""an eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind."" This well directed, well acted film still manages to be quite boring, tedious and predictable. The ending is really watered down and weak, the message would have been so much more powerful and devastating if Avner and his young family would have been murdered along with him and thus driving home what the real cost of the constant game of violence and revenge leads too. A film with a thought provoking message about revenge but never really embraces an alternative, it's overly long and misses its chance to really be daring. This could have been a very interesting exploration of the dichotomy between forgiving and seeking vengeance. It is not and doesn't come close to Spielberg's best work."
"chadsarah","6","0","4","14 July 2006"," A Tedious Mishap of Important Ideas
","MUNICH is a tug-of-war between two screenwriters (of different disciplines) and a director who can't decide which version he likes so he tries to blend them into one coherent experience. The result is a mixed bag. To be fair Spielberg's intention is valid and he took the right path artistically, but I think he should have spent more time developing the project. Instead he decided to rush the production along to reach the Oscar deadline. This paid off because the Academy nominated it for Best Picture but I believe it would have benefited from the delay. Oh the masterpiece that would have been if only Spielberg was a little more patient. The film starts off well, pulling you into its story with an ease that very few directors have mastered. Much of the film is well done with solid performances through out. Eric Bana is extraordinary. Yet about two-thirds through, the film loses its momentum, shuffling various endings that drag the film down. My main complaint is that the film repeats its arguments, almost as if Spielberg is worried he hasn't made his point. Some of the scenes are outright melodramatic in presentation and I wish Spielberg would have taken a more subtle approach instead of hammering the viewer over the head, wielding us to feel what he wants us to feel. The best example of this is the sex/flash-back scene toward the end of the film. Technically it looks atrocious for one, reminding me of a scene from FLASHDANCE (what's with all that glistening sweat?). Second, it stylistically opposes the rest of the film, glaringly sticking out for attention. While I like the juxtaposing of the two events, I felt the end result was pretentious. Another example is the last image which loses much of its impact in its predictability. This is a post-9/11 film; I already considered the implications so the image doesn't shock me or affect me in anyway. I just nodded my head and thought, ""Yes, you already made this point."" Would I recommend this film? Yes, because while it is a flawed film that is unsuccessful in telling its story with any fluidity, the questions it asks are relevant. Any film of this nature inspires dialog and I applaud Spielberg for trying."

Maybe I should watch it again.<br/><br/>Eric Bana, is an attractive actor with screen presence, but I felt somehow he could have shown more passion, if that is the right word. Or a more powerful portrayal of the lead character. Although was Avna a victim of politics too? I felt he was. <br/><br/>To me the screenplay seemed to indicate some criticism of Mossad (?) and the Israeli government's reaction to the Munich tragedy. Not that I blame them for feeling this way, but the way they handled it.<br/><br/>As far as acting, Geoffry Rush was good, and also the other actors in lead roles. <br/><br/>I just felt it was a bit repetitive.

","We're all familiar with Spielberg's heavy hammer film making. His films are beautifully lit, well crafted and then they crush your skull with monochromatic themes and characters. If you are looking for morale ambiguity visit a Bergman film, but if you want good vs. evil dial up a Spielberg film and prepared to be dazzled along the way.<br/><br/>I don't know what to make of Munich. Clearly it is factually inept. This isn't even close to what really happened, and on the DVD version I watched it comes with a preamble of Spielberg himself, where he practically apologizes for the film. ""This isn't a documentary and it does not criticize the Israeli government,"" Steven tells us on the DVD. It leaves you wondering what this film does try to say. I think all Munich really does communicate is that ""an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind,"" which is bludgeoned into us from the opening reel.<br/><br/>The thing is, the film isn't particularly entertaining along the way. Eric Bana puts in an admirable performance, but his character never really progresses much, nor are we ever really connected to his plight. Other characters are glossed over as awful caricatures, and given no depth. We are 90 minutes into the film and I still don't know much of anything about Bana's supporting cast or what their motivations are and when some of them die on screen I feel neither pity nor a sense of dramatic resolution.<br/><br/>There is no doubt Spielberg has produced some of the greatest moments in American cinema. Only the most elitist of film connoisseurs would deny that. This film however falls flat in my book. You simply do not care about the outcome of this movie, you are rarely involved with the characters and the protagonist's evolution in the story seems labored and sudden. <br/><br/>Perhaps I suffered the situation where I had heard and read all the high praise for this film for an entire year before actually seeing it. Perhaps as a result, my expectations were too high. None the less, my wife and I ended the viewing of this film and immediately frowned in disappointment.<br/><br/>This movie does not criticize the Israeli government with any real authority or clarity. In fact, it doesn't make half the political statements that its detractors accuse of it. It doesn't really say anything other than Spielberg can film gritty fight scenes with Uzis and lots of blood, then wrap it up in a bow by having the protagonist refuse to kill at the end. Then he just fades to black along a New York skyline with the World Trade Center clearly visible. This is enough apparently to have all of Hollywood praise it as another piece of 'genius' work."

The movie is told from the viewpoint of a ""weak sister"" who found that killing was great fun, but then developed a conscience. There is always a whiny-ass in every group. This movie is about a war, unconventional to say the least, but still a war. The participants are merely soldiers in that war. It they turn into gutless wonders after they have been in battle, that does not change the fact that others war fighters do their job and can still function in this world. <br/><br/>I can't help but wonder what Spielberg's ""needs"" are to show a scene with a man having sex with his pregnant wife, or later practically raping her as he has flashbacks of something that he did not witness?

But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding ""Thumbs Up"".<br/><br/>Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.<br/><br/>The acting is fairly blasÃ© with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.<br/><br/>The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.) I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history. But I felt the story lagged and was forced upon the viewer rather than coming across in a fluid manner.<br/><br/>Although I watched and enjoyed the Oscars this year, MUNICH stood out as the ""stinker"" in the Best Film category.

","Munich wants to be an important film. It uses the tragedy of the Munich Olympics to explore the effects of hatred and revenge on all involved parties especially the avengers. So I really wanted to feel moved and challenged by this cinematic dissertation on the subject much like I was with Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". I wasn't. That's not to say Munich is not worth watching. It is. Just be prepared for a sophisticated version of ""Death Wish"" except here it's based on a true story with more depth. Perhaps that is a trivialization of a film that does engage. But I was getting weary of the main characters finding different ways to blow up their targets. I wanted more about the clash and conflict of terrorists on both sides. Spielberg attempts to be objective and he is to a point. But both sides here have their justifications of what they did and why. No doubt neither side are purely evil or completely vindicated. What drives these people to the desperation resulting in such horrific actions is really what we should be attempting to understand. Instead Munich shows us how Israel got even and why that was tough on the avengers generating more violence. I suppose the music score should include a track titled ""It's hard out there for an avenger""! The acting is good across the board. Technically the film is well done. But Spileberg's direction, while competent, seems almost clinical in the depiction of this very relevant and timely subject."

","Munich, or Black September has always remained a sensitive issue with all Jews. This effort by Steven Spielberg as we all know is a effort by him to redeem the events that happened some 34 years ago. The movie starts off as we know, Eric Bana son of a super secret agent is hired as a group leader to assassinate eleven people who were *supposedly* behind the Munich massacre. The group starts off, travels all over Europe eliminating targets, until they find out that they themselves have become the targets and their cover has been compromised. Then they start to fight for their own existence as their own people starts getting knocked off.<br/><br/>The brilliance of Spielberg is evident when he finishes off the movie in an abstract fashion. From start till the end we have seen Eric Bana bear a deep hatred for the Arabs and a national pride. Somewhat through the movie he meets up with an Arab extremist and he realizes that they are on the same boat. Both are killers just fighting on the opposite side. In the end, thats what happens. He learns that of the 11 targets he was to finish, only 1 was the mastermind, the rest else were either suspects with no real proof, or sum one who had been involved against some anti Jewish movement in the past. He realizes the nature of the world has made him to be a terrorist just like the Arabs from Black September, no different. He realizes the pain of the Jewsh athletes when they die, knowing that they cant do anything to save themselves and it was their own country that let them down rather than the Arabs assassinating them. An individual brilliance of Eric Bana, with some witty direction by Spielberg is all that you can expect from Munich. It's a thriller, but Spielberg has made better movies I can assure you.<br/><br/>A 7/10 !!"

Did you guys see that scene in the theatrical version or was it edited out for American audiences ( I saw it in France ). They didn't mention that the movie was cut but I am pretty sure that scene was there because it was very graphic. I don't understand why Spielberg did that for the DVD.

Perhaps Spielberg felt that an 'epic' was essential for increased chances of award nominations??? The accents are terrible!! I didn't believe the group of assassins were Israeli for one second. They would have been better off sticking with the usual American accents all-round, at least that's probably closer to what English speaking Israelis sound like today, yet perhaps not so much in the 70s.<br/><br/>At least it was easy to tell the goodies from the baddies, the baddies are the only ones with subtitles! There are plenty of fantastic bilingual European actors and i imagine, but can't comment for lack of knowledge, Israeli actors, who deserve more consideration for roles than is apparently given. I personally don't mind subtitles, especially when it adds to the credibility of a character.<br/><br/>Yeah, pretty unimpressed overall."
"Daniel_Feldman","6","0","2","1 April 2006"," Munich is mesmerizing, important, and flawed.
","Note: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>If looks were never deceiving, things were always as they appeared, and a book was judged solely by its cover, then Steven Spielberg's Munich would be a masterpiece of epic proportions. From a technical standpoint, it is that impressive: each shot has the camera in the ideal place to make the scene as realistic as humanly possible, and every moment is so meticulously captured that it should further cement Spielberg's status as the greatest pure filmmaker in history. However, underneath this astonishing coating is a surprisingly muddled and flawed film, one of Spielberg's weakest efforts yet.<br/><br/>The film's opening ten minutes, which show the kidnapping/slaughter of several Israeli athletes by a Palestinian extremist group known as Black September at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, are so remarkably filmed that they have a sort of documentary feel to them. Eventually, things calm down, and the film moves to its central story: Avner (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent, is asked by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) to seek revenge against those responsible. ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises within its own values,"" she says, and the compromises in question clearly involve the assassination of each and every member of Black September. This mission forces Avner to leave his pregnant wife until the assassination is complete. Joining him are four men, each with his own area of expertise, such as bombs, forgery, and getaway driving, and the movie proceeds in showing their mission.<br/><br/>Munich, in its tense, gripping depiction of the team's mission, raises many important questions, many of which run parallel to today's Middle East conflict. For instance, is murder justified in response to murder? Is it right, in cases such as this one, to ignore the judicial process and proceed directly to the execution? At one point, Avner says ""Jews don't do wrong because our enemies do wrong."" Everything reverts back to the Prime Minister's original point: Do civilizations have to compromise their own values from time to time? Is it okay to mimic the actions of the very people that a nation hopes to assassinate? This film is one of the most important in recent years because it asks such questions, because Spielberg puts himself directly in between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Of course the film will elicit criticism from both sides, because it is not completely partial to either one. In this regard, Spielberg is spot on.<br/><br/>Where Munich falters, unfortunately, is in Spielberg's strange detachment from his characters. In other words, he allows us no entry into their souls. Aside from Avner, we learn virtually nothing about any of the other characters aside from their areas of expertise. The Israeli victims and the Palestinian extremists (many of whom are average members of the working class with families and children) are essentially useless names and faces. How many members of either group will people remember after seeing the film? I, unfortunately, remembered very few. The bottom line, the movie humanizes its main character, and the result is fascinating. Why could Spielberg not do the same thing with everyone else?<br/><br/>In the end, while the film is undoubtedly successful in raising extremely important questions, I simply am not buying it as a work of quality cinema. Such a film must care about all of the characters that the director and screenwriter spend enormous amounts of time fretting over, and this film cares about only one. Still, there is no denying its power at a time like this. The film's most powerful scene involves the team being booked into the same ""safe house"" as several members of a PLO team. After convincing the latter that the situation is safe, we move to Avner and the PLO team's leader, Ali, having a conversation by a staircase. Only then are we able to access the film's core, and everything is brought into focus. As one of them rightly says, ""at the end of this, there is no peace."" Everyone fights, and no matter the outcome, no one wins."

That said, it is not brilliantly clever as some point it to be. Its good, but important things is left unsaid.<br/><br/>'Munich's merits as a movie however is a bit lacking. For realism, it's good and gory, too gory for my tastes.

"valadas","7","0","2","29 March 2006"," He who takes the sword...
","...shall perish with the sword. That's what my grandmother already used to say. The problem are the so-called collateral damages (killing innocent people, etc). It looks like this movie has roused great hostility in Israel you can never tell why since it's not for or against Israel nor for or against Palestinians. It doesn't take sides in that conflict. It only shows a bunch of murderers on both sides but we all know already that terrorists and secret agents are flour of the same bag either they belong to CIA, KGB, Mossad, ETA, IRA, Hamas or the likes of them all, all of them beneficent organizations that only want our well-being and plead the best causes in this world. With a slight inconvenience: to achieve their purposes they don't show the least respect for human rights a despicable thing of course. Consequently my comment will stick exclusively to the movie as such without making any reference to the fact that we are in the presence of Israelis and Arabs since its action could occur with any other groups with the same type of conflict. What this movie proves thoroughly is what anyone of sense already knew i. e. that these selective murders of hostages, terrorists, or secret agents not only don't solve any problem but aggravate them all by creating a spiral of violence in which one killing by one side leads to ten killings by the other and so on. The structural problems behind the conflict remain unsolved. And besides that it achieves nothing on practical terms since the murdered terrorist's and secret agents' bosses are immediately replaced by even worse ones. Furthermore we have here a technically well made movie like it is Spielberg's point of honour (by the way isn't he also a Jew?) and a well told story that may not be true in every detail but is certainly true in general terms according to what I said above. Another important feature of the movie is that terrorists and secret agents are shown not as the usual inhuman robots but as human beings with their joys and sorrows, their families and beloved ones, their weaknesses and incompetences, their doubts and uncertainties and even now and then some stings of conscience when they reflect upon what they are doing. The story has nevertheless a few gaps. Besides the apparently facility with which the location of the terrorists to kill is done as well as with which most killings are prepared and done, we never know what kind of organization was the one who informed the killers of the whereabouts of the men to be killed and what was its ideological affiliation as it seems very doubtful that they did it only for money since according to the words of one of its members and of its chief (a curious personality) they never worked for or against any government. Anarchists? We'll never know. And what kind of efficient network they had which allowed them to locate everybody so quickly? But in conclusion this is a movie made with much solidity upon a very momentous and important theme."
"Karl Self","Null","0","3","8 March 2006"," Unfortunately ""Courageous"" Doesn't Equate ""Good Movie""
","After the Oscar-awarded but factually flawed ""One Day In September"" I was really curious how Spielberg would treat the subject. And judging by the media hooplah, Spielberg had apparently gone off his rocker and turned out a shlocker that advocated the complete annihilation of Israel, or something to that effect. As it turned out, ""Munich"" falls short of both counts -- it's mostly an action movie with little regard for historical accuracy that seeks to propagate an agenda that I would term ""slightly mellowed Zionism"". I would have thought that Spielberg's position is in accordance with what seems to be official doctrine, that the existence of Israel is non-negotiable and that Israel has the right to defend herself, but that she is not simply awarded carte blanche for doing so. Strangely, judging by the uproar surrounding this movie, I seem to have been out of synch with reality in that at least a large part of media commentators seems to assume that Israelis are beyond the pale of moral considerations and somehow invested with unalienable right to act with complete impunity.<br/><br/>But back to the movie. It's actually quite convincing as a sort of alternative James Bond movie, one in which the hero is married with children and has moral qualms, but as such it almost mandatorily falls short of its claim as a polical movie or as a truthful -- if not factually accurate -- portrayal of a historical event. Maybe you can't have both, or at least Spielberg, in this case, couldn't. The film eventually hits rock-bottom in an unforgivable scene in which Avner and his wife play a round of ""hide the kreplach"" interspersed by stroboscopic takes from the final shootout of the Munich hijack."
"dust-7","Null","0","3","9 March 2006"," Assassination, paranoia, and his blind critique of eye for an eye
","I agree that this was an effort from a man working out his feelings about the state of Israel. It wasn't good, at any rate. The disaster of German special forces in Munich, still a national embarrassment, certainly, as were any initial reports that all the hostages had survived, is restaged for this fim in flashback clips - not all at once. At the beginning, at points inbetween, and at the end of this film, you have to remember to piece it all together in your head as the hero of our story suffers some sort of out of body experience, as if he'd been there in the midst of the hostages. I also agree with the complaint that Spielberg is crazy to have this unexplained supernatural phenomenon occur while at the end of the film the hero has sex with his wife, and just doesn't stop.<br/><br/>The plot is basically that some frat-boy type Americans smooth the way for the terrorists into the dorms by hopping the gate along with them. The terrorists unpack their weapons and assault the Israeli athletes still in their rooms. One fights back, kills or wounds a terrorist, but is mowed down by AK47 fairly quickly. Looks like one escaped. And a total of two were gunned down. As for the nine remaining, Germany readily agrees to the terrorists demands and makes choppers ready at the airport. They don't mean it, of course. The hostages are held together in a tight group with the terrorists, who all mount up into the choppers, at which point the German's just unload on everyone. And the terrorists are shown gunning down the hostages, and tossing the grenades into the choppers. But you don't see a lot of the last bit except at points through the film, and at the end, as already noted.<br/><br/>In retaliation, we have Golda Meir sitting down with the generals in her home to recruit a former bodyguard to head up a team of assassins. She gives essentially a speech about civilized societies necessarily doing uncivilized things to survive, and so on. And the job of these assassins is to kill the organizers of the Munich assault, or generally the leadership of Black September. The government creates a 'deniable deniability', a Swiss bank account with American cash periodically deposited in safe deposit boxes. And off they go. But not before the 'handler', a rather confused jerk, insists that Golda attended the funeral of her sister rather than the official ceremony for the slain athletes because many Israelis held her responsible for not negotiating with terrorists - she didn't want to get booed. Spielbergs says, don't know about history.<br/><br/>So they start with a few names, though none of the team is quite sure how they fit into Munich. Over the months they spend millions for information. And then they shoot some, bomb some, and so on, a total of five or six figures connected with international terrorism. Meanstwhile, on the ever-present TV, there are reports of hi-jackings and cafe bombings, etc., where hundreds have been killed. These are supposedly in retaliation for what the assassins have done, not for anything Israel was doing in Lebanon or wherever else. So Spielberg wants us to know - direct cause - and this is the balance sheet. Hundreds vs. five, or six.<br/><br/>And sure enough, the assassins begin to have questions. Why are we doing this? Are we not righteous Jews? The bombmaker, in particular complains of that, and wants out. It apparently never occurred to them, when they began this cell operation that assassins - kill people. Apparently they only realized that after they killed people, and only then start in about being righteous or not. And look at all the hundreds that died because we killed these few - again, part of Spielberg's message. Essentially, he seems to want to say - what's the point, can't we all just get along? There's a stairwell scene, where this team shares a 'nightmarish pad' with some PLO types, both sent to this 'safe house' by a French information broker getting hundreds of thousands of US greenbacks for each tip, and selling one side against the other, basically. And the PLO type, thinking our hero is just some Communist German stooge, apologetic even for the Nazi past and therefore sympathetic to Israel, says - you reds never quite get it, but you've got homes to go to. We Palestinians will fight for our land, even if it is left to my sons, or to their sons to do so. Brave talk, calling to mind the very struggle to create Israel itself. Spielberg wants us to see that, I think. Death to Israel, forever! <br/><br/>And that's how the movie concludes, as well, from the other side - Israel, forever! The hero's Mom is sort of aware of what her son was doing. But she gives much the same speech, that we'll do anything to keep this, our land, no matter how unjust or unprofessional. You are our hero, son. Remember the PLO guy, mentioned. Spielberg has homes, and homes like few Americans will ever see. He probably feels like some land baron. He's now vested in that order, and protecting it; even if it means more taxes because it's all just money-tree money to him. He's got an endless supply. Spielberg probably can see his own zealotry for the Democrat Party when it's election time. Perhaps. But fierce religious and nationalistic zealotry seems to be lost on him, or scares him as simply destabilizing. Perhaps he's yet to discover that he's a closet Republican? But he's not stupid. And neither were those who knew what assassination meant before they set out."

","hello everyone. I tried to watch this film ignoring the fact that is based on a true event. Why?. Spielberg is confusing me very much. I don't know if he wants to make a movie to get more money or if he really wants to narrate a very important event. the formula of Spielberg worked really well in ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" but since then with movies like ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" you can notice that the formula can't work all the time. So he mixes drama-adventure-action to get all the audiences, get recognized and money. But try to look the movie as just a movie and you will see how the characters repeat themselves in previous movies and the plot is so simply that when you remember that is based on true events what you can think it's: ""Human race is so stupid"". Revenge that's the secret of the movie. And some people are proud about it. I do not support any kind of killing and surely i do not take side, i just fell sorry for the families of the people who died. the movie don't deserve any award i think, it's just another movie. Besides the people who lived that event must remember it really well and a movie like this, i think, can't make a deep change on the things that people believe. IT's too personal."

The movie moves along well enough, and the general storyline is engaging. <br/><br/>That said I have strongly felt, since ""A.I.,"" that Spielberg is a disturbed individual. ""Munich"" did not change my opinion. In two cases I found what I felt to be gratuitous sexualized violence (the killing of the Dutch woman and the final ""love scene""). I suspect Spielberg was going for some grittiness in those scenes, but it felt hollow and unnecessary to me. Another word that comes to mind is ""exploitative."" <br/><br/>The lack of subtleness in the Golda Meir and the ""you look like your mother"" part, which I found to be mind-numbing, is essentially repeated again and again throughout the movie. Wait, what? We're (Americans) suppose to identify with Avner and see our own War on Terror in the same light? No way! Could the fact that all of the Israelis speak English and the final scene with the Twin Towers in the background made that point a little more obvious?<br/><br/>Yeah, OK, if the initial scene's dialog had been in Hebrew with English subtitles the movie would never have done well with American audiences, I can accept that part.

","I left the theatre moved in a peculiar way after seeing this film. Usually if a film is an hour and a half too long, edited in such a way that the director appears to have lost all interest in the story's momentum, and contains endless clichéd meetings between men in cafés I simply dismiss it in being rubbish. However, this is Spielberg we're talking about here! I have to believe he does everything for a reason, don't I? The film has good performances, I'll give it that, but the whole film has an air of 'been there, seen that,' offering nothing new on the subjects of terrorism, revenge, espionage or any other topic you'd like to affix to the piece. Spielberg's message seems to be: Terrorism is morally dubious and revenge is morally dubious too, which doesn't really fire up the imagination.<br/><br/>However, this isn't what I finally decided was my main problem with the film. You see, while Eric Bana et. all did a fine job bringing the characters to the screen I just couldn't connect with them. It's a brave move to make your protagonists men you can't really root for, being terrorists themselves and all, but the main reason I didn't care about them was fairly simple.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie Eric Bana's character is brought before the prime minister and set an assignment: to track down and kill those responsible for the Munich attack. He is given 24 hours to decide if he accepts or not. He is also warned repeatedly how dangerous this mission is. He accepts anyway. Now, I found it annoying that he spent the latter 3rd of the movie whining about how dangerous the mission had become. Grow some balls, dude! He seems to totally lose his cool the minute anything doesn't go according to plan, and you're left wondering why is he the team's leader (a topic that is brought up but washed over immediately).<br/><br/>I then spent the last hour and a half of the movie waiting for it to end but being forced to endure meeting after meeting, phone call after phone call hoping he would just tie a knot in his hankie and get on with his job!

He wants to deliver an exciting story with suspense, some great undercover-agent elements and interesting characters. He also wants to deal with some heavy issues about the legitimacy of killing, the definition of loyalty towards one country, the problem of having or not having a home, the emotional and familial side-effects of being part of a manhunt, both as the hunter and the hunted. Additionally he tries to fit the Palestinian point of view into a story that is already full. All of the intentions are great.

","Wonderkid turned Hollywood legend director Steven Spielberg makes three types of film: family entertainment (""ET"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Indiana Jones""), action adventures (""Jaws"", ""Minority Report"", ""War Of The Worlds"") and serious political works (""The Color Purple"", ""Amistad"", ""Schindler's List""). ""Munich"" is firmly in the last category and, in the sense that it picks up on his Jewishness, the book end to ""Schindler's List"". There is so much to commend this stunning work, but equally so much to cause reservations.<br/><br/>An examination of the Israeli secret service response to the 1972 massacre of 11 Jewish athletes at Munich, this is one of the best political thrillers in a long time, imbued with sustained tension, with some powerful action sequences, and literally exploding with mayhem and murder. The acting is of a high quality with five key roles: Eric Bana as Avner, Mossad agent and leader of the assassination team, Ciaran Hinds as the pipe-smoking planner, Mathieu Kossovitz as the Belgian explosives expert, Hanns Zischler as the German master forger, and Daniel Craig as the South African getaway driver. Each time, they - and we - doubt the reason for all this killing, Spielberg flashes back to that terrible time in Munich.<br/><br/>Above all, this is an honourable and worthy film that poses huge and topical questions about what leads terrorists to take innocent lives and what measures a democratic state can take to combat such terrorism before it betrays the essential values of that society and in the process corrupts those carrying out such revenge. If there was any doubt as to the contemporary force of these issues, we are reminded of them in the closing seconds as we see New York's World Trade Center standing in the background.<br/><br/>The major concern with Spielberg's narrative is the extent to which he has taken artistic licence with the known facts. Although the work is only said to be ""inspired by true events"", the constant reference to the memory of the reality of Munich and other touches such as the portrayal of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir give the impression that this is almost a drama-documentary.<br/><br/>Every action in the film is carried out by one group, but in fact Mosaad deployed several. The operation is represented as funded by, but otherwise out of the control of, Mossad, whereas the secret service was totally in charge. Although some things go wrong in the film's account, essentially the killings are cleverly executed and the murder of an innocent Arab in Lillehammer in Norway is never mentioned. Information on the location of the intended targets is shown as coming from an odd French family of anarchists - this is taken from the 1984 book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas - but there is simply no evidence that such an unlikely faction exists.<br/><br/>Above all, Avner and his team are shown as increasingly troubled by their actions. However, we know from a new Atlantic Productions television documentary featuring interviews with Mossad agents directly involved in ""Operation Wrath of God"" that they had no doubts and exhibited no hesitation. Perhaps Spielberg is entitled to refashion the operation somewhat in order that he can raise questions and challenge us to think through the moral issues involved, but some of this is just too contrived, such as when the Jewish team find themselves sharing an Athens safe house with Arab terrorists. Also the incident with a freelance Dutch female assassin seems included simply to provide some colour and sex.<br/><br/>Spielberg has had critics from all quarters. From the Jewish side, he has been branded as guilty of ""an incorrect moral equation"" and ""the sin of equivalence"" because he has characters articulating the Palestinian cause. From the Arab cause, a former member of Black September has accused him of focusing on ""the Zionist side alone"". Even George Jonas has charged him with ""humanising demons"". However, the families of the athletes slain at Munich have publicly praised the work. When all is said, ""Munich"" is an important and brave work that really should be seen and thought about. It may be 164 minutes, but there is never a moment of boredom and rarely has a film raises such sharp moral issues in such a considered manner."
"alexandermangoldt","Null","0","1","10 February 2006"," Aesthetics vs. realism
","I would like to comment on the cinematography of this picture. Although the clothes, cars, hotels and other requisites of the movie have shown to be quite accurate, I still felt that this picture was too aesthetical regarding the horrifying events that they depict. Take one scene, for instance: When the Palestinian terrorists make their way into the Israeli apartment and kill one of the Israelis you see his blood covering the wall and you see some scraps of wallpaper coming off the wall due to the bullets from the machine gun. So instead of showing the bullet-ridden corpse of the Israeli Spielberg chose to show a wallpaper full of blood and wholes. Why? Because he chose to display the murder of an Israeli in a way other than realistic. He chose to use a metaphor (a stylistic device) and not the actual death of a Israeli. I think that this is typical of all his movies. In the end, what most of his movies (even Schindler's list) come down to is this: They are nicely made popcorn movies and they have no real political impact. For the time being (as long as the film lasts) you are in the story but then again, once your out of the movie theater you realize that you still don't know more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The one scene were the conflict is really being discussed is when the Bana character talks to the Palestinian terrorist, but the conversation they have is so commonorgarden that you don't really feel for either of them. I watched a German documentary on the hijacking of the Landshut (1977) by Palestinian terrorists (Das Todesspiel, Heinrich Breloer) and this documentary provided a lot more information on terrorism and raison d'etat than Munich. It was a mixture of documentary and movie scenes and it included interviews of the people involved at the time (Helmut Schmidt, Ben Wischnewski and Jan-Carl Raspe, among others). In comparison, Munich is nothing more than an aesthetically pleasing film with some overwhelming action scenes and a handsome looking Eric Bana who looks like he got right out of the TROY gym. Synopsis: Spielberg turned a horrible event into a popcorn movie. He doesn't really care about the event, he just takes them and abuses them so as to make a suspenseful movie. In this, admittedly, he succeeds."

","After hearing all of the amazing reviews, I was really let down by this film. The acting was great, everything looked superb, however the director failed to create any kind of bond with the audience. I did not see the film in a theater, and am glad I did not waste my money. About 1/2 way into the film I shut it off without a second thought. I felt the film was completely void of emotion and simply lacking. The only scene that managed to invoke any emotional response from me was when nearly killed the young girl, because she seemed innocent and young. All the athletes were simply bloody bodies. They were given no story, so the I did not care what happened to them, as if they were simply extras in the film. The same is true the majority of what happens in the first half. I was very disappointed to see this movie make it as an Oscar contender. To those who think ""Well what if the end was good?"" I say this... If I pay to see a movie, I want to watch a full length, high quality production. A good ending can not save a movie if the first half is void."
"dilbertsuperman","8","0","4","8 February 2006"," Spy thriller Mossad Style- Emperor Bush approved!
","The Mossad are a Jewish organization like the CIA, only more effective and far more murderous. This film tracks one man's descent into the world of spy vs spy Israeli style- in the events surrounding the aftermath of a terror attack on the Olympics in 1972.<br/><br/>While the film is very solid- it is also secretly, or not so secretly- a jew apologist film with its' subliminal anti-Arab messages, and as such is a very dangerous film to be passing off to the uneducated public as innocent unbiased entertainment.<br/><br/>The message of this film is that the Mossad was created for self defense only and their hand is continually forced by the dastardly evil Palestinians and it is with great regret that our noble mossad agents butcher women and children on a daily basis. <br/><br/>The killing must be done or the jews will lose ""their"" ""homeland"". If you have studied the intricate subjects of the israel conflict it will be obvious that this is very heavy handed on how innocent the jews are in their various mass murders. I can assure you the mossad is not a noble self defense organization, but rather the sort of organization that was behind 911.<br/><br/>Like many Jewish films this film is very resigned to accepting israeli violence as inevitable in relation to the Palestinian struggle against the illegal and immoral Israeli occupation. If you are uneducated you won't notice this poison barb in the script and instead be able to fully enjoy this solid thriller like a fat happy bunny.<br/><br/>Me, I was kind of disgusted that yet another piece of mainstream media is being produced during a confusing time of war- telling us how to think and feel about the Israeli struggles and to side with the jews because they are exercising the only option they have.<br/><br/>This of course is a state manufactured mentality as there are many, many other options that the Israeli's are simply too proud and corrupt to consider in resolving their disputes with the previous tenants of the land they stole. <br/><br/>One of the characters in the movie has a good 15 seconds of soul searching when he realizes what he is doing(killing) is essentially making his reason for living worthless and only helping to make things worse with the Palestinians. That's about all the movie has for any moments of regret or sanity for killing innocent Palestinians- about 45 seconds of film time.<br/><br/>So while this movie is a solid thriller and accurately portrays what it feels like not to be able to trust anyone when you are on a mission, it is important to note that this a clever deception through media manipulation during a time of war when it is important for Americans to support siding with the jews against the Arabs in order to move Emperor Bush's military stratagem forward.<br/><br/>Don't think for a second that the timing of this film and it's subject matter are not endorsed or encouraged by our current dictator. I haven't seen such a clever mental abuse of a media audience since the debacle about the dutch cartoons about Mohamed. Beware of your media- it's not without its brainwash attempts. Jarhead is another much crappier movie in this dangerous style of new propaganda for a new empire."
"happy_hangman","Null","0","2","7 February 2006"," Hardly an Olympian Feat
","'Munich' has managed, it seems, to offend just about everyone in the Middle East. The Islamic world finds it's representation of the Black September team who murdered the 1972 Israeli Olympic squad superficial, and it's understanding of the underlying issues which led to that act and it's bloody reprisals equally scant. The Israelis are outraged that their actions in retaliation for the Munich killings should be subject to ethical scrutiny. Both sides have their say, and the zealous defence of tribal territories is clearly established as the principal motivation for all concerned. But  and, given that the narrative is told from the perspective of the Israelis this is hardly surprising  it is a largely one-sided story.<br/><br/>Oddly, it's not this which prevents this from being a serious discussion of continuing . divisions in Middle Eastern relationships. Eric Bana, as Avner - the leader of the unofficial Mossad squad dispatched to terminate those he is informed by his masters are responsible for the Munich killings  gives a nicely layered performance as the patriot dispirited and dehumanised by his own deadly endeavours, and if the film works at all it is greatly due to him. His gradual realisation that he is an instrument of political manipulation, that some of his actions may lack righteous justification provides what moral debate exists within the piece, after all. No, what undermines the film is Spielberg's uncertainty as to whether he is conducting a personal, political debate or making an action-movie  as each action of Bana's team is, essentially, a dynamic little set piece. A more reflective, polemical piece may not have been so attractive proposition for the studiobut it would, I think, have made for a more stimulating piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Supporting performances are generally good, particularly Daniel Craig's Semitic zealot and Valeria Tedeschi as Bana's wife. Geoffrey Rush is rather disappointing as our hero's Mossad spymaster: a surprisingly stilted and unsubtle effort. The best, and most understated supporting turn comes from the always reliable Michael Lonsdale. Always worth watching, and a performer with genuine presence and seemingly effortless on-screen authority."

"Rich B","9","0","1","1 February 2006"," Harrowing and brutal with superb performances and amazing realism, it's a harsh but excellent movie.
","Controversy around Munich has been apparent from its announcement, and the unusual move by Spielberg to not talk about it or pamper to the Press has raised expectation and the very controversy he has sought to avoid. Then we began to hear that some critics didn't like it, and that the movie was biased towards or against one viewpoint. As usual I approached this movie with an open mind, and my Scottish viewpoint.<br/><br/>The first thing to say is that this movie firmly belongs on the Schindler's List side of Spielbergs work and nowhere near the E.T. side. I'm sure you have guessed by now that it is a serious political drama, but by this I mean it is hard, harrowing and at times quite a brutal movie. The journey will bring you downwards, not upwards to a nice fluffy conclusion, and not even leave you with much hope. Its showing in the clear light of day how messed up, manipulative, blinded and cold human beings can be. Be warned, it's a tough movie and not an easy afternoon viewing.<br/><br/>One of the amazing things that Spielberg manages to attain in many of his movies is the level of authenticity. Nowhere is this more apparent in this movie with the style of filming, costume and the writing. Blending real footage with reconstructions which look as genuine as actual news footage, keeping costumes as in the period but without resorting to 70's cheese, using actual camera equipment and styles that represent those used at the time, all combine to give a harsh but very real look and feel to the movie.<br/><br/>That is one of the big positives of the film. It's extremely realistic and with that comes the tough and often brutal representations of events from history and the book the movie is based on. Nothing is sugar coated here for Hollywood audiences, and no better places is this shown than with the scenes of murder. From explosions to shootings, they are all portrayed openly and as they would be in real life. Fraught with tension, understated, and meeting death face on. If you are looking for an easy ride in this film, or some shock entertainment, then you are sorely mistaken.<br/><br/>I felt that this was quite surprising for Spielberg, even though he has tackled tough subjects in the past, this seems to push the representation of the darker side of reality even more. At times viewing the movie becomes almost uncomfortable to watch, but you're drawn to it like watching a reality show, or news footage.<br/><br/>Despite the subject matter there are still a few moments of traditional Spielberg creeping in. There's nothing that harms the movie, but they do illicit a groan and hurt the odd scene for me. One such moment is the where the Isreali and Palestinian argue over a radio station, and what brings them together is the compromise over American music.<br/><br/>This probably meant nothing when filming it, and the track was chosen because it was universally know and recognisable, and I really do hate looking for connections in other peoples work when there need not be. Yet it does certainly feel as if there is something being made of this moment, but it's twee and seemingly contrived. Thankfully, there are few moments like this, and you are returned to reality with a bang.<br/><br/>I have to say that I feel no bias in this film at all. Spielberg shows that all sides have their level of bloody mindedness and futility from Isreali to Palestinian, even the CIA and the KGB are shown as lost in their own types of hatred, self deception and self fulfilling agendas.<br/><br/>The acting is of the highest quality from all of the leads. Bana redeems his pitiful Hulk performance, and Craig shows us what a fine actor he is although definitely not a master of accents - this performance bodes well for Bond. Hinds provides another excellent performance which at times is quite chilling.<br/><br/>All these actors give top notch performances being strong, striking and intense. Craig, to some degree, but mainly Bana give the most emotionally charged and altogether confused performances which seem very human and with identifiable pain. Bana's slow change during the latter stages of the movie is particularly worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Hinds though, shouldn't be crowded out by these other actors. He brings perhaps the most grounded and real performance, and the moment of recognition of this actor when he first appeared on screen was a joy. I've seen him before and was struck by his performance, and this hits home again in Munich. His connection with Avner seems heartfelt, and his through the movie I was captivated by his character.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job of highlighting the futility of the ongoing and escalating acts of revenge, and how these slowly eat away at those involved, destroying who they once were. I say that thinking of all sides involved through the movie and not looking to either Isreali or Palestinian alone.<br/><br/>My understanding of the final events of the actual hostage taking in Munich does lay some blame on the handling of the attack on the terrorists. Yet there is no hint of this anywhere, and if I were to point any finger at this movie suggesting it was showing something or some group in an improper or inaccurate light it would be that very operation. It does not appear in the movie and indeed it portrays them as innocent victims.<br/><br/>However, this would have surely detracted from the belief of blame in the movie, and after all as Spielberg says, this is not a documentary it's a movie based on real events.<br/><br/>As I've said, this movie is tough, harsh and very realistic, resulting in a sometimes brutal portrayal of events. It's not easy watching by any means, but it is a very excellent and moving film."

It is much less flag-wavingly patriotic than I expected and offers a well rounded view of the issues involved. I wouldn't have minded a little more insight into the civilian casualties of the vengeful attacks. The acting is quite superb for the most part, although the part of the bomb-maker is a touch stereotyped which makes him a little hard to believe. My only other moan is that one is left guessing a little at the end as to the outcomes of some of the characters involved. Craig will be great as James Bond! Overall I would thoroughly recommend this movie but would suggest that it is watched after 5 Days in September, the excellent documentary on the same topic."
"stevetseitz","6","0","3","30 January 2006"," Munich: a good film a weak political statement
","I can safely say that Munich is a well crafted film. Spielberg presents a sobering and serious character study of a man given a grisly and dangerous assignment. The film itself is engrossing, beautifully shot and believable. Eric Bana, with a simply perfect reaction to hearing his baby daughter speak on the phone, establishes himself as a heavyweight actor.<br/><br/>That being said, Munich is a highly manipulative film. Spielberg makes clear by his emphasis on and juxtaposition of certain elements that his contention is that to respond in an ""old testament"" fashion to terrorism is pointless and merely continues the ""cycle of violence"".<br/><br/>This logic is seriously flawed if you put it to the test. First of all, there is no moral equivalence between a terrorist act and violent action against terrorists. Terrorism is the deliberate targeting of civilians and non-combatants to create fear among the general populace to manipulate the political landscape. Terrorism is cowardly, reprehensible and the last refuge of the ignorant and incompetent.<br/><br/>The ""cycle of violence"" argument is weak. If a thug punches some lady and takes her purse, is the cop that forcefully arrests said thug perpetuating a ""cycle of violence""? Of course not. Spielberg's other contention in the film is beautiful and noble. It is stated by the character Robert played by Mathieu Kassovitz. He states that all the years of suffering and persecution that the Jews have gone through has made them righteous and that they shouldn't ""lower"" themselves to the level of their enemies.<br/><br/>I believe that only someone like Spielberg who was born and raised in America and who has lived in relative safety, affluence and luxury his entire life could actually believe in the impractical course of ""inaction"" that he espouses.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the depiction of the cold, methodical methods used by the Israeli hit-men, particularly when the film goes so far to paint the Palestinian terrorists almost as innocent victims of circumstance. In the movie, the Palestinians who slaughtered the Israeli athletes are shown sympathetically as if there actions are simply responses to forces greater than themselves. They shoot in confusion and desperation, while the Israelis are portrayed as calculating and reasoning.<br/><br/>If this was not merely my perception but a goal of the filmmaker then there is really an inherent racism in the film. It depicts the Palestinian terrorists almost as sub-human, which is really a cop-out and downplays the cruelty and heinous nature of their crimes.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Munich"" is of high quality. As a political statement it is disingenuous and naive. I would only recommend this film to those who have an informed sense of history. Specifically, research the history of the Levant and the Six-Day War."

","I was fourteen at the time of the Munich Massacre,followed the events closely, and have been interested ever since.The raw materials for a great film maker, and film, are all here:hate, fear, revenge, plotting, treachery and intrigue - Shakespeare would have loved to have had a go! Munich works best in providing snapshots of the assassins and their victims.The piano playing daughter of the Paris ""hit"", the lover in bed with one of the Beirut ""hits"", and the joy, then despair, of the families of the Munich hostages are all wonderful vignettes.<br/><br/>The criticism from both Palestinian and Jewish supporters reflects a tremendous story telling discipline from Spielberg.However for a long film, some essential original detail was omitted which would have added to the drama.Before each ""hit"", in reality,the widow of one of the Munich victims was ""tipped off"" to watch the news by an anonymous caller.This complicity of Mossad and the Israeli Government in each assassination was ducked in the film apart from the implicit cooperation demonstrated in the Beirut raid.Was Spielberg too deferential to the Jewish lobby in this respect?<br/><br/>Equally,the spineless capitulation of the West German Government in releasing the three captured Munich Terrorists following a high jacking was referred to as an incidental. In reality, this was the real driver for revenge with those three top of the wanted list.The neutral portrayal of the Arab victims consequently evokes a sympathy which does not do justice to the motivation for the assassins actions.<br/><br/>I squirmed when the opening shots for Paris and London were the Eifel Tower and a red double decker bus.Audiences don't need that insult.As a Brit, the ""Twin Towers"" shot at the end on the New York horizon totally passed me by until I read the reviews.<br/><br/>The last quarter of the film is a mess.A failed ""hit"" appears, then ends without explanation or reason.The real life assassination of the wrong man in Norway is omitted altogether, even though this was the catalyst for the end of the killing programme. So anxious is Spielberg to sit on the moral fence that he concentrates on the personal moral confusion of the chief assassin rather than the bigger moral picture.<br/><br/>Ultimately, that is what limits the film. Great drama examines Great Moral issues by using personal drama to highlight them. Spielberg has done the personal moral drama well, but just holds back from the big picture.A fine, but flawed, effort."

Way too boring. It's depressing, dark, hopeless, and pointless.<br/><br/>Watching Bana struggle with his angst for over 2 hours was almost more than I could take. I hung in there to the end, though, hoping for a satisfying ending. Instead I got a ridiculous sex scene where our ""hero"" is envisioning gruesome murders while in the act.

The quote that stirred me in the theatrical trailer of ""Munich"", and the dialogue that stuck with me every step of the way today when I sat down to watch Spielberg's latest venture into cinema. Where does one even begin todiscuss a film that has created endless discussion before it's generalrelease? Simply in the same way Spielberg handled the material when he set out to make such a complicated film, ""With careful hands"". In a film that follows a team of Jewish assassins requested, to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists after the events of the Munich Olympics, there is nothing but pure cinematic tension from beginning. However difficult it is to begin watching this film, without your own personal views on the bitter conflict resurfacing from time to time, you can't look away from the dilemma on screen, or reframe from feeling nothing but sympathy for both parties. The violence within the film, although you are perfectly aware is just around the corner, hits you creating a pumping after effect and never fully allows you to recover. Spielberg tops scene after scene with his handling of dramatic materiel, and while the cause for conflict slowly disintegrates as the film progresses, we are left with nothing but remorse for the violence that never seems to end. The acting is spectacular with stand out performances from Eric Bana to Geoffrey Rush. While Spielberg is renown for his ability to bring out the most within his actors, it still to this day dazzles me how well this filmmaker can dabble in the different genres and still bring, living, breathing characters to the screen. While most of us will do our up most to enter the theatre with strong feelings determined to tackle this film, it's hard to walk out not feeling that you got a taste for this films endless pain and awakening perspective. Those determined enough to sit down to it, will be inflicted with the endless discussions that are presented before them. This is important storytelling for our era that will live with you hours and maybe even days after your first viewing. Without doubt Munich is Spielberg's bravest film to date, that requires only one sitting to grasp how upsetting violence and revenge really is, how it's ability to corrupt what appears to be the most noblest of intentions, and how the darkest part of mans soul can easily live with it."

","This was a very interesting movie, it wasn't good enough for me to watch the credits and it wasn't bad enough to walk out of. Eric Bana plays the role brilliantly as did Geoffrey Rush (thats good Aussie talent)however I thought there was a lot of unnecessary violence in it. I do realize to make such a tragedy realistic you need violence but not to this extent, all through out the movie there was bits and pieces going everywhere.<br/><br/>and also a lot of nudity, I mean it doesn't need to be in there, this could have been a great M rated movie...instead of a disturbing MA rating. That being said I do congratulate Spielberg on maintaining a good storyline and picking good actors. A good movie, could have been better, but there is still a chance for an Oscar"
"richardproductions","5","0","4","25 January 2006"," Not Worthy of Spielberg...Boo
","I'll give this a 5 out of ten and I'll tell you why. As great a filmmaker as Spielberg is, and I count one of his movies in my Top Ten, this is not worthy. He is basically making a remake or a slight altered version of a the film that has been made. This film based on the same novel by George Jonas is called ""Sword of Gideon"" and was made in 1986. Partially in Canada I might add. However, regarding the authenticity and budget of this film (""Sword of Gideon""), it shows a vision that is far superior due to the restraints of the production, cast and crew team. I respect what Spielberg has done in the past, but I would like to see what he could make on a shoestring budget in the present day. ""Sword of Gideon"" is a far superior film.<br/><br/>A note to our friend, Michael from the States. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was another miss by Spielberg. The first 15 minutes were totally interesting, then it got boring. How can you disrespect the works of other great directors you've mentioned??? Stone, Coppola and Minghella. I suggest you familiarize yourself more on film before you criticize it. Read some of the interesting posts on the ""Sword of Gideon"" page!! It just goes to show you sometimes Money Talks!!.....NuffSaid........."

","At first, Avner (Eric Bana) has few hesitations about his mission. Never mind that his wife is seven months pregnant; the men who killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics are animals. They respect no laws. Now is the time for Israel to show the world its strength, and Avner is honored to serve his country. Meeting his team members, he exchanges pleasantries. One is a doll-maker. The men marvel at Avner's cooking. The camaraderie is more appropriate to a fishing or hunting trip which, in a sense, it is.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is neither a paean to the Great Sacrifices required by war, nor a testament to the human spirit. Brilliant as they were in their own ways, neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Schindler's List,"" his recent political movies, share the ruthless detachment that ""Munich"" demonstrates toward its subject matter. It's hard to argue against the savage brutality of the Munich assassinations, and it's no surprise, really, that Avner and his team relish their task of locating the architects of the raid. When they find their first target, on his way home with his groceries, the banality of the situation gives them only momentary pause. Maybe they were expecting to interrupt a wild-eyed Palestinian in the act of eating a Jewish baby, but what they find is a regular person doing errands. He's an animal, though, and must be liquidated. The same goes for the target whose little girl answers the exploding telephone before him, and for the PLO's KGB contact, who makes pleasant small talk with Avner on a hotel balcony before being incinerated in his bed. Yet Avner can't confidently say that the Arab world is awed by Israel's show of force, particularly when letter bombs start showing up at Israeli embassies across the world, and when his source provides him with a fresh target who turns out to be the successor to a man he's just killed. These people are replaced faster than they can be erased. The letter bombs are a PLO response to the assassinations, which are a response to Munich, which was a response to <br/><br/>Spielberg takes no sides here, impressive for a director with a tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, particularly when it comes to portraits of his own heritage. ""Munich"" in fact seems less interested in the particular politics of the Arab-Jewish conflict than with the cyclical dynamics that propel people to fight savagery with savagery. Spielberg presents figures so fixated on breaking one another's will that they're blinded to the long view. Perhaps it's when his compatriot congratulates him on a successful hit and the birth of his daughter in the same breath that Avner begins to reconsider the wisdom of his course, or maybe it's when he realizes that the same source that finds him his targets could just as easily find him FOR his targets. As he ultimately says to his Mossad contact, though, ""there's no peace at the end of this."" Spielberg has reasserted himself in recent years with some of the leanest, most focused films of his career. With two hard-edged and one half-brilliant sci-fi pictures (""Minority Report,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" and ""A.I.,"" respectively), a coming of age story that managed to avoid pathos (""Catch Me If You Can""), and now ""Munich,"" I'm reminded why the guy is the biggest filmmaker in the history of the world. ""Munich"" is sophisticated and remarkably restrained by Spielberg standards. It doesn't profess to have The Solution to Middle East turmoil, or any number of other like conflicts, but it lays bare the folly of the strategies by which they have thus far been characterized."

","In spite of what some people might say, we (my husband and I)love the movie. It gives a nice view on the stupidity on both sides. Spielberg doesn't take sides, but had to choose from which point of view to show what happened then and what is still going on at the moment. In Belgium a lot of Jews en Arabs live in the same neighborhoods and are trying to live peacefully together.<br/><br/>The movie had beautiful screen-shots, extraordinary music and the cast was well chosen. This is a high quality movie with great potential of letting people thing about certain things. I was surprised to see how well Spielberg captured certain situations and succeeded in keeping the viewer chained to their chairs. The movie is showing in Belgium from 25th January. We were two of the lucky ones to see it in premiere.<br/><br/>I would love to see more quality movies like this!"

","I've just proudly seen Munich in a preview in Southampton. I must comment a little on it, and for once I'd like to avoid considering the story: when you start talking of terrorism, and Israel, and Palestine, well, you may never end it. So I won't start.<br/><br/>But... the film! What a film. I'll be afraid, in the next few days, of watching any other film, especially my favourite ones, because they cannot help but seem minor in some extent. What a technique! I'd never seen before so great realism in the acting and in the direction. You may love such a realism, independently of the story which lies behind, so beautifully realised it is.<br/><br/>I loved: 1 ) one of the first scenes, with the television showing the original live footage of a terrorist going out on the balcony of the hotel, shot from inside that same room; 2 ) the photography (each frame could be enlarged and watched as is); 3 ) the photography of the mother smiling and hugging her little daughter, against a beautiful bright light; 4 ) the final lovemaking scene, intermixed with the dreadful memories; 5 ) the tours over all the Europe of the 70s, perfectly recreated; 6 ) the very last scene with the Twin Towers, full of obvious meaning.<br/><br/>Great."

","Seeing Munich last Saturday, I came away emotionally exhausted, my husband left feeling unresolved. I found some of Spielberg's attempts at humor distracting, such as the accountant making abundantly clear he wanted receipts!!! The tenor of the film seemed a little uneven, perhaps that was the intent, the whole situation was pretty untenable. Not sure what to make of Papa and/or Louis, who proclaim such disdain for what governments can and do do, but make a very comfortable living off of that ambiguity. Not clear why such relatively untrained people were brought in for these jobs. Amazing what they pulled off, all things considered. Are targets really that easily accessed? Eric Bana has been a personal favorite since Blackhawk Down, I thought he did the best he could with Hulk, he was very effective in Troy, or was that just by way of contrast with Bloom and Pitt? Still remember ""Papa"" from ""The Jackel""(the original one:), he continues to be convincing and effective. I thought perhaps Louis had the most difficult role of any, lacking the passions of his father, how did he feel about his ""job."" Clearly I need to view this film again. No doubt all my questions are answered. In the meantime, though, I applaud the film and Spielberg. It is the first feature-length film to take on this horrific time and crime. I remember the made-for-TV movie, of many moons ago, with Lindsey Wagner as a compassionate flight attendant who talks to one of the terrorists, I almost feel like that depiction was more evenhanded, perhaps. Of course, it stops with this event's playing-out.<br/><br/>It seems clear to me Ms. Meir's motivation was pretty purely revenge/vengeance, not sure she had any good alternative choice, though.<br/><br/>Those are my thoughts, as of this day!"

I was only eleven years old at the time of the Munich Games, but I do remember the news broadcasts during that time. I applaud Spielberg for bringing the incident to younger generations, and filling in the memories of the rest of us. Even though the movie runs 2 hours and 44 minutes, it doesn't seem like it at all. There is so much action and keeps you pinned on every word from the opening credits until the end. Bano's performance was beautiful! And despite the very serious nature of the subject, several lines scattered throughout the movie brought giggles from the audience. Bravo!"

","5 hours later, I'm still tense. I'm physically exhausted. My body and my mind both ache. Munich has this effect not merely by being a thriller, but through its messages. In fact, I'd say it's more the latter.<br/><br/>It's plot serves three purposes. First, it discusses the conflict that seems to perpetually surround Israel and Palestine. Second, it acts as a character study, one that examines what a man should fight for, and what this fighting can cause. Lastly, it addresses what loyalty truly is.<br/><br/>Plot point one: Though Roger Ebert seemed to feel that Munich was only a film that gave facts that the audience was supposed to draw a conclusion from, and despite the fact that Munich's director, Steven Spielberg, said he thinks there will be peace in the Middle East in his lifetime, I felt that the movie really suggested peace is going to take a very long time to arrive in the region. The picture's protagonist, Avner, boldly states this once his experience has ended. Though I'm getting a mixed message from what the movie said and what Spielberg said, I think that, unfortunately, the movie's message is accurate. Considering that many Muslims feel Israel belongs to them, there's going to inevitably be trouble.<br/><br/>Israeli Jews aren't going to give up their land anytime soon, either. In this day and age, Israel represents Judaism. It's what the Jews have, after the many centuries following the Diaspora.<br/><br/>This sets up a conflict that won't end any time soon, and I think that Munich realizes this. There is no inspirational ending, just a realistic one.<br/><br/>Plot point 2: Avner is the leader of an assassination squad, sent by Israel to take out those responsible for the Munich attacks. In a nutshell, the killing takes a toll on him. We've seen the James Bond movies where Bond kills, kills, sleeps with women, and kills some more. Though Avner kills, too, he makes Bond look like a sick, sadistic madman, completely indifferent to taking human life. This is because Avner experiences something that puts guilt forever upon his shoulders. One might wonder why this is a significant part of the story; it's not like normal people have to deal with that. Well, I, for one, have to choose a career quite soon; I've often considered the military. I don't think that I'll take this path precisely because of what Avner experiences. In fact, even if one isn't actually killing in the military, or even in the military at all, he or she still supports it. This indirectly supports the killing. I'm not saying war is bad, as I feel it is sometimes necessary. But it will inevitably have this effect on all who take part, and the motive for going to war must outweigh this. Munich asks if fighting over Israel outweighs this, and that leads me to my next and final point.<br/><br/>Plot point 3: I'm not trying to get all political here, but the movie even applies to things like the current war in Iraq. Now I admit that some soldiers will never see direct conflict, but a surprisingly large amount do. Is their desensitization worth fighting in Iraq? I'm not saying it isn't, because maybe it is. Nor am I saying that it is, because maybe it isn't. We have to decide for ourselves on that issue. The movie also shows Avner becoming less patriotic to Israel because he doesn't feel his actions are justified or necessary. An Israeli government official subtly criticizes him for this at the end. This parallels a lot of debate today in the U.S. Are people who criticize the war in Iraq unpatriotic? The movie implies that they are not unpatriotic, that they simply wish to improve the place they love.<br/><br/>I dislike addressing politics in manners like I just did because I know that it will inevitably stir up controversy, that some people might say that this review was helpful to them because they agreed with it, and that some might say it was not helpful because they disagreed with it. The same support (or lack of it) will go to this film for the same reasons. Though it is mostly a politically neutral film (finally), there are very slight leanings to the left side. I am slightly on the other side of the dividing line, yet this movie still spoke to me with many powerful messages. And I respect it for that."

","Munich staring Eric Bana Wow! Went to see this film without knowing too much history about the 1972 Olympic hostage taking. I was not even born yet. I learned so much about Israel and walked out of the film with a greater knowledge of what the Israelites have gone through and the plight if there forefathers. I would highly recommend this film to all who have the slightest bit of interest in History and Israel. I now have decided to take a trip to Israel and check out the Kibbutz, and learn more of their history. The only problem I had with this film was the length, I think it could've had about twenty minutes shaved off, nearing the end I found myself looking at my watch wondering if it was ever going to end. Although I understood the need for it to be the length it was. If you can't sit still in a theater, wait for it to come to video. But do see this film and go in with an open mind. I applaud all the actors for a job well done and hope that this film gives people the message that was intended. Enjoy the movie!"
"the_rattlesnake25","8","0","1","20 January 2006"," ""An intelligent film, by an intelligent Director.""
","""The darkest day in Olympic history, September 5th, 1972."" The film is obviously about the '1972 Massacre'. For anybody who hasn't heard about this event, during the 1972 Olympics in Germany, 8 Palestinian 'Black September' members climbed into the Olympic Village before taking hostage, and eventually killing 11 Israeli athletes.<br/><br/>While the film centres more on the Israeli retaliation, where they hired groups to remove individuals thought to have masterminded Munich. Avner (Eric Bana) an Israeli Mossad Officer and four other men (including Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds) are hired to travel around Europe and 'take out' Black September members and sympathisers who may have helped plan the attack. Until eventually the hunters become the hunted.<br/><br/>I had mixed views before I was going to see this, because instantly I thought. Spielberg is Jewish, this film centres around Israeli/Palestinian relations, obviously it will be biased in some way or another, but I was dually surprised to find this film not taking any sides to an extreme point, just relaying the hard facts on top of an underlying deep moral message.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is typical Spielberg, a quick violently sequence showing you the horror of Munich and the hell the Israeli's viewed. Setting a harrowing tone for the rest of the film. While the ending is a confusing mixture of the events and a strong emotional period.<br/><br/>Eric Bana was a brilliant choice for the leading role. He projects his emotion into the audience as he struggles with the guilt of murder and the fact he has been turned from a father of a newborn child into a relentless perfectionist killing machine. Ciaran Hinds is also great as the emotionless 'cleaner' until the pressure of the job clearly gets through to him and his true colours are shown.<br/><br/>Credit also has to go to the Scriptwriting team of Tony Kushner and Eric Roth. A slick and thoughtful screenplay which gives the film an extra leg to stand on. While the most notable scenes are the ones involving the assassination attempts as perfectionism is trying to be achieved.<br/><br/>One thing that got to me was the running time. This film runs for around 2hrs 33mins and could've easily been edited to around 2hrs 10mins as some of the scenes add little to the overall story except for boredom and confusion.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent film by an intelligent director that portrays just one 'fight' in a longstanding battle between the Israeli's and Palestinians.<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"

","I took 6 18- 20 year old to see this and to them it was awful, i have to agree compared to his other work this Spielberg film was poor. The plot is good as are the actors, but the most important thing is it takes too long to tell the story. The build up to each action scene diverted into irrelevant areas. There are two sex scenes that are just not relevant. The shock horror moments are shocking because the volume in the cinema is too loud and the gore is too visible, he needs to go back to Jaws to remember about suspense. I would also question why they put subtitles in for some dialogue and not others. This film could loose at least 30 mins and it would perhaps flow a little better.

I hope no man having sex is obsessing about a hijacking he was not actually present for. Why the obsession? And what was the point of ending on a shot of the twin towers if not to ensure the audience hate Arabs? The editing is trite, a bad attempt to make us feel we are indeed back in the 1970's...and likely an afterthought as the shooting style is not as 70's...

","The one and only problem this film has is the nature of the subject matter. Any film made from a contemporary event will *always* be subject to criticism; making one that involves contentious issues such as terrorism, Israel, assassination, or intelligence agencies simply amplifies that criticism to stellar heights.<br/><br/>The best advice to give anyone going to see Munich would be to put your politics on the shelf while you watch. This is a VERY good film, with a VERY good performance by Eric Bana (he was so good I didn't even realize it was Eric Bana until the closing credits).<br/><br/>This film does what so few intrigue movies do: it puts a human face on those doing the dirty work. Most films, based on real events or not, portray all operatives as cold-blooded killers or soulless robots. The screenwriters treat these Mossad agents as real people with real fallibilities, real doubts, real strengths, and honest reactions to incredible stress and danger.<br/><br/>Above all, it's that last phrase that most aptly describes the power of Munich. Men are irrevocably changes by killing others, regardless of the justification. It changes one in many varied ways. Some collapse inward under the strain; some become more monstrous with every event; some become careless, as if they want to be killed in return; for every man it is different. This phenomenon, and the obsession of vengeance, are the two big themes of Munich.<br/><br/>Beyond this, the film is well shot, quite fitting for the setting. It's also well cast and well acted, beyond Eric Bana there are good performances all around. And the score is pretty compelling, too. Not your standard John Williams' fare.<br/><br/>I very much recommend this movie. 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Barky"

","This movie made me very, very angry.<br/><br/>Only an ardent supporter of Israel, who knows all the facts and past history, will not see this movie as sharply anti-Israel. For an *average* person this film is a pinnacle of irresponsible movie making.<br/><br/>There is something Spielberg and many other liberal Americans (and I am a liberal person myself) don't understand: some guys are just violent freaks! No amount of reasoning and dialog would've changed Hitler, Stalin, or Saddam. Showing a Palestinian terrorist with agony on his face - almost driven to tears! - as he was executing five hostages by an automatic weapon epitomizes this dangerous misconception.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie is spent showing in details the Palestinian assassinations carried out by the Mossad team. The well-paid mysterious source of their names and whereabouts (a fictional character) is a ""black box"" which hides away most other details, allowing good two hours of the movie to focus solely on the killings. The very first target sets the tone: a very pleasant and courteous gray-haired man who was just applauded by his Italian audience in a streetside café in Rome after speaking about his translation of 1001 Arabian Nights into Italian, who is killed with a bag of groceries in his hands - milk, wine, bread he just bought at a corner store. Milk flows on the marble foyer floor, followed by blood, as the Mossad agents run away out on the street like children who have just done some booboo.<br/><br/>One of the more poignant speeches comes from a young Palestinian fighter, later killed, an actor with beautiful, expressive eyes, saying that home and land mean everything, even if it will take hundreds of years to take them back. ""How long did the Jews wait to get their country? We'll wait, make children, children will make children, and we'll get it back."" He sounds prophetic; Avner, the team leader, has nothing to reply to that.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie periods between the killings are punctuated by TV newsreels about new Palestinian terrorist acts, highlighting the main point of the movie: violence begets violence; vengeance like this for an unspeakable atrocity of Munich massacre is NOT an acceptable answer. Even more irresponsibly, the movie implies that there is no solid evidence, the kind a liberal Western person expects - especially in this era of political lies and intelligence lapses about Iraq - linking most of the assassination targets to the Munich massacre. That's untrue - and dangerous.<br/><br/>Avner's torment results in the ultimate anti-Israel statement of the movie: from the initial sentiment, expressed by his wife, that ""Israel is his mother"", he travels the whole path to basically the rejection of Israel by immigrating to Brooklyn at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the cinematic quality of the movie itself (which is too long for what it does with most of its time) - when Avner passionately screws his wife while having flashbacks - rather, fantasies, since he couldn't have witnessed it himself - of the Munich hostages being killed, all I wanted to ask was, ""How was sex - good?"" If this is the roof of Spielberg's ""artistic symbolism"", he really should stay with ""Jaws"", I'm sorry..."

So much for Munich's ""ethical"" ""exploration"" of ""issues.""<br/><br/>The plot is tedious. That's one guy killed; now on to the next guy. And the next guy. And the next guy. Yawn. Look at watch. Eye theater's ""exit"" sign.

I can remember exactly where I was when the news was broadcast that the athletes had been murdered.<br/><br/>I was aghast. Paralyzed with grief and fear. I could do nothing for hours afterward but somberly ponder the consequences of this horrible act, and its inevitable consequences.<br/><br/>Another example: After 9-11, the New York Times published ""Portraits of Grief,"" a series of one paragraph biographies of the victims of 9- 11. Like millions of other readers, I found reading these brief, simple bios unendurably moving. Reading a one paragraph biography of a victim of terror moved me much more than all the whoop-de-doo fake blood splashed on the screen, and shallow hand wringing, in ""Munich."""

","I may be one of the few, but MUNICH shares more similarity to Spielberg's worst film (in my opinion) THE TERMINAL than it does to the MUNICH-compared films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST. MUNICH starts as strong as any film this year, with a sequence that illuminates the historical realities of the 1970's; Americans (supposedly Olympic athletes) help the terrorists get over a fence into the Olympic compound. It's a possibly un-aware reference to America's bumbling foreign policy of ""helping"" other countries out.<br/><br/>Anyway, the action picks up quickly and major players are introduced in classic Spielbergian ease. The film may be ambiguous in its politics, but it's precise in its dialogue and character setups. Everyone has their dye cast early on, so you can see their developments ahead without giving away too much. What follows the fractured sequence involving the hostage crisis is a swiftly paced action story about the Mossad hit-squad put out on the terrorist's tails. As the assassins begin to see the humanity in their targets, the film begins to lose its way, until eventually the weight of Eric Bana's guilt derails the film into its frustratingly imprecise third act.<br/><br/>The film is gaining praise around the world for its daring stance on an epic, historical struggle between the Jews and Islam. But where the film does attempt a more balanced look at the struggle, it misses its mark trying to defend its three hours, finished with a too-long ""you can't go home again"" sequence.<br/><br/>It's a noble effort, perhaps, but certainly far from the best Spielberg has done. Perhaps he was so aware at how controversial the film would be for its subject he never scrutinized its narrative arc. What starts as an action movie with a conscience ends with a boring denouement for Bana's Hero of Israel. He realizes he may have enjoyed killing just a bit too much. This has been done before in better films. I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but I won't defend this as greater than a 7, an earnest attempt but it misses its mark."
"thegreatczar","7","0","1","9 January 2006"," A great movie which was missing a lot of scaffolding....
","*Spoilers* Munich, the Olympics 1972. An event that I was somewhat familiar with. Nevertheless, SS takes for granted that we know everything about it. This movie could have used an introduction a 'la Fellowship of the Ring to bring us up to snuff. While the overall plot is an excellent story that needs to be told and the acting is good, sometimes the movie slips. For instance, Eric Bana's character suddenly gets a massive dose of paranoia rather than it building up through the movies 160 minute runtime. Much of the ""suspense"" in the movie seems manufactured. For instance the child coming home when her daddy's about to be killed. And who didn't know that that woman was an agent the instant you saw her? Anyway, with a little work this could have been an outstanding movie."
"midnightgraffiti","4","0","4","9 January 2006"," Though Munich is well intentioned, its thinly-stretched plot and absurd length ultimately kill it.
","Steven Spielberg, why? The General Gist: What could have been a gripping, provocative, inspiring thriller instead became a listless, inconvenient disaster that left this reviewer looking at her watch instead of the screen. Though the previews for the movie promised an action-packed, suspenseful saga of the revenge of the Jews in the aftermath of the 1972 Olympics, Munich turned out to be one hour of serious material, and a further one hour and forty three minutes of senseless droning.<br/><br/>The Good: More or less historically accurate, Munich addresses a fresh topic, which is a relief in a cinema world dominated by sequels. Though not particularly insightful on the Israeli/Pakistani conflict, the movie may get a few gears turning in the minds of movie goers who are not CNN regulars.<br/><br/>Also in Munich's favor is its pull-no-punches approach to the violence inspired on both the part of Avner's team and that of the nameless Palestinian threat. Definitely not appropriate for the squeamish, there is no omission of the pain that comes with war in this movie.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Munich shines on the big screen. Vivid coloring and slick action shots bring the story to the viewer, and the sound is clean.<br/><br/>The Bad: Two words: Too long. Munich drags on and on, painfully limping through enough storyline to comfortably fill an hour's worth of film. Though the action scenes are brilliantly done, there are too many of them, and they are all the same. Munich brings a Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith quality to the big screen; there are so many places where the movie could have ended, and just refused to die.<br/><br/>The main characters are as a whole unsympathetic. Ayalet Zorer shines as the beleaguered wife Daphna, and Mathieu Amalric is suitably slimy as Louie, and this is where the nods end. Eric Bana fails to put protagonist Avner into more than one dimension. The supporting cast, while inspiring fleeting feelings of camaraderie, isn't given enough to do. The plot regarding these characters is also a little wacky, as three of them die, two inexplicably. The 'evil' Pakistani terrorist group, Black September, fails to inspire even a twinge of dread in the audience's heart. A strange sub-plot involving a Dutch assassin serves as a reminder to Avner that he's not invincible, but it comes out of left field and forces the movie on for another thirty minutes.<br/><br/>The ending is another sore spot to this movie. Having lost almost his entire team to the throes of war, Avner returns to Israel for a debriefing, which he refuses to give for an unexplained reason. He has moved his wife and child away from his mother land to Brooklyn, also for uncovered motives. Stranger still, instead of exorcising his demons with meaningful dialogue or resolving what he's done with his civilian life en route to the arms of his lovely, pregnant wife, Avner finds catharsis in a series of weird flashbacks while having sex with said wife, leaving this reviewer more than a little confused. The thing that ruins the conclusion more than anything else was that there really wasn't one; the movie literally fades away into the Brooklyn sunset.<br/><br/>The Grade: C- Though Munich is a fresh idea and has good intentions, a thinly stretched plot and the absurd length of the movie ultimately bring it down. It's the first movie that this reviewer has ever wanted a refund for."

","Munich isn't the kind of movie that you walk away from feeling jolly and light-hearted. It is in many ways sickening, but I'm sure that Spielberg wanted it to have such an effect on its audience.<br/><br/>Munich's plot revolves around the assassinations carried out by Mossad agents against terrorists suspected of planning the 1972 Olympic kidnappings and murders of Israeli athletes. It is graphic and disturbing, but it effectively decries the violence perpetrated by both sides in the conflict.<br/><br/>I felt that Munich didn't do a good enough job developing characters and their relationships, but other than that, Munich was a very good movie. It's central theme was home. All any Israeli or Palestinian wants is a place to call home to share with his/her family. It also effectively showed that violence only begets more violence and that the only solution that will work in the conflict is one that does not involve revenge killings."

","I checked CONTAINS SPOILER because I want to come to it at the outset. There is no way I'll ever believe that any Israeli chosen, in collaboration with Mossad, to assassinate the Fedayeen who murdered the Israeli athletes at Munich could have shown any bit of remorse over those justifiable revenge killings. Yet, Spielberg would have us believe that Eric Bana, in the role of Avner, did and so much in fact, that Geoffrey Rush, playing a chief Mossad agent,refuses to break bread with the man out of contempt and disgust. I didn't remember that much about the Munich Massacre but after witnessing the event all over again,one is so livid, especially in light of 9/11,that anything goes regarding the permanent removal of the responsible Palestinian Fedayeen terrorists. Need I express my letdown by the conclusion of this film and if the government of Israel has a grievance against Spielberg, it is justified."
"kungfugee","7","0","3","9 January 2006"," Uninspiring
","I have seen better and expected better work from Spielberg. Munich offers several great performances, like those of Eric Bana and Geoffery Rush. However, while the story is influenced by the actual events that follow the Munich massacre, it offers very little to movie goers who are looking to be entertained. Munich drags along while making generic and exhausted points on Middle Eastern politics that anyone who is even remotely familiar with the Arab-Israeli conflict would already be tired of seeing. If you're looking for an engaging political thriller, go see Syriana. If you're interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict, I would recommend that you borrow a book from your local library, and not watch Munich. The only thing that saves this movie from a lower rating, in my opinion, is Eric Bana's performance, which is certainly Oscar worthy. The only good part of the movie was the 15 second conversation between the bomb maker and Avner in the airport, before Avner and the other men leave to find the Dutch assassin. Finally, the movie ends without resolution, much like the nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This story would make a good documentary, but not a good feature film. If you're annoyed by the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict, you will be annoyed by this movie also."

"castigjm","9","0","1","8 January 2006"," A Great Movie
","Munich is a great movie, definitely one of Spielberg's best films. Munich shouldn't be looked upon as just as a drama, thriller, or action film, but a piece of history that everyone should know about. Spielberg tells the story in a violent, brutal and mature fashion. More importantly, he makes the film feel more real than any other film inspired by true events. The events that take place after the murders of the athletes in the film are intriguing. You will be tuned in, and at the same time feel uneasy. This is much on the same level as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but this time around the main characters aren't portrayed as heros or monsters, just men on mission in which they aren't entirely prepared for emotionally. The performances are great, especially Eric Bana who i hope gets recognition this time around.<br/><br/>While the mood and tone of the film is perfect, the films editing has a few problems. Some scenes could have gone/been shortened. The sex scene intercut with the Munich killings bothered me the most. Even if the intercutting had its own message, i still feel Munich killings shouldn't have been intercut at all. The editing also creates some confusion and it is at times hard to follow whats going, sometimes feeling like you've been left out some important points. You'll have your gripes, but certainly not as much as you did with War of the Worlds :) Its not perfect, and some of Spielbergs decisions may be controversial, but its still an important film and its problem hurt the experience little. Highly recommended."

","I found this film unnecessarily long (2 3/4 hours)which made me wish that I could have edited it. I could have cut at least an hour out without damaging it in any way. The flashbacks were choppy and in some cases unintelligible. More time should have been given to the actual massacre up front and the flashbacks would have been unnecessary. The picture felt very propagandistic to me and I can see why Spielberg was accused of being anti-Israel.<br/><br/>I will say however that the acting was excellent and the use of lesser known actors was effective. Somehow, I could not have seen Tom Cruise taking the part of Avner. I would give this film 2 stars at best."

","Munich is based on the book Vengeance by George Jonas. The film and book are inspired by the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany where a Palestinian group came and killed and held hostage some of the Israeli Olympic team. After this occurred a group of men including an intelligence officer are sent all over Europe to kill different men who were behind the killings that went down during the 1972 Olympics. After committing these murders the intelligence officer named Avner , has to battle some demons of his own. Munich has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. When I first went into this film it took me a little while to get into it and understand what was going on, but from there I started to love the film more and more as it went along. It is very well made and has great acting and also is really an involving film. This film captured my interest and it would not let go. I was compelled through the whole movie seeing what these men did and I found the last bit of the movie where Avner has to deal with his own demons and thoughts of what he did to be very well acted and a good character study. The film also has some thought provoking moments and lets the viewers make up their own opinion of what happened after the Olympic tragedy. Munich is a powerful film that has quite a punch and it entertained me and kept my interest the entire time. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg and I would say that this ranks up there as one of his best films ever. This film deserves many Oscar nominations for the things I mentioned above and I hope that people see this movie and that it is awarded come awards time. This is one of the best films I have seen of 2005 and probably one of the best films I have seen it quite awhile. A truly powerful and moving experience and one of the best movie going experiences I have had in awhile. Munich is a true masterpiece."
"ilovedolby","10","0","1","8 January 2006"," One of 2005s Best Films!
","This is one of Spielberg's best films. The reason for that is simply that Spielberg addresses both sides of the issues between Israelis and Palestinians. Certainly he is pro-Israeli. But he is not anti-Palestinian. What we see in ""Munich"" that is even more convincing is how the leader of the Israeli assassination squad, Avner, played by Eric Bana, is that with every step of reciprocity that the Israeli's take, they lose something more internalizedtheir very identity is threatened to become everything that they have sought to prove and believed in. For example, in one scene, one member on the squad approaches Avner and says that he cannot go on doing this. He begins to weep. He says he doesn't even feel Jewish anymore and that the ones involved in the terrorist plot in Munich must be brought to justicenot simply murdered. As the film approaches its end, we see Avner, then living in New York City with his wife and child. After his mission, he has become extremely paranoid and feels that the Israeli Government may be trying to kill him to cover up any relationship to the assassination squad. One of the government officials played by Geoffrey Rush approached him and tells him essentially to calm down and not worrythey aren't after him. However, as their conversation goes on, Bana invites Rush's character to dinner at his home. Bana says something along the lines of, ""Well, you're a Jew. I'm a Jew. Isn't their something written in stone that I have to invite you to my home for dinner? We can break bread together."" Rush's character simply says no and walks away. You come to realize that everything they stood for has been lost in search of revenge, rather than justice. It all comes to bare on the most popular quote in the movie, given by the actress who plays Golda Meir, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."""

The event is, on it's own, a great story. But this movie could have been made about any sort of movie that involves murder and then revenge. Even, perhaps, about a murderer who is subsequently executed by the government.<br/><br/>I didn't feel a connection to the main character.

"jay4stein79-1","9","0","1","8 January 2006"," The Best of 2005--#8
","I am not one of those who resides in the camp that condescends to Steven Spielberg for being a successful filmmaker. Because the man makes money (a lot of money) with his films does not make them bad. The man makes original, compelling, and affecting films, regardless of how much money he earns as a result. He's made many stinkers (1941, Empire of the Sun, Amistad, Hook, and Always come to mind), but he is also the captain of Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Raiders, AI, and Schindler's List. Spielberg may not be an auteur, inasmuch as there has never been what I would call a distinct style to his films, but they are manipulative and masterful in the best way possible. His movies jerk you around, make you cry, make you laugh uncomfortable, and scare you. He's a good filmmaker, and, in many ways, he reminds me of John Huston--another great filmmaker whose movies never had a ""typical"" John Huston feeling. <br/><br/>In any event, Spielberg's serious films have been pretty hit and miss for me. Schindler's is undeniably excellent, but Private Ryan and the Color Purple seemed simply okay to me. Munich belongs in the same category as Schindler's, as far as Spielberg's serious movies go, and it's also one of the best films he's ever made. <br/><br/>It starts off inauspiciously. The scene of the actual kidnapping and the kidnapping/murder's television coverage is phenomenal, but it sinks to mediocrity as the Israelis plan a response. There was something about that meeting sequence that just felt wrong to me. It didn't feel like a good movie but rather felt awkward for no apparent reason. Fortunately, there's nary a bum step from that point forward. <br/><br/>For the next two hours you're plunged into the tale of Avner et al as they set out to kill Arabs believed to be responsible for Munich. That Spielberg combines terrific action sequences with thoughtful meditations on terrorism and Israeli-Palestinian relations is incredible. I doubt anyone could have found a better balance. <br/><br/>It's also remarkable that Spielberg fails to take sides. I generally despise films that make a point of taking a solid position, so I was pleased to see a film that appears to be neutral on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It's a complex situation and, really, both sides are screwed up. That's the way Spielberg presents it. He says look, the situation is totally f****d and both sides murder one another and that's going to keep happening and that's a terrible thing. The film doesn't pretend to have any idea about how to solve this problem, and, though that may upset some, I think that's an honest approach. Who knows how to deal with this problem? I don't know and I doubt Spielberg thinks he has the answers; it would have been false for him to assume the guise of authority. <br/><br/>Beyond the film's politics or lack thereof, there is, as I said, a lot to admire. Eric Bana was fantastic (which surprised me greatly), as was the rest of the cast, and the writing is top-notch, thanks, I would imagine, to the wonderful Tony Kushner. There's also a fantastic use of pacing. They edited this film in a way that makes it endurable. This film could drain you had they not decided to include pauses between relatively white-knuckle action sequences. <br/><br/>This is a stellar motion picture and one of the year's best."
"colonel_green","10","0","1","7 January 2006"," Spielberg is still the master.
","I just saw Spielberg's latest film, in a theatre that was pretty close to packed; and the audience was almost entirely older people (40+).<br/><br/>First of all, this is about the most un-Spielberg that Spielberg has ever been, even moreso than with Schindler's List; there are (at least, as far as I can see) none of the little moments that some people deride about SL (like the girl in the red dress, or Schindler's teary monologue near the end; personally, I didn't think they were inappropriate). There's one moment where Avner (Eric Bana) confesses to his wife (who's apparently named Daphna, but I don't recall it ever being said aloud; also, she's a total babe) that ""You're the only home I've ever had."" Daphna bursts out laughing at this, and remarks how corny that line was. It's almost like Spielberg is mocking his own past work.<br/><br/>There is way more sex and violence than I can ever recall in one of Steven's past films; the violence is especially notable: there's blood everyone, pieces of brain, you name it. In one especially disturbing scene an Israeli athlete has a whole blown through his cheeks, but is otherwise fine.<br/><br/>There are a lot of little moments, without any epic score or ""dramatic posing"", that really get to you. For example, an Israeli athlete is about to escape from the compound by jumping out a window, but, noticing a butcher's knife lying on the floor, he grabs it and wordlessly charges back in, killing a terrorist before being machine-gunned to death. Performancewise, Eric Bana should get an Oscar nomination for his work here; it's a magnificent piece of work. However, his character is a rather closed individual, so he probably won't get anything.<br/><br/>After this film, I'm convinced that Daniel Craig will be a particularly ruthless James Bond; his character is the only assassin who never has any real doubts about their mission.<br/><br/>Ayelet Zorer, who plays Daphna, is also notable (and, as I said, extremely attractive). The ""loving wife"" role is a bit thankless, but she is absolutely convincing. Actually, she may be my choice for this year's Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, et al. do their usual quality work. Lynn Cohen's Golda Meir is only in the film at the beginning, but she's a formidable presence (she looks more like an old grandma, but she commands the whole room effortlessly).<br/><br/>I give Munich 10/10."

"MsFarEast","9","0","3","5 January 2006"," A film that questions the morality of violence.
","After viewing this film, I have come to a conclusion: This is hands down on of the best films of the year and on of Spielberg's finest to date (including the remake of War of the Worlds). Upon hearing about this film, I had low expectations. I thought it was another plot-less, conventional, over-the-top, special effects movie with more flash than substance. Clearly, I was wrong. Not only is this a action thriller, but it is also well written, thought provoking, and well acting with great performances from the actors themselves. It is a story that grabs you and never lets go and the action doesn't let up until the very end. The action scenes are very well choreographed with no fancy moves that action films have. From the use of bombs to kill the perpetrators to a thrilling and exciting gun battle in Pakistan, the film has a strong sense of danger and tension on an epic scale. The political machinations of the Mossad agency gives the film a real sense of depth as the plans set in motion clearly describe.<br/><br/>However, beneath the film's quality aspects lies a message about the nature of violence. The Mossad agent (Bana, The Hulk) wants to kill the ones responsible for the killing of the Israeli athletes and does so with extreme prejudice. Soon, as the film goes on, he begins to doubt the nature of his actions and is about to give up. The real question boils down to one conclusion: Violence begets more violence. There really is no solution as far as world conflicts is concerned. This film sends a strong message about vengeance and its tragic and horrific results by those who believe in a ""eye for an eye"". Even in the war on terrorism, this message hints at the conflict in Iraq. Just because America ousted Saddam Hussein from power does not mean that the conflict in the Middle East isn't going to go away. Sadly, it is America and as well as the world, that does not realize that fact.<br/><br/>Truly, a action thriller with brains and heart. Worth seeing at the box office."

","Unlike some recent films that found themselves surrounded amongst controversy, Steven Spielberg's new film Munich does not cripple itself with a naive message or manipulative film making.<br/><br/>Rushed into production earlier this year, Munich could have been full of all the hallmarks of lazy film-making. Yet it shows thought, care, and passion.<br/><br/>As a film it is able to capture the feel of the 1970's very well. Both from the clothes to the look to the feel, this is a film that never becomes a cheap modern reconstruction. Spielberg even uses 1970's cinematic techniques, such as a frequent use of zooms, to recreate a time not so long past.<br/><br/>As a historical thriller this is a very modern film dealing with very modern issues. One person I saw it with was disgusted, calling it ""an awful piece of Palestinian propaganda."" Munich cuts to the nerve.<br/><br/>This is exactly why it is such a towering success, especially since it is a Steven Spielberg film. Spielberg often imbues his films with mega happy endings that wrap everything into a nice little bow. Just look at the conclusion from his War of the Worlds adaptation earlier this summer.<br/><br/>However, while Munich begins with the 1972 murder of the Israeli Olympic team and then follows the reaction afterwords (some of it of course fiction or speculation), the film ultimately transcends the entire Israeli Palestine conflict to reflect on the entire culture of terrorism begun with the Munich murders that has affected our world of today so deeply.<br/><br/>One thing that can often cripple ""message"" films like this is that they end with an overly simplistic message that can be summed up in a single sentence. Often times a film can become too much about the message and not enough about the characters, as well.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Munich has more to say than ""all violence is bad,"" or ""revenge makes us as bad as the people we are going after."" It also creates characters that are more than cardboard cutouts to be pushed through a story.<br/><br/>Munich never tries to justify the killing of the Israeli Olympic members, either, nor does it compare the murder of the Israeli athletes to the retribution of the people part of it. In both cases blood is spilt, but it is not the same.<br/><br/>Rather it examines the human side of such acts, observing how something that begins as a noble act of justice can quickly spiral out of control. Ironically, but sadly, often what is being fought for is quickly forgotten in the process of fighting.<br/><br/>In the last shot, a pan revealing the World Trade Center sitting quietly shrouded in the fog of distance, Munich borders on becoming a preachy indictment of modern America.<br/><br/>The last haunting line tempers this, though, as it does not condemn as a Michael Moore film might but rather suggests, offering something for those who know much about the Munich massacre, and for those who know nothing.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Munich is a human story that takes all these big issues and brings them to a personal level. Sometimes in the chaos of conflict we lose sight that what we are seeing is happening to people, and being done by people, and that you cannot examine any situation without looking at the people part of it and affected by it.<br/><br/>This does not mean that as a film Munich never stumbles, for it does. At points the hurried production time does rear its ugly head as certain scenes become muddled in unnecessary complexity. The main character of Avner, played by Eric Bana, could have had a bit better of an introduction to fully show his motives and the toll his job takes on his family.<br/><br/>There is also a perplexing and almost amusing montage near the end at a very important moment that drowns itself in murky pretension.<br/><br/>However, these small flaws hardly affect a film that is much more than simple ""Palestinian propaganda,"" or any propaganda for that matter. In fact, the very backbone of Munich encourages individual reflection rather than blind acceptance of an ideology or moral standard.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Munich reaches no absolutes because there can be no absolutes with such multi-faceted issues. It is this surprising complexity from Spielberg that makes this one of his best and most mature films to date, and a film that will bring him much controversy from those looking for a black and white conflict that is never portrayed."

","I knew very little of what happened during the 72 Olympic terrorist attacks and what happened afterwords.<br/><br/>There were some great performances. Eric Bana gives a great performance. <br/><br/>Spielberg can inspire great performances as shown in 'Munich' and his other previous movies. There were a few great emotional scenes but there were also some scenes that were serious but made you laugh. <br/><br/>One example is Bana screwing his wife and he whips back his head with sweat as he thinks about what happened in Munich. The scene is Munich was effective, it was when he was screwing his wife and thinking about Munich that made me laugh. Spielberg should have tried to explain the events of Munich another way. Another scene when they kill the female assassin had half of the theater laughing which is not a good sign with this kind of a movie.<br/><br/>It was hard to follow some of the plot. More emphasis should have been explained with the governments hoped to achieve from this operation, but I can see why they did this because the main characters are unaware with their government's plans and we can relate to their frustrations of getting the job done. <br/><br/>There were scenes that were very intense. A lot of the scenes captured the human emotion of the killings and the purpose of it all. If Spielberg would have made a few changes with some of the scenes then this could have been a fantastic film.<br/><br/>The movie had a few strong messages which relate to our current international surroundings. This movie relates to the morals of how we should deal with terrorists and when is a job truly done, at least that is what I got out of the movie."
"smck-1","7","0","2","30 December 2005"," Excellently directed and performed but lacking in direction
","As the synopsis says, the movie focuses on Avner and his team of untrained assassins trying to take out the Palestinians involved in the 1972 slaying of Israeli Olympians. Steven Spielberg, as expected, did an excellent job directing the movie and both the performances of the ensemble together and Eric Bana individually were outstanding. The movie brings up thought-provoking ideas about terrorism and vengeance, however, it is not until the last twenty minutes of the movie that they are explored. Most of the movie is spent following the team through its attempts to assassinate the members of Black September. Although there are brief images and references to the themes explored later in the movie, I felt that the movie was more thriller/drama than the drama/thriller as which it has been billed. This is not to say that the movie missed the point, but it was not until late in the movie that the viewer was shown the moral consequences faced by the characters and the ramifications of their actions.<br/><br/>I feel that this is the only problem with the movie however. As stated above, the movie is excellently made and well presented, but I feel that the screenplay was lacking in substance, which takes away from the excellence of the other aspects of the film. The movie is very good and is definitely worth seeing, but was ultimately a disappointment, considering who worked on it."
"ms_mogs","9","0","3","30 December 2005"," Spielberg breaks new ground
","This film has stirred up a wide variety of reactions, from the typical unjustified criticism provided by people who won't even see the film to the fluffier question of whether or not Steven Spielberg regains his status as film's top director from Peter Jackson. All of those miss the point. What Munich REALLY accomplishes is the deglorification of violence in entertainment through its story of a vengeance squad put together to hunt down and kill those involved in the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olymkpics. And he doesn't do it by force-feeding the audience, just with Hitchcockian style behind the camera, a questioning script and an unassuming -- but brilliant -- cast led by Eric Bana."

","Went to the Loew's Lincoln Center to catch the 10:30 p.m. showing of Barebacking Cowboys. After the first 20 minutes of boredom, predictable storyline, more boredom, lame situations...got up and exchanged that ticket for the 10:40 p.m. showing of Munich.<br/><br/>I have not written a review in quite some time. Why? There hasn't been anything released in the past year and a half that I would pay to see or even download on Gnutella. How refreshing it was to finally have the lights go down, sit back, and enjoy a film from beginning to end -- and become thoroughly engaged without having my common sense and I.Q. insulted by lame, disconnected, illogical situations -- and bad acting from over the hill so far gone ""stars/movie actors"".<br/><br/>Munich is a masterpiece. From beginning to end it engages you and leaves you wanting more like the best sex you ever had -- multiple orgasms. I recommend this film highly to anyone who was old enough in 1972 to remember the tragedy of the '72 Olympic games and the political scandals and cover-ups that followed. And for those that were not around back then, this is probably the best visual history of it you will ever experience. 3 hours, but worth every second. Will leave you wanting to know more of what happened with the central character."
"ozzy_fan_forever","10","0","3","27 December 2005"," Great Movie+ As if Spielberg can do anything else
","MUNICH is an excellent movie and deserves every award given. Having said that it could stand to be a little shorter. At 2 hours and 44 minutes one starts to notice the time past by the numbness in the butt. The story is the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic Games terrorist attack. 11 Isreali hostages were taken and killed. The story revolved around what the Mossad (Isreali version of the CIA) did to those who funded and planned the attack. Eric Bana is surprisingly good in the role. He shows the guilt of an assassin as well as the determination of person doing what he believes is the right and true thing to do. Ciran Hinds is equally good and deserves award nominations as the cleaner This film is action packed and very thrilling. It does not shy away from blood and gore. Bombs are detonated and you see the true aftermath. People are shot and don't just grab where they were supposedly shot and fall over. You see the blood. Definitely earned the rating of R. Spielberg cares for the material and is shown in every minute of the movie"
"palakurn-1","9","0","3","27 December 2005"," Look at comment
","WOW..This movie was so much more than what I was expecting. The movie shows the angst of each of the main characters as they question whether their loyalty to their country and religion is worth killing men with loving families. Though I will not discuss what I believe to be the film's underlying theme, their are poignant scenes which underscore the futility of violence. While I do not know Spielberg's politics, anyone who says this movie takes sides is simply wrong. Like ""Requiem for a Dream"", this is a movie I believe many people with experience in the subject ought to see. In my opinion, this movie is the year's Best Picture so far."
"tlombaer","10","0","3","26 December 2005"," Spielberg's greatest work
","This movie was a delightful surprise for me. It is my tentative vote for best picture of the year. It has all the elements of a great movie. There is a good amount of violence, a good amount of nudity, great dialog, great acting, great directing, interesting plot. The length was a little less than three hours, and I was never bored. Although at some moments this movie was visually disturbing (graphic violence) I walked out of the movie with a great taste in my mouth. Eric Banna captures the fear of being hunted by unknown enemies perfectly, and all of the rest of the roles are cast perfectly. Much of the movie was shot in Europe, and these scenes are beautiful and do a good job of capturing European daily life. I can't think of another time when I was more pleased by a Spielberg film."
"vacaville-shane","9","0","3","26 December 2005"," Thought-provoking!
","The time went fast, a good sign. Rarely does one sit through this long a film with little or no squirm. The squirming came from subject matter. Other reviews have insinuated or claimed an ambiguous telling. I did not experience that, beyond the single pro-Palestinian rationale offered by a PLO agent in the film. Neither was a positive light cast for the Israeli actions, but the over-all feeling I am left with, having just watched it two hours ago, is futility. Not the film, no. It is an important film, worthy of posing the question, that being ""is vengeance worth it?"" Therein lies the futility. You'll have to decide for yourselves, of course, for who am I but a person living a fairly comfortable and secure life in the US? I know not first hand of having to fight for a home, making me a poor judge of such things. Yes, I'll need to ponder this awhile."
"nottesigana","7","0","1","26 December 2005"," some flaws
","here are some of the flaws that I saw. 1)Unlike Schindler's List, it didn't draw in the viewer. The acting was excellent but Avner remained emotionally unattached to the AUDIENCE. He was not someone that we (or I) could identify with. 2)the subplots weren't developed. Who were the different people? Why were the Israelis chasing them (besides being terrorists)? The role of some of the terrorists was unclear. 3)In conjuction to #2, there were too many (yes, I know that it was a global net work)who just were mentioned or appeared and just as quickly disappeared without much explanation...including the Israelis 4)The safe house scene was confusing 5)Was anyone also confused about the roles of Papa and his son? (yes, they were selling info, but why and why did Papa remain aloof from son? The garden scene with Avner: what was that about? 6)Avner's mom/ima? Why was she even IN the film? 7)it was about 45 minutes too long, it dragged in parts.<br/><br/>All that to say, a little on the boring side. The real event affected me profoundly."
"coolzed4","8","0","3","23 December 2005"," Good Action/Suspense, Intriguing Story, Unsatisfying Finish
","Munich is a great action/suspense movie, which unlike many films of its genre also has a very intriguing storyline and conflict. The problem was the movie's resolution. Munich does indeed ask very tough (and good) ethical questions, but provides answers that are WAY too easy. In case anyone is wondering, the story is not actually about the 1972 Olympic Incident-thats just the backdrop. Rather, the movie is about revenge in general, and whether violence justifies more violence. Without providing any specific plot details, my main problem with the ""easy"" answers is that Spielberg presents a whole complicated world with many shades of gray, then takes a black and white stance supporting one side at the end. Note: NOT for the faint of heart (there are some VERY gruesome death images)."
"richardbklyn","9","0","3","23 December 2005"," Munich was Spielberg at his medium to good-great
","""Munich"" was a good movie. I liked it. It showed a lot of mindfulness. It was good and I liked it. It shows that violence solves very little, but that people still have a strong impulse toward ""an eye for an eye,"" and that given particular circumstances, it's all very complicated and hard to figure out.<br/><br/>The movie itself was great, in that it left you with the feeling that ""you were on your own,"" in regard to resolving the pain, conflict, and political problems inherent in the struggle against terrorism / resolution of the Mideast conflict.<br/><br/>As far as the Mideast conflict goes, the state of Israel has a right to exist and so does a Palestinian state have the right to exist.<br/><br/>The following is just an observation -- not a judgment call -- but I couldn't even picture Israelis trespassing onto an Olympic compound and murdering fellow human beings (( Maybe if they were very far right-wingers ?? )) Then again, they have a thriving country out there. If they were living the way some of the Palestinians have to live, maybe they'd find killing easy and not have to go through some of the soul-searching Avner has to go through.<br/><br/>But I digress from the movie. Anyway, I guess there are just three races of people -- kind and unassuming . . . hateful and murderous . . . and Spielberg imitators. If only we had his money . . . and Tom Cruise's . . . and Tom Jones'."
