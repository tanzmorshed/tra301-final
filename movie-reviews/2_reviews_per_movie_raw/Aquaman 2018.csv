","And it has nothing to do with the comic books.<br/><br/>Bad and pointless<br/><br/>What is the point of this film? A big beefcake? Because that's literally the only storyline this mess has going for it. Pointless characters, horrible CGI for this modern time, bad acting, I could continue. If I had went to the theater to see this, I would be trying to get my money back. I gave it a 3 only because of the nostalgia I have for Aquaman. That's all that is good about this excuse of an action/family film."

","Look at the so-called Aquaman in this movie. Does he look like a prince to you? His mother was a queen?? Not at all.
I am not sure why they strayed so far from the Aquaman we all like and love.I guess the main actor looks like a bouncer or something so the loutish market can see him and like this film.

","What's with the 10 out of 10 reviews? really?. Sure it's probably the best (or second best) DC Justice league era, but that's not difficult.
Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't."

","I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one."

","I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic.

"gogoschka-1","Null","364","600","26 January 2019"," Everything But The Kitchen Sink
","Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.<br/><br/>I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn't just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn't, but it somehow does, which is why I've since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don't let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I've seen in ages. It's the film 'Valerian' wants to be. It's crazy; it's over-the-top; it's beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.<br/><br/>I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.<br/><br/>It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clichÃ©d, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.<br/><br/>So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct 'Aquaman 2', as I'm sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.<br/><br/>P.S.

","Finally, DC seems to be moving towards the right direction. I a big fan of superhero movies, not caring whether it Marvel or DC. The movie is very straightforward and you quickly get excited to know what's to come next after the first act. And oh please, the songs used are really good plus the visuals are really good. There are lots of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes and oh my that battle with Black Manta kills it. The main characters are very well explored.

"trevorcarpenter-28214","4","908","1614","21 December 2018"," I'm so annoyed with the people who reviewed this movie before I saw it!
","I checked all these reviews before seeing the movie. ""Most Beautifully visualized!!! DC movie... so far"". ""Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years!"". I was SOOO excited! I love all superhero movies, MCU and DCEU. I have been hoping for a good DCEU movie for so long, and have gone to each one hopeful. Wonder Woman was a step in the right direction in my opinion. I saw the reviews for this movie and was so excited to see it. And was subsequently let down, partially because I didn't read into the feud between the two franchises's fans.<br/><br/>Look, this movie should not be reviewed as highly as it is. It has GREAT visual effects and Jason Momoa is actually pretty good. However the rest of the acting and writing is so so so so subpar. I've been reading reviews all morning, about character development, how it is way less cheesy than MCU movies, just the right combination of funny and serious. Every scene feels forced like a formula: have at least one funny joke, one cool visual effect, and one heroic speech about the importance of what we are doing. So repetitive, the entire movie. How is that revolutionary, or better than any other films the DCEU has produced? I blame my disappointment in this movie based on the DC only fans who are just forcing good reviews on this movie based on their hatred of Marvel. Because while I definitely love DC, and I like Marvel sometimes too, I pay $15 at the theatre for a GOOD MOVIE not a BRAND.<br/><br/>I hope my review brings down some of the hype. It is still a pretty good film and OF COURSE I love Aquaman and think that every fan should see the film. But I could have waited until it is cheaper on DVD to watch, because it simply isn't worth it. Please don't let the annoying reviews that praise this film as some above holy savior of the franchise sway you, because it is not that jewel of the DC universe they claim it to be. And if any of those reviewers read this, please, when reviewing movies, leave your anger at the MCU at home so I can not waste money on a film that is by no means, saving the DC franchise. The last thing I wanted was to associate this film with disappointment.<br/><br/>tldr: this film really needed a poorer review because the amount of praise it is receiving is unrealistic, and causing people to get their hopes too high about a mediocre film."

The dialogue was TERRIBLE. The acting was also TERRIBLE. It couldn't pick a genre. Was it a comedy? Was it a soap opera? Was it a policital piece on pollution of the seas? Was it Star Wars? (did they really need all that tech??) Was it Avatar? WHO CAN TELL.<br/><br/>It was honestly all over the shop. I felt like each scene had a different director who was just going to completely disregard what everyone else has done before them.<br/><br/>Positives: the underwater CGI was magnificent. Like, really beautiful. Jason Mamoa is charming. I'll give him that.

Well, I wasn't wrong about that one. I still think his visuals are the best in DCEU but this movie had lots of moments too, those wide angle and tracking shots were a treat. The cinematography was really satisfying, so thank you to Don Burgess and James Wan for that. Underwater CGI scenes were breathtakingly beautiful to look at. Set-pieces makes you forget about the world you live in. Not on the same level as LOTR or Indiana Jones or Star Wars but It's close, and I think that's a pretty tough thing to accomplish. Dialogues were cringy now and then but, unfortunately, that's what makes a super-hero movie ''good'' nowadays, and this probably will continue for the next 10 years. Too bad the days where Nolan's TDK Trilogy gave you goosebumps with just words are gone. Now it's just you have to act weird and say something out of place to create a chemistry between the characters. I can't even believe how people buy these kinds of contrived relationships anymore. Anyways, let me say this, the movie isn't something like Thor (2011) It doesn't make you feel like you're on a movie set. It actually has high-quality different places that set the movie's atmosphere perfectly. If you guys worried about if the movie is just a copycat of MCU film, you can relax. The only similarity between this movie and MCU movies is 9 unfunny and awkward moment. The movie actually harbors multiple layers. Antagonists are actually valued, they're not just background actors or extra performers, they actually have moments to shine. This isn't something like Ant-Man. It doesn't have a stereotype, cliché, and generic film elements that created for the lowest common denominator. It actually has innovations for its genre. This isn't something like Black Panther, It doesn't have PS2 battle scenes. The CGI is actually well-crafted. This isn't something like Captain America: Civil War or most of the MCU films out there, it doesn't have a dim or bland color grading. The movie actually looks lively and vibrant. This isn't something like Guardians of the Galaxy, the characters don't act irrational or illogical, they actually have good reasons because they have developments. This isn't something like Ant-Man and The Wasp, It's not just a filler movie. It actually has a worth-seeing climax. This isn't something like Wonder Woman, It doesn't fail or fall flat in the third act. It actually fulfills its mission at every level. This isn't something like Avengers: Age of Ultron or any other MCU movie. The tone isn't out of place. The movie doesn't have a recurring and predictable theme. The camera isn't too shaky or it doesn't change in every second when an action scene comes up. The villains don't act out of character when they're in a situation. This isn't another Justice League, it isn't trying to be something else. It actually knows its place. But still, nothing can save this universe, not even something as good as The Dark Knight. But as a standalone, this is something worth seeing in the theaters.<br/><br/>PS. It's not better than what MCU offered us for 9 years"

I don't know what it is with DC movies, but they just lack something in their movies that just leave you questioning why you wasted over 2 hours, every single time. Like I said every girl on this planet probably saw it because of Momoa, that's a lot of money right there."

","It was slightly boring. I also found the underwater Atlantic conflict contrived and forced. Give me a break.<br/><br/>My problem is that I used to read the Aquaman comics a a child. I also used to watch the cartoons. Aquaman was not on dry land, taking his shirt off, gaining a love interest and white trashing the world. He was actually quite classy and interested in justice.<br/><br/>This is not Aquaman."
"ahmetkozan","8","430","809","30 December 2018"," The enormous visuality of Atlantis!
","We know that the DC cinematic universe that emerged as a result of the partnership between DC Comics and Warner Bros does not go well. Aquaman does not fall into this category. The film first appeared in China. Then the comments about the movie excited me. I was looking forward to it. It was a movie I really liked.<br/><br/>The story of the film is a complete story of origin. We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero. We see what Arthur Curry has been going through since his birth. I mean, you can follow the course of the story very easily and there is no scene you will be surprised. From time to time clichés and boring moments can be experienced. When you think it's a story of beginnings, the cliches don't bother you much. I think this is a must for superhero films.<br/><br/>While watching Aquaman, you feel a lot more of Wan's touch to the film. Aquaman literally makes you feel like a ""movie"". Because while watching the film, you can see the introduction, development and the result line in a very comfortable way. Everything is as it should be. The characters perform their duties more than enough. In the first 20 minutes, you already feel inside the film, and your attachment instinct confirms this. The origin of Aquaman is generally preserved. There are some minor changes to the film. At the same time, there are critical changes in the Black Manta and Orm. But if you are a comic book reader in general, Arthur Curry's story will give you pleasure. The film also touches on a beautiful subject; People pollute the oceans and nature. Jason Momoa had a successful performance. In particular, he has reflected the character change very well. Willem Dafoe is an actor that everyone will enjoy watching. Willem Dafoe had to have more scenes.<br/><br/>The film has technical errors, logic errors, clichés. But in spite of all this, the good aspects are much more. James Wan really created a separate world for the film. The underwater scenes were very good. The visuality is tremendous. Sea creatures, underwater conversations, used camera angles, location preferences, costume designs, fighting scenes, visual effects were very good. The music was just as good as the visuals. Even a separate film for Atlantis can be shot. 8/10"

","This movie was terrible. The acting was horrible. It honestly looked liked the cast had never acted before. The worst actor being Kekoa Kekumano. He plays the teenage aquaman, and honestly the casting director had to be high to cast him. Jason Momoa was ok however I still think it was a weird choice to cast him. Most the cast looked oblivious to what was happening and they probably had to be to take this movie. The choreography was one of the worst I've ever seen, and so were the transitions. However was in charge needs to be fired and never casted again. The movies plot was dull and predictable. They followed every cliche possible, and missed out on some possibly iconic scenes. The love interest just seemed forced and should have never been there. The lines were laughably bad to the point it would have been better if they said nothing at all. The background was too busy in almost every scene and reallly took away from the movie. The characters themselves have next to no arcs, and are confusing in the beginning. They tried to give to many qualities to each character. The best part of the movie was the visuals. The movie itself was stunningly beautiful. In all this movie isn't worth the IPad I typed this on. DC really needs to step up there game. They need to go back and learn from their mistakes and glows. Look at what worked and what didn't. Until then I would advise not watching their pathetic excuses for cinema."

"alexpapaniko-472-358998","2","502","974","13 December 2018"," Why is this so highly praised?
","So i just came back from watching this. And for once I wanted to see a DC movie and feel like it was worth my time. Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>-OK visuals..<br/><br/>-The undersea world looked like it had some potential. It would be interesting to see more about daily Atlantian lifes or how the other, seemingly very different kingdoms, function. Sadly James Wan did not want to elaborate on that.<br/><br/>that pretty much sums up all the good points of this movie. Now to the bad ones:<br/><br/>-no character development or any attempt to make the hero resonate with the audience which is very weird, aquaman being an origin movie<br/><br/>-very poor acting (especially Momoa.. My god.. ) and unexisting chemistry between actors which is almost funny at some points. Regarding the acting Aquaman is supposed to go from super-confident in the beginning to somewhat scared/sceptical by the middle of the movie by what's at stake. Movie tells you that's what's happening at least. Momoa never portrayed that in any way. Same dude throughout the movie saying his lines.<br/><br/>-Music selection. Aquaman is portrayed intentionally or unintenionally being somewhat goofy/witty/smartass. And the music background playing in every one of his scenes sounds like you are watching The Dark Knight. Only darker.. But goofy.. Makes sense.. No..? Ok moving on..<br/><br/>-Jokes were between cringy and plain bad. Some one-liners especially from Momoa made me shiver in discomfort. To me it felt like James Wan saw Thor: Ragnarok and tried the same approach but much much more poorly executed<br/><br/>-no real story development (or even story). Felt like a videogame where your hero goes from place A to place B fights some dude that noone cares about (Im looking at you Manta), gains his XP and then onto the next scene. Seriously if Manta was not part of the movie it would have made literally no difference. Pretty much like the Joker in Suicide Squad. DC was criticized about it then but here we go again....<br/><br/>-Again regarding the story. There is literally nothing original here that you haven't already seen in every other pop-corn movie before. If this is not your first movie then you can easily predict the lines, the story, the 'plot twists'... Pretty much everything..<br/><br/>-And since we are at the story.. Why was that submarine bombarding Atlantis? As far as we are told noone even believed in Atlantis aside from some people who were considered 'weird' or 'conspiracy theorists' by the general public. So could the government know about Atlantis all along? And its plan was to send a lone submarine some thousand meters undersea for what purpose? Or was it an inside job? Shouldnt we be told or hinted at least? I mean that incident, again from what we are told, initiated the war underseas that would lead to the invasion of the Atlantians against the people of the surface. Either I was half asleep when they explained/implied this or the movie was laughably lazy with this<br/><br/>I could go on but I mostly wanted to share my rough feelings on this especially after seeing how highly this movie is praised at this point. If this was released in the early 00s where the superhero genre was still discovering itself then it would have been fine. But at this point its definitely not.<br/><br/>Honestly if you care only for the visuals go watch it. If you expect anything more do not waste your time.<br/><br/>Personally I think I am officially done with the DCU"

This movie is definitely going to give DCEU a lifeline and after Aquaman, I really want James Wan to direct more DCEU movies in future."
"Zdiac","10","532","1042","9 December 2018"," Aquaman: retro dreams come true, to innocence and imagination!
","I really love this film. Everyone talks about the GCI in Aquaman,but what moves me most is its style ,so called ""old fashioned fun"" .Here I'll talk about this.(This review is translated from Chinese by google translater.And I'm the writer of it.)<br/><br/>First of all, the story of Aquaman is classic enough (that is, the old-fashioned set of some people), which is the journey of superhero treasure hunt. In an interview with James wan in""WorldScreen""magazine, James said that this is a very classic narrative technique. The growth of Arthur is like the growth of heroes in Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas movies. When Wan was a child, he watched the works of these masters grow up and always wanted to make such a movie, so this retro style is intentional. The facts also prove that the classic story will not be outdated. However, we can also understand from another angle that Wan did not try to try the dark and deep story style, but from the direction of being good at commercial blockbusters. In short, even if you don't have interest in the retro story, the level of the plot is definitely qualified in the super-Hero movie.<br/><br/>Second, it is the retro feel of the picture. On the one hand, many dazzling special effects brought us back to Avatar and the Lord of the Rings until the shock of the first Star Wars, and the imaginative and fascinating atmosphere of the underwater world is obviously a tribute to the classic fantasy sci-fi movies, like those of Star Wars. Just like classic fantasy operatic movie opens the window of imagination for us. On the other hand, James indicates that the film is expected to be like special effects movies in japan(like Ultraman and Godzilla in last century ). No wonder the friend who watched the movie with me shouted ""The clothes looks cheap"" when he first saw the soldiers of Atlantis. ..... I believe that it is not a problem to add more cool special effects to the soldiers, but James chose a very traditional approach , allowing the actors to fight in plastic armor and add to the film. A little bit of childlike beauty! Seeing this armor design is a little touched. We seem to be able to see james that realize the childhood special movie dreams,hiding behind the viewfinder and snickering.<br/><br/>And......To be honest,I'm little worried about Aquaman2,which is said to have been planned by Warner bros because the first episode is too successful,but I don't believe James will direct it again(just like SAW and Fast&Furious,he did once and did the BEST)And I'm also worried about Birds of Prey because the director is too young ...looking DCU(or DCEU) movies is funny ,we must stand some boring films ,but sometimes DC gives us BIG surpriseðŸ˜˜"

The fighting was extremely repetitive - all these scenes fighting with tridents became tedious pretty quickly, and the Ring of Fire scene had a ""shark bait ooh ha ha"" vibe to it.<br/><br/>Black Manta was gone for 3/4 of the movie, and he contributed nothing to the storyline.

","Better than any DCEU film, and some of MCU movies I think. The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.<br/><br/>But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.<br/><br/>Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D. Worth it."

However, the movie's biggest failure is its cheesiness. Unfortunately, it isn't the good, funny kind of cheesiness, but the utterly annoying one. Not a scene went by that didn't make me cringe, either because of bad acting, bad writing, or bad directing. Usually though, it was a combo of all the aforementioned.

","This movie is pretty entertaining. That, however, doesn't mean that it has a great script. The truth is, DC played safe on this one, and it pays off, mostly.<br/><br/>I was never bored throughout this movie, but that is not because of the clever dialogue, or the the amazing score. No, it's because everything in it is incredibly over-the-top. No kidding, be it the heroes or the villains, the action scenes or the romantic ones, every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated. Sometimes it worked for me, but sometimes it didn't. With that in mind, let's get to my pros and cons.<br/><br/>First, what i liked the most: the direction, specially during the action scenes. James Wan managed to differentiate himself from that Snyder style of action pretty well (there's still one or two ""Snyder slowmo"" kind of shots, but that's it). The fight sequences were well choreographed and shot, with wide angles for most of the time. It was very pleasant to see. Now, I usually don't like when movies start looking like videogames, but it didn't really bother me here. During the gigantic CGI battlescenes you've seen in the trailers, the amount of elements on-screen can be overwhelming, but for the most part, they are well enough shot that you can differentiate what's going on, and so they eventually become quite satisfying.
The interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining, but then again, because Aquaman is just really extravagant most of the time, so it becomes this quirky, awkward chemestry. But that leads me into the cons.<br/><br/>Yeah, remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here? Well, sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting, or just unintentionally funny scenes. For example (and I don't wanna spoil here), the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this ""lovey dovey"" scene, but that just took me out of the film because it's so over-the-top and doesn't fit at all with the previously established tone of the film. It was weird. Not only that, but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like he's a football commentator announcing a goal, like he's really badass when in reality it just comes off as ""just too much"". I won't lie, I started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie. Most of these are nitpicks, but because this movie blows everything out of proportion, these small problems end up REALLY standing out.
Some bigger complaints are: characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations. The movie is also filled with cliches, but that's mostly because Aquaman follows the standard superhero movie formula. On top of that, i found some inconsistencies regarding character's abilities (like, it is established that inhabitants of Atlantis cannot breath outside of the water, but during certain moments they do it just fine).
The CGI is very inconsistent, from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom, to some pretty terrible green screen effects.
The dialogue, is mostly not very well written. Some characters don't suffer from it, including Aquaman, because it ends up fitting their personality, but some characters end up sounding really artificial.
The acting is fine. Willem Dafoe is Willem Dafoe, Jason Momoa is Jason Momoa. Temuera Morrison, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren all did fine with their respective characters. I think the worst ones are the villains, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen and specially Patrick Wilson (who's character is the embodiment of ""over-the-top""). Too bad, I don't consider him a bad actor, but goddamn was he subpar in this one.
I don't have major complaints wit the editing. It's pretty good, except once or twice where there's just too much going on on-screen and I couldn't follow it, but those were rare moments. However, the sound design has some odd choices. There's this scene where a certain character is handling a knife, and every time he gently touched it, the knife went ""KATCHING"" with that standard blade sound , but just extremely loudly and exaggerated. I just thought to myself ""what?"".<br/><br/>Despite the fact that i nitpicked a lot, i think this movie works more than it doesn't. Yes, it's as a standard superhero movie as you can get, but it's a good one. Even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems, it's not a bad movie. The direction is quite good, some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying. It's pure, blown out of proportion, massive CGI fest fun, and I think that's enough for me. For an Aquaman movie, it does everything it should."

It felt like it wanted to be Thor Ragnorak so badly.
To say that these comics are the ""darker"" versions it was silly, two brothers fighting and the mom telling them to stop. It lacked any decent bad guy, I was waiting for Willem Dafoes character to turn out to be the real villain, instead he was strange Mr Miyagi type character. Not good"

","I really gave DC another chance after Wonder Woman, which I thought was a wonderful movie, but they have disappointed me again with Aquaman.<br/><br/>---MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD---<br/><br/>The story is extremely messy: there are a lot of things happening, but the movie never seems to focus on anything. Which is strange since they had more than enough time to do so: the movie's running time is rather long and, considering the story, should have been a lot shorter.<br/><br/>The action scenes were boring and seemed to be going on forever. Up until the last 10 minutes, Aquaman was just a guy who could punch REALLY hard and who occasionally used a trident to do nothing more than use it as a sword. It isn't until the last scene that he gains his extraodinary powers of being able to control the ocean and its inhabitants. Therefore, all the action before that moment was a snoozefest and also took forever. You just want them to go on with the story.<br/><br/>Granted, both Aquaman and his love interest, Mera, are very easy on the eye, which makes it (at least in my opinion) more entertaining to watch, but on that alone you can't build an entire movie.<br/><br/>The visuals of Atlantis weren't as beautiful as I expected them to be: I was kind of confused as to what it even really was. It just seemed like a big ruin (and a lava pit?) with a couple of high tech water ships floating above it. The sea did have some pretty lights in it though, but what the meaning of them was is still unclear to me..<br/><br/>They also tried to create a villain who had absolutely nothing to do with Atlantis, but merely had a personal vendetta with Aquaman. The story doesn't pay any attention to him until he comes in handy for some action scenes though. Why the audience should even consider him a threat is still completely lost on me, but maybe I'm missing something.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not enjoy this movie very much, but to be honest, I still have hope for the Aquaman character. Yes, this movie wasn't all that great, but they didn't ruin his story. Therefore, I think that if they would make a sequel, it could still be a good movie as long as they do things differently than they did in the first. I would consider to go see a sequel, so I guess the movie sort of did what it needed to do.."
"jonathanmarklund","1","175","356","21 December 2018"," Absolute mess
","So now that the movie is finally out on the internet, we'll start to see some real reviews that aren't written by the staff.<br/><br/>The casting of the actors are absolutely horrible. It's a pod of second rate b-list celebrities that are phoning in their performances in front of a green screen. There has to be bigger fish in the sea than the mess they managed to bait for this deep water grave.<br/><br/>The music is absolutely horrendous. I think somebody got the wrong fish on the hook. They hired Rupert Gregson-Williams, brother of the respected composer Harry Gregson-Williams. And it's apparent. The music switches between Jarre inspired synthesizer and stupid little guitar motifs that feels more at home in a 1990's Zimmer soundtrack.
There is no originality in this wreck whatsoever and all you get are the leftover chum and clichés from other composers and movies. It's insultingly amateurish.<br/><br/>The whole movie follows that pattern. And I'm not surprised. this movie has 5 writers, 1 director and over 10 producers. it lacks a strong captain.
At no point does it feel like a coherent story. It's more like 3-4 different scripts was shoot 3-4 times by 3-4 different people, and then they pasted together the ""best"" parts. When ever the story tries to float it sinks like an anchor.<br/><br/>This movie is an absolute assault on taste and intelligence. It's mindbogglingly bad.

","First in for most I really didn't want to see this movie but friends invited me along and I thought why not everyone is raving about it. It opens up with a decent story about Altlanta who is discovered by a lighthouse keeper and they have a hybrid kid, Aquaman. Story goes from there to when he's older and eh it begins to fall. From the moment he is adult fighting the pirates in the submarine it's just a cliché of every superhero film you've seen before. Black Manta trying to get revenge on Aquaman to avenge his father, princess of Atlantis helps Aquaman overthrow the king,the two fall in love for having a journey together, Aquaman challenges king for throne and loses(wins later), mother turns out to be alive(even thought she was supposed to be dead), and so many many overused lines like ""I've waited for this moment"", and ""They don't need a king, they need something greater, a hero"".

","AQUAMAN is the latest superhero blockbuster from DC Comics and a surprisingly lacklustre affair. It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum.

For all the CGI, and there is a ton of it, the only time it's hard to watch is during the final battle. Other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer.

","I am going to write this review as a movie goer and not a critic. I am not a fan of how critics write their reviews because it doesn't apply to the general audience. So as a normal movie goer this is my review. Aquaman was a fun movie with a lot of upside to it. The way Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry is perfect. He has an attitude that no other superhero really has. He is witty, sarcastic, funny, but also has his sensitive side. I really enjoyed him as Aquaman, but as for the other actors, they were average. My one rip on this movie is the CGI. DC hasn't really produced a good movie with good CGI yet. And this movie, better than justice league when it comes to visual, still lacks the way a Marvel movie would. So as a fan, I noticed the CGI and acting wasn't very good and the dialogue was pretty poor. I also though adding Manta was just a waste of time and space in the movie. His character was a below average villain who besides his fathers death, didn't show a compelling story as a character. I did enjoy however how fun the movie was and how upbeat and also caresmatic it was. I think as a fan this movie is worth seeing because of it being a super hero movie who we haven't seen much of and how fun it is. I am giving this movie a 7."

The visuals are pretty neat, Momoa is likeable and Manta with his suit is pretty sweet. This however cannot outweigh the ATROCIOUS writing, poor directing, bad directing and poor acting.
One thing at a time: the writing is so lazy, there is no explanation of character relationships (specifically Willem Dafoe & Momoa), the lore is hastly given, and the super hero cliches are bad. This is all on top of THE WORST written script I have ever experienced. Every line of dialogue explained everything that was going on very blatantly. That's not how dialogue works! Additionally there was absolutely zero character development.
Basically everyone outside of Momoa and Herd should be replaced in this movie. The movie was littered with actors who stood out like a sore thumb. Herd was pretty bad too but I have a little faith.
In essence the movie is reminiscent of Green Lantern: neat visuals, likeable leading actors and a cool, promising secondary villain, and an overall trainwreck."
"lahejarishabh","10","118","258","15 December 2018"," The best DCEU movie so far!
","Yes I truly mean it. Aquaman is not just the best DCEU film but also the best origin story or solo film in both the Marvel and DCEU universe.<br/><br/>I last thoroughly enjoyed myself in a DCEU film when I watched Wonder Woman's ""no man's land"" scene. But in this film one can't seem to pick any specific action sequence that is so brilliantly crafted that it stands out, infact each action sequence is as brilliant as the previous one. The camera movements and lighting effects especially for under water scenes were stupifying i.e. cinematography on the whole was breathtaking.<br/><br/>The third act of this DCEU film was a jaw dropping climax. The last time I experienced utter silence was during the third act of Avengers Infinity War. This time the theatre was filled with mind-numbing silence creeping upon every unsuspecting viewer slowly but surely making them move to the edge of their seats due to the burdening weights of anticipation, nervousness and excitement. The film ended with astonishment on people's faces and a huge round of applause.<br/><br/>The visual effects were a treat for the eye, mesmerizing and charismatic. Being an aspiring animator myself, I could notice and appreciate the efforts taken in animating the Atlantians, making them float, swim as if they are fishes and not humans and make it all feel realistic. From the mosaic underwater architectures, the finely detailed character costumes, the enchanting visuals, to captivating and horrifying monsters and unforgettable marvelous action sequences, this film offers everything we need and more.<br/><br/>Surely it does have the feels of Thor Ragnarok, Star Wars, Avatar and Game of Thrones - All packaged in one. One may think that the story is predictable. But then get ready, for James wann is about to turn your ship sailing event into a voyage far exceeding beyond your expectations.<br/><br/>Personally I believe James Wann for the DCEU is propitious and I wish he directs Man of Steel 2 or even more DC films. Aquaman is tenacious, invigorating and a must see film for not only all DC fans but for anyone looking for a good movie for the weekends. Watch it in IMAX 3D on the biggest screen possible and feel the imersive experience of an underwater adventure. In the end it will be worth it."

"ironhorse_iv","7","7","10","23 March 2019"," Aquaman indeed made a splash with some viewers. Me not so much. It was just fine.
","Packed to the gills with over the top cartoony action, clever nods to other pop works and hilarious comedy. This Warner Bros motion picture directed by James Wan, was the first DC live action movie in a long time to go with a lighter tone. Set in their extended universe, this fish out of water hero's journey story of a humanoid merman, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) being reintroduce to his culture's origins in order to reclaim his birthright before his half-brother Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) takes the throne & seek revenge on the surface world, was entertaining. Without spoiling the movie too much. Brooding, over serious, and somber doesn't fit Aquaman at all. They made the right decision of tone, even if the actor's edgy badass presence doesn't fit well with the wholesome colorful silver age look. Nevertheless, I did like Momoa's surf bro style of acting. I just wish, the movie didn't make Arthur seem so much of airhead. After all, he's supposed to be a wise king that care for his kingdom. In this movie, he rarely thinks, or try to embrace with his people. All he wants to gain the people's trust is to find a silly lost McGuffin. While, the treasure hunting subplot is fun. It's still a bit odd, that his people who barely knows anything about him, would make Curry, their king, after he kill hundreds of them, just because he now holds a legendary trident. As for the other leader, the one they knew. He got off the hook, a little too easy as well. He done far worse. Regardless, who is the true leader, this senseless war resulted in large number of deaths & casualties; which this movie, sadly highly glazed over. None of the royals felt bad, about how many Atlanteans were murdered. A little comeuppance or selfless sacrifice would had been justified for both rulers. Maybe, Arthur losing an arm to save them or Ocean Master accidently drowning by his own hands would made the film, a little more satisfied. Plus, it would add more stakes, surprised twist, or innovative concept in a movie's plot that didn't take that much risk. As of right now, the main plot is kinda thin, bland, and generic. It's not adding much of anything new. In truth, I thought the film would had been a little bit better if they stay away from the surface world, as much as possible. Why? Very little of the history of the surface world make sense within the story, they trying to tell. Logically, it's really hard to believe that the Justice League wouldn't had interfered after the tsunamis, even if they were busy. The film did the right decision, by not hanging up too much from the previous movie. The film is already confusing enough, with people not believing Atlantis exist, despite that there has two alien invasions, an goddess running around, and a enchantress attack. Nevertheless, there were a lot of loose ends. The hero's superpowers & physical imperfections are kinda inconsistent & poorly define. This lend to a lot of confusement on what things could harms Curry. A good example of this, is the desert scene. Isn't the lack to expose water, one of Curry's weaknesses? To add onto that, how does he even have tattoos, if he has strong healing ability? Better yet, does his powers, give him a new orange-and-green suit? Things like that don't add up. Even the bizarre reunion with family members recognize each other instantly, despite one of them being a kid the last time was a bit offed. Regardless of the story. The visuals were beautiful even if they look fake and highly disproportionate. Nothing seem like it was physically or scientifically there. They really did overused the computer effects. Need more practical effects sets. CGI was overwhelming. Regardless, I did like how the movie look. It was bright & colorful, rather than the desaturated color palette and pitch black darkness. As for the dialogue. It was a mixed bag. I kinda dig the villain's eco terrorism reasons to fight. I wish the flick explore more of that. Sadly, a lot of the corny exposition given throughout the movie is highly repetitive. The film is full of people reminding each other of things, they should at the very least know already, like the rules of within their society. Then, there are things that are never explained, like what happen to the previous king. In spite of that, I really don't mind most of the casting. Some of the performers playing older parental figures despite being nearly the same age with their costars, whom are acting as their adult children, was fine with me. I found Nicole Kidman & Temuera Morrison working great as the movie's emotional heart piece. As for Amber Heard. I found Mera to enjoyable to watch, despite the controversies surrounding the actress's personal life. I also didn't mind Wilson being here, even if it's a bit jarring to see him in yet another DC movie after 2008s 'Watchmen' & 2015s 'Batman V Superman'. He was fine. As for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. He was good as Black Manta. Hopefully, he has a bigger role next time. Rounding out the cast are Julie Andrews, Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren. They were scene stealers. Trying not to rock the boat, the only acting that I didn't like, were the thespians playing the younger version of Arthur. They had really wooden delivery. Overall: While, this movie did swam up from the depths of the DC Universe and into theaters ending with a mediocrity end credit stinger. Nevertheless, I'm willing to dip into uncharted waters and say, this movie is whale of a time worth watching, even if its story is just a small drop in the ocean that didn't sail smoothly. In the end, it's still worth diving into, my man! At least, once or twice."

","When you adapt comic book to the big screen, mostly you just ADAPT it... There are exceptions obviously, but comic book doesn't translate from page to screen, or so we were told...<br/><br/>And then along came James Wan! What a director! What a movie! This is one of the most accurate comic book movies, like ever(except the lead, who looks nothing like Aquaman from the comics)!<br/><br/>So Jason Momoa is great in this role! No doubt about it! And just like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder cast people(not very good, in terms of acting abilities), who naturally fit to these characters. I mean from the first shot of him onscreen you're like: he look nothing like Aquaman, I've read, but he IS AQUAMAN!<br/><br/>Back to comics accuracy. Every other character is authentic esthetically, and personalitywise. Black Manta really is Black Manta(they even explain, why his helmet is so damn Big, Oceanmaster has his iconic Helmet and etc...
Now the Action! James Wan gives the fight scenes in Aquaman a unique cinematic language: they always begin with wide circular shots, that help establish the geography and after we're used to surroundings, James starts cutting to the choreography. And also long take fight scenes! Quite few of them actually!<br/><br/>Film is pretty fast paced, but still manages to deliver solid story arcs, and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains. Performances are solid overrall. No clear standouts, at least to me.<br/><br/>I don't even need to say that the movie is visually stunning! You already knew that from the trailers!<br/><br/>The score: pretty good! Aquaman theme is repeated quite often, and after the credits roll, it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop. Character themes overall are very good, although Oceanmaster theme is too dark, considering the fact that he is not evil personally.<br/><br/>In the end It's a feel good movie for the whole family, with some real heart, and genuine humor!<br/><br/>I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"woziak","10","123","273","9 December 2018"," WOW!!!!!
","Ok I saw this a month ago at a pre screening and it just blow my mind. The plot is simply enough but it's the way James Wan makes you care for the Atlanteans and ofcourse Ocean Master, brilliantly but if a little camply played by Payrick Wilson and more importantly how we the surface dwellers have poisoned the oceans with plastic materials and maybe deserve some form of retribution. My concern originally was the acting ability of Amber Heard and Jason Momoah but for me Wan gets two great performances from his leads, especially to my delight, Jason Momoah and the supporting cast are simply stellar. Black Manta is next level dope and the action, film choregraphy and fighting scenes are some of the best witnessed on the big screen. The music score has epic moments but also can have some strange choices at time but overall the score was great. The last act is worth the admission alone and I dare anyway to come out of this movie not being in simple awe at what they witnessed and beautiful the World of Atlantis is.
For the record I'm not a DC or MCU fan but I am now a James Wan fan, can't wait to go see it again on Wednesday this time in 3D Imax!<br/><br/>Ps stay for the midcredit scene and please, please, somebody give James Wan the Keys to the DCEU universe"
"jbramlrj","1","58","121","22 December 2018"," Incredibly lackluster film
","I seriously don't understand how this film is getting such good reviews, it's one of the worst films I have ever watched, at the same level of fantastic four. Fair enough people are entitled to their own opinions, I respect that.<br/><br/>Good parts:
That fight scene in sicily was decent
...struggling to find anything else that was good
Some of the set pieces were good I guess.
Black Manta was okay?<br/><br/>Bad parts:
The acting was awful, Jason Mamoa couldn't show any emotion, when there was meant to be a sense of urgency or peril, he slaughtered that sense with his overall non-chalance throughout the film. Ocean Master (awful name for a villain btw) has a laughable response when seeing his mother for the first time in decades, more comically confused then surprised or shocked.
The so-called twist with the mother returning was so predictable.
The CGI for the majority of the film is appalling, remember the complaints about the inconsistency in the CGI in Justice League? Those complaints remain with Aquaman.
Black Manta was wasted.
The fight scenes, this annoying and tedious spinning shot with all the fight scenes. The first fight scene is okay, the spin shot seems cool but is ruined by awful and simple choreography and those fights could've ended within a second if the enemies just shot. Also what kind of a hiding place is a corner? The next fight scenes have the same spinning shots and they were so tedious and frustrating.
The pacing of the film was horrendous, along with character development. It felt rushed at the start, and felt too obliged to introduce all of the characters straight away, you ended up forgetting half of them. Near the start where Black Manta's dad, I think, dies is terribly done, you have no sympathy due to a lack of development and appropriate pacing. Ocean Master's character development is awful and he is just terrible throughout the film, I mean Patrick Wilson was amazing in Fargo season 2 as Lou Solverson, but what happened here? Other character developments are lacking such as Vulko and Mera.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT AFRICA COVER. This scene made me laugh cos of how bad it was. It cuts to them walking and this awful africa cover starts playing really abruptly, and just ends like 5 seconds later, it doesn't fade in or fade out. I'm still trying to figure out if this film is supposed to be taken seriously.
The after credits scene wasn't impressive, I know marvel initially copied dc with their origins, but this film felt like it was tring to hard to be like guardians of the galaxy/thor ragnarok (which are amazing films). The ""who is aquaman"" is dumb, given that throughout the whole film, aquaman is making hinself well known and is being very public about his superhero identity, this guy is meant ti be a professional journalist, how does he not know who aquaman is?
It dragged, I asked my friend how long was left and was saddened from hearing it still had 2 hours left, some long films don't feel long, or at least are enjoyable throughout their length such as Fargo, Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Infinity War and The Matrix, but this film felt like forever.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a film to laugh at for 2+ hours, this is a good one, not because it's intentionally funny but because of how bad the film is as a whole, and if you're a film student, most likely you will despise this film. One of the first movies that made me almost go to sleep, almost as I wanted to give it a fair chance and didn't want to miss anything that may be redeeming, however I wish I had fallen asleep.

"larrysez","3","8","12","7 January 2020"," Hollywood Tripe at Its Worst
","I watched this movie on a flight from Oakland to Kauai, after I'd already watched a really good film (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). I was looking for something light and easy, that I wouldn't mind missing the end of if it lasted longer than the rest of the flight did. I can assure you that I did not mind missing the end of it.<br/><br/>The two stars, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard, are pretty good eye candy, as were a couple of the second-stringers, gorgeous Patrick Wilson and still-stunning Nicole Kidman. Some, but definitely not all of the special effects are well done. Otherwise, what a waste of celluloid, or electrons, or whatever movies are made out of these days.<br/><br/>Both Momoa and Heard are atrociously one-dimensional actors who can't even pull off the clichÃ©d, tough-guy lines they've been given in any kind of believable cowboys-and-Indians way. They'd be the runts of the litter in any 6th-grade drama class, except for their good looks.<br/><br/>The script is so bad that its predictability and the simple-mindedness of the dialogue are actually one of the most fun parts of watching the movie. The plot is full of lazy, dumb shortcuts that break the movie's few asinine rules about Atlantis and sea-people vs. land-people as soon as they've been laid out. E.g., our hero and heroine, ferocious Atlantan royalty who can swim better than anything in the ocean, have to steal a boat to get from the coast of Italy? Greece? (someplace on the Mediterranean) to get to an off-shore island so close that it can easily be seen with the naked eye.<br/><br/>If you shaved down all the overly long, gratuitous fight scenes, you could probably cut the running time of this potboiler by about 50%. Which would be a blessing. Thank heavens for the fast forward button.<br/><br/>I'd been willing to suspend disbelief, as one always must with sci-fi/fantasy films, but this thing is dumber than the crappiest 1950s horror film you could ever imagine. So, of course, it made over $160 million, and a sequel is planned. Yay, Tinseltown. It's hard to tell how much to blame the director and producers for (justifiably) holding their audience in contempt, as opposed to not being able to produce a decent product even in a lowbrow genre like comic book movies."
"Platypuschow","3","8","12","30 January 2019"," Aquaman: Basically what I expected, and that's not a good thing
","Where could I even start?<br/><br/>Let it be known immediately I'm unimpressed with the DC cinematic universe thus far, though not bad I've considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part. I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.<br/><br/>Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?<br/><br/>You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.<br/><br/>So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.<br/><br/>The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.<br/><br/>I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.<br/><br/>It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.<br/><br/>Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Momoa is the personification of ""Cool""<br/><br/>A few funny moments<br/><br/>Some very impressive visuals<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>That simply isn't Arthur Curry<br/><br/>Hard to take any of it seriously<br/><br/>Tacky Hollywood nonsense"

This is where the compliments end. Acting all round was shocking. Patrick Wilson as the bad guy??? COME ON!!!! My cats are more threatening!<br/><br/>This film seemed to pay unintentional homage to Flash Gordon, He-Man the Movie, Tron (remake), Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Transformers 3, Baywatch....you get the gist.

I actually laughed out loud in the cinema and I could hear a chorus of groans around me from others.<br/><br/>Poorly cast & poorly executed. Such a shame as this could have been a belter.

Relationships are established that made the film full of heart and respect for the original material. A lot of reviewers talk of abrupt scene progression, but in my opinion it was an element that added to my interest in the plot.

","What's going on?! All the 10 star ratings, it's crazy.<br/><br/>I absolutely hated this piece of trash. Jason is cool, but it ends there. Amber Heard is just a terrible actress and it showed, especially when she gets cheesy dialogue. Nicole Kidman is amazing, but didn't have a lot to do with the overall feel of the movie. The jokes made no one in my theater laugh, literally no one.<br/><br/>CGI is understandable to create the underwater world, but there were lots of moments when the characters where replaced with CGI and it looked terrible. There was only one moment where we actually saw Patrick Wilson, besides that he looked CGI'ed the whole time.<br/><br/>The movie dragged way too long, after a good opening start we get no introduction to Atlantis, but we suddenly need to care for it. Even the establishing shots of Atlantis seem dull, because there is no back story or whatever. Almost to the end we get some backstory, but it's not enough to make you care about Atlantis.<br/><br/>A big CGI battle, where the bad guy fights a not introduced opponent, who is also completely CGI, how are we supposed to feel any connection to that?<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on Black Manta, he was pushed aside and suddenly came back during the whole National Treasure part of the film. He looked so silly in the suit and acted even worse. He has a big death beam, but after using it starts to actually fight Aquaman... It made no sense.<br/><br/>It really had potential if they replaced Amber Heard, opened with a better explanation of Atlantis, kept Aquamans intro short and then started with the actual story. It took more then an hour to really get somewhere in this film and by that time I already knew where it was going and was already bored."

","AQUAMAN released in India one week before its US release and yet I watched it just a few days ago. The IMAX 3D experience was just outstanding! I won't be lying if I say I enjoyed the film to the core. It's a complete visual spectacle with lots of action and adventure. Great performances and direction made it stronger. If you like superhero movies, this is a must watch.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is that while most superhero movies do justice to the action aspects and the adventure aspect often gets overshadowed, AQUAMAN is a complete action adventure. You don't just get breathtaking action set pieces but also a lot of enchanting locales. The entire CGI work is impressive and that's another reason to watch it in IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is very impressive, as is Amber Heard. Their combo makes the story more fun as they go places. Willem Dafoe is back with another solid act. Nicole Kidman is quite good, as are rest of the cast members. James Wan has done a great job with the direction by sticking to the plot and not resorting to unwanted subplots. The background score is also very impressive.<br/><br/>I had seen and liked BATMAN V SUPERMAN, JUSTICE LEAGUE and MAN OF STEEL but not on the big screen. There was no way in which I could afford missing AQUAMAN. It's a treat to the eyes and a perfect entertainer for the big screen. From the action sequences to the adventure moments, it will keep you on the edge of your seat."

First: the main character didn't even want any of this, he got pushed with the ideals of another person (Mera who should of literally be the Queen at that point)
Secondly: there was a ton of cryngy moments like when the movie was about to end Mera said there was too many casualties in the war moment later kissed Arthur while the war is going on in the background (probably between 300-400 died during that kiss like wtf)
Third: from the moment the movie started I knew not only how it's going to end but literally every detail of what will probably happen because the plot lacked twists or something interesting.<br/><br/>Sadly what could of been an amazing movie turned out to be a one dimensional origin story of Aquaman (and in the movie he didn't even deserve to be the hero) probably all the reviews that are 10/10 or 9/10 were created by DC to gain more money on a higher rates movie"

The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.<br/><br/>This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.<br/><br/>How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four.

","Even in the realm of a make-believe comic book universe, things should respect the rules of physics. When you watch Aquaman, you are left with the newly emerging (and very real) condition of CGI-fatigue. Nothing you see before you registers as real, in your brain, because nothing that moves a certain way in water moves that way in this film. One exits the long, dizzying experience feeling like they've just watched a long video game. Nothing is scary anymore. Nothing is exciting or suspenseful, because the filmmakers use no visual restraint in their storytelling. The excess of CGI use in films like Aquaman have just made us stop caring.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa mumbles out his words without any charisma or life; he comes across like an early and unpolished version of The Rock, and his lack of acting experience stands out in stark contrast to veterans like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>Where Aquaman fails in engaging the audience in a compelling story through its weak acting and visual diarrhea, it does make up for in one area - costume design."

The acting is good, but there's no real character development and the forced humour is awful."
"Mike_Devine","7","11","19","23 December 2018"," No 'Wonder Woman,' but wildly entertaining
","The DC Universe has an uneven track record when it comes to recent film adaptations of its franchise. For every 'Wonder Woman' there's a 'Batman vs. Superman' or 'Justice League.' Thankfully for fans of these superheroes, James Wan's 'Aquaman' is closer to the former than the latter, at least in terms of entertainment value.<br/><br/>While 'Aquaman' is pretty much billed as the Jason Momoa show, the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight, even in the face of typically wooden dialogue. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea, while Patrick Wilson surprises as scorned Atlantean brother King Orm - a role very different from those he is known for. Not to mention Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, and a kraken voiced by none other than...Julie Andrews? As for villains, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II takes on the role of modern-day pirate Manta, whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a Power Rangers movie.<br/><br/>But the cast is not the main attraction here - it's the visuals. It's hard to imagine 'Aquaman' being filmed a decade ago when Vince Chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on 'Entourage.' The level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of Atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted. There is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as Pandora-like. This alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's your standard comic book fare, with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before 'Aquaman.' In this case, the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting. The soundtrack and score are also above average for a DC Universe film, with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a Pitbull song that samples 'Africa' (but why?).<br/><br/>'Aquaman' may not come anywhere close to 'The Dark Knight' series, or even hold a candle to some of the better quality Marvel efforts, but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is."

"eobame47","4","7","11","31 December 2018"," The SFX make this movie, and Jason Momoa is great. Nothing else works.
","By now, I think everyone knows DC can't make a decent superhero movie without Chris Nolan or a woman in charge. It is the Batman trilogy, Wonder Woman, and then we have to travel back in time decades to Tim Burton's Batman films and Richard Donner's Superman.<br/><br/>What is the difference between DC and Marvel? How come there is such a gap in their movies as far as writing? The SFX make Aquaman a tolerable film to watch, and that is basically it. Jason Momoa has charisma, but the dialogue is so expositional, so on the nose, so boring and irritating, for every character.<br/><br/>And where is the character development? Jason Momoa's Arthur/Aquaman has an arc, but everyone else is one-dimensional. In Wonder Woman, we saw what could be added to the story when the supporting cast have backstories: the Arab with Hollywood dreams but he is the wrong color, the Native American who has had everything stolen from him by people who look like the leads, the PTSD sniper who can't shoot anymore.<br/><br/>A saving grace for this film, I think, would have been a little more focus on the pollution affecting ocean life, the damage to the environment. What is wrong with raising the IQ level of a blockbuster film, so it isn't just popcorn entertainment?<br/><br/>Yet Aquaman is almost all visual effects (and I guess it has to be since it mostly happens in a fictional underwater world). There is barely a coherent story: a special trident, the surface world is evil, war must be waged. The mythology doesn't work for me, and once again the dialogue is painful."
"u-66754","8","57","131","7 December 2018"," Not a typical superhero film
","The opening of this movie really captures my eyes. And the background music is excellent, the scenes are gorgeous. I would rather regarded it as an epic, not typical superhero film. The performance of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard is great. I could not understand why people think Momoa is handsome until I watch this movie. And Heard looks so awesome with redhead😍.<br/><br/>The description of emotion is much more abundant and important than I thought, and Wan really did a great job of expressing the love of Arthur's parents. It's undoubtedly the most touching part of the film. I especially admire the way that Wan uses and presents props and scenes in this film, and the sense of destroying and grandiosity he tries to convey. My favorite part of the film is the ocean monsters part and it's really heart-shaking😝.<br/><br/>But for me, the incongruity between sense of epic and superhero elements (or modern elements) is a little bit huge, making me feel disharmonious in some scenes. And the costumes of villains in Atlantis are a little bit disharmonious, too."
"cabof85","8","39","86","11 December 2018"," Emotional
","I'm 34 years old, I've watched thousands of movies but this is my first review. I felt that I had to do that.
I've been following Jason Momoa since Atlantis, since nobody really knew him as we are look-alikes and people started calling me with his name all these years. Then came Khal, Aquaman etc..
I watched the 3d movie last night at cinema premier. I caught myself crying at some moments.. I don't know the reason, I've been waiting for this movie all this time and I felt reliefed. All this hate about DC, all these bad comments about the trailers, the cgi etc..
But let me unbiased: the movie was amazing. I'm still thinking about it today. It finished and I stayed at my seat for 20' more minutes..
To be honest I don't really watch superhero movies. Neither big budget movies. But with this one I felt differently. It was more emotional. The whole story about himself, his mother etc. It wasn't just an action movie.
The action scenes were amazing, the visuals stunning.. Wan did an amazing job.. The story was good, the pace. I'm laughing with people calling the movie boring.
I know it has a good rating already beause of Momoa's fans (mainly young girls) but just watch it and don't listen to anyone.
As for me.. I already bought a ticket to watch it again."

","In nearly 30 years of going to the movies I've never ever experienced a crowd cheering for a movie to be over like it happened today in Berlin's biggest cinema. This movie should be called ""How the CRINGE stole Christmas""
Seriously, let's leave the non existent plot aside. The editing is so awfully off. The sound design is just ridiculous. In one of the first scenes when the pirates enter the vessel they have a assault rifle firing with a muffled sound but no silencer. The lasers attached to the guns were BUZZING? Have YOU EVER HEARD A LASER POINTER BUZZING? This movie is so incredibly lazy. The visual style were clearly copied from Tron and Avatar. The soundtrack is literally a mix from a low pitched ""sad trombone"" and clone of Daft Punk's award winning Tron Soundtrack done by someone that really hates music. If anything this movie is so linear and predictable, the comedy is out of place and edited always half a second too slow. AQUAMAN is nothing but a very expensive glorified first semester film school project. And trust me. I've been there."

The storyline by it self is not something extraordinary or particularly captivating but doesn't fall flat either, it even manages to get you emotional as well.<br/><br/>While it has some funny or emotional bits, the dialogue in its entirety seems to me a bit blank. It is however a fast paced movie with high standard fighting choreography and what really elevates this movie it's the exceptional visual effects . For a movie that takes place underwater it reminded me a lot like a space adventure quest .<br/><br/>Overall it's a Very good superhero movie , in my opinion the best of DCEU so far and better than a lot of MCU movies."

","Exquisite underwater world, magnificent underwater wonders, can be called "" Avatar"" underwater, Pandora underwater. Atlantean epic war is as powerful as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. The action drama reached its peak, boxing reached the meat, making people feel the shock of "" Steel Body"" again. The pursuit of the spaceship was dazzling and fascinating, as if it had moved "" Speed and Passion"" to the bottom of the sea. The expedition to find trident is also fun and interesting, and it is also the reappearance of Indiana Jones (franchise). The core of the film returns to the exploration of family and self - affirmation, bearing growth and motherly love, self-confidence and affection. The last scene was filled with tears, just as Thomas finally waited to meet his wife, so did we wait for DC's best film in recent years. Wen Ziren, such as Cameron and Peter Jackson possessed him, took a master of action, adventure, fantasy, super English and other elements. It is one of the best superhero movies after "" Dark Knight"" and the name of "" Aquaman"" will be remembered from this movie history."

","Dear Marvel, if you're worried about your ""superhero"" competition over at DC, don't be. While trying to be funny and have a tension-filled plot, they caused anxiety throughout the whole audience in which uncomfortable laughter was the only escape. Momoa did his best but it seemed like there wasn't even a script written. Poor Julie Andrews was disgraced by voicing a faceless monster while her legacy as Mary Poppins was shrouded by the new Mary Poppins Returns which opened just days before. So let's hope DC makes enough money to buy new writers and then maybe, just maybe, they'll draw a crowd back to the theatre."

"davideo-2","4","2","2","27 January 2020"," Visually striking, but little else to hold your attention
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is a half man, half aquarian warrior, who has been raised on Earth, and uses his special abilities to fight for justice. His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge Â£95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.<br/><br/>The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **"

","I want 2.5 hrs of my life back. It was so boring I kept trying to fall sleep but all couldn't because of all the loud noises- it's what I imagine being stuck in purgatory feels like. Needed more action and less plot, didn't have time to process all the critical information."
"PyroSikTh","4","13","25","18 December 2018"," Pretty to Look At, but Rushed, Badly-Written, and Weightless
","Aquaman's New52 run was a fantastic moment for the character, so it was definitely the best choice of story to adapt. Now here's the thing, the entire run covered four graphic novels - 25 issues - which is roughly two years of storytelling, including a crossover with Justice League (which added another five or six issues). That's huge. It's an epic story involving multiple smaller stories that all come together. For the movie, they came up with a story that was a combination of that entire 25-issue run. That's like trying to squeeze all three Lord of the Rings books into one movie.<br/><br/>Okay, I get it, it was a loose adaptation for this very reason; cliffnote the important parts and tie together into a cohesive narrative, and I fully understand that things had to be moved about or cut out entirely in order to keep it manageable. Problem is, that's an antagonist per graphic novel, and we all know how the overabundance of villains affected Spider-Man 3. The Aquaman movie wants to squeeze in his origin and the fate of his mother, the Trench, Black Manta with his revenge for the death of his father, and Orm and his war on the surface world as antagonists (thank goodness they gave up on the idea of squeezing in the Dead King as well, and never even bothered with Vulko's betrayal), explore all seven kingdoms, and establish a romance between Arthur and Mera. It's too much to put into one movie, especially one as crazy and outlandish as this. It devolves the plot into a series of checkpoints that are all rushed through to get to the conclusion, meaning no moment is given time to breathe. None of the villains feel particularly well developed, Arthur and Mera's romance comes off as forced, the effects of everything on the outside world are completely forgotten about early on. Aquaman is just ferried from point A to point B to point C.<br/><br/>Compounding this lack of space and atmosphere in the storytelling is the overdone formula of interruption. By which I mean if you took a shot everytime a serious moment was undercut by a cheesy one-liner, or a section of dialogue gets interrupted by an explosion, you'd be paralytic by the time the credits rolled. It was cool and unexpected the first time it happens, but by the third time it just got boring. I know! A movie featuring armoured sharks and a drumming octopus felt boring! How do you even manage that?!<br/><br/>To continue the criticisms, what little immersion I had in this movie was completely broken by the nonsensical choice of licensed music. The use of Sigur Ros early on was a masterstroke I was completely behind, really suiting the scene it was put over. But then they lost their way and put in upbeat Depeche Mode over Black Manta building his suit after the death of his father, or getting Pitbull to sample/cover Africa by Toto (what?), and Skylar Grey's Everything I Need made the film feel like a Rom-Com once the credits rolled. For one, these songs were awful, but secondly they were just completely wrong for their scenes. The music's not all bad though. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is actually pretty good. Not Hans Zimmer, Johann Johannsson or even Michael Giacchino levels of good, but by the halfway point it was his score that was keeping my sole interest going. Yeah, in a way it does sound like they saw Thor: Ragnarok and frantically tried to squeeze in as much 80s synth as they could, but I'll be honest, I think Gregson-Williams melded the 80s synth into the typical orchestral score much better than Mark Mothersbaugh did.<br/><br/>And that's not my only praise either. The opening ten minutes or so sold me instantly that this could exceed my admittedly low expectations. The scenes between Nicole Kidman's Queen Atlanna and Temuera Morrison's Tom Curry were so charming and brimming with chemistry that you couldn't help but root for their romance. When Atlantis eventually came calling, we got a kick-ass fight scene with Atlanna acrobatically bouncing all over the house in a composite longshot, fending off the attackers and saving her family all at once. Unfortunately this was just about the highest point for me. Arthur beating on Manta senior and junior, and their crew, was pretty badass too, but after that all the action scenes lost their gravity. Literally. Underwater battles should be super cool, right? But I actually got kind of bored of them because there was no weight to any of the choreography. They just ""fly"" all over the place. None of the punches felt like they landed, and the breaking of Atlanna's trident was only impactful because of its emotional implication for Arthur.<br/><br/>Another mote of praise I have, this time without any kind of criticism attached, was the visuals. Rushed story, awful music choices, and weightless action scenes aside, Aquaman is a devastatingly pretty movie to look at. The use of bright neon colours really gave it its own visual identity. Each of the seven kingdoms are designed so uniquely from one another that you can tell where you are at a glance. Arthur and Mera diving deep while being swarmed by the Trench is wall-mountingly gorgeous imagery. Of course there's the inherent concept of Aquaman's world as well, with armoured sharks, a drumming octopus, and soldiers riding giant seahorses. Atlantis looks truly mythological. And the CGI underwater hair is flawless, far better than other attempts in the likes of Inhumans or even the otherwise fantastic Arrival.<br/><br/>I can't say I was disappointed in Aquaman, as I already had pretty rock-bottom expectations. It starts out incredibly strong, but it quickly goes downhill as they try to squeeze way too much into the story, forcing it to rush from plot point to plot point. It's formulaic and badly written, with some truly cringeworthy dialogue, a forced romance, and lofty action sequences that were frankly boring to watch. It's a really pretty-looking movie though, with some fantastic CGI and set designs, and every character is brought to life visually. I give Aquaman a bad 4/10. It's not the worst you'll see, but goddamn I wish I had gone to see Into the Spider-Verse instead."

"minzkevdm","4","17","35","27 December 2018"," Where do all these 10/10 come from?
","This movie was a big disappointment. After reading reviews on here claiming it to be 10/10 and the best DC film to date, I was excited to go see it even though I do not have any comic book knowledge.
The film started off interesting. A story was building to a point, and then it fell of the wagon completely.
Characters were very poorly introduced, and since I have no real knowledge of some of these characters, it was very difficult to form connections with them. The background of the characters, even of some of the main characters, is very vague and this made me lose interest early on into the film.
The storyline was very predicatable. Also, very 'unrealistic' and not well thought out. In some cases, it's not really known why characters do certain things or how they get from place to place. It's very wishy washy. Unfortunely, I grew bored very quickly. The movie did not grab my attention. The fights were average, and long winded. The writers tried to incorporate jokes and humour, but it was not very good. The imagery was confusing at times - in the end, it was just a grey blur.
I don't know man. I wanted Aquaman to be the next Wonder Woman - it had the potential! But irritating villains, villains that looked like Ant-Man and predictable plots ruined it for me. I won't even spend money on Aquaman 2 if it was ever produced."
"theamazingdnivog","10","35","81","8 December 2018"," Insane Visuals. Insane Action Pieces. Maximum Entertainment.
","Visuals: The visuals is mind-blowing. Wan has created a world rich in colour, vibrance, and depth. The details are astounding. Best visually insane movie since Avatar.<br/><br/>Story: Predictable, a bit yes. But which superhero movie is not? Is it predictable from the beginning? - NO.<br/><br/>Humor: Not cheesy as some reviews say. The humor doesn't feel forced, like with some Marvel movies. The movie will give you 2 hours of joy ride, and you'll never regret the money or time spent on it.<br/><br/>Emotional Depth: The movie already has an emotional core(The connection of Arthur and his parents). Although it's not that much emotionally resonant, it does a good job of balancing the tone.<br/><br/>Villain: The Villain has a real good reason. He's also right, in some ways, although not in his solution plans. All his rage can be felt with his words. I'd compare his character to MCU's Killmonger, who also lives and fights for a cause. And while in the Black Panther movie, for some people, some things feels like a racial agenda and see's the white people as the bad guys, in Aquaman, all the surface dwellers are seen as the bad guys in the view of the villain. There's no feel of any agenda or anything.<br/><br/>
Verdict: 10/10. Everything is awesome and purely mind blowing, while still delivering a message which affects the real world."

It is an OK movie to take your kids, depending on how old they are they will probably enjoy it. In my opinion it is definitely not for adults (with at least average intelligence).

Also, it just rips off of black panther. They thought if they did the black panther plot with abunch of fillet, they'd get billions of dollars too. But they missed the part that actually made Black Panther popular: the black. Because all the people were African american, it gave the black community someone to root for.

Aquaman should be watched in theatre for great experience. First of all James Wan is ""The Man"". He had taken the risk and courage to bring this superhero to life. Aqua man was the least appreciated superhero before. But now it has changed. Wan did the magic making the character lovable like how Robert Downey Jr. made us like Iron Man.<br/><br/>Now to the main part
The script is simple. It doesn't mean it is bad. It is simply good. With this simple script, Wan had delivered an extraordinary way of storytelling which is enganging and makes us glued to the seat till the very end. The narration, the vfx and whole are in the next level. We don't feel any lag as the story is taking us to an whole new adventure.
The actors did their part very well. Especially Mamoa and Heard. Patrick Wilson and Yahya did their job well. No words to explain how good they are.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Amber and Jason is very well executed. I didn't feel the jokes were forced. Even if it is, it doesn't matter much.<br/><br/>As I said the movie has the perfect balance in emotion, love, action, adventure, humor and serious. This movie won't be a let down for anyone who had watched or who is planning to watch it thanks to James Wan.<br/><br/>""Praises to the whole casts, vfx team and one and only JAMES WAN for giving us the wonderful ride.""<br/><br/>And to those who are degrading the movie.
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself for degrading a movie which is good in every way.<br/><br/>To the people who are reading this.

"Scott351w2001","2","20","43","27 December 2018"," Boring mess of a movie
","I really like James Wan. I thought The Conjuring films were excellent, so I went to this thinking it would be as good. I was wrong. The movie feels like it was made for DC fans only, who may have some knowledge of his back story. How exactly did Arthur become Aquaman? What's with the tattoos all over his body? Was he born with them? Did he get dragged to a tattoo parlor in a drunken stupor by his friends? How are Aquaman and the others able to breathe underwater? There seems to be no cohesive story line either, something to do with becoming king of Atlantis. Also, plenty of gratuitous explosions occurring throughout the movie, like watching a video game. The movie just seemed to consist of randomly strung together scenes, without any semblance of a story. By the midpoint of the movie (and it's a long movie) I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. Really not a good film"

","Just saw it 2 hours ago and boy oh boy was I blown away !!!
Exquisite cinematography ... amazingly tense script and wonderful acting.
It is just as good (or even better) than any movie competitor Marvel has produced till date. The story arc and character story is excellent. I love this movie along with WonderWoman and both these characters are going to help DC in the long run.<br/><br/>Dont miss it. Just GO and watch it<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED !!!"

","Let's start with the positive things about this movie: the credits at the beginning and Jason Momoa's gigantic pecs. Also, Amber Heard lungs are quite interesting. If you're expecting more, you might be disappointed. No storyline, dialogues are written by a five years-old and it is a succession of embarrassing moments never ending. Thank you interns from DC for creating this."

I actually just created this account to give the score this movie really deserves.
My girlfriend and I couldn't stop laughing at how bad the movie is. Jokes that no one in the cinema laughed at, abysmal sound track, shallow plot and a lot of screen time that could be removed without any harm to the movie at all.
There were some quite interesting scenes, but they were rare and the rest of the awful ones are way more present."

I can assure you that ""Aquaman"" is undoubtedly one of the best films of this universe."
"Just-Us-Losers","7","15","31","24 December 2018"," An imperfect but wildly enjoyable ride
","What's it about?<br/><br/>The latest attempt by DC to right the course of their up-and-down cinematic universe, Aquaman, directed by big-name horror director James Wan (Saw, Furious 7), tells the story of the titular character (played by Jason Momoa), mostly referred to by his human name-Arthur Curry-as he reluctantly begins to accept his destiny as the heir to the throne of Atlantis. Amber Heard co-stars as Mera, an undersea princess trying to guide Curry, while Patrick Wilson plays Orm, the main villain, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Black Manta in a secondary villain role. Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren also play smaller but important roles, and Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman round out the list of stars as Curry's human father and Atlantean mother respectively.<br/><br/>What works?<br/><br/>Given that much of the action takes place in Atlantis and other varied undersea kingdoms, the visuals were where this movie was going to live or die. Fortunately, this is an absolutely spectacular movie to look at-there's hardly any cracks in a really impressive CGI façade, and the use of color and other visual elements to build an engaging, real-feeling setting is equally impressive. In short, this movie is game-changing in the scope and effectiveness of its visuals; for me, someone who's never read an Aquaman comic, who's never really thought about what Atlantis should look like, this was a wholly convincing depiction of the undersea world. Even the character movements, gliding and hovering through the water, felt mostly natural, and the dialogue was given just a hint of the normal distortion you'd hear underwater.<br/><br/>While the visuals were necessary to make this movie work, there's more to making a good movie than just pretty imagery (most of the time). Especially with a superhero action movie, something trying to connect with a very wide viewer base, the movie has to check a few more boxes. Fortunately, it also does a pretty good job with its characters, especially Aquaman himself. The character is written in a slightly unusual way-he's not a classic Superman-type, saving the world because it's the right thing to do, but neither is he a broody anti-hero type. He's free-spirited and energetic but likes to maintain a lower profile in the surface world; he's goofy but motivated and confident. This, of course, makes it the perfect role for Jason Momoa, who plays the role with a perfect sort of cocky charm (he also spends a decent chunk of the movie shirtless, and he's a hunky man). He's also allowed to be a funny character, mostly played as a loose-cannon fish-out-of-water (groundhog-off-the-earth?) relative to the rigidly hierarchical, traditional, rule-bound undersea peoples. It's a line of humor that could easily grow tiresome, but one which is used sparingly and therefore effectively. It's also worth pointing out that the undersea world doesn't come off as too stilted or outdated-it gets some satisfying chances to push back on his behavior in places, which also happens to allow for some solid character development moments as Aquaman tries to learn his place as someone with powerful ties to both the undersea and surface worlds.<br/><br/>The other characters are also mostly at least solid. Amber Heard's Mera is probably the next most important of the heroes. She plays the role well, but it's an unfortunate inevitability that a good chunk of her dialogue is just exposition, given that her role, especially in the first half, is explaining the rules of the undersea kingdoms to Aquaman. But in the latter half of the movie she gets a couple moments to shine, moments which she takes full advantage of. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman are good in their own ways as Aquaman's parents. One standout is Willem Dafoe's Vulko, an advisor to the Atlantean throne and former mentor to the young Aquaman. His character has some interesting moments and good twists along the way.<br/><br/>But as is the case with most superhero movies, the true test of its quality is going to be the villain(s). I was worried going in that Patrick Wilson would not be a good choice for Orm, the primary villain, but he is intensely compelling both as politician and warrior, bringing a quiet ferocity in his dialogue-heavy scenes but a vicious confidence in his action ones, building a very strong primary villain, and one who even gets some good character moments. Plus, he looks great in the full Ocean Master armor, once he breaks that out.<br/><br/>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is also solid as iconic Aquaman villain Black Manta, though it sometimes feels like his character isn't necessary. He has a commanding screen presence, especially in the excellent opening sequence, but when he's allowed to function as a true villain, he often comes off a bit monologuey and underwritten, though a powerful enemy. He really shines, though, when he's allowed to take off the helmet and do some real acting, giving the character more depth and weight than it needed. I'm also really glad the decision-makers behind the movie were willing to eventually go all-in on the big, comic-accurate Black Manta helmet.<br/><br/>The plot is mostly just adequate and generic, but it hits several of its emotional beats with resounding force. The ending is of particular note-without giving anything away, it takes a cliché framework and plays it really effectively before breaking it off in an unexpected manner, one that leaves the viewer startled by some unusual but effective emotional questions.<br/><br/>One last crucial selling point for any superhero movie is going to be the action. Here, again, Aquaman shines. The massive-scale undersea battles are impressively constructed, being sure to maintain some semblance of tactical order while keeping a character-focused perspective, but the CGI overload does tend to wear by the end. The real selling point, however, is the close-quarters combat. Even the opening's expositional setup has a beautiful long-take fight sequence, and it only gets better from there. The fighting is often done with tridents, and the choreography and execution is superb, fast-paced but feeling realistic and visceral, and it always utilizes superb camerawork. James Wan is a director who likes to play with his toys, and the sheer joy of creating some of these sequences is beautifully evident on-screen. Even the slow motion is handled with both care and obvious excitement, showing off some great moments while never becoming quite gratuitous.<br/><br/>The music also deserves a mention. Rupert Gregson-Williams, who also scored Wonder Woman, is in solid form here. Several moments in the score are notably strong, and there are no obvious missteps. He might not be ready to supplant John Williams or Hans Zimmer quite yet, but he's definitely deserving of more attention and work.<br/><br/>What doesn't work?<br/><br/>As I mentioned a few paragraphs before, the plot is mostly just generic fare: find the magic item, beat the bad guy, become the chosen one you were always meant to be. Part of the problem is that this is a movie that had to do a lot of things-develop its main character, establish a massive and complex world, introduce and develop two villains, and give their villainous plots enough weight to feel like a threat to the hero. With all that going on, it's no wonder that the core plot was going to be a little simple. It's not quite Justice League-levels of simplisticity, but it probably is ultimately more of a weakness than a strength, even if it was an inevitability given the volume of other details and characters and subplots surrounding the main narrative.<br/><br/>Another problem with a movie trying to do as much as Aquaman is that there is bound to be some tonal inconsistency. The main chunk of the movie feels like an amalgamation of a mainstream superhero movie, a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy epic with Game of Thrones-style fantasy politics, while also bringing sci-fi action and worldbuilding of the sort we should have gotten from the Star Wars prequels. That core combination, though, works surprisingly well. It's when the movie starts dropping in scenes reminiscent of Indiana Jones or Journey to the Center of the Earth that things start to feel like too much, or when it takes a brief detour into otherwise-effective moments straight out of the rom-com or horror genres. Each of the bits, taken on its own, works at least fairly well (especially the horror bit), but there are some inevitable jarring tonal shifts.<br/><br/>With any movie of this scale and ambition, there are inevitably going to be at least a couple weak points in the visual effects. While, again, the effects are almost uniformly astounding, there are one or two odd points-an unsatisfying movement here or there, a giant CGI monster that doesn't feel entirely present. An early scene in an aquarium has some uncanny-looking sharks. But really, that's it, and that's just nitpicking.<br/><br/>But is it any good?<br/><br/>It is! It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does a fair job with most things, and it does a couple of the big things-visuals, action, main character-exceptionally well. Even the problems are mostly inevitable byproducts of bold, exciting decisions elsewhere in the film that end up mostly outweighing the costs of the unintended consequences. On the whole it's probably not quite on par with Wonder Woman (though there might be an argument in that direction), but it's definitely in the same ballpark-another clear winner for DC and a definite step forward for a universe that finally seems to be finding its feet."
"eliel-calebi","10","33","78","13 December 2018"," A true comic book movie
","It is easy to consider the first act of the mevie slow, but in fact, Aquaman is aware that arthur was already stablished, not in a particular good way, and now needs depth. Therefore the beginning is made to reaffirm arthur's motivations, reassuring the audience trust on the character, and to introduce new characters whose archetypes have already been seen plenty of times, wich its not a bad thing.<br/><br/>In the second act it's clear to the audience that Aquaman is a action packed movie who tells the storie of a long gone heir to some throne that comes to save the kingdom from a mistake, slash uncontrolled tyrant. Nonetheless Aquaman delivers a visually stunning experience and, even though its hard to fear for the life of the characters, its easy to be engaged with the narrative and crave to now what comes next.<br/><br/>The third act, at last, is amazing in so many aspects, the climax is setup with such finesse that it is hard not to be lost on your own thoughts while processing the amount of Aquaman that the movie delivers<br/><br/>In conclusion, Aquaman, is easily one of, if not the most comic book like movie ever made. James Wan delivers a amazing movie full of good fight scenes, heartfelt moments, realy good cinematography and inspiring art. Most importantly Aquaman seems to be made of comic pages, something that every movie who adapts a comic book should have as it ultimate goal."

","Oh man, what a waste of 2.5 hours! I'm really not understanding why this piece of tosh is getting so much hype. Zero story, non-sensical plot, one-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy dialogue, horrendous production design, costume design looked like they ripped-off the Power Rangers, and the visuals weren't even that great! The ""young-ification"" of Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman at the beginning of the movie was absolutely laughable. Manta's - actually all the costumes - looked so cheap and plastic-y it reminded me of those kids' costumes that you get at the Dollar Store. Momoa does his best impersonation of Thor, but ultimately fails to draw any laughs or garner any emotion. They absolutely ripped-off every sci-fi fantasy concept out there, mixed them together and hoped something would stick. It was just a loud, chaotic, brash, flashy, low-brow, seething mess. I think even Sharkboy and Lava Girl did a way better job! Just give up DCEU, you're no match for the MCU, the harder you try the worse you look."

","This film is worth watching for the remarkable production design alone. It is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater, but here Aquaman excels. Gorgeous visuals, incredible underwater battle sequences, and well-choreographed fights make this film impossible to look away from.<br/><br/>That said, the plot is fairly basic. Reluctant hero, doomed mentor, unexpected love interest, bad guy who wants to take over the world, etc. Aquaman is surprisingly likable, much different from his closed-off Justice League persona, but he's not particularly clever. He kind of just goes with the flow, punching bad guys as he goes. There are various attempts at injecting humor into the script, but its not very smart - especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent Deadpool, Guardians and Ant-Man films.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was Black Manta's origin story. Not that he has much competition, but he's the best DCEU villain we've met thus far."

","It does amaze me to see so many reviews that one way or another comes from the studio. They're so easy to spot, but I guess it helps to balance things out from the trolls who love to give good films a one rating.<br/><br/>Quick review, the first half was a bit sluggish. With a super hero film who either need a bunch of super heroes which helps to move things around or you need a good number of scene changes to keep the audiences interest. Mortal Engines did a very good of moving from one scene to another, introducing new things into the mix. It did mostly fail on the story. So the first half of Aquaman was a bit weak because it didn't move well. The 2nd half did a much better job moving things around the world and introducing new scenery, above the ground, below the ground and beneath the sea. The visuals were absolutely amazing! I thought the score was a bit weak. Some of the songs were thrown into a scene and then crawled away. Felt a bit off. There were some good laughs along the way and as we find out to along the way the creatures that live beneath the sea are a lot more complicated than we might've believed. I found the scene in Italy to be the best over the seas. I thought the development of Mantra was weak and certain parts of that story were a bit confusing. Overall a very entertaining film, in the end."

"tresm87","8","6","10","21 December 2018"," 8.4/10 James Wan has crafted the most visually magnificent and triumphant tale of the DCU, full of heartfelt emotion and genuine fun albeit ridiculous at times.
","Had someone ever told me I would enjoy an Aquaman film with Jason Momoa more than any film in the DCU, I wouldn't have believed them and laughed. The truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing DCU, and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout, as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story. While it might stray away from comics in certain aspects, it thrives with its own distinct identity. The attention to detail from Wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least. The world building through the diversity of colors, environments, creature designs, costume designs, and the overall perspectives are spectacular. The CGI was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work I've seen. The characters are all acted well besides Black Manta's character which I thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written. Momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch, but Patrick Wilson stole the show with an incredible role as King Orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that I did not see coming. It's clear to see why James Wan casts him so much in his great films. I also thought Willem Dafoe did a fantastic job as Vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation. I did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times, and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity. There are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness. Luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action, that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked. It's satisfying to see that Wan took the time, effort, and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the DCU for the most part, to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future. I just hope the Black Manta character/actor will improve, because if he will be the main villain, he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written. Overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes."
"trevorwomble","7","6","10","20 December 2018"," Overblown and overcomplicated but fun too
","First the negatives. Aquaman has a ridiculously complicated script, is too long and full of plot holes. The film is, at times, visually derivative ripping off various better films like Thor Ragnarok, The Hobbit and The Matrix and is highly predictable. The CGI is also ridiculously over the top in places. Don't watch this if you are expecting anything original.<br/><br/>Now the plus side, Jason Momoa is a piece of inspired casting, he has the look and charisma of the 'halfbreed' Atlantean. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman give their characters some real gravitas and Dolph Lundgren is a natural fit for his role. The dialogue is occasionally clunky but having established actors like these deliver them does help make it not so obvious.<br/><br/>I hope we see more of Jason Momoa in the role. He has a charm and lightness of touch that is welcome, much like Chris Hemsworth's Thor. I'd like to see more witty one liners as he delivers the few he has very well.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film and Wonder Woman is still the DC high spot in terms of recent films but Aquaman delivers action and character even if there is still room for improvement. If there is to be a sequel I hope DC will improve on this decent first effort."

Anyway, I did not have great expectations, but as it turns out it was actually quite good.<br/><br/>Momoa basically steals the show, he's pretty awesome as Aquaman, his portrayal of Aquaman as a tough but tongue in cheek super hero is really good, basically he nails it.<br/><br/>Regarding Mera, all I can say is that Amber Heard's acting is at best bland, I would have loved to see Emily Blunt as Mera, she is a much, much, much, much better actress and could have easily pulled this character out of the mediocrity Heard gave it. In all honesty, has Heard managed to actually act in any movie she has had a role in ?? I think she is by far the lowest point in the movie, unfortunately it is a leading role and it does hurt the movie.<br/><br/>Another low is, in my opinion, excessive violence. It is gratuitous, unnecessary, pointless and does not add anything to the movie. I will not let my son see it, he's 5 and way too young for this kind of violence. If there's a Lego version I will certainly let him see that.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors do a really great job.<br/><br/>Visuals are a mixed bag though, as they are at times quite amazing (almost on an Avatar, LOTR level), but at other moments they are not that good, specially when they modify some of the characters faces (Nicole Kidman, Willem Defoe, Temuera Morrison, etc.), as they try to make them younger and it does not work at all, but overall the visuals are really good, except for these aforementioned, lets call them minor, let downs.<br/><br/>All in all it is a very good movie, it also leaves the door very widely open for Aquaman 2, which I will definitely watch.<br/><br/>Go watch it, it's good fun. Don't take young kids though."

"lmstapleton","9","6","10","16 December 2018"," Action packed
","One of the more colourful of recent DC films, action packed and delightfully predictable in the way that superhero quest type films are. I liked that Aquaman isn't the standard straight laced superhero, but more of a grey area.
Marked down for repetitive use of the same 'jump scare' for want of a better word. Any time 2 characters, usually Arthur and Mera got close and lingered for a second or more something exploded. Great effect the first time, but it was then used another four or five times throughout making it obvious."

","""Kind is the one who protects the kingdom but Hero is the one who protects everyone"" Aquaman with High expectations after five minutes trailer Had kept its promise. James Wan direction and the screenplay makes audience feel extraordinary. Non stop action sequences in 3D and background music makes movie much more interesting. I feel no critic can give negative review for this film. Very happy that India got early chance to watch the movie. After watching Post Credit Scene, Eagerly waiting for Aquaman 2"
"jacman2084","8","6","10","16 December 2018"," Wonderful.
","Only minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I agree that I was sceptical when I heard that James Wan is going to direct Aquaman. The guy who was famous for - Saw, Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Lights Out - all out dark horror movies. I mean, if you take out Furious 7 from the list, the guy is almost completely dealing with horror stuff. The only plus point that I saw there was that all of them were 'dark' and the DC verse is supposedly 'dark'. Things got worse when I saw the trailer and saw some 'altered' old school scuba divers as villains. I mean it did look like Black Manta from the comics but to cast something that dramatic from a comic into a movie usually calls for disaster. And in the trailer there were underwater shots of Atlanta that reminded us of 'Avatar' and a Gigantic crab that reminded me of 'Wrath of the Titans' - So now you see my dilemma before watching the movie - it could be an Avatar or a Wrath in the waiting!<br/><br/>But my oh my, this fellow blew my mind completely. Right now I believe this movie can bring back the DC movie verse from close to death.<br/><br/>After watching Aquaman (due to early release in India) the one word that is still ringing in my head is - MAGNITUDE.<br/><br/>The sheer magnitude of the sets, the stunts and the visuals got my jaw dropped. There were a lot of wow moments and more than once did I think about the 'scale' of the underwater world that he is trying to show to us. For instance, there's one scene where a giant blue whale looking like a fish when it swims past one of those fallen Atlantan statues under the sea. At that moment you will invariably compare the sizes in your mind.<br/><br/>I would say James Wan has successfully compiled Avatar, the Titan movies, Pacific Rim, Godzilla, a bit of TinTin, Indiana Jones stuff, a pinch of Harry Potter (LOL) - all into one short fun packed movie. There is fantasy, future tech (in its own way), adventure, creature stuff, scary stuff and breathtaking visuals. And thankfully you won't feel that they have made it all too sweet for a PG-13 rating. It is just the right amount of action.<br/><br/>Oh thanks for reading that much - As a DC fan, now you are probably thinking like - I know all that from the trailer but what about the Superhero stuff? What about Aquaman? Did he pull it off?<br/><br/>My simple answer is a firm Yes.<br/><br/>For a start, this was the one of those films where I waited to see who the casting directors were in the end credit (applauds to Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy). Personally I felt all the actors were spot on for their roles - Nicole Kidman back in the DC world as Atlanna and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta steals the show in the opening moments, Amber Heard as Mera was convincing, Patrick Wilson as the rogue brother was a decent choice. And for a change you will get to see Willem Defoe (a.k.a Norman Osborne from MCU) and Dolph Lundgren, Drago from Rocky, in different roles (though it's hard to spot Dolph in his new looks).<br/><br/>The towering Dothraki, Khal Drogo - Jason Momoa - to top it off. He is literally like a character walking out of a comic book with those chiselled muscles and the looks along with some pretty decent acting skills (he has a few comic one-liners too). He seems to have understood the depth of the character well and we will see him switching from the ignorant meta-human to the King of Atlantis along the way. There's a pretty decent back story (similar to WonderWoman) and a 'Save the World from Pollution' theme to hold on to. So overall the movie has a pretty solid base.<br/><br/>There are some minor flaws like too many things going on in the final fight (but certainly not as bad as Man of Steel or BvS, here it is simply because of the same magnitude that I mentioned earlier) and there are some space-game like action sequences (even the BGM at that time seems odd but I think it might have been intentional) - but those are very trivial ones.<br/><br/>Overall it is an entertaining DC movie and we feel like we are watching a true comic adaptation.<br/><br/>So now you see DC's dilemma now - In the next JL movie - WonderWoman and Aquaman will be running the show unless the Bat and the Man of Steel proves us wrong.<br/><br/>I rate it 4 out of 5. Watch it on a big screen to feel the magnitude.<br/><br/>
PS: Just one advice to all of you - PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILERS for DC movies. They simply reveal too much every single time."
"adamsmith-51004","8","6","10","16 December 2018"," A great superhero film
","This film has received mixed reviews from the critics and after watching it not sure why the negative ones.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a solid superhero film, yes you could say we have seen it all before but that doesn't make it any less fun. Jason Maoma is brilliant at playing the strong yet dump Arthur Curry/Aquaman. The story is very solid and makes good use of the main villain Oceanmaster and side one Blank Manta. The visuals in the film are brilliant you truly believe that it takes place under the ocean. The film passes by really quickly with a good amount of action and humour. Easily one of the best DC films of recent years and a good superhero film. Would recommend for anyone who is a fan of comic book films"

","I saw an early showing through Amazon (No Spoilers). What a fantastic telling of Aquaman's story. Actors were great, story was great, cgi and sound was great. It was an enjoyable cinematic experience while staying true to the characters comic book origins. Jason Mamoa is awesome as Aquaman. I say let James Wan take over the DCEU. Bring on Justice League 2 with the original cast and Wan in the drivers seat. The only negative I could find, was some predictability with a few minor plot points but I think that is to be expected with a royal succession story. I am not losing any sleep over it. I can't wait to see it again. Really good movie."

"khmsb21","2","19","42","31 December 2018"," it's just too much to handle
","I am right now in the cinema watching the movie and am on my phone.<br/><br/>It actually started well but it got lamer and lamer and I just couldn't keep my attention.
It seems rhe movie makers have one goal: show how much CGI they can put in, it's somehow annoying, they'll start a fight out of nowhere and it's just too much.<br/><br/>Also the lack of creativity is apparent, for example the star wars like costumes, the evil dude outfit that looks like antman meet predator and the scene where they slide on dirt ""cough cough prince of Persia""<br/><br/>But nothing is more annoying in the whole film like the explosions tgat take place every time characters are talking I mean I literally screamed ""come on"" at the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie started well but just went downhill in my opinion, the acting is bad and the CGI get on your nerves after awhile, the only positive thing is that now am inspired to read more about Atlantis, sea creatures, and human bad affect on marine life."

BTW: Don't lost hope in this film because of the RT score or what other people are saying about it. There should be no reason why this movie's score is 70 % or lower. It should be around 80 at least. This is the best movie after the mess of Justice League. I do admit there was a lot of things going on, so much story stuffed in one Film and some of the dialogue didn't fit but either way It was a pretty good movie! James Wan is a winner.

"omarmosaad-93674","4","22","50","20 December 2018"," Why comedy? So his origin story is a joke?
","Let me first say this, the cinematography and the lightning are great, many thanks to the director and the cinematopgrapher who created an interesting fantasy world for the audience, but..!<br/><br/>Were they trying to make a movie or a 4D game? Mmm, because I didn't quit catch anything AT ALL that has logical meaning or sense of reality!<br/><br/>The CGI was so weak if we are talking cinema, I don't think that the CGI crew have ever been to a cinema school and studied how to mix fiction with logic and make real fantasy, lively one! You are gonna imagine the green screen behind them, you are gonna feel you are standing between 4 green walls with the actors. Put that away from your mind, you get a beautiful picture.<br/><br/>Acting and who to blame!.. The director of course, the guy has a good cast, and still he can't get them to perform well, Momoa can't even figure out his character's dimensions to get involved, so you find him changing depending on the situation, a new character each scene, not a character to follow; is he a leader to follow? The story should tell you.. story? Mmm...<br/><br/>Story and the corruption of screen play writing in DC! Story line is broken, there isn't any actually, it's just a typical clichÃ©e kind of story that you can always predict its events, or atleast never get surprised with any of it because you have seen it 1000 of times before!<br/><br/>So the plot is weak and everything you already know fron the beginning, and you are waiting for it to either happen or not, nothing new will appear after the first 15 mins! And guess what, the infamous Black Mantis, the cool guy from the trailer, could have been so easily kicked out from the movie and you wouldn't even care, him and all his scenes, but the director wanted to strech the movie!<br/><br/>Video editing is so bad, disturbing and not meaningful, repeating some things twice as if they're legendary or something, you feel the editing, and that's why it is so bad!!!<br/><br/>Comedy and hell those jokes were not funny! I liked the comedic ironies and actions that occured that were related to the story, but why throw jokes? What grown up superhero does this? Not even spiderman!<br/><br/>So Aquaman's origin story is full of jokes, and I will always remember that, it's taking some of Black Panther and some of Thor: Ragnarok and that's a stupid mix!<br/><br/>Oh yeah and one last think, people of Atlantis kneel for who ever is king, which should be the big joke but it wasn't, LOL!<br/><br/>The movie has a beautiful image, not logical sometimes, it's a perfect popcorn-movie, and perfect for DC fans!"
"namashi_1","6","43","108","14 December 2018"," A Visually Dazzling, Yet Overstuffed Spectacle!
","Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, 'Aquaman' is the big DC Blockbuster that finally opened in cinemas today in India. Directed by James Wan, best known for helming the spooky Conjuring Series, now delves into the Superhero mold and delivers a visual spectacle. Wan, however, suffers partially on the account of an Overstuffed Screenplay, that is patchy and overlong.<br/><br/>'Aquaman' Synopsis: Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa in a winning performance) the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.<br/><br/>'Aquaman', who appeared in last year's disappointing Justice League, gets his solo origin story here and the Superhero is an instantly likable one. And Momoa gets into the skin of the superhero and delivers a fun turn, that leads 'Aquaman' to much success. Momoa not only looks the part, but brings a fabulous heroism to the part, which was essential here.<br/><br/>Another ace of 'Aquaman' are its visuals. This biggie looks like a dream! The world created underwater is dreamy and will leave your eyes mesmerized. The Graphics are of top-grade, and 'Aquaman' is easily the BEST looking DC film, yet! And the action-sequences, though way too many, are proficiently picturised and executed. Some of the stunts are wow! I'd like to point the one sequence that takes place in Italy in the film's latter half. Its stupendous!<br/><br/>However, despite magnificent visuals and Momoa nailing the titular role, 'Aquaman' suffers due to an overstuffed Screenplay. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick & Will Beall's Screenplay brings much action and a fast-moving narrative, but has no soul. Sure, 'Aquaman' wasn't going to be an experience full of pathos and soul, but here, there is none of it, not even a slight bit of it. The film keeps moving forward, not giving enough time to its characters to make them connect with the viewers, and there is just too much action here! I mean the action does leave a big impact, but there is an overdose of it here, quite frankly. It appears as if the Writers ran of out ideas in the middle, and kept writing action set-pieces until they found another aspect to continue upon. And there is barely any humor here, which is surprising, since Momoa seems to be good at being funny! The Writing could've been better, for sure!<br/><br/>James Wan's Direction is top-notch. As mentioned earlier, 'Aquaman' is a visual delight and the Director gives the film the look it deserves. This is a grand film and looks every bit of it. Don Burgess's Cinematography is fantastic. The lensman has captured the film beautifully. Kirk Morri's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper. 'Aquaman' feels a little too long at a 143-minutes, some trimming, of at least 20-minutes, was required. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Rupert Gregson-Williams's Score is super.<br/><br/>Barring Momoa, 'Aquaman' boasts an impressive host of actors, but the ones who stand out are Patrick Wilson (impressive as the villain) & Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko (efficient in a strong supporting role). Amber Heard as Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus & Temuera Morrison as Thomas Curry, are adequate.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Aquaman' is definitely fun, but it doesn't utilize its potential to the fullest. A Decent Watch!"

"zero-to-HERO","9","15","32","4 January 2019"," AQUAMAN & WONDER WOMAN SAVE THE DCEU!
","It looks as though the DCEU has some hope! Between the success Wonder Woman had and now Aquaman, there is some light at the end of the tunnel after all. The DCEU now has room to restructure their semi folly flicks/runs via the Justice League & Suicide Squad. Or does it? The reason why I say this is that it looks as though the DCEU movieverse does better with their standalone character driven films than it does when they're relayed as a team. Perhaps it was a matter of bad timing. I humbly think they should have introduced their primary standalone character films first before rushing in team collaborated feature films. Trying to catch up with marvel seemed to have been the plan, the folly there was marvel has been good at their movieverse craft for quite some time now. DC should have just paced themselves one character at a time.<br/><br/>But enough of the loom and gloom, this was supposed to be a positive review and thus it shall be. To be frank I didn't expect the film to be as good as it was. And admittedly had my doubts and reservations. Don't get me wrong I thought it was going to be fun but fun in a goofy way (not that I was expecting the whole thing to be goofy, just more so than not). But to my surprise there was less goofiness and more straight up fun. Not only that, but there were dark yet mystical elements to the film as well, supplemented with a dash of wittiness and character. Albeit the style that was presented in this film wasn't over the top, nor was it lowly either, but in my humble opinion, done just right (from a comic book world perspective). From the telling tale of Arthur Curry (Aquaman) to the general creation and lore of the world around him, I really didn't want it to end and yearned for more. And it made me feel like that slightly more so than when I watched Wonder Woman (as much as I also greatly appreciated that film).<br/><br/>Now it's no secret that to portray Atlantis properly, there would have to be some heavy CGI. And I will say it was done just right - considering current CGI technologies (plus budget allowance). The architecture presented both modern Atlantis and old sectors as well. To describe the way it was done would be harder said than seen. The rich textures and lush colors at so many turns, let alone the style of structures utilized created a mythical magic about Atlantis unlike seen before, part of which included Atlantean technological advancements. Of course I did see some areas that I thought needed more attention to detail, but my overall admiration of what was presented far outweighed my nitpickiness. The only real way to describe what Atlantis is like in this movie is to go see it yourself.<br/><br/>The actors did an admirable job! As someone who reads Aquaman comics, I had a tough time seeing Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Let's face it, Arthur from the comics and Arthur in this film look very different. And although I've been a fan of Jason Momoa's roles in both Stargate Atlantis (no pun intended) and Game of Thrones - I just couldn't visualize Jason hitting the mark as Aquaman. And to my surprise he did just that, especially as a DCEU extension of the character, he did a fantastic job! Just as Arthur, Jason delivered a bold, conflicted and sometimes misunderstood Aquaman, whilst showing us a prideful 'not easy to uncover' loving side as well.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do & quite the impressive cast it was. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Amber Heard as Mera, and even Dolph Lungren as King Nereus and more... Sometimes it's not the actors alone who make or break a film no matter who the actor/actress is, oftentimes it's the synergy of how the characters coalesce to one another that's an integral part of the process. Hence is why I reiterate this supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do and delivered a successful Aquaman film.<br/><br/>I must admit, when I see non comic book readers critique a comic book film, it makes me cringe (not always but a fair amount of times). Which is why in my humble opinion when seeing a Superhero film, don't rely on such critics too much, and sometimes this includes comic book reader critics too. Go in with an open mind and judge for yourself the world that's being presented to you. A comic book movieverse is one of those rare exceptions where relying on your own critiquing is a much better way of validating your liking or disliking of any one of these films over other critics themselves.<br/><br/>As for me, I really relished this film. It had all the elements required to portray Aquaman and the world around him. From the storytelling and the lore presented to the characters themselves and the laid out visuals. Go see it, and lean on your own genuine open minded critiquing when you do see it."

","What was this mess? Of course Hollywood keeps pumping this garbage out because 'we' still want to see if this comic book movie is better than then last. And not in a good way. So many of the comic book movies are CGI abominations and Aquaman is no exception. I took 4 days to finally finish. It was so uninteresting, boring, and predictable I could stay focused more then 20 minutes at a time. And it's a 2 1/2 hour movie. This movie has convinced me that Willem Defoe is NOT a good actor. I always thought he was a good actor because of very memorable roles. But looking back his good roles are the exception to the rule. Jason Mamoa was given ridiculous lines and action sequences that show he is a bad actor despite his awesome character depiction in ""Frontier."" Amber Heard??? She's terrible in Aquaman. Even our beloved Dolph Lundgren, who made a career in bad movies, is particularly bad in this flopping fish of a movie. It is a mess from start to finish. The sequences are laborious and dull. The dialogue wouldn't impress 13 year old boys. 1 Star for CGI, zero stars fro everything else.
The plot....
1) Woman beats up soggy storm troopers and we have no idea why.
2) Boy goes on school field trip to Aquarium and that is the extent of the introduction to Aquaman. We have know idea who he is, what shaped his life, his beliefs, how he discovered his powers, etc....
3) Black guys beat up Russians
4) Polynesian guy beats up more soggy storm troopers.
5) Polynesian guy and hot chick end up in the Sahara.
6) Polynesian guy and hot chick magically appear in Sicily and beat up the robot from Rocky 3.
5) FIsh people, beat up crab people, beat up shark people, beat up seahorse people.

Bright lighting/lights take your eyes away from the scenes, but it is so poor; I swear Willem Dafoe is laughing while he says his lines.
The narrator made me laugh - how silly and far fetched - too far fetched for people, maybe in a cartoon.
The storyline was created ad-hoc during the movie, seemingly, to fit in and add something to this POS.

","After the release of Justice League I wasn't optimistic about anything in the DC Extended Universe, not named Wonder Woman. I thought Aquaman was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray. I was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in James Wan. I think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the DC Universe and definitely the second best film after Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of Arthur Curry, who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of. The film goes into the details of Curry's past and shows how Aquaman eventually became the hero he is today. In this film Aquaman must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of Earth. The film stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, and Patrick Wilson.<br/><br/>Wan reunites with a reliable name in Wilson who plays Ocean Master. Both him and Black Manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films, its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the Aquaman comics for the general masses. You can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with it.<br/><br/>The film isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature. It still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light, tone, and color in this universe. Its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the DCEU should continue to exist, but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated.<br/><br/>7/10"

* Surprisingly good cinematography.
* Good directing.
* Fight scenes look bit too choreographed.
* Story is nothing new - Its a rip off from several movies.
* CGI everywhere. (but at least this time its understandable why.)

","I didn't have much expectations for this movie tbh after the failure of Justice League. But after watching this movie last Thursday, it completely blew my mind with its overwhelming visuals, superb soundtracks and great storyline. This is by far the best superhero origin movie for year 2018 (well if you exclude Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse). James Wan really done a great job in bringing this character to life and restore the DCEU."

"Jinxie_G","10","5","8","16 December 2018"," A Brief Review
","Typical hero journey where the hero must face hardships and go through a trial to achieve the one thing he doesn't want-to become king. Right?<br/><br/>Not exactly. And it isn't quite so simple. Don't worry, I don't drop spoilers.<br/><br/>I mean, yes, we're definitely following the hero journey story line because it's a superhero movie, but there isn't much typical about this movie, much like there isn't anything typical about Jason Momoa. ""Aquaman"" is filled with comedy and drama, love, exceptional action and horror that throws some fantastic jump-scare at its audience. The backstory is well done and touching. The comedy is timed perfectly, in my opinion, and quite hilarious. We're faced with more than one bad guy but also shown consequences of our actions. And by ""our"" I mean 'we the audience' as well as the characters.<br/><br/>We've already seen Momoa in this role in ""Justice League,"" but this film, this movie, expands on that, and he is outstanding and was meant to play Arthur Curry. Of that, I have no doubt. Kinda like Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna kicks ass, Amber Heard as Mera gives a great performance, and Willem Dafoe...what can I say? The man playing Vulko has been in both Marvel and DC movies, and his acting is stellar as always. Patrick Wilson gives a fabulous performance as the entitled King Orm, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II shows us a glimpse of Manta's humanity, albeit brief, and what one will do to exact revenge. James Wan (""Insidious,"" ""Furious 7""), director, gives us visuals-holy sh!t the visuals-that are stunningly beautiful, and storytelling that is spot on and retains the momentum from Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman,"" keeping the DCU's heart beating strong.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but I think DC has finally figured out how to make movies. I will definitely be watching this again, and buying it.<br/><br/>""I dig it."""

","The best of this current series of DC movies. Visually incredible, epic set pieces and tonnes of potential for more out of this character's universe. James Wan's direction and the cinematography is brilliant during the fight scenes and the spectacle of the large battles (the final act of the film is mind-blowingly epic, with sea creatures fighting alongside armies etc.). The performances are good from everyone, Momoa has managed to make Aquaman cool, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe are spot on as Mera and Vulko, and lastly we get two of the DC universe's coolest cinematic villains with Ocean Master and Black Manta (the latter having one of the best action sequences in the movie) and costume wise everyone is straight out the pages of the comics. Few minor issues, the humour just isn't funny at all, some of the dialogue is awkward and not well delivered. Also some of the licensed music used is dreadful (the score is good though). This is proof if DC aren't done with their universe and is one of the best comic book movies this year 👍🏻"

","Look, I'm not a die hard fan of any super hero comic books, I just enjoy movies for what it is. If I walk out of every cinema after watching movies and I know in myself that I definitely enjoyed it then I'll give those movies a 10/10 no matter what other critics/people says because I don't rely on opinions of others when it comes to having personal enjoyment. And for me Aquaman, though I've decided to watch this moivie without knowing anything about him, I'm really surprised at how fast he became one of my favorite super heroes along side Iron Man, Captain America, Superman and Wonder Woman."

"averyoda","3","14","30","28 December 2018"," One of the Funniest Movies of the Year
","Aquaman is a bad movie. Let's get that straight. From the costuming, to the score (except Sigur Ros, I love me some Sigur Ros), to the plot, to the acting it's all pretty awful. Jason Momoa shows no emotion throughout the entire film. I would, however, HIGHLY recommend to everyone that they see Aquaman as soon as possible. It is unintentionally comedic genius. From Aquaman literally murdering a hiding cowering henchmen to challenging the BBEG to a fair fight in front of a live audience, then proceeding to get his *** kicked and run away from the duel after cheating and tagteaming the villain before he had the chance to win, Aquaman ends up feeling more like a villain himself than a hero. It doesn't help of course that the villain's main motivation to attack the human world is that THEY ATTACKED HIM FIRST. The villain's not even a villain. Also, this movie is oddly fascist. Like, the whole time the script makes sure that you know that only the blood elite have the ability to rule, and that's not challenged by Aquaman, that stays the status quo the entire movie. Not to mention the INCREDIBLE amount of plot holes and inconsistencies and OMG the costumes. Seriously, if you are into so-bad-it's-good films, give this one a watch, you won't be disappointed."
"BrockLinehan","3","14","30","27 December 2018"," Boring, but good effects
","I'm being stingy with the 3 stars, but I needed to balance out the 10/10's that the marketing agents gave it. I like Jason Mamoa, but he is a very wooden actor and not a good choice as lead. Story is generic, predictable and full of the usual cliches. Only positive was the effects which were very impressive, but even that could not keep my lids open - I dozed off near the end. I suggest waiting for it on Netflix and only watch as a last resort."

"ijamadar","9","14","30","14 December 2018"," Move aside Wonder Woman, Aquaman stole my heart ... veritable roller coaster
","Wow this movie blew me away, not a moment I could breath just constant action and amazing SFX with good acting and very believable world.
I grew up on comics and Aquaman was never an easy character or world. And thus was never really popular or interesting on his own. Usually coming to life when in a role with another character or big story.
But somehow they managed to pull of something amazing, that actually made me really see the character and world in a way I had never thought.
I can absolutely see how critics and those that are so into dissecting and criticizing movies and forgetting that its movie goers who matter. And if they want escapism and fun then who cares what your checklists and technicalities are.
The visuals are awe dropping and I did not even see it in IMAX. They did an amazing job in creating the whole Ocean World, and easily the best SFX so far in the DC World.
The Black Manta character was a bit off and I im not sold on him, found myself more irritated by him than anything. But I think they were trying to must seed him into the future story lines.
If your put off by the critics, ignore them and go and see it. Apart from the real sticklers you will all love it. Just sit back and prepare to be awed and go on an emotional roller coaster.
Its so not like a conventional Super Hero movie, and that is great as why have the same things over and over. It felt more like a Clash Of The Titans journey with an Avatar world of escapism mixed in."

","Have always been a fan of my favourite idol James Wan, director of horror movies. Initially I was sceptical about him directing his first ever Superhero movie Aquaman but guess what? It was better than I expected! Casting Jason Momoa as Aquaman is just perfect for the role although I would prefer Aquaman to have short beard with short hair instead of long beard, moustache and long hair hahaha. Ahemm, red-head Princess Mera (Amber Heard) is hot and sexy too, while the secondary villain Black Manta looks exactly from the comic book... a very funny big headed black ant to me hahaha.<br/><br/>I tend to agree that 145 minutes is a bit too long for this movie but one thing for sure... it's full of actions and never boring.

It's like they ran out of money from the giant water battles that didn't serve a purpose, so they couldn't be bothered to maybe film some of the land scenes, I don't know, on a location next to an ocean. This movie is an hour too long.

No doubt acting with visual effects not visible on the set is a huge challenge, and delivering a credible reading of badly-written dialogue would also challenge many actors. Unfortunately, the cast does not overcome those challenges."

","This is as bad as it gets.. not 100% sure what's wrong with DC movies, but they seem to miss the mark from a timing and pacing point of view. The cinematography is alway great, but there's something about the way they piece these together in post that is slightly off, even the way they record the dialogue that takes away from the weight of any performance - or maybe it is simply that they don't cast well?<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was a huge improvement for DC and I had high hopes that this would learn from those lessons, but IMHO we're back to weak story, characters I don't ever get asked to care about, terrible pacing, disjointed and jumpy transition between acts, and a terrible script.<br/><br/>Casting wise, if i was Jason Momoa's wife i'd be overjoyed that there was zero chemistry between the incredibly boring, but pretty to look at Jason and equally lacklustre and boring Amber - the best casting here is definitely Dolph and Willem!<br/><br/>Much like Jason and Amber, this movie is very pretty to look at, but ultimately boring and a waste of time.<br/><br/>So many bad lines, so many holes in the plot, so much content crammed in that they forgot to mention some of it, so many pointless bit of action, and at leat 20 mins too long.<br/><br/>skip it!"

Gritty but not too much, cool but not fake cool...he's just cool period, perfect physically for the role. I mean wouldn't Aquaman be 6' 4"" and very handsome? The action and CGI of this movie are beautiful, you really get to delve into fantasy-land for 2 hours. Every character was portrayed well by each actor. There is no portrayal that I didn't like. And it has a good story line that kept me interested. Frankly, it was so entertaining I've already seen it twice and plan to see it in IMAX at least once more.

It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur.

Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.<br/><br/>Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.<br/><br/>Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.<br/><br/>Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.<br/><br/>However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.<br/><br/>There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film.

"thesar-2","4","4","6","20 January 2019"," Thor Underwater
","I know I'm probably causing waves here, but I clearly see why this made so much across the seas. It's just so basic.<br/><br/>Awww, James Wan. How you've been bought out. I mean, good for you, as a director and creator, you've come so far...to earn so much. But, you've also left your soul behind in that dirty SAW basement to enter the depths of the oceans and sell out to DC.<br/><br/>But, anyways, I didn't hate this movie. It was so much like Black Panther - just OK. So mediocre, so bland, so formulaic. There was nothing new here...aside from so many swear words that were just added in for ""depth."" The edge! Now, I'm no prude. I swear up and down, but here it felt forced.<br/><br/>Anyways, we have reluctant Aquaman who's hell-bent on not being the King he's supposed to be that he journeys the entire movie to become said King. Oh, and insert sets, conflicts and villains A-B-C on his journey. And lest, I forget, his relationship with Not-Scarlett Johansson plays a part.<br/><br/>So this Fish-Outta-Water-Film is the classic tale of self-discovery with a 1000% CGI. Though I am NOOOO CGI fan, I guess there's really little alternative here. We have The Little Mermaid made into a live-action battle, Ã  la The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>And now, back to knocking the lands across the ocean. They see 1 movie for every 100 I see, so yeah, I have a right to say this was bad overall, though still watchable. It's just not great as: let's earn a billion and become the greatest DCEU film. It's certainly not the best, but I can see where people connected with it.<br/><br/>Just wish they would've explored the whole pollution thing a tad farther. Yeah, us humans suck and it's only briefly mentioned here. Stand up, stop polluting the oceans and it's sooo beyond those damn straws.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Yep, this is the highest grossing worldwide DCEU movie, but far from the best one:<br/><br/>1.

"achyutaghosh","9","4","6","16 December 2018"," Aquaman is a fun affair!
","Aquaman is a blast!<br/><br/>DC got everything right for a change, and in doing so James Wan conjures (pun intended) a level of entertainment that bests their greatest in this decade- Wonder Woman. The humor, action, acting, editing, all are spot on for a change, and Jason Momoa as Aquaman is as inspired a choice as Gal Gadot was.<br/><br/>This connected universe thing is not DC's cup of tea. They never established the characters well enough to connect them like Marvel did, and each movie was tonally different. DC's 2018 shift towards independent, disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the Marvel way. Aquaman though, introduced in fine style in 2017's Justice League is a remnant of their connected strategy. Momoa isn't the only guy bringing the house down though, the key guy here is James Wan. Wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience, which DC so far lacked. Not that he has given up on his horror roots- some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the Conjuring universe.<br/><br/>Watching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind. In this case, that is an underwater world, complete with shark and whale riders, highways for turtle-cabs, sea horses that are quite literally sea horses, bongo playing octopuses, giant prehistoric monsters, pink haired Dolph Lungdren- you get the idea.<br/><br/>Aquaman picks up where Steppenwolf is defeated in Justice League, and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them. A backstory gives Arthur Curry's origin- eldest son of the queen of Atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper. She was apparently executed for her infidelity, but you know DC movies are all about mommies, so hold that thought. Arthur's half brother Orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms (yes, there are 7!) and wage war with Donald Trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming, ocean trash, pollution etc. Only Arthur can take him on, but for that he needs the Trident of Atlan. He is helped by Mera, daughter of Sir Pink Hair Dolph, and Vulko, counselor of Atlantis, while in his way stands Orm and his dreams of becoming Ocean Master, and his comic book nemesis, Black Manta.<br/><br/>Arthur Curry: I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
Mera: Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more.
Arthur Curry: Well, what could be greater than a king?
Mera: A hero.<br/><br/>In one fell swoop, Wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain, a believable romantic angle, and an emotional family drama, replete with epic battle scenes that shade Star Wars, and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to Indiana Jones. Momoa plays Aquaman as he played Khal Drogo- brashness and physicality that he has made his own, along with doses of humor and charm- no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for Mera. Speaking of whom, Mera is perhaps Amber Heard's first big budget role, and she fits the Atlantean princess to the T. Nicole Kidman is the most charming DC superhero mommy, and Yahya Abdul Mateen is a passionate Black Manta. Patrick Wilson as Orm is probably the only miscasting, but he too gamely plays along.<br/><br/>Many thought this year's greatest spectacle was Avengers:Infinity War but do watch Aquaman and you may be pleasantly surprised."

"jackson-regurge","7","10","20","3 January 2019"," Aquaman Makes a Splash!
","Aquaman is an exciting and enthralling adventure that must be seen on the big screen! It offers one of the best stories produced so far by DC's cinematic universe.<br/><br/>The visual effects in Aquaman are spectacular. The film is reminiscent of Tron, Avatar, How to Train your Dragon and Star Wars in its creation of the world of Atlantis on screen. As a fan of the comics, the vivid colours and comic accurate costumes are so pleasing to see cinematically. It is clear to see that director James Wan has done his homework. However, the de-aging effect used on Temuera Morrison is a little bit distracting. This is only a small criticism though, as otherwise, the effects are something to behold.<br/><br/>James Wan brings everything that's good about the original source material. However, he also brings his own flare to the property, adding horror elements that merge beautifully with the world he has forged.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa was born to play Aquaman! In recent years, Aquaman has been treated as something of a laughing stock. However, these times are over! Momoa has brought gravitas to the role and has made the character very cool. Amber Heard is also fantastic in this film adding a really interesting dynamic to the film. Her character surpasses the typical damsel in distress that superhero films typically have, instead giving us a powerful and stylish equal to Momoa's Aquaman. Patrick Wilson's portrayal of King Orm is good, but in the grand scheme of the film Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's portrayal of Black Manta shines out, offering a very compelling villain for future films. I must also add that Willem Dafoe's Vulko really helps add authenticity to the world of Atlantis with a subtle and considered performance.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend the film to fans of casual film goers but also to die hard fans. The film's visuals are spectacular and are also supported by a strong storyline that will keep you totally invested throughout. I would give Aquaman 7.9 out of 10 as nothing is watered down!"

","So today was my husbands birthday. His one request was to see this film. I agreed (for the eye candy lol) even when I haven't watched any recent DC films.
I am a huge marvel fan, and to me this just seemed like a low budget, childs version of Marvel.
The storyline was predictable, the graphics were vibrant and eye catching but just not believable - especially trying to make them look younger.
I felt like there was just an action scene after an action scene with new people/villains to fight but no real character development and not enough of a back story to the main character.<br/><br/>And I couldn't help but compare a few things to the marvel films:
1. The mother was never dead. And came back to the husband (who never moved on) in tip top condition. (Like AntMan)
2. The villains black/red suit was like a knock off version of AntMan. And his name Black Manta is like they couldn't think of anything besides Black Panther and just changed it to suit the ocean.
3. Aquaman is DC's version of Thor - very manly and muscular but funny and sarcastic with his deep voice and long hair.<br/><br/>And for some reason when Arthur was going to collect the trident, I was expecting that singing snail in Moana to pop out haha."

","Dear lord - from Amber Heard's terrible acting and wig SO obvious you can actually see the lace front hairline; through to the horrifically overacted EVERYTHING that is Nicole Kidman - this movie is any unmitigated disaster.
Yeah - we get it - Ya read the legend of King Arthur and thought you'd base the whole movie around it complete with jousting, rightful king and all that goes along with it.
Jason Mamoa is actually the very best thing about this - taking on an absolutely abysmal script and somehow still making Aquaman seem cool.
Big budget special effects - so that's kinda cool - hence the two stars - but other than that - this is definitely a kid's movie. They should have employed the writers of Shrek, Toy Story or a docen other movies to write this instead. So overall, casting was an absolute joke; script (like Inception and Batman Begins) tries WAY too hard to be clever and just fails miserably (it's like watching 5 unrelated episodes of ""Aquaman The Series"" back to back.); the badly cast actors all overact their roles and are supported by some terribly poor acting - and WTF happened to Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe's faces?!?!? Did y'all think that would look good? It's like when they colorized movies and posters back in the 1980s - NO!! it does not look realistic.
Next generation of movies people - CGI'ing real actors faces to try and make them look younger......just fail.
This would be a good movie to watch at home with the kids - but save your cinema money for something better"

But then it got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.<br/><br/>Not one single 'character' behaved in an interesting, believable or relatable manner, and the script appeared to have been written by someone who had never actually seen a movie before but had instead been raised exclusively on World of Warcraft.<br/><br/>And actually, the experience of the 'film' was more like one of those youtube videos watching someone else playing a video game, passively observing someone else constantly 'unlocking levels' and being fed endless new challenges (""now you gotta get the OTHER trident!"") with no reason for any of them to matter to the viewer.<br/><br/>Every attempt at humour fell flat and seemed out of character for characters that paradoxically had no character, and every time any of the actors (and particularly the actresses) had to do anything but walk forward in a straight line, they were replaced by terrible computer game CGI animation. I was trying to figure out if ANY of the scenes were not just shot in a big green room but I could only count about four.<br/><br/>The only positive thing I could find to say about the whole embarrassing affair is that sometimes the pretty coloured lights looked sorta nice, once in awhile.

Flashbacks are thrown in seemingly at random and practically give you whiplash. Character motivations are never quite explained. The movie plays out like a bunch of different cut-scenes from an Aquaman video game played out in random order. The cheese level at some points surpasses Power Rangers (the TV show!) levels and the dialogue drops down to the level of the bad guys yelling ""RRAARRR!!"".<br/><br/>While still entertaining, there are some awesome scenes, it definitely drops down a cog from the Aquaman we were introduced to in Justice League and left me disappointed.

"geoffreywade","3","7","13","23 December 2018"," Predictable and frustrating
","I get very frustrated with superhero movies for this very reason. Every diehard fan of DC or Marvel jumps on IMDB and rates it a 10, making the cumulative IMDB rating much higher than it should be, which yeilds optomism followed by incredible disappointment. I like some superhero movies, but not just because I like the universe or company that makes them. I think most of them are vastly overrated, and diehard superhero fans, Marvel and DC alike, become completely blinded by their love for a franchise. In my opinion, Aquaman was one of the worst of the recent superhero movies. The humor seemed incredibly forced and really not funny, there was no character arch, no plot development, and frankly very poor acting. There were so many cheesy lines that were supposed to be dramatic and awe inspiring that were cringeworthy, and I found myself feeling almost embarrassed for the actors involved. Yes the visuals were good, and the fight scenes were entertaining and well done, but it takes way more than just that and a DC or Marvell stamp to make a good movie. After seeing Aquaman, my patience for superhero movies is slowly fading, as it becomes obvious to me that if DC or Marvel makes a movie, no matter how bad it is, their respective fans will immediately rate it a 10. This is slowly delegitimizing good superhero movies. If you are a diehard DC fan you will probrably love Aquaman whether you see it or not; if you're a non-biased movie fan who just wants to see a good film, then you'll probrably think it's trash, and be very disappointed by the positive reviews."

","Aquaman is the first DC film that looks like it wants to embrace its fun side<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Aquaman is a film gasping for air. Hobbled by a messy and overstuffed screenplay, poorly developed characters, and a patchwork of unimaginative action sequences stretched across bloated running time. The film suffers through an identity crisis. It wants to embrace the campy Silver Age comics but it also wants to try to be serious and feels like a patchwork of many films. Yet ""Aquaman"" shows sparks of hope throughout, with visual finnese and one of the most fantastic openings in the genre. At times, ""Aquaman"" contains the hints of a blockbuster ready to engulf the world.
From giant sea creatures swimming around to Dafoe's Vulko riding a giant hammerhead shark, the film doesn't lack In its imaginative ways to transform the ocean .But its default mode is paint-by-the-numbers action, by the time you've reached the finale there has been over a dozen or so clashes. Instead of making one ""Aquaman"" movie, James Wan has made three or four films. Wasting away what could have been great storylines for future films. The film never takes the opportunity of get you invested in these characters. When the opportunity to do so arises, it's a damn action sequence or laborious exposition is put in its place.<br/><br/>Aquaman just strives for sensory overload without a care for the audience's emotional connection."

It's visually stunning and the actors try to do their best of a poor script.<br/><br/>However, there are many negatives. As usual, DC try to do too much and seem to be in a rush to get as much covered as possible. Aquaman learning his powers should be done in the 1st act, not the 2nd. By this point, it was just assumed he'd learned over time, so no point having his training so late in the movie.<br/><br/>The overall tone was all over the place. One minute, it's serious like MOS and BVS, the next it's slap stick like Looney Tunes.<br/><br/>Mera was beautifully played by Amber Heard, but there was too much change in the character. She starts off like the Little Mermaid, then progresses to Black Widowesque, then some sort of Jean Grey type character.<br/><br/>The movie felt like it tried to take the best bits of the 3 Thor movies (not necessarily a bad thing but would have been nicer to see Aquaman as something different).<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad movie but could have been so much better"

","This movie is truly a masterpiece in the superhero genre, the cinematography and visuals are breathtaking, simply beautiful to look at. James Wan probably did one of the best directing job in 2018 as everything was just perfect, nailed everything perfectly, catching the heart of the characters and story and also the whole atmosphere and tone of the movie, making everything believable. Its actually really close to the New 52 comic book run that was written by Geoff Johns, it made me as a fan really happy, seeing the villains and all the culture and people done right. Making the costumes for especially Orm, Mera and Aquaman's final suit absolute true to their comic book counterpart. It was also great cast, having a well known ensemble with names like Amber Heard, Willem Defoe, Dolph Lundgren, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman that all portray their characters in a accurate and great way. Jason Momoa blew me away, he's actually a believable Arthur Curry except for the long brown hair and beard. My favorite characters have to be Aquaman and Mera like they were in the graphic novel, great duo and amazing characters!<br/><br/>Something that kept me interested at all times were the action sequences and plot, making it flow together nicely. The Sicily sequence and the final battle being my favorites, making this movie rewatchable more than the great characters and actors they have in store!

"tavm","8","6","11","17 January 2019"," Aquaman was quite a thrilling DC superhero movie!
","I first knew of Aquaman as a kid of the '70s when watching him in the animated series ""Superfriends"" when he was teamed with his more-established mates of Superman, Wonder Woman, and the team of Batman & Robin. There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he's very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it's also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here. In summary, Aquaman has such a fine story and great action set pieces, that I heartily recommend it!"
"aleksandersochan","6","6","11","6 January 2019"," Strong visual. Weak dialogue/acting.
","Visually this movie was pretty great. They crafted a very unique and cool world and met my expectations for this, which was the original reason I wanted to see this movie in theaters. Sadly though, the dialogue was very painfully corny and unnatural feeling much of the time; and the acting of some of the main characters doesn't help. I loved Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones, but for some reason he did not appear to be able to naturally perform this role. I will say to be fair that the dialogue he was served to read gave him a massive disadvantage. What he does have going for him is he definitely looks the part, perhaps better than anyone else I can think, I just wish the performance felt more genuine.<br/><br/>Another pro for this movie would be that the action scenes were pretty strong. Still I found that the corniness of the dialogue overshadowed this in my mind because it was painfully hard if not impossible to ignore at times.<br/><br/>If you're going to see this movie, go in for cool costumes, sea animals, fantastical kingdoms, superhero action fights, and neat visuals. Leave your expectations for good dialogue and non-cringy character interactions behind."

","Absolutely amazing movie. The best DC movie so far. The movie is moved from being a child friendly superhero to a more mature and serious story, where it matters who you are, and
The actor play is just phenomenal. All of the movie characters are really well developed. They have a really solid story behind them and the viewer gets attach to their story and who they are, and this is made in a really clever ways.
In the whole movie everyone grows and develops.
Another great aspect DC implemented was that heroes has also some weaknesses, and are drawn closer and closer to the average person, and that not superpowers are important, but the thing who we are. The feelings we express.
The cinematography is just stunning, and the special effects was the best i have seen in a 3D movie so far. Just amazing to watch. A lot of effort was put into the underwater world. They successfully recreated the beauty of the deep.
I have some minor complains about Mera. In some shots she was presented like an innocent explorer of the land, and in other shots she was presented like a provocative and super experienced badass girl. I dont really know what made this very rapidly change in character but who knows.
But the movie is absolutely amazing and it is a must to watch preferably in 3D.

"Ceredon1","6","6","11","28 December 2018"," One of the better DC flicks but still a 6.
","DC movies always seem to come up short (though their tv series are absolutely the worst). Having said that this one was one of their better showings.<br/><br/>Not sure how much they paid Nicole Kidman to stoop down to being in this film but they gave her horrible, stunted lines. She honestly seemed very out of place and I don't blame her for that.<br/><br/>There was no reason for it to be such a long movie. Seemed to want to have big CGI scenes just for the sake of having them. Also they seemed to be very confused as to how indestructible aquaman should be. In one scene he eats a RPG to the chest (who the hell brings an RPG on a submarine?) and it barely stuns him and he takes no physical damage. He takes a plasma blast (that earlier vapourized a huge boulder) and gets back up with some superficial burns. He jumps out of a plane from hundreds of feet in the air and just rolls his landing. Yet he is stabbed by a plain old dagger (and not just the Atlantian blades).<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a fun movie and for all it's flaws I enjoyed it. I can't put my finger on why marvel movies are always so much better but I think a part of it is that they don't take themselves too seriously (or are able to give that impression). That might be why this was one of the better DC films, in that they seemed to just have fun for the most part (but not entirely)."

i went to watch this movie as a neutral fan and honestly i was so disappointed.
first of all the cliched plot line? the whole movie is about aquaman finding the trident and they streched it for 2:30 hours,it felt bloated this movie would have been bearable if it was an hour and 45 long.Then the way he obtained the trident in 2 microseconds just like that? you kidding ? it just fell off completely rather than being a satisfying moment in the film.
Then there are huge character plotholes!! they are literally sea creatures so why on earth they would need a boat to travel through the sea? or why would they need those underwater-crafts when they simply can swim like a literal sea-flash.
also it is mentioned that aquaman has special eyes which helps him see underwater even when its dark then why the heck he would need flairs in the climax sequence ? and there are many more silly character development mistakes in the movie
also what exactly are aquaman's powers? is he wolverine? is he Thor(wannabee wet-thor more likely). he gets beaten like crazy and yet he sorta is healed in the same scene and also there are no signs of injury whatsoever.
The whole story and dialouges seems like you are watching a teen rom-com! with childish dailouges and poor writing.
The only Good thing about this movie is Jason Momoa ! they nailed it in the casting of him as aquaman but the rest is pretty much mediocre at best."

","Alots been made about DC and it's movies.
If like me your a comic book fan,your just ignore the critics.
Marvel or DC,I just wanna see a great movie and this is.
Jason Momoa makes the role his,I forgot the comic book image as this WAS Aquaman.
A cheeky grin and swagger to match.
Great casting in Amber Heard as she's in 90% of the movie and makes Mara as powerful as she's meant to be.
The whole cast did an amazing job and should be commended.
The CGI is top notch and REALLY REALLY needed to be for this film to stand any chance.
James Wan made a film thats up there with all the other superhero offerings.
DC are finally on a role with Wonder Woman and now this,so PLEASE DC keep it going.
And if people say it's copying Marvel then so what.
Them two have been doing it for years..
ENJOY👍🏼"

","Aquaman was a pretty good movie. There were a couple of acting parts from Jason Momoa that were pretty cringy. I just feel like the CGI was a bit too much. Dont get me wrong the CGI was cool and looked good, there was just too much of it. I liked Black Manta and Ocean Master both. It just seemed like Manta came out of no where and started hunting Aquaman. Mera was awesome in this movie. Her and Arthur were a good team. Knowing James Wan and the Type of Movies he specializes in, i expected to see a horror scene and it didn't disappoint. Im surprised that that scene got past a pg-13 rating.And how Orm knew Manta is still confusing, or maybe i just missed something. The runtime was a bit lengthy, but still. It was either me, the theater or the actual movie, but the underwater scenes were very hard to hear. Willem Dafoe was also cool in this type of movie. I would've liked to see more of Arthur and Mera on land. It seemed like every 5 minutes the wall got blasted in by someone. One of my favorite parts was the final fight scene between Aquaman and Orm. Overall it was a good movie. Not really something I'd absolutely have to see again, but it was good."

The storyline was great, the visual effects were fantastic and I really liked the characters and the humor, the gags. Maybe Manta was a bit stupid man, but we could understand everybody's motivation and intentions. This is the movie I'll watch so many times cause every detail added something special. This was not a drama so you do not have to wait for Oscar winnig performances, but the casting was great, they all fitting into their roles and do it very believable.

I mean, at least DCEU tried to tell stories of superheros we've never heard of in their distinct way whether or not they are liked by the public, but now it seems like they just want to play safely, and cater to most of the audience ,no unexpected plot twist, no deeper messages to deliver under the appearance. Exclusive of the superhero-like characters and the mythological background, it may just look like a Fast and Furious sequel,that is, a classic popcorn movie. But why not, only to produce this kind of movie makes them plenty of fortune."

I was surprised to find a surprisly good film about a half human half Antlatian called Arthur, who challenges his half brother to his rightful place as king to stop war against the humans. Director James Wan outdoes himself by creating a great DC film that goes alongside all our favourites such as Batman and Superman. Main actor Jason Momoa does an outstanding performance by really embracing and taking on the tough character of Aquaman. The movie does however stay true it's comic book by not only introducing Arthur's brother King Orm but also introducing Aquamans Nemesis, Manta. Aquaman is a truely fantastic film that DC lovers will enjoy and a movie that family's can go and see for a movie night."

"geraa-03530","6","8","16","18 December 2018"," Does not deserve any more than this score
","It looked to me like they've put up a really consistent unrealistic look, everything was told like a tale of some other world. The plot has a point, although it's still weak, like most superhero movies, sorry. Fun action, and amazing shots.<br/><br/>The worst:
The ""side-villain"" guy with cyclops stuff: unlimited unjustified anger, engineer in whatever you need, and a really exaggerated angry face. What's more, he's too strong for a human (on some scenes, maybe it's the suit, we'll never know. Not when his father's life depends on it, for certain), not very believable.
The killings: to be a hero who wants to end a war he may have been too commited on making fishes and sharks kill atlans to do it. Seems like a justification for an epic battle.<br/><br/>The best:
The charisma on Aquaman's father, very good character;
Aquaman's groupies, I laughed more than i should have to this;
How he got the trident, slytherin-like chat (althought its powers are not crystal clear to me, or how it allowed them to escape that place.);
The recognition of human weapon's destructive potential. You can measure the difference between an atlantean taking the hit of a granade launcher and Superman taking it;
Consciousness about contamination.<br/><br/>I just hope that DC cyclops won't show up ever again, as the final scene suggests."

"EmbraceTheGeek","7","11","24","16 December 2018"," A Unique Maritime Epic
","Let me start by saying this film is a definite improvement from past DC Films. This movie felt a bit long considering it's run time of 2hrs 23 mins as the epic scope of CGI scenes battled with trying to keep a simple plot refreshing. It is a film of royalty and myth which rewards this film by giving it the grand scale other DC films lack. Sure this film does follow the typical formula, but there are a few twists which keep the film from being an absolute bore. Visually this film is looks pretty as the nearly endless CGI serves as mostly pleasurable to the eyes. The various environments of the sea vary from illuminated wonder to dreary darkness but it is satisfying to see how broad film is with creating kingdoms of the sea. There is a scene where Aquaman spins his trident with terrible CGI but I'll ignore that. As for character development, this film has had more than a lot of past DC films and as an audience we learn enough about Aquaman to understand his motivation. This could go deeper but in an already long movie it would be quite difficult and would most likely become a snooze fest. There are moments that are bound to make you smirk in the dialogue and the characters are likable enough that you don't end up hating them and might come to enjoy them during the film. However, this is an action film and deep dialogue is the last thing you'd expect. There are moments which can be a bit cheesy or over the top but it is satisfying to follow Aquaman through his journey though the sea. His relationships add a layer of richness which somewhat invests you in his motivations and endeavors. If it wasn't for his companion Momoa, his brashness and over the top nature would be unbearable and annoying, but she provides an acceptable balance. Overall, this film entertains with its adventurous feel and monumental battles but it falls victim to a lengthy run time which is unbalanced in pacing. I would recommend and I feel cinemagoers will feel some sense of satisfaction from DCs oceanic epic. It is a refreshing take on a system which is formulaic (both Marvel and DC) with a unique setting and royal grandeur which sets it apart from its predecessors."

"sanjayasantoso","9","11","24","12 December 2018"," Best DCEU movie after Wonder Woman
","AQUAMAN (2018)<br/><br/>DC you finally did it! Another worthy movie from DCEU besides Wonder Woman. Never have I expected the movie to be turned as good as this, especially since the director James Wan is famous for mostly horror movies such as Saw, The Conjuring, and Insidious.<br/><br/>You can also call this movie the Black Panther version of DC : the plot which is battle for the throne, the lost and advanced city of Atlantis which basically is Wakanda, and the powerful villain of King Orm which basically is Killmonger. Surely there are some point which different but those elements are the most that standout to me and basically feels Black Panther enough for me.<br/><br/>There are some things that I must say Aquaman did better than Black Panther : the beautiful tough and badass Princess Mera portrayed by Amber Heard, a badass mother Queen Atlanna portrayed by Nicole Kidman, and a better 2nd villain in the form of Black Manta rather than Ulysses Klaue. Besides that, Jason Momoa is standout as Arthur Curry and Aquaman is a truly energized fast paced action superhero movie since the beginning that will keep you amazed until the end and not realizing that the movie duration is almost 2.5 hours<br/><br/>So why the 4.5 and not the perfect 5 score? Well since basically I am a Marvel fanboy and I watched Black Panther 3 times in theaters, which is a record for me, this movie cannot have a better score than Black Panther LOL. Wakanda Forever<br/><br/>Score : 4.5 of 5 stars"
"SomeOtherBloke","7","11","24","11 December 2018"," Depictive colours emerged from what was before me.
","A friend of mine persuaded me to watch Aquaman in China. I didn't really want to, to be honest. But I went along, nontheless.<br/><br/>3D vibrating seats IMAX stuff.<br/><br/>The movie started and I was preparing myself for a Hollywood meh.
Whoa!
This movie gives me the Storm Troopers I've been waiting to see since seeing the first scene in 1977 Star Wars. The scene when the Storm Troopers had burst into the Tantive IV and annihilated the rebels. The Atlantian Commandoes are such as we have been waiting to see, I believe.
This movie also provides awesome technology. In so many ways, surprisingly enough, it filled that hole in my enthusiasm that had resulted from watching Star W...w....wrrsss. I can't even type it. Lol.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is a massive buzz in a 3D vibrating seat IMAX. Quite frankly, it blew me away here and there. I will have to see it again because all I can remember right now is how much of a buzz it was and how many buzzes I got from this movie. And there were quite a few.
The Black Mamber guy is awesome, behaving exactly how Anakin should have been behaving, as a hard man a quarter of the way through The Phantom Menance, two crazy movies before the Emperor enleashes him. Awesome. I loved that guy.<br/><br/>I have no idea about Aquaman, and only recogised Khal Drogo about twentiy minutes into the movie! Lol. I thought the part suited him really well. Him and that red headed Duchessy lady, Mera or some such, engaged me and I was mostly happy watching them banter n' that. When they did things I didn't like, something would happen and they stop that and instead find themselves in a pickle. Which was good.<br/><br/>The visual effects range from up ""wow amazing"" and down to weird shark faces, which in a way were still alright once I'd gotted used to them remarkably quickly.<br/><br/>I liked the music, funnily enough. It was deep oceany.<br/><br/>Platoon and Spidey's ""Elias"" Green Goblin was in it too. His role is kind of interesting. The stuff he did n' that. Some of it was pretty nice to watch.<br/><br/>Aquaman's mam was alright too. I liked her. It's nice to see a movie with characters I like. It's a good thing, I think.<br/><br/>Who didn't I like? Hmmm... I don't know.<br/><br/>Some say it is like Avatar or LOTR. And in a way, bits of it are you know, aggregated together with bits of Tron2, Star Wars, and delivered them very well here.<br/><br/>Of course it's not perfect, but these imperfections give it personality. Few complain that the original South Park drawings were not Da Vinci perfect.<br/><br/>This film can tug at your heart strings, and not only in a poignant way, if you are so inclined. And that's nice, too.<br/><br/>For me, this movie was a good experience in that IMAX place. I walked out happily, after the extra credit bit.
Yeah, watch that after the first credit roll."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","12","27","13 December 2018"," Aquaman splashes onscreen with a spectacular torrent and a waterfall of barnacle action.
","It's safe to say that Aquaman is no longer not cool. The running joke is finally put to rest. Not only has accomplished director Wan created a decent superhero film in an extended universe that feels tonally convoluted, but possibly its strongest entry. That's not to say it's perfect, there is dampness in the far corners of Atlantis. But ""my man"", what a ride! Set after the events of 'Justice League', Arthur must step forward to be king of Atlantis and stop his half-brother from creating a war with the surface world. There's a phrase that has been circulating within the inner workings of the Internet. ""In Wan we trust"". A director who singlehandedly modernised the horror genre, entered the 'Fast & Furious' to create its best entry and conceptualised 'Saw', one of the most renowned horror franchises of all time. He is what makes Aquaman work. He is what gives life to the seven seas. He is why he is often the secret weapon in franchises. He understands any genre that is given to him. This solo endeavour, that rarely references other DCEU films, conforms to the cheesiness and blockbusting entertainment of earlier successes. From cringe-inducing one liners (""Permission to come aboard?"") to humour that often falls flat (""I could've just peed on it""), it often seems like it sets itself up for failure. However, because of this it surprisingly gives charm to the film and personality to its characters. It's so light in tone, purposefully juxtaposing the darker narratives of other entries, that it feels fresher than freshwater. Wan's eye for visual spectacle and intrinsically immersive action proves that it's not trying to be the next 'The Dark Knight'. Grand in scope, yet a personal tale of leadership for Arthur that enables his character to develop from a careless brute to a genuine role of idolisation. Considering the 143 minute runtime, it was paced methodically. Never did I feel the need to look at my watch, a rare achievement for any lengthy blockbuster.<br/><br/>As the trailers suggest, the primary insight into Wan's ambitious creation is the use of visual effects. There were one or two scenes that physically gave me goosebumps. The design and architecture of Atlantis was awe-inspiring. Each building upholding a sense of modern personality, and each inhabitant spreading ancient history. Vivid neon colours invade your sight, as you sit back holding your breathe whilst being submerged into this otherworldly fantasy. With the help of Gregson-Williams' euphoric score, the world of Atlantis truly came to life. These visuals are then utilised during action sequences in order to stylise them. Wan tends to experiment with his camerawork (switching from POV to 360 rotational panning to ambitious one take shots) which invites you into the combat. Simple choreographed fights involving tridents soon escalate into kingdoms battling each other on giant crustaceans and hammerhead sharks. The range is splendid and maintains the entertainment. Momoa, Heard, Wilson and Kidman all getting involved within these sequences. The performances, for the most part, were good. Momoa is in his element and embracing every opportunity as the leading actor. Both his physicality and demeanour suit the role of Arthur Curry. Heard was also decent as Mera, the two interacting with each other often to create comedic moments. Although the end relationship is somewhat predictable, it was still pleasant to watch. Wilson also held his own (as always) as the primary antagonist. Kidman and Lundgren though were slightly dry and probably needed more time in the water.<br/><br/>There are however faults that makes this a wet affair occasionally. The screenplay needed more work and is the weakest aspect to the film. Often relying on exposition, it never truly embraces its characters and instead settles for scope rather than nuance. For example, the secondary antagonist Black Manta was horrifically underdeveloped and unfortunately felt like an afterthought. Only showing up during action sequences and nothing more. Even the Ocean Master himself wasn't particularly developed enough to make you understand his viewpoint (aside from humanity destroying its waters). Wan has so many ideas, so many locations that he wants to showcase, that the narrative occasionally feels like shallow set pieces rather than a deep story. The ""Ring of Fire"" challenge fight sequence does accentuate the often poor human CGI, turning a pivotal moment into more of a distraction. I also found the conclusion underwhelming and rushed, in a bid to open itself up to a sequel. Still, in Wan we trust and fortunately his trust was justified. Aquaman is a nautical adventure that is sure to reinvigorate the extended universe that crumbled before it."

"CANpatbuck3664","5","9","19","25 December 2018"," DC Takes a Step Back in AquaMEH
","When I talk about movies I didn't like, I like to start with the positives before I start complaining nonstop. I'll talk more about Jason's portrayal of Aquaman but the biggest thing Aquaman has going for it is his casting in the central role. He wills this movie past some of its worst moments. I liked the design of some of the creatures of the deep, the CGI is all over the place but there were moments in the movie that the look of Atlantis and the underwater kingdoms were pretty cool. The action set pieces also had their moments, there were some fleeting bits in the final fight that caught my attention. I also thought there were minor character turns that made the characters easier to relate to (the one that comes to mind was when Arthur and Orm were about to do battle in the Ring of Fire and Arthur mentions that all he wanted as a kid was to meet his half brother and tell him that he wasn't alone and that they could get through it together).<br/><br/>There aren't going to be many positives for the rest of this review. The first thing that I didn't like from Aquaman was how the movie expected you to be emotionally invested in things without any setup. So much of the dialogue (much of it coming from Mera played by Amber Heard) is just an exposition dump, the movie shows you very little but insists on describing everything. Orm wants a war with the surface people because of the damage they are doing to the ocean, maybe showing us some of the problems the surface people are causing would bring the audience around to seeing things from his point of view instead of some CGI flashes? Orm's goal is to bring most of the oceanic kingdoms together but they have deep seeded grudges against the Atlanteans, could we see some of the problematic backstory that caused the clans to break apart? Why should we be invested in these things when we were just introduced to them and have no context? Seeing some of that would have been better than the whole desert sequence which had nothing interesting except more terrible one-liners. Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is just a hired gun for the enemy when you boil it down, why do we need to spend so much time with him when you could cut him out of the movie completely? Lastly, why should we care about the budding romantic relationship between Arthur (Jason Momoa) and Mera when the characters have no emotional connection when she shows up and they haven't spent more than a couple of days together? I could keep going but the movie acts like we already have a deep connection to Arthur Currie and Atlantis but minus a few moments in Justice League, this is their introduction.<br/><br/>About halfway through Aquaman, I realized if the cast didn't include so many actors and actresses I liked, I really would have turned hard on this movie. Jason Momoa has a bunch of charisma, he's easy to like and that carries over into this movie. There are times where his enthusiasm is so infectious that I started to get distracted from how cringe-worthy his dialogue was. He can't save the movie with the terrible jokes and lines he has but he did what he could. I felt sorry for Amber Heard when I watched Aquaman. She seemed like she was one big break from hitting the big time for a while there (to reach the Jennifer Lawrence, Brie Larson or even Anne Hathaway level) and this still isn't the right vehicle. Just like Jason, she's saddled with bad dialogue and an uninteresting romantic subplot, but she gives it her all. I thought Patrick Wilson gave the most committed performance, he's a regular collaborator with James Wan and while he's far from a memorable villain, he really delivers his lines like he was reciting Shakespeare. He's the type of actor I like even when he's not in great stuff and that continues in Aquaman. Temuera Morrison was my next favourite character, the best parts of the movie are when he and Momoa are hanging out in the beginning and they really feel like they could be father and son or at minimum friends. Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe showed up for work but just went a little over the bare minimum when it comes to the energy in their performances. The most over-the-top acting comes from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta, I almost was laughing when he had his big dramatic moment early in the film. Manta is a hugely unnecessary character in this however, so I'll give him credit for doing the best job he could even if he was chewing the scenery.<br/><br/>I'm not a DC hater I really enjoyed Wonder Woman and I enjoyed Suicide Squad despite its peaks and vallies in quality. I also like BvS, it got better with the ultimate cut but its a mixed bag of a movie. I went into Aquaman with low expectations, but the decent Rotten Tomatoes score gave me hope. I don't think this movie was as all over the place as Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman. It stayed at one level consistently, but it was consistently mediocre or bad. The likeable cast couldn't save this and while I didn't outright hate it, between the terrible dialogue, the embarrassing score (covering Africa with Pitbull? Really?) and the script elements that feel way too familiar or were covered better by better movies (think about the similarities between the arcs of Atlanna and Janet Van Dyne in Ant-Man and the Wasp), this is a disappointment and when I left the theatre with my friend and we were laughing at the movie. This is a 5/10 and I feel like I'm being generous."

The humor is hit and miss.
The way the story is told is a bit too repetitive.
Some songs are jaw droppingly bad.
The villains too basic.<br/><br/>But the good is great:
The emotion works (barely, but it works).
The arcs of the characters feel totally earned.
Parts of the score are actually pretty awesome.
The villains while basic, help to force our protagonist to become the hero and define him.

"rolando19552001","10","10","22","13 December 2018"," Aquaman
","Aquaman<br/><br/>This film is the most ambitious comic book film ever. James Wan manages to create a make believe world as implausible as it may seems at first underwater, the director makes it a make believe world. James Wan creates a make believe world as the likes of Pandora like James Cameron, also in the film Tron Legacy, James Wan creates a world that is fictional but like a magic wand the film Aquaman and its world makes the film a reality that you heavily invest yourself in. Momoa as the protagonist makes himself totally vulnerable as a man of two worlds, one the surface world and the other Atlanteans. The story of Aquaman or Arthur Curry begins with the coming of the queen Atlanna to escape an arranged marriage and the father of Arthur helps her in her vulnerable moment and a love story begins and there is a fruit of that love in Aquaman, a child of two worlds who is very reluctant to believe in the hype that he a chosen king like Mera played by Amber Heard with a heroine in her own right and fights as well as Momoa´s Aquaman, many times Mera saves Aquaman and the story is thus richer.
The main plot is that Aquaman´s younger, baby brother the always charismatic and suave Patrick Wilson wants to wage war against the surface world and needs four of the seven oceans´ kingdoms to wage the war. Mera´s father is one king that supports Orm, Patrick Wilson. Orm tries to get at least the four kingdoms needed to make his dream war true and almost manages to do this until the true king cometh.
In one of the side stories that is emotional invested Aquaman is asked by a pirate who begs Aquaman to save his father´s life, but Aquaman responds without a soul that the ocean´s rage and justice is the pirate´s justice. The son of the dead father becomes a villain of his own who had a secret accord with Atlantean king Orm who gives him secret tech to enhanced himself as the pirate becomes Black Manta, a villain full of hatred against Aquaman and in one of the sequences in Sicily, Italy, the about five minutes to ten minutes through the walls, roofs escapade of Mera and Aquaman against Black Manta is a very good scene.
Aquaman is a combination of the best movies of their respective genders, Indiana Jones in the archeological element done great by Dafoe who played an adviser who trains young Arthur and does indeed believe the coming of the true king, Aquaman himself. The visuals and the technology of Tron Legacy comes to mind, the ever made make believe world of Avatar and the metaphors of Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. Momoa makes a great work of Aquaman as a broken man who does not have faith or belief or hope in himself but many do believe in him like his love interest in Mera who always support him even if she makes many jokes on Aquaman´s expense, also Dafoe as the adviser and Nicole Kidman´s Atlanna and his father Senior Curry. Many believe in the great destiny of the true king Aquaman and finally when the moment of coronation happens, here cometh the great Atlan king remade, King Arthur Curry, Aquaman himself."

","This is a really entertaining movie. It has some fun action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and two likable main characters. That's about it. Aside from those positives this movie is still very flawed. It has a weak villian that feels to much like Loki from the first Thor film(you know, the movie before he became an interesting character) the romance is incredibly cliched, the plot is all over the place, some of the acting(mostly during the flashbacks) is laughably bad, and most of the creature effects really aren't anything to go crazy over. I would say that the effects are much better than all the other recent DC films, but the compitition between those two is non-existent because the effects in those movies have been awful.
Now don't get me wrong, this movie is a blast, and that's what I want from a superhero movie, but the superhero movies I love give me more than just fun, they give me great characters, great effects, and even some solid stories. Personally, I didn't feel the movie gave me any of that. But hey, that's just my opinion. I would still recommend seeing this in theaters. I definitely have problems with it, but that doesn't mean I dislike it. I had a fun time seeing it and was never bored. That's something for DC I guess."

The love story didn't work for me they didn't seem compatible.
Mamoa is a cracking guy but I didn't feel he was acting here just being himself he is just him in real life and his acting life.
Overall it was watchable but not memorable I think they need to start interacting super heroes together separate to justice league to fill out a story.
If you like super heroes watch it. If your not in to heroes watch something else."

Just as you're starting to escape into this reality, something will happen that makes this movie feel like the worst spoof film made. (Naming the films they spoof will one day be a great drinking game). I wanted so badly for this movie to be fantastic - but other than a few glimpses of what it could have been, it's not even close.<br/><br/>The only real way to appropriately describe this movie is like a restaurant wanting to make a signature dish and deciding that because people like burgers, steaks, pasta and pizza, oh and who doesn't love milkshakes; so for their signature dish they decide just to mix all these elements together and throw them in a blender.<br/><br/>I really wanted this movie to be the step that DC needed to launch their cinematic universe and properly showcase their catalogue of characters, unfortunately it looks like my DC universe ended with the Dark Knight Rises."

The costumes also reminded me of the Power Rangers and I'm not sure if they were trying to make Amber Heard look like Ariel from the Little Mermaid but her wig looked like it came from Party City! It was horrid! I thought with James Wan's awesome directing that this would be great but honestly I think he needs to just continue doing horror films.

Also, my 5yr old really enjoyed seeing all of the sea life visuals.

The storyline, acting, effects, all of it, great.
Jason Mamoa did a great job at playing the aquatic, funny hero. Other acting was great, especially Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren. Part of the amazing pieces of this film was how you saw what every party, or group, was fighting for. You saw Orin forming the seven kingdoms together to cause war among the land. You saw Black Mantis seeking revenge for his father. And of course, there was Arthur seeking the Trident. And I'll say this once more, the visual effects made it all the more stunning. I feel like a good behind plot that was concluded at the end of the film was that they were not separate, and that led to the Atlanteans discovering that the land and sea were indeed not separate, and Atlantis was one. Good movie, I recommend seeing it."

"sergei-229-442306","9","5","9","19 December 2018"," DCEU is dead. Long live DCEU!
","Aquaman delivers the final blow to ""DCEU is dead after Zack Snyder departure"" buzz - DC Cinematic Universe is pretty much alive, at least, underwater. James Wan successfully competes with Snyder's visuals, but without offering questionable plot twists and ""Oh, Martha!"" scenes. Yep, main plot is pretty much the same as Black Panter and dozens of others about outlaw king must accept his role as a real KING with a help of a bunch of friends. Yes. even evil brother is here, a hidden, but powerful contry (or countries) and old tradition of hand-to-hand combat as a political argument.<br/><br/>So why ""Auquaman"" makes ""Black Panther"" look pale? Answer is pretty simple - director & screenwriters successfully adapted character's canon without disturbing ""modern approaches"". Classic suits, classic names, minor race changes Yes, Orm in the movie looks way much like blonde Aquaman in comics, but it was not Wan's descision to hire Momoa as a title hero.<br/><br/>We see a very classy old-school adventure, Wan even cited Inidiana Jones as a reference - and, yep, spitit of Indiana is indeed here in a good way.<br/><br/>Acting is solid, without spectactular perfomances, but Patrick Wilson can be names as the most remarkable actor from enseble. His villain delivers belivable emotions and motivation is not so dumb, as like Thanos, for e.g. under similar circumstances.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa plays a cool biker-outlaw-style guy, the only problem with him - he cannot act really good, there is a big potential, but he definitely needs to improve. Momoa made his comeback in smal roles (like Drogo). but he is not a leading man material (see his Conan, for e.g.). With Momoa, directors are facing the similar problem as with Gal Gadot: a beatutiful human being, looks incredible on posters, but impression fades once they try to act. Wonder Woman was saved by Chris Pine & his team - they delivered most of fun, but ""Aquaman"" was not able to offer something like that. Amber Heard is a bad actress, her red wig looked really cheap, zero chemistry between Mera and Arthur - nuff said. Love part of the story is a hit-and-miss, without a question.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is ok, but Aquaman really, really delivers the exceptional underwater wold. It looks incredibly amazing, with love & care, with many details for comic geeks. A spectacular journey, with a secondary villain for sequel - yep, Black Mantha should really shine, his motivation is pretty understandable and actor definitely needs more screen time.<br/><br/>WB, You should negotiate with James Wan immidiately. You know, right now You have Your own Lucas/Cameron - class director."

"kumingz","10","5","9","19 December 2018"," Aquaman RULES!
","I saw a preview screening in Florida- wow loved it.
Words: beautiful to look at (visually kind of reminds me of 'Tron Legacy' but underwater), funny/fun/entertaining, cool looking characters/costumes, great art direction, cool score that reminds me of Vangelis' Bladerunner.
I'm a fan of all comic book movies but here is my take:
Marvel movies are ""safe"". They are entertaining but reminiscent of USA Network shows like Burn Notice (there are fights/weapons/guns/explosions- yet no blood/death/bad language) to me there isn't much to be surprised about yet great to watch.
DC movies are more ""crazy"" - almost like AMC network shows like Breaking Bad/Walking Dead (WITH some gore/blood/death/sexuality & nudity/foul language/etc.)
Aquaman is almost a bridge between both worlds Marvel/DC.
That being said, I LOVED Aquaman - it's my favorite comic book movie to date.
I'm in my mid-30's and I remember reading the character's comics/cartoons a little as a kid - I had the Super Friends/Super Powers(?) toys and the producers got the character perfect for current pop culture here (Jason Momoa is an actor that you'll like immediately on impact- like when I was a kid watching Schwarzenegger flicks).
The only annoying thing about this movie was the people in the theater around me kept gasping and getting very excited (in a good way) at the action/scale of what was exhilarating them -it was distracting and this movie pulls you in/engages you.
It's the first time in a long time that I remember saying to myself ""I really don't want this to end!""
That's how much I enjoyed Aquaman."

Orm is that kind of villain, that you want to hate, but you just can't, he is a major badass and you can see that shred of goodness in him. Supporting villain who completely takes the screen in every scene he is in, Black Manta sets the foundation for his very bright future in this franchise, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II truly does justice to the character. Amber Heard does very well as Mera, you can really see that chemistry between her and Momoa, which results in a great relationship on screen. Willem Dafoe makes a surprisingly good Vulko and Dolph Lundgren is playing a typical Dolph Lundgren character, and of course, he does it just right. Nicole Kidman was good, but missed something, the scenes seemed a little bit too much, or other times too little, not that she didn't do a good job, but the rest of the cast did brilliant, so at least to me, she was a little bit underwhelming. Momoa is definitely the man for the role, he plays Aquaman that you wouldn't want to mess with, but also the one who you'd share a drink with. Throughout the film he transforms, and shows us that he can be much more than a tough, beer loving dude. Can't give it a perfect 10 because of some cheesy scenes , which were put just for the sakes of humor, but even those scenes seem to fill the movie in a good way, so you don't feel bored for a single moment. In the end it's a really fun ride, that will take you through an amazing world, with astonishing visuals, and a great story to hear. The movie sets up the stage for the next instalment in a great way, and takes Arthur to a whole new level, which will be interesting to see in next JL movie."

I'm a big fan of Batman, and he was suck at the Justice League, I bullied by Marvel Fans (my friends) around me because Justice League went gross and I told them ""Okay, let's make a deal, Aquaman will be the BEST than Black Panther. If Aquaman went gross I'll pay your ticket but if you hyped/surprised/amazed after seeing Aquaman, you'll pay me for another round of Aquaman but in IMAX 3D and buy me a Full Lunch after seeing Aquaman."" and I did it. My friend (who bullied me after Justice League), he surprised when he was diving to Atlantis for the first time (my friend is a total MCU Fan, this is the first time he watched DC Movies), his face was WOW-ed, he told me that he HYPED, he told me that Atlantis is better than W*k*nd*. And he lost the deal.<br/><br/>James Wan was right. See AQUAMAN on the biggest screen YOU can. It will not disappoint you, literally, not as disappointing as Justice League.<br/><br/>Thank YOU, James Wan. I'm gonna be waiting for your Sequel of Aquaman.

"treborquest","7","8","17","13 December 2018"," It is ok, long and very kitsch, but ok
","I don't really understand why so many people seem to look at this film as if it's god's gift to mankind. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, it was ok, quite entertaining, had some fun bits and nice action. But it was like 20 minutes too long, most of the time I thought that it couldn't be more over the top, until the next scene actually was more over the top and the CGI sucks. on top of that the acting wasn't all that great at some times and horror of all horrors, Nicole Kidman can't move her face anymore.
Maybe it's the best DC films since 10 years for some, ok, but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that. be objective, because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars. it absolutely can't live up to Black Panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie. While watching this, I was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop Avatar and yet another 10+ years for the sequels. Because the time and money went to good CGI. This was straight out of a cheap bin full of unicornfarts dipped in care bear rainbows. Enjoy the movie for what it is, because it is enjoyable, but lets not go over the top with the ratings. the movie is over the top enough by itself."

I would've given it a 10 but it has it's flaws from time to time, but for a DC Movie? it's a 10 for sure!<br/><br/>I loved the Visuals, after seeing so many movies with fights on Earth or in Space it feels refreshing (no pun intended) to see a movie underwater, as a big sucker for Atlantis Stories and the idea of a Underwater Civilisation I am glad I got to see it on release date in the UK, the battles and plot were pretty good for a DC movie, again I loved Wonder Women compared to previous DC movies (Excluding the Dark Knight Trilogy as I do not consider that the same as the Cinematic Universe they created after) this is a HUGE upgrade, some people said it was funny like Thor Ragnarok from Marvel, I agree, but my oh my was the Cinematic on point, this is probably the most Marvel while still being DC that I can imagine DC going, and that is great, really hope to see more from the people involved in this Movie, as they did a great job! The villains put the Justice League and Suicide Squad to shame, seriously, I can't believe it, they actually finally got proper villains in a DC MOVIE!<br/><br/>As I said, No spoiling the movie, so I am just going to end my review here, GO WATCH IT NOW!"

","Aquaman is not the easiest character to adapt to the big screen, but this movie does almost everything right! It's comic accurate enough and not afraid to look weird or silly.. and it does also bring it's own updated concepts and ideas in the right places. The hero is likeable(a fleshed out version of ""Aquabro"" from Justice League is actually a damn cool guy) and has a definite arc during the movie where he grows and changes, in fact most of the characters do! The villains are believable(one is maybe a bit cliche but it's that kind of story) and have reasons for their actions besides just having cool powers/designs! Speaking of design.. the visual styles and design choices for characters, creatures and places are amazing. It's a joy to journey from one awesome looking place to another in this movie, and while it's a 2hr 23 min movie it never drags or feels long, it's a fast paced, action packed ride from start to finish. It does everything a comic book movie should with style. Definitely recommended!"

Unfortunately, the bloated, waterlogged film is loaded with crummy CGI, cheesy costumes, and groaner dialogue delivered by actors who are too good to traffic in such nonsense.

Amber Heard , Nicole kidman and Jason Mamoa were great the rest of the characters frankly boring and had no meat to eat on the barebones plot .

"theshadow1963","9","6","12","24 December 2018"," Blows Black Panther out of the water!
","When it comes to movies about superhero kings, forget Wakanda. Atlantis is the place to be. Aquaman has a richly-realized superhero fantasy world build from the ground up and full of life.
It's the story of Arthur Curry, a child of two worlds who must make peace between them when his evil half-brother seeks war. Long derided by folks unfamiliar with the comics as ""the guy whose superpower is talking to fish"", this movie should show the non-fans what comic fans have always known: that Aquaman is a certified badass.
Comparisons with Black Panther are inevitable: both are movies about superheroes who are the hereditary kings of hidden, super-advanced societies. But Aquaman is superior to Black Panther in every way. Atlantis, unlike Wakanda, is a true ""lost world"", a place hidden from outsiders by isolation, not politics. And Arthur Curry is a much more engaging hero than T'Challa. Whereas Black Panther and his sister are confident to the point of being insufferably smug and unshakably convinced of their own moral superiority, The Aquaman (like The Batman, he is no longer referred to as just Aquaman, he's THE Aquaman, now!) is conflicted and full of doubts. For all of his manly swagger, he knows it takes more to be a king than just inheriting a title, and his story is about his journey to become king. His story also tells us that there is more to him that just a title. As his mother says, ""King fights for their country. You fight for everyone."" Take, that, T'Challa!.
The special effects are top-notch. Atlantis is not merely rendered as a place, we get tantalizing glimpses of its ecosystem, with Atlanteans using trained sharks, whales, hippocampi (giant seahorses) and even Mosasaurs (which is not the only thing about this movie that will invoke Jurassic Park). There's also a sea monster that talks with the voice of Julie Andrews (I'm not making this up.).
As per any superhero origin story, this film introduces major members of the hero's Rogues' Gallery. In this case, Orm, the Ocean Master who is Aquaman's evil half-brother, and Black Manta, DC Comics' first major black supervillain.
Aside from a quick reference to Arthur's role in defeating Steppenwolf in Justice League, there are no other references to the overall continuity of the DCEU, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10/10 rating. Since it takes place after the formation of the League, it would have been a nice touch to mention that Arthur and Mera were getting a little financial help from Bruce Wayne while trekking across Africa and the Mediterranean, instead of wondering how they got from the middle of the Sahara to Sicily. It also precludes that the Altanteans' greatest weakness in the comics - they can only survive out of the water for brief periods of time before risking death from dehydration - doesn't apply to Atlanteans of royal blood, like Arthur and Mera.
But small issues aside, Aquaman proves that Wonder Woman wasn't a fluke, and that Warner Brothers can produce superhero films on a par with the best of what Marvel can offer."
"jherrick-6-991336","6","6","12","24 December 2018"," Visually striking, but not a good script
","Sigh. Another swing and a miss for DC.<br/><br/>It was the weirdest experience. The movie started out so well. For literally the first 45-60 minutes, I was really enjoying myself. Then things got a little silly... then more silly... then more silly... then downright ridiculous. I realize this is a comic book movie, but still. Maybe Marvel has set my standards too high.<br/><br/>It's not like the movie is a complete disaster. The world building and production design are downright amazing. This has got to be one of the most visually striking films I've ever seen, and that's saying something in today's day and age.<br/><br/>The problem is the script. The premise is great: Arthur must find the magic trident to become king of Atlantis and save the world. Classic comic book/architypal awesomeness. Where things get bad is in the execution. Bad dialogue. Bad acting. Over-the-top and unnecessary additions to the plot. Jokes that don't work... at all.<br/><br/>I kind of felt like the pendulum has swung too far the other way for DC right now. Man Of Steel and Batman Vs Superman were criticised for being too dark and moody. This one is too silly and childish. Poor DC just can't seem to get the formula right.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it wasn't realized."

","Loved the underwater world they created for this film. Gorgeous diverse CGI environments. Strong story line rich in mythology and magic. Jason Momoa engages the audience with a wide range of emotions: heroic, belligerent, joyful, grieving, humble, confident, unsure.... emotions we all deal with. The supporting actors I loved especially Amber Heard (Mera) who's sense of right forces her to deal with a complex situation. Arthur's (Aquaman) parents are everything you could want from a human dad (Temuera Morrison) and a superhuman mom (Nichole Kidman). Definitely don't miss this one!"

"rgkarim","8","6","12","16 December 2018"," Aquamantastic! Swimming In With Lots of Visuals, Story, and Action. The Right Direction For DCEU
","In the realm of comic book and superhero movies, DC once sat atop the throne as the champion of the real life, action films about our favorite paper bound heroes. As Marvel studios fell into stride though and secured it's regime, DC has struggled to find the same quality in its work for one reason or another. Despite whatever source of struggles, DC has been limping along from film to film, only shining once with Wonder Woman last year that renewed life. Yet, coming to shore this holiday season, is another beacon of hope in the form of Jason Momoa as the champion of Atlantis Aquaman. With the coming tide of movies, can this film restore faith in the franchise , or does it fall short once more of the glory of superhero films. Robbie K here with a week advanced screening of Aquaman to give his thoughts. Let's get started:<br/><br/>Movie: Aquaman 2018<br/><br/>Director:
James Wan
Writers:
David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (screenplay by), Will Beall (screenplay by)
Stars:
Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe<br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>Acting: Momoa's talents as the gruff warrior continue to shine through, only this time much more in your face. It works well, brings the heart of the film in all it's wonder and glory, and really makes for an entertaining hero to watch. As the character develops, Momoa is able to go with it and it works quite well to entertain the masses, plus his abs didn't hurt as the women in my showing were swooning. His sassy partner in crime, Heard did a wonderful job stepping up into the major role, bringing sass, class, and looks that felt in tone with the movie and a great opposite to Momoa's rantings, and again the looks didn't hurt either. The rest of the cast did extraordinary as well, Dafoe's prowess as the vizier and mentor was like something out of a Shakespearean play. Nichole Kidman's performance held regality and love for the time she was in. Patrick Wilson did his job as the grandiose king, extreme in direction, but having enough salt to back up his madness.<br/><br/>The Visuals: Leave it to Wan to come up with his own version of Atlantis and bring with it the same flair that he leaves with his other works. The studio's design of the underwater kingdom is solid, a blend of technology, magic, and biology that may seem a bit stereotypical, but captures the prowess of the mighty ancient realm. Past the city itself, the characters have a unique and fantastic design to themselves as each kingdom gets its own look to show a common origin, but still give their evolution different. Other costumes for the warriors had their own edge to it, and I personally liked Mera's costume feeling it was on point compared to her current modern-day image. And when it came to battle scenes, the effects worked quite well given Wan's flashy approach to his films. It feels like a comic book world brought to life and accomplishes the immersion into the nerd culture we love so much.
The Story: It's the classic Aquaman story that we've come to know, a greedy kingdom filled with headstrong rulers whose focus on the one approach drives their goals, while the other tries to find a way to his own identity. For the most part it works, and this Aquaman has enough features of his comic realm to appease most fans with the introduction of Black Manta, the family dynamics that are almost as warped as Game of Thrones, and the developing relationships Arthur has itself. What I liked the most was that even though it is part of a bigger universe, this film was able to tell its own story and stand alone, without relying too much on the other films that came before it. Again it's predictable and clichÃ©, but the tale should be enough to rope people in regardless of what arc you enjoy the most.<br/><br/>The Action: You saw it in the films and you know this is meant to be one for the big screen before I even wrote these words. Aquaman is all about the fights and trying to imbue it with some diversity to break away from the other films. It accomplished the goal of bringing a variety of styles to the mix that feels part Fast and Furious, Part Game Of Thrones, and Part DC meeting kung Fu. Special effects lit up the theater in a thunderous display of sound editing that had the theater rumbling like an earthquake. I was drawn into most of the battles, and felt that on some of them they hit the target in the center to really have people jumping in their seats. As such, despite the nearly 2.5 hour run time, there is so much action keeping it moving you won't feel to bogged down by the time constraint.<br/><br/>
DISLIKES:<br/><br/>The Episodic presentation: Wan jammed a lot of things into this film, and while I appreciated the completeness, I felt the movie was a little too episodic for me at points. Transitions between clues were a little too fast for me, relationships progressing a little conveniently and quickly for my tasted to get the realistic factor. While complete overall, it lacks the polish of story that Wonder Woman held and I think it was because of the action focus of this movie (which I do like, but still do appreciate good storytelling).<br/><br/>Action Scenes needing more depth: Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the action component as mentioned above, however, I also appreciate action scenes that are longer, more developed than what we got. Much of Wan's vision was very cut and dry 5-minute sequences that were impressive, but short lived, or sometimes more running than actual combat. While I loved a few of the battles that really captured the spirit of the combat, others felt too short lived. I agree with some fellow colleagues that there was more choreography needed, but perhaps giving a little more integration could have made these scenes shine for me.<br/><br/>CGI Overuse: We know these movies are all about CGI making imagination come to life, but what we also know is the importance of balance and not diving too far into the realm of artificial imagery. Aquaman's visuals were a little heavier than most, like George Lucas in the prequels, the reliance on CGI made for some cheesier moments than I think intended, where some writing lapses helped amplify the artificial feeling to it. Like the end fight of Wonder Woman, the effects didn't quite add up to the picture I had in mind, and when you get to how fast they skimmed over some of the battles, it left me feeling I wanted a little more though to the battles at hand.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>I could go on for hours about this, but let's wrap this up. Aquaman is definitely one of the better installments for this reviewer, finally getting out of the convoluted, too focused on darker themes that the DC universe went to and instead getting back to the basics of the superhero film. It is a visually packed joy ride made for the theaters, as this action-packed journey is all about showing off the technological, imagination driven ride Wan is famous for. I had fun in this movie and enjoyed the complete tale, despite how episodic the presentation felt. In addition, the action was very fun, but I wanted a little more coordination and investment to the sequences, so quality vs. quantity. Aquaman has bounced back to the superhero movie quite well, and with a little more balance, it may finally reach the intended levels they set out for long ago. Definitely worth a trip to the theater my friends, and potentially the biggest holiday bash of the bunch.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"

"NightChild-792-522294","10","6","12","16 December 2018"," King of DCEU
","I'll start by saying please ignore any review that is comparing Marvel movies or even mentions them. Disney couldn't hold a candle to this film and not one Marvel movie has the business or respect to be compared to Aquaman. Not one!<br/><br/>Aquaman was outstanding! It had a great plot, great villains, awesome fight scenes and action, romance, comedy, and it was powerful. Back in the day, people would laugh at Aquaman and call him the most worthless hero. Ignorant is bliss. Those people were ignorant and I'm getting all the bliss laughing here because the joke was and still is on them. The King of Atlantis and one of the co-founders of the Justice League really took off with the visual effects and how awesome it was to see a movie take place underwater. You get to see Arthur's superpowers early on in the film so you know what Aquaman is made of and just how durable the King really is. I do hope these ""critics"" don't get paid to write reviews, because their reviews are very biased, opinionated (obviously), highly arguable, and even some are incorrect. The movie had an outstanding cast and is one for the whole family to see again and again. I believe Rotten Tomatoes gave Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse a 100 and yet, only gave Aquaman like a 70? Aquaman was a WAY better movie in every way. So, that is one example and reason why I urge EVERYONE to go see the movie and judge for yourself...and why I believe Disney/Marvel probably ghost owns RT.<br/><br/>DC has put out great movies like V for Vendetta, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman (extended cut), Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman. All within the same Universe excluding V for Vendetta, but the films, nonetheless were REALLY, REALLY good. Yes, DC is darker and that's good. They are not Disney and I like that they don't pretend to be.<br/><br/>10/10 Final Score"

","What a comeback for the DCEU. This movie is absolutely stunning in almost every aspect. I was in awe with every sequence. Momoa and Herd are great as the lead characters( Mera's powers are so well realized!). Patrick Wilson as Oceanmaster was a wonderful villain.

"ramvsree","10","6","12","14 December 2018"," Finally! DC proves it's mettle with a badass flick that won't be forgotten anytime soon.
","Aquaman! A freakishly beautiful telling of a simple tale. The rightful heir must fight off his half brother to take his rightful place in the throne. What the film lacks in terms of complex plotline, it lavishly makes up for in cinematography, stunt choreography, visual effects and pretty much every other department.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is a spot-on choice for Aquaman/Arthur Curry and he carries the role on his strong shoulders with swagger and panache. He oozes charisma in every scene and the scene in which he comes out armor clad for the final fight scene gave me chills.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend to go and watch the movie in theatres. DCEU finally gets it right!"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","6","12","14 December 2018"," The most visually stunning DCEU film.
","Aquaman tells the story of Arthur Curry/Aquaman(Jason Momoa), after the events of Justice League(2017). Arthur learns that he is next in line, to rule the oceanic kingdom of Atlantis. Arthur must become king & be a saviour to the world.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a fantastic movie. Director James Wan has given us an immersive world, that is an absolute treat for the eyes. What works in this film's favour is that, it is aware of its outlandish concept & embraces it wholeheartedly. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humour adds to the entertainment quotient of the film. The visual effects are mind-blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. Jason Momoa is spectacular as Arthur. Momoa brings that much needed swag to his role. Amber Heard is outstanding as Mera. Willem Dafoe is great as Vulko. Patrick Wilson is brilliant as King Orm. Nicole Kidman is amazing as Atlanna. Dolph Lundgren is good as King Nereus. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is superb as Manta. Temuera Morrison is awesome as Tom Curry. The supporting cast is impressive. Aquaman is a must watch not just for DCEU fans but, for superhero movie fans. Arguably, it is my favourite DCEU film. Dive in!"
"The_Sonuverse","9","6","12","14 December 2018"," Superhero movies have never been this good
","So what do you know about any superhero movie? It has good the origin story, a conflict and resolution. but Not this one, The movie starts with the pre-origin of Arthur Curry (loosely based on New 52 comics) when his mother Queen Atlanna meets a surface dweller Thomas ""Tom"" Curry, a light house keeper. She spends about 2 years with him and has a baby named after an hurricane ""Arthur Curry"" later to be known as Aquaman. Before you even dwell into the aquaman/arthur curry's story line you come to see a beautiful lovestory between the parents. and eventually same continues between Mera and Arthur.<br/><br/>This wasn't just an other superhero/comic book movie, this had all elements of surprises with various kingdoms of the sea (Trench & brine) The emotional development of characters like Thomas, Atlanna, Manta/BlackManta and even our very own Patrick Wilson's King Orm. He isn't a regular villain who wants to take over the world, he has a right agenda and equally justified reason to hate surface dwellers, its just his way of doing this isn't politically correct though.<br/><br/>The editing/Narration of the film takes you places, literally. I love how transitions are shown through Water/Sun and those time jumps.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this, but to sum it all up.... I felt like a child while watching this movie. I was so fascinated looking at all the visuals, characters and the beautifully narrated story-line.<br/><br/>PS: Watch out for BlackManta and Shin ;)"

","I always have been a fan of Justice League. But I wasn't very happy with the Movie we receive last time. Was not bad but definitely we expect more. And this movie is precisely that. It gives all what we were waiting in previous DC movies. The storyline is nice and have a faster pace that made the movie everything but boring. Has very nice visuals to the point that Avatar need to bring something very stunning to surpass these water scenarios. There are some very nice details in the lights the shoots and the general mood of the movie. Is lighter than previous DCEU but not shallow. The main characters the villains, the weapons the rides all of them are ensembled so nicely that is very enjoyable. And of course that red hair ... Amber looks sooo gorgeous in this movie that it almost make you feel sorry for Johnny Deep. CGI on faces are remarkable to the point you can't decide which one is more beautiful if the Nicole Kidman in this movie or the Nicole Kidman of Days of Thunder. I really think Wan has the Midas touch for action movies and this one is no exception. Totally recommended. And most important I believe this will give a good push to next installments as apparently DC found the formula. Finally.
My grade will be 8.5/10"
"man14","8","6","12","14 December 2018"," The Best DCEU Movie Ever!
","This film is simply amazing. I absolutely loved it! The story is great, even if it's nothing new. The characters are very well writen, they all go through complex story archs and are not the same by the time the movie ends. The actors are all great - even Amber Heard, who is not the best actor in the world (far from it) comes off as a believable and likable character (and she looks stunning in that outfit!) -, specially Jason Momoa who absolutely rocks as Aquaman. I mean, the man was born to play this role, it's that simple. The visuals are amazing, the CGI is virtualy flawless, the action scenes are relentless and perfectly staged, the humor is perfectly timed to release the stress from the action scenes without feeling forced. What more can I say? It's the best film in the DCEU, pure and simple, followed very, very closely by Wonder Woman, and it rivals anything Marvel has ever made. Let's hope WB/DC have learned their lesson and hire James Wan to reboot Superman - now that would be awsome!"

From the acting to the music, CGI, everything is top notch. Jason Momoa is not playing Aquaman, he IS Aquaman! Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman and the rest are amazing in their roles too. But honestly, Jason Momoa couldn't be the more perfect Aquaman. CGI is honestly breathtaking. I have never seen such good CGI. The music fits perfectly in every scene, and is badass in some moments, that you can't contain yourself from excitement. This movie and Wonder woman have saved DCEU.

This is the most ambitious superhero movie ever and then goes on to deliver the most breathtaking scenes ever. The main characters Arthur and Mera are developed well. You can feel the emotion from Arthur in each and every moment. Mera, she is strong and passionate with Arthur and Mera drives the movie .
James Wan, thank you. Some of the camera work is like sitting on a roller coaster ride. Just 'Bad ass'.
Don't listen to people comparing to Thor or Black Panther, those movies were passive and lacked heart. This movie hits the right note but more importantly it has heart.<br/><br/>Masterfully excuted ride only to be enjoyed on the big screen."

It won't be wrong to say except for the Thanos saga this movie even takes the fight to MCU.
It has a scenic IMAX 3D experience. Treat to your eyes, good VFX and the icing on cake is the plot.
It has a plot, a sub plot and a sub plot.
The director has done well to bundle it together and give us a proper ending and don't keep loose ends.
A must watch in IMAX and at last something for hardcore DC fans to win an argument with MCU fan

"cinemawithcj","8","6","12","12 December 2018"," Aquaman - Cinema with CJ Review
","Aquaman is the Nicholas Cage of superhero movies. Wild, unpredictable, off-beat, all over the board, crazy, funny, entertaining, and you'll never really know if it's bad or good.<br/><br/>If anything, Aquaman is a gift. If this wasn't a year with a great line-up of superhero movies, this would be the best superhero movie of the year, and not by default.<br/><br/>It seems that every Worlds of DC movie not involving Batman or Superman (tragically) has something great about them. Not perfect, but great.<br/><br/>Aquaman feels like everyone was just given free reign to do what they want, so they just made it the most insane concept ever. At the base of it it's the usual hero's journey, but it's one that on the surface has you jetsetting under and over the sea, Aquaman punctuated by guitar riffs, one cartoonish pirate villain who customises a suit given to him by a secret underwater race in order to stop the true king of Atlantis from taking the throne from his half brother therefore putting a stop to a war against sea and land, a sea creature voiced by Julie Andrews, and a cover of ""Africa"" by Toto.<br/><br/>It's something saying that the soundtrack is more diverse and more fun than the work of Hans Zimmer, or Junkie XL, but it is. Whether it's a cool Aquaman theming, or the left-field choice in covers, or the neon-fuelled Atlantean City music, all the choices are out there and work, which is the lifeblood of all of this movie.<br/><br/>Given the reigns to James Wan was the best idea. Wan, probably always more well known for this horror work at the time of writing this, also gave the world Furious 7, the first time the seventh film of a franchise is seen as second best/the best. Like that movie, Wan takes everything up multiple notches, crafting an utterly cartoonish and more accurately, utterly comic book feeling movie.<br/><br/>The colours of this movie leap out of you just like the colours would leap off the page. We're not working with darkness and shadow, we're not dark and gritty, and the more we strive away from that in superhero cinema the better.<br/><br/>Aquaman is fun. Plain and simple. It is utterly crazy (it seems to be the season for crazy given my last two reviews) and it embraces it so strongly. It knows just how ridiculous it is.<br/><br/>The entire cast bring this movie alive, but goddamn does Jason Mamoa lean perfectly into his characterisation here. It's the surfer dude Aquaman you've seen before, but here it works perfectly for the tone.<br/><br/>Clearly everyone has realised that if Aquaman was gonna have a film, he'd have the potential ridicule aimed right at him if it was attempted to be made seriously. Pop culture has filled the world with Aquaman jokes, but by the time you even get to Aquaman getting a version of his iconic costume, the laughs aren't in ridicule, it's in the ridiculous of the world and being baffled of actually liking and enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>This film is going to be divisive. Not in a critical way, not in an offensive way, but in the admission to whether you actually had as much fun as I did with this movie.<br/><br/>It's got its flaws. I wish there was more Black Manta, I wish the film was shorter, despite my fun and enjoyment, I wish there was more bonkers sea war stuff, I wish the 80s adventure peppered with romance sequence carried through a bit longer, I wish for all of DC to embrace this tone. It's not Marvel Imitation Syndrome, it's going in the ridiculous comic direction that's just fun and over the top and true to the larger than life superhumans of the DC Universe.<br/><br/>It's hard not to keep coming back and saying that Aquaman is such an enjoyable and confounding-ly weird but great time at the movies. It should have failed on every level, and it's potentially not going to be a financial or critical hit, but really, this is another slice of how these movies should be. Shazam! looks to be in the same direction, so I'm down. I am legitimately excited to see what else comes in this new world of the DC Universe.<br/><br/>And you'd think that of all things, Aquaman would be the least likely place I would have thought that.<br/><br/>A controversial, in most eyes barely scrapes if at all,<br/><br/>8/10 Stars."

To think how most of DCEU's movies had been anything other than a disappointment these days, it's only normal when I came to the cinema without any expectation whatsoever. And damn it! How wrong I was! Turns out, It was anything but a disappointment! Although some of the scenes were too cheesy for my preference, and some were kinda boring for me, It didn't overshadow my amazement towards this particular movie. I don't know if it's just my bad sense of humor, but Jason Mamoa succeeded in making me laugh with some of his supposedly unfunny, and corny jokes. Overall, it was an overwhelming surprise coming from DC!"

","First of all anyone who's fan of comic book heroes knows that Marvel, Dc, Dark horse etc. Have there own distinguish story telling.
With that in mind don't pay attention to any 'critic' who compares this movies. Especially that family comedy movies Disney creates using the Marvel logo!
Now, Aquaman is a fresh take on a heroe that's been around for so many years that became kind of a parody.
James wan and the crew created a breathtaking word of Atlantis!
Full of mythological creatures!
If you want to see something fresh and new action packed full of emotion movie then Aquaman is the movie you should go see this Christmas!
I won't spoil the movie.

","If I am being honest, I heavily dislike CGI, superheroes, and pretty much any mainstream films that are trying to be the blockbuster of the year. Well, Aquaman features really fake CGI, more annoying superheroes, and fails at being a blockbuster for me because I was bored, uninterested, and kind of disappointed half of the time.<br/><br/>Aquaman is such an uninteresting character who is given no character development. Every other character does not matter because I could not even remember their names, which heavily implies that the writing was just awful. The CGI took me out of the movie so much, that I felt no spectacle at all, but I felt like I was watching humans stand in front of a green screen. Nothing felt real, and it annoyed the hell out of me.<br/><br/>I wish I laughed more. I wish there was more cringe scenes, but honestly, this film was just really boring. I fell asleep tons of times and there is just nothing left for me to say. I mean, the enemies were horrendous, and I didn't care about one single thing that was going on. There was even this one bad guy (a pirate) that was given a montage scene with heroic music for what reason? It was so out of place and made no sense. He is supposed to be the evil person. The mother of Aquaman also annoyed me a lot. There is a decision that involves her in the film that could have happened so much sooner, and what ends up happening is so dumb, that I was really wanting to walk out.<br/><br/>All in all, not even a red-head showing off some cleavage could spark my attention in this bloated, boring, and really ugly looking CGI-filled atrocity."

"ferguson-6","7","4","7","14 December 2018"," a swim through comic book mythology
","Greetings again from the darkness. Were the TV series ""Entourage"" still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director's seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ½ hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.<br/><br/>Sure, we've seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it's the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.<br/><br/>On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.<br/><br/>When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to 'Iron-Man' it to another level - one much less stable. It's Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn't think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?<br/><br/>The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film's epic climax.<br/><br/>Although director Wan may throw a bit too much 'plot' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it's all stunning to watch.<br/><br/>Don't tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn't experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.<br/><br/>This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing ""She's a Mystery to Me"", and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is."

","This movie did not live up the hype for me. First, yes, there are a lot of spectacular visual shots, but too many wide shots with too many little details that take away from the main protagonists, and after a while, they become stale. Second, the story is weak, the last fight is completely anti-climatic, essentially to win a fight in Atlanta, you need to get the better weapon to break the ones your opponent has. Third, the actings are subpar, Momoa and Heard cannot deliver more subtle emotions like Gadot and Pine, and Dafoe and Kidman are underused, the only memorable one is Abdul-Mateen's Black Manta (or just Manta). It's a fun ride, but nothing more. However, Wan's camera work is really next level."

It's beautiful and fascinating at times, and the characters are well portrayed, I've been a DC fan longer, but I enjoy Marvel just as well, so this is unbiased. A critic will try to find issues in every movie, but you'll be entertained no doubt. And just as the movie reaches about an hour and a half to 2 hours spot, where other movies would be finishing off, This one kicks it up a notch. There's a Whole Lord of the Ring-eque feel to the remaining quarter, saving the best for last I suppose.

Some misplaced or unnecessary scenes (which Wan could've done better) were added just to (imho) increase the the duration of the film rather than strengthen the story, Arthur's behavior sometimes doesn't befit his counterpart in the original source (he's to much fun as a king of the planet's most powerful kingdom, he's should've been more like T'Challa instead of Thor), and the resolution is quiet (or at least a little bit) cringe worthy for a conflict between two (or more) great (underwater) nations (or kingdoms, or races).<br/><br/>At least, what Wan has delivered us is better than anything Snyder offered (thanks to learning from past mistakes, and a godly touch from DC's lord and savior, Geoff Johns), though he and his wife still take the credit as producers.

There were a lot of other movies thrown in and the movie was all over the place as a result.<br/><br/>I cannot understand all of the positive reviews here. People awarding 10 stars should not be allowed to watch proper movies!<br/><br/>There are Stormtroopers (who other reviewers have actually referred to as Stormtroopers!), there are dinosaurs, there are Sword in the Stone and Pinocchio references. Not references actually like actually just thrown at the audience.<br/><br/>Aquaman is unlikeable for me. A waster who just likes to drink (""Quickly... I'm missing happy hour ho ho""). The romance between him and Amber Heard is so obvious from the beginning. And talking of obvious - the mention of Nicole Kidman being dead - I think maybe 85 or 100 times?! Shocker - she's not dead after all! And the whole movie happened because she was dead!! Absurd.<br/><br/>Everything was forced and everything fell flat. The scene where Arthur pulls the sword from the king or something was insane - in the bad way. A huge boring creature stops him until Aquaman tells him to deal with it or some such thing and then says ""well, no-one has pulled the trident from the king's hand yet... so when you fail, I'm super hungry."" Or something like that. I was struggling to stay awake honestly. The movie runs at around 2-3 days in length. Can't be sure. So many bad jokes thrown in.<br/><br/>Someone should make future DC writers/directors sit down and watch 10,000 hours of Marvel movies before starting the next flop.<br/><br/>Or actually just watch one Marvel film.

","While Arthur(Momoa, charming) has known since childhood that he is Prince of Atlantis, he's been reluctant to claim the title and has instead stayed on land. However, when his half-brother Orm(Wilson, really committing to the role) threatens war on the surface world, which could kill millions of people, he has to embrace his nature. The only way for him to succeed is to work with Mera(Heard, her cynicism a cover for a sweetness and willingness to sacrifice herself), despite not getting along with each other, and neither of them having faith in him.<br/><br/>This is entirely unashamed of itself. It is proudly and decisively going all out. I'm not going to claim that everyone who criticised it either ""don't get it"" or don't at all have a point that its tone vacillates awkwardly between different ones, such as Lord of the Rings epic and cartoony comic book. Your mileage may vary. For me, it grabbed me from frame one and I was with it all the way through. It's so infectiously in love with its world, which really is unlike anything seen recently in movies from Marvel or DC. I'm not sure of when there last was a picture like this that didn't get a lot wrong. There is a lot of mythology at play here. Thought this was about a single nation of the Sea? Wrong. There are seven. Those clips of a massive battle in the trailers? It's freaking amazing. And I would have to strongly disagree with those who say it goes on for too long. This has the best action scenes I've seen since Infinity War(no, course it doesn't top that, how could it possibly?). They are easy to follow, the camera moves to take in the scope and keep the energy up, they are varied and distinct from each other, and they take advantage of the cool concepts at play here: dozens, maybe a hundred, underwater creatures utilised for transport and attack, as well as plasma guns and other futuristic tech. Although this film doesn't top Wonder Woman in every way, it's definitely in the top two. Warner Brothers: put as much of this franchise in the hands of Patty Jenkins and James Wan, and the DCEU will thrive.<br/><br/>There is a lot of sci-fi violence, some disturbing content, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes superheroes. 8/10"

Aquaman is full of poor acting, forced humour, no character development. Momoa is the same man in the beggining and ending, saying awful jokes and fighting ghost characters (manta)

","Watched Aquaman on screenx<br/><br/>A spectacularly disappointing spectacle movie Here is what I think:<br/><br/>1- The dog was the best actor. Although it only appeared less than a minute in the opening 5 minutes of the 2 and half hours lengthy movie<br/><br/>2- The dog has expressed in its 1 minute role more genuine emotions than the whole cast including the hero, the pretty face main actress and the mother reunioned with her son after 20+ years<br/><br/>3- The visual effects (CGI) were indeed of a very high quality, it felt natural and smooth despite the plot largely runs underwater<br/><br/>4- the script feels like it was done as a homework assignment by the writer's daughter who doesn't like writing<br/><br/>5- The pace and compilation feels like it was done as a punishment assignment for the son of the director<br/><br/>6- Despite the story has a great potential there was no substance in the movie. Just as an example, the hero did absolutely nothing good for the underwater to be their hero.<br/><br/>7- Despite the mythological nature of the story should typically simplify the creative progress of situations and the great CGI quality, almost everything was illogical and incoherent. As an example the hero was near bullet proof for all kind of weapons including heavy ones that explode mountains, but surprisingly afraid of being biten and eaten by silly creatures with stupid teeth.<br/><br/>8- Didn't feel much added value of screenx. Probably iMax would be a better option<br/><br/>9- I have already given enough points. If you still need more then you go find out yourself"

","Aquaman is basically Thor underwater. Solid main lead with occasionally well placed humor, good use of ancient mythology, sick action scenes from everyone involved in the movie and absolutely beautiful cinematography with a diverse world that has been created under the water.<br/><br/>The best part is that unlike any other Marvel/DC movie, you forget that Aquaman is an actual super hero because of how immersive the story is.<br/><br/>Bad part is that some of the scenes feel like they are stapled together instead of having a smooth flow. Oh and the song selection leaves more to be desired; however, the music that was used in the movie is good.<br/><br/>Overall, this is no Wonder Woman but still a very good DC movie that is enjoyable in the cinema just for its sheer cinematography, action and a good cast that gels well together."

","It was a good movie. Acting was brilliant and hair and make up was great. The CGI was quite good, not something in particular I would point out but still good. The costumes overall were great except for the last costume aqua man wore which looked...well... different is the word. The storyline was a bit all over the place at times but about a quarter of the way through the movie it becomes a bit more clear. This film unlike most other dc films had some comedy in it rather than another 'seriously dark' dc movie. Most dc films are quite dark and barely have any comedy. It needs that balance of comedy to get the audience laughing but still a deep movie at the same time. Too much comedy and the movie feels like a joke but too much deep stuff and you feel like your eternally falling through a black hole, if you know what I'm saying. There was the 'I'm going to blow you up every five seconds' which is pretty much in every dc film (apart from wonder woman and the original batman trilogy). It was a good film and by any means watch it but if you are looking for a go to dc superhero/hero film, the batman trilogy is the way to go. Or you could look at some of the marvel stuff as well."

"MMOO7","8","3","5","24 March 2019"," 'Aquaman' has a different theme!
","It is almost kind of a new scenario, under water! There are many movies that themed underwater but not with a massive empire at the bottom of the sea. Many viewers are hating this movie based on their personal opinions like bad story, few superstars, Jason Momoa's bad acting, slow SFX etc. It is true that just like tipical Marvel or DC movies, the count of superstars are very less in this movie and that didn't made this movie bad in my view.
Jason Momoa is a big guy, and his size perfectly fitting with his character. But he couldn't 100% blend with that character in terms of acting, some tweaks are required.
About the movie, I like the underwater empire. It supposed to be huge and massive. But throughout the movie play, we won't get a feel like that. That is the main flaw of the movie. More of a budget empire 😅 I think. I enjoyed to watch the water creatures that the soldiers are used to ride. The Trench Monsters, Sea Dragons, Battle Lobsters, Tylosaurus. Especially the Karathen, wow! That gigantic creature is almost a nightmare. The director had every possible chance to make this movie great but the limitation of time and may be budget made the move average I guess!
One of the things I more like about this movie is less cracking jokes and more of a serious attitude of all characters throughout the movie, mainly the main actors. In the Thor movie sequels, we can see, the first movie is the best of all. Thor the son of Odin, is really mighty! His talking, attire, actions are exactly resembles a true son of god. But after that movie, every characters are making things less important and making jokes. Thor and Loki didn't seem that concentrated on their respective characters behaviour. This is happening with all the superhero movies nowadays. Cracking jokes irrespective or their characters. Especially in fantasy and mythological movies. But Aquaman is better than that. All the actors are serious in their corresponding roles.
I had great expectation on the coronation at end for new king, but nothing was there. Another flaw in my view. I am not going to be a complete critic about this movie. To be honest, it is better than Spiderman movies (not the old ones), some Avengers and DC movies with too much hype."

When you meet a hero, good music plays, and their hair blows in the wind - nothing is left to the viewer to figure out. Whoever did the music for this movie...should find a new career path. There is a scene where they go to Africa, and a version of the song ""Africa"" is played...pure cringe. The characters are undeveloped, and Jason Momoa, while visually a perfect action hero, cannot deliver authentic emotion through Aquaman's dialogue (I prefer him speaking Dothraki). The fighting scenes were shot beautifully, but there was so much screen time devoted to fight scenes that they became boring...I mean, we already know who's going to win. The other annoying thing was the cheap strategy of having an extremely quiet moment followed by an incredibly loud noise to startle you - it would've been fine to employ this strategy once, but it happened about four times in the movie, as if the writers couldn't think of any other way to create excitement.

"paul_haakonsen","8","3","5","28 January 2019"," This was rather impressive...
","Alright, well for starters I must state that I am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies, because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint. But I was forced into watching the 2018 DC ""Aquaman"" movie together with my family.<br/><br/>And it turns out that it was actually a good thing that I was forced to watch it. Because it turned out that ""Aquaman"" was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made. Not that I am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and haven't read the comic books or anything.<br/><br/>Initially I was a little bit hesitant about the movie, but it turns out that director James Wan actually managed to turn the written material of David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall and Geoff Johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable. The movie was driven by a good story, where one quickly and easily got submerged, no pun intended, into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen. Plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well. Needless to say that the CGI and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Now, normally I am not much fan of Jason Momoa, but I must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing Aquaman - although I have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character. But he did it phenomenally in my opinion, regardless. It was of course a treat to see Willem Dafoe in the movie, despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous. Patrick Wilson actually was so well-cast for the role he had in the movie, and he brought so much grace, charm and wits to that dark character. I had initially not thought he would be up to the task, but he proved me so wrong. Then you have the likes of Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie, despite them not having an abundance of screen time.<br/><br/>The pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat, and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down. Which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion, and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit through.<br/><br/>As for the special effects and CGI. Well, there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie. And that word is: wow! Are you kidding me, this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department. Prepare to be blown away.<br/><br/>With that being said, the movie is not at all flawless. Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the Secret Sea and what was going on there. It was just too far out there for my liking. And also the fact that all the marvelous, magnificent, malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures, vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me. It makes absolutely no sense at all.<br/><br/>Now, I was praising the CGI and visual effects just before. There were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater, it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at. That was a shame, because the rest of the 95% of special effects and CGI in the movie was just spot on.<br/><br/>If you enjoy superhero movies. Wait, let me rephrase that. Even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies, then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie. It is definitely well worth the time, effort and money."

"Vartiainen","Null","3","5","28 January 2019"," Colourful extravaganza
","In my mind Aquaman has the honour of being the second honestly good DC film after Wonder Woman. And once again it's due to it straying away from the usual DC/Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan clichÃ©s. This is a colourful action blast full of good humour, interesting locations, bright lights, majestic set pieces and enough eye candy to paint a house with. True, the story is still bit of a mess, it's trying to do perhaps a thing or two too many at once, but it's more than entertaining enough to rise above such petty concerns.<br/><br/>Two great things to single out. First is the direction of James Wan. Mainly a horror director before this, he brings with him this great energy and passion. This feels like an epic. Like a great superhero film should. He also has a really good style when it comes to action scenes. Like in Wonder Woman, all the action scenes in this film are easy to follow, mostly shot at wide view, with very little shaky cam employed. And surprise of surprises, it makes it really entertaining to watch when you can actually see what's going on and can appreciate all the effort that went into making it.<br/><br/>The second great thing is Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, the eponymous Aquaman. Amazing physical presence, very good with action scenes and practically made for the role, despite his looks being rather far from the original character. And he has some serious comedic chops, which this character sorely needs. Because, let's face it, a superhero who talks to fish is not the easiest sell in the world, but Momoa makes it work.<br/><br/>Granted, the villain side of things is still a bit lacking, the story is messy, some of the side characters are rather weak, and there are more than a few hiccups scattered throughout.<br/><br/>But, the film still delivers. I walked out of the theater with a big smile on my face and I'd more than gladly see the film again. And that's the most important thing."

Derivative, and not in a good way. I lost track of all the ripoffs of other movies. I don't mind a nod here and there, but this was ridiculous. I notice other reviewers were impressed with the underwater scenes, which I would describe as Avatar meets Bladerunner, mostly. I personally enjoyed the above-the-water shots much more, and looked forward to them. Not a good sign for an underwater hero movie.
Movies ripped off : Alien(s), Attack of the Clones, Harry Potter, Avatar, The Matrix, Bladerunner, The Perfect Storm. Others, I can't recall.
Things I learned:
Aquaman is a former pro wrestler. Totally unbelievable until he gets his suit later. The original King would of been much better.
Underwater princesses have augmentation. Distracting, even for the star. That doesn't make up for horrible dialogue.
When I forget the main villan is even in the movie, something is wrong.
Dialogue, that is dumb on a level that would make Roadhouse look like Shakespeare.
A couple of the battle scenes were ok, but the most entertaining parts of the rest of the movie were spotting the differences in William Dafoes man-buns.<br/><br/>Aggressively dumb."

I couldn't restrain my self from laughing when I noticed Mera in all the scenes(even after getting out of water) with lip-stick on, hardcore eye rimmel and full make-up. I mean what the heck!!! She should appear more natural, she just came out from the WATER, it's not like she's posing for Victoria's Secret.

","This is not an awful movie. If you completely turn your brain off, it is not hard to enjoy.<br/><br/>That having been said, the story is weak and the dialogue is absolutely abysmal. Mamoa is great in this role, but the character was so much better written in Justice League. Both Kidman and Dafoe were just wasted.<br/><br/>I suppose that it is completely subjective, but so many of the directorial choices took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>What the DC people don't seem to realize is that simply because a movie is based upon a comic doesn't mean that it has to be written to appeal solely to 10 year old boys. Characters are allowed to speak as though they are real people, with real emotions, and who have actually passed high school English. Hard as it may be to imagine, the story doesn't have to be stupid just because it's based upon a comic book."

The only thing worse than the script was the horrendous acting, 90% of the movie is actors with poker face. The story was portrayed in the most naive way possible and the story telling was horrible.

","Finally, it seems that that DCEU has worked out how to do superhero films right. Instead of the dull, dingy worlds of films like Batman Vs Superman or Suicide Squad, Aquaman provides a sequence of visually stunning settings with colour palettes that help to set the scene. Gone is the failed attempts to make the series dark and gritty, instead here's a film that accepts that the audience of a modern superhero film is there for an exciting and light-hearted action film, then proceeds to hit the mark. It even subtly acknowledges the common criticism of the DCEU that they're just copying Marvel with a couple of visual jokes! If this is what DC films are going to be from now on, then I look forward to what comes next!"

","I've been a superhero comics fan my whole life, so I was extremely excited at the idea of Aquaman having a legitimate movie of his own, less so that it would be in the low-quality context of the DCEU.<br/><br/>First off, Momoa was a great casting choice for the man himself: he has the energy and looks to actually make a lesser superhero very charismatic nonetheless. The problem comes with almost everything else: the other members of the cast have nothing interesting to give their characters, not even the ""queen"" herself Nicole Kidman, and the plot is... just a mess. It's a fun mess, but a mess still. What I mean is that Aquaman has an interesting mythos, but also a limited one: the authors managed to stuff the plot with Orm, Manta, the War between Land and Sea, the trial of the Trident AND the Trench, a newer and awesome addition to the canon of recent years. Now, this has consequences: the story makes no sense, of course, but this has to be taken into account when watching a superhero flick (a DC superhero flick, rather); the story is so absurd it's fun and funny: I found myself laughing at some of the most bombastic and/or cliche scenes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing; last, but not least: this makes it incredibly hard for a sequel to happen. I know DC is already considering throwing away the whole project, and I'm honestly happy with that, but the team could've focused on fewer plot points, delivering a sharper, shorter film, instead of burning every cartridge with a long and messy one."
"bankofmarquis","5","3","5","10 January 2019"," Momoa saves it from being a total disaster.
","I have been a defender of the darker DC Universe films. While not as popular (nor, generally, as good) as their Marvel counterparts, they all do have their good points - until now.<br/><br/>AQUAMAN is not a very good film and I could really only come up with 1 good point - Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Some are calling him ""the next Rock"" and he certainly has the physique, the screen presence and the charm to pull this off. This movie ALMOST worked because of Momoa's presence on the screen.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>Director James Wan (Furious 7, The Conjuring) certainly had the ""chops"" to Direct a film like this, unfortunately, I found his Direction to be choppy. What I mean by that is that this film never really settled into a good flow. It cut back and forth - both in content and in tone - to such an extent that I, the movie-goer, could never settle back into my seat and enjoy the ride. I'm sure Mr. Wan would call this movie a ""roller-coaster ride"", but if it is, it is an old, wooden, rickety roller coaster, jarring the riders as they go.<br/><br/>As for the cast, they are ""fine"". From Patrick Wilson to Amber Heard to Willem DaFoe to Dolph Lundgren(!) to good ol' Nicole Kidman. They all do decent, professional jobs with what they are given, but what they are given is weak and disjointed.<br/><br/>I would like to point out Yahya Abdul-Mateen as the sub-villain of this piece, Black Manta. This is the most incompetent Super-Villain in any Super Hero movie to date. His Black Manta was there, obviously, to give Aquaman someone to beat. And he beats him...again...and again...and again.<br/><br/>All I wanted to do was ""beat feet"" out of the theater.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: C+ (for Momoa's efforts)<br/><br/>5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Some positives... the visuals we're stunning at times. Jason looks good while shirtless for the ladies.<br/><br/>The bad...Acting and cringe worthy dialogue. Story is weak and predictable. (Spoiler Alert) They said his mom is dead so frequently throughout the first half of the movie it was obvious they were over compensating that she was alive. Overly CGI, did they have any actual sets or filming locations? The score was so cheesy, whenever something evil was revealed the music actually went ""dun dun DAA!!!"".<br/><br/>Go see it if you're a fan, but be prepared to turn your brain off and munch some popcorn.

However the writing was often cliched and cheesy; jokes fell flat for me(which happens in most movies) there was no money left in the budget for amber heard's wig and last but most importantly it had a horrible score. My god. They had a cover of Africa (by Toto) sung by Pitbull... why. The score wasn't background it was heavy handed and brought me out of the movie often.

"aweynand96","7","3","5","4 January 2019"," Progress in the right direction - as long as you're hoping for fun and grandeur
","They've finally done it: DC has embraced the cheese and abandoned their attempts to make superhero movies with both the dark, serious atmosphere of the Dark Knight trilogy and the light comedy of Marvel movies. It didn't work with Batman vs. Superman and it certainly didn't work with Suicide Squad, but they came much closer with Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>What we have here is a movie which doesn't try to be grounded and gloomy like before, yet doesn't aim to be clever. Aquaman is proud of its corniness, with all the lame jokes, unexplained phenomena (do none of the underwater folks need gills?), and impressively epic deep sea battles. This last part is where the film soars. I have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws. There are hordes of creative ocean monsters, ancient and colossal predators, Lovecraftian horrors, and jaw-dropping sceneries which make the boring, gray-scale landscape of Justice League almost forgivable.<br/><br/>By no means is this a perfect movie. You can expect the usual plot holes and details that don't make much sense. There is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and second-handed. The characters are fun and refreshing, but mostly predictable and, except for a couple, one-dimensional. The performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season. I would point to both Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities. Nicole Kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them. Willem Dafoe seemed suppressed in his role. In general, most of the other characters were just ""okay"". One of the main villains (Manta), in all his high-tech glory, is afforded a brief half-assed origin story to make him more relatable.<br/><br/>But in spite of this, Aquaman seeks to be FUN, and it does a much better job than any of DCEU's previous endeavors. The change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of Wonderwoman. There are so many intricately-designed creatures and characters that I'm shocked the film's budget wasn't significantly higher. Also importantly, Jason Momoa plays a hero who just doesn't really care about behaving like one, which works - at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film. After the first half-hour or so, we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious Marvel projects. It is a comic book movie, after all.<br/><br/>There are some not-so-subtle critiques on mankind's treatment of the environment, and though it's a good message, it doesn't strive to go much deeper than ""humans bad, but not all bad"". Don't see Aquaman to have your life changed, but if you want an ultra-fun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting, buy yourself a ticket.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"jamiesmith-50352","10","3","5","3 January 2019"," AMAZING VISUALS FOR A GREAT STORY
","I absoloutley indulged in this movie as it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie of all 2018. As I watched this in 2019, this is definately the highlight of my year so far.<br/><br/>Beginning:
The story was amazing especially with beginning as both Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison completely dive into the role and put in there all as you can feel the love and connection they have in such a limited amount of screen time. Because of this they did great with what time they had to make it believable on screen. Nicole Kidman completey kicked ass in this movie and honestly didn't expect any of the amazing fight chreography from her and was really impressed and overwhelmed.<br/><br/>The Story:
The story was really good with some amazing writing and some unique and imaginative world building especially for when we are entering the city of Atlantis and seeing the amazing under sea world. It really reminded me of avatar with the overall designs.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the feud and rivalry both Arthur and King Norm have for one of another but I wished that there was some brotherly love like we have with our marvel characters Loki and Thor but for reasons that are brought up I can see why James Wan didn't go in that direction. I think that Patrick Wilson didn't a phenominal job as King Norm. I didn't realise it was him from the trailers so seeing that he finally got a big role since watchmen as Owl man for me is awesome.<br/><br/>Third Act:
The third act is the most insane thing we've had for a battle since man of steel in the DCEU in my opinion as it was a chaotic, suspenseful and visually stunning. The kiss both Mera and Arthur had in the third act was kind of a ""YEAH FINALLY"" moment as you can feel they have feelings for one another throughout the film and even in Justice League so for them to drag it out and then do that was a cool moment. Amber Heard did a phenominal job as mera and really felt like a 3 dimensions character instead of an actress doing a role. Everyone did awesome<br/><br/>Overall:
The film was visually stunning and the entire cast did a phenominal job. How James Wan and the design team made aquamans iconic yellow and green suit look great in a live action film I'll never understand. Perfect Story, perfect cast, perfect visuals, perfect writing and perfect direction."

","I enjoyed seeing James Wan's latest, ""Aquaman,"" the 2018 live-action film adaptation of the famed DC Comics character. ""Aquaman"" tells a story that's actually quite similar to ""The Legend of King Arthur,"" and revolves around half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) becoming Aquaman in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and the human world. ""Aquaman"" is much different from James Wan's previous films - of course, ""Saw."" The film (especially in its underwater sequences) looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but that's really all I got out of it. (I'm not a fan of Aquaman and perhaps if I was, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.) It's really no different from many other big-budget superhero films of late, especially those produced by rival Marvel. But I went with my father (who really wanted to see it) and he paid for our tickets - since I paid when we went to go see ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018) a few days ago.<br/><br/>7/10"

Jason mamoa is engaging and fun but also gave some depth, not to mention absolutely stunning. Amber herds Mera was a great character and was an absolute doer and not clichÃ© at all.

What do you expect?), and acting is solid. Although there are some disagreements with some versions of Arthur Curry's backstory, this brings a good flavor to the canon (curry? Flavor? Pun very much intended).<br/><br/>Takeaway points: visuals are great, story is interesting and moves along at a good pace. Editing keeps things feeling natural and acting helps characters come to life. Very high score is very deserved, even if Aquaman isn't your drink of choice."

","When I heard they were making an Aquaman movie, I rolled my eyes. After seeing the abomination that was Justice League and Batman vs. Superman, I had low expectations. I was so wrong. Once I saw the preview I had a little hope, but it looked like a Black Panther ripoff. I went in ready to be disappointed and came out blown away. James Wan did excellent on this film. I never thought I would say I liked an Aquaman film but I did! The acting was great and there were funny moments. The fight scenes were so much more different than I had prevuiously seen in any movie. The visuals were perfect and I was in love. Black Manta proved to be an awesome villain despite looking very funny. Orm or Oceanmaster turned out to be an awesome villain as well. The ending scene is what got me. When Arthur and Orm jumped up on the ship and the slow-mo was used. I actually muttered, ""whoa."" There were surpringly a couple scenes like that. The fight in Italy, when Mera and Arthur dived into the reaf and it gave us the beautiful underwater shot of them getting swarmed by those creatures, I was in awe. Beautiful and worthy of $10."

","I'm a huge fan of Marvel and I always thought that DC's superhero movies suck. (dont get me wrong but... Justice League and Batman vs Superman?? Super boring)
Wonder Woman was still okay, but Aquaman totally change my opinion towards DC, thanks to James Wan.
Not going to describe much but if you haven't watched it yet, please do."
"knappd1","8","3","5","31 December 2018"," Finally a DC movie i would pay to see in theaters again
","Not since the dark knight have i seen a DC movie in theaters that i would want to see in theaters again. You can tell DC is doing things differently with aquaman, they are not afraid to use the fantastical elements of Aquaman's comics.
What that means is, instead of a dark, gritty, rooted in reality movie; we have a colorful, vibrant other world under the sea movie. It is unique from other movies in its style and story elements while still maintaining familiar superhero elements.
Having said that, I personally found the movie quite predictable. Perhaps it is the way the movie plays out very similar to many video games i have played. What I mean is that the movie, while quite good, feels like it is made based off a video game story campaign.
Many scenes of dialog end with sudden violence, the main character is repeatedly told that they have only one path they can make without the world ending, even a kind of tutorial scene and well established powers.<br/><br/>It really felt like it was written by a video game story designer, but in a good way. I hope DC can remember what worked in Aquaman in future DC movies."
"morrow2522","4","3","5","31 December 2018"," Don't bite
","One thing Pixar should have taught anyone making movies is that the story comes first. Without characters and situations that engage an audience, without screenwriters who can craft meaningful dialogue, all the CGI in the universe can't save a movie. Actors that can make us believe they are the characters they portray, and directors and film editors that shape a film into a meaningful whole can make a good story into a memorable experience. Aquaman has none of those things. It has the CGI, but unless you have the critical capacity of a 10-year old, that isn't nearly enough. This isn't a movie, it's just a bunch of poorly written, badly acted set pieces that look good, but leave an audience wanting so much more.
For awhile, I thought maybe this was going for the Pacific Rim effect-laughably over the top, but no, it's just a mess of a movie, a waste of money and time. The dialogue is laughable, the story is cliched, silly and dull-witted, and the acting is about at the level of a Power Rangers episode. Save the trouble of finding out for yourself, and don't be fooled by any of these 10/10 reviews. Both of our sons (17 & 20) nearly fell asleep watching this, and my wife did. DC has a long way to go before they can equal Marvel."

THIS is what defines cinematic masterpiece and this movie will join the archives of CLASSIC. Just a PHENOMENAL film loaded with creative WONDER and SOUL. Aquaman sets the standard very HIGH."
"KeremUlucay","7","3","5","30 December 2018"," A HOPE FOR DCEU
","Aquaman is a good super hero and blockbuster movie. It is worth to see it in theatre. Although it has something original, we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies. What Aquaman did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright. CGIs are really great. I liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time. And thats the hard part of the job. Even so this movie has the best CGIs in any DC movie for me. Also, Aquaman has a great action. Italy fight, submarine fight, big battle in Atlantis... Casting is great too. Momoa and Heard did a wonderful job on this project. But generally characters doesn't have tough motivations. Especially King Orm, he is not a so intense villian. On the other hand, film is so long. I think it could be better if it would be 15 minutes shorter. Another great thing Aquaman did it great is connection of opening and final sequences. It was enjoyable."
"RforFilm","8","3","5","30 December 2018"," Aquaman does not blow the man down. It's a visual spectacle and an entertaining superhero story.
","I've said before that the difference between Marvel and D.C. is that Marvel is humans becoming gods and D.C. is gods becoming humans. If there was a character from D.C. that embodies this type (at least on Earth), that would be Aquaman. Not only is he the king of Atlantis, but like a lot of people within the D.C. universe, he already has god-like powers. His story seems more classical then Superman or Batman; one in which he may have grown up amongst humans only to find that his connection to the sea makes him a king. Tell me this doesn't sound like something that fits along with Homer's Odyssey.<br/><br/>Aquaman had already been featured in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, but he had never gotten his own movie. Come to think of it, he's a character that hasn't been seen within a live action. Given how expansive the comic books have shown Atlantis and the majority of his powers, I can't imagine how this guy would have been portrayed without computer effects. It almost seemed that the D.C. universe was doomed after the negative reception to Justice League. Let's see how things have improved in the standalone movie Aquaman.<br/><br/>As shown through a flashback, a lighthouse keeper Thomas finds the queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (played by Nicole Kidman) washed up on shore. The two fall in love and have a child, Arthur. When Atlantis comes looking for them, Atlanna returns to the sea, leaving Thomos to care for his son. Cut to years later when Arthur (played by Jason Mamoa) has gained reputation as an ""Aquaman"" who stops pirates on the high seas. After coming home one day, he's approached by Mera (played by Amber Heard) who asks that he return to Atlantis to dethrone his stepbrother Orm (played by Patrick Wilson) who is ruthless and wants to become Ocean Master of all kingdoms. Arthur declines, but agrees to accompany her to find his mother's trident.<br/><br/>From here, Arthur and Mera return to Atlantis, meeting with his old teacher and a confidant of Orm, Nuidis (played by William Dafoe). While getting information, their ambushed and Orm attempts to fight him, but they escape. Traveling to the Sahara and Sicily, they figure out where the trident is, but the battle rages on as Orm wants to declare war on the surface world and Arthur has to fulfill his destiny as the Aquaman to stop his brother from becoming Ocean Master.<br/><br/>For the most part, Aquaman is the movie that Warner Brothers had needed to make in order to compete with Disney's Marvel brand. Is it a perfect comic book movie? No, but it was a lot more entertaining then I expected it to be. Director James Wan (The Conjuring, Fast 7) seems to have thrown out the brooding darkness from the previous movies and embraced the more fantasy elements of the DC universe. Aquaman is not a bad movie to do that with, given that the majority of the story is set underwater and the kingdom of Atlantis.<br/><br/>Environment is one thing, but it's all for nothing if the characters aren't interesting. The good news is that Jason Mamoa is not only charismatic, but he's also a welcome change to the typical, all American or strong women we see. He's more like the former jock from high school whose at least nice and willing to make a friend. Mamoa not only fits in well with his position as the son of a lighthouse keeper, but has a noble pose, giving him more of a royalty ambiance then I felt with Chadwick Boseman from Black Panther.<br/><br/>His journey is also interesting, as the goal is not only simple, but is genuinely fun. When we see him in Sicaly fighting high-tech pirates, im invested. When he's in Atlantis talking to his brother, I want to see where things so. When Arthur has to fight, I'm curious to see how the movie will incorporate the various elements of the ocean. Most of it is played out well, though if I had a problem, its that the movie is a tad too long. Without giving anything away, there's a second villain they could have cut, as the story is mainly setting him up for a sequel. Not to mention there are exposition bits of dialogue that could have been shortened.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Aquaman comics out of ten. It's crazy to think that while Superman and Batman were not done well, its Wonder Woman and this that are the better movies within Warner Brothers. This is likely to help those who've been dissatisfied with the previous DC movies. All I can say is that Aquaman does not blow the man down. Go check it out."

DC had a hard job to make a good film out of a not so respected horoe (Speaking for myself, I didn't know much of aquaman, just the basics that everybody knows) and it worked very well.
The cast is really good, There wouldn't be any other main actor as good as Jason to play the role and James Wan managed to make one of the best super heroe movies of the year for me, only behind avengers. Also think this might the best movie from DC, maybe behind justice league."

"yashrajs536","8","3","5","26 December 2018"," Looks like DC is on the right track to get its mojo back !!
","I am a hard core Batman fan so I can call myself a DC fan also. Well after the DCEU started I was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to Marvel but that never happened.<br/><br/>Marvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers. And yes apart from Man of Steel the other consecutive movies BvS or JL they both were not upto the mark. Wonder woman was a good movie though.<br/><br/>Because of these dissappointments I was not excited for Aquaman. I thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies I mentioned. But I was proven wrong !! How did I forgot that the director of this movie is none other than Mr. JAMES WAN who made The conjuring and Furious 7. But everything aside. James wan yet again proved his mettle. And this movie is a sure shot blockbuster.<br/><br/>DC has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors. And that's why its movies become dissapointments. But as Wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making Aquaman we can ourselves see the results of it. And I hope that DC continues this trend in its future movies also.<br/><br/>Back to the movie let's talk about pros and cons:-<br/><br/>Pros :-<br/><br/>1. Wan's direction is fantastic.<br/><br/>2. Action director who has designed the action deserves a praise.<br/><br/>3. VFX team also deserves a praise. A film like this is quite a difficult task to do. But still these guys have done it.<br/><br/>4. Adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous DCEU movies. Though they could have shown more emotional attachment of Queen of Atlanta and Ocean Master.<br/><br/>5. Performances by all the actors are fantastic.<br/><br/>6. Art director also deserves a praise.<br/><br/>Cons:-<br/><br/>1. Film gets boring in between especially in Italy scenes.<br/><br/>2. If character development of Black manta and Ocean Master could have been done a bit well. Then it could have been more amazing.<br/><br/>My rating is 8/10."
"JasonR77","10","3","5","26 December 2018"," Delightfully Fun
","Well, they managed to make Aquaman cool.<br/><br/>I don't say that lightly, either. The superhero with the odds-on worst reputation of all has been redeemed by a talented leading man and a sound director. James Wan's work with this script managed to blend high action, character development, and tremendous visuals, with a smattering of utter ridiculousness for good measure.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is the star, but Amber Heard cannot be overlooked, as her character is the one that drives the plot, and not as the love interest. Wan did his homework, and ensured that Mera was more than eye candy or a damsel in distress. She is a butt-kicker, and more intuitive than Arthur is for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Arthur is done consistently with what we got of him in Justice League, but fleshed out more, and Momoa is up to the challenge of doing more with a guy who to this point had been a hard drinking nobody who could fire off the occasional wisecrack. The backstory he is given is less tragic than many other superheroes tend to get, complete with one guaranteed living parent. Kind of an odd fact in this genre.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is definitely committed as the would-be Ocean Master, and brings a hammy gravitas to the role, as though he understands how ridiculous he is and plays it up at every opportunity. This should make him cheesy, but instead it makes him more distasteful, adding to the strength of the performance.<br/><br/>Black Manta is another good choice, and his part in the film is helpful at moving the plot along, and bringing more action. His anger, and unfettered rage for revenge makes him a good, gritty villain to counterbalance the others.<br/><br/>The action is fantastic, and the scale on which it is done in many scenes is great. But at no point do you lose track of Arthur or Mera as they get through it all.<br/><br/>Like Wonder Woman, this is an example of what the DCEU can be when it is given to directors and writers who are of quality, and there's less Zack Snyder."

"Tyrone_Prince","9","3","5","23 December 2018"," Refreshing
","I was kind of skeptical coming into this movie at first mainly because of Justice League. JL was a huge flop IMO as it was simply rushed and there was simply no character growth at all! Besides Wonder Woman, Batman & Supes, I had absolutely no inkling or any form of connections to the other heroes.<br/><br/>So lo and behold, fast forward a year later and the trailer for Aquamam came out. I have to admit, the trailer was very intriguing but even then I was kind of doubtful if Aquaman could even entertain me with a decent plot or even some half-solid action sequences. MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOTALLY SHATTERED.<br/><br/>The cast was great! Jason Momoa killed it as Aquaman. He brought Aquman to life perfectly with his outgoing and rambunctious personality and physically he nailed it as well. Amber Heard as Mera was perfect too as she displays a sense of pride and strength that we are all too familiar with the Mera in the comic book universe. Patrick Wilson as King Orm was convincing as well and he truly made me dislike him from the moment he appears. The supporting case (Nicole Kidman & William Dafoe) was solid too and even the antagonists were considerably interesting too. This is what truly set Aquaman apart from JL. There is a proper cause and Aquaman has a legitimate underdog journey to obtain the throne/<br/><br/>Overall, I think all DC fans and any average moviegoer should go watch this. The CGI isnt bad at all and James Wan has perfects cuts and edits so not a single scene feels to dragged out. The action scenes are all very neatly done and u can feel a surge of adrenaline pumping through you when the musical score hits during battle scenes.Most importantly though, there is an actual plot that you can relate to and you can submerge yourself in the absolutely dreamy and surreal world of Atlantis while enjoying this roller coaster of a movie.<br/><br/>I am definitely hoping for a sequel and I hope the DCEU can continue building on the success of this movie."

","I find many action scenes in comic-book movies too short or too long with not enough ""drama"". This movie has good balance of showing strength of Aquaman with just the right amount of number and length of action scenes. The visuals are really stunning and really well done.
I rolled my eyes on stupid jokes and this is probably the only downside of this movie. It's like they're there to compete with Marvel...whatever.
For me Nolan's Batmans were the movies made more for adults, this one is more for children although older gen that like comic-books will be pleased.

"piggulu","9","3","5","22 December 2018"," Best film to end the year with
","Thrill ride to the extreme! Never a dull moment as it moves quickly and without long winded character expositions that have dragged down previous DC films. The underwater visuals are the gold standard here, much like Avatar did eons ago, and the action is just as breathtaking. Most of the dialogue was uninspired hero encouragement (like lesser ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and without the same emotional weight). There are a few questionable scenes/concepts that may cause some brain cells to drown themselves.<br/><br/>My main complaint is the audio mixing, primarily with the dialogue being way too low compared to the bgm most of the time. Compounding this, they add an echo-like effect for underwater scenes, which sounds like an immersive idea but only makes the words less clear and not easily understandable.<br/><br/>But if you see one last film this year, you can't go wrong with this."
"ElliesWonder","8","3","5","22 December 2018"," A typical heroic movie
","This is a very typical DC heroic story, it's straightforward and predictable, but I really appreciated the brilliant underwater world CGI, it's so mysterious and fantastic. The plots run a little slow and stupid in the beginning, but climax and underwater battles are much compacted and excited later.<br/><br/>In my very own opinion, I don't like the aquaman because the character is arrogant sometimes yet self-abased inside because he knew himself is a half breed, and the cinemagraph world also insulted him by that. I have no idea why the beautiful princess would treat him differently from the beginning? Probably every hero has a hallo, and only heroine can see. As a girl, I admire the beauty of Mera, her red hair is so charming, and the texture is so fairly flowing in the water. I really appreciated movie creator's works by giving this effect!<br/><br/>Lastly, such a shame, underworld killed their own kind before revenge the surface."

I didn't know before the movie that stars like Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Williem Dafoe, Temuera Morrison and Dolph Lundgren was in it. So i was amazed just by that. And to see Dolph Lundgren in a movie like this again was great. Jason Momoa as Aquaman really works. Played by anyone else i think it would have just felt silly.

","Being a DC fan, it was tough to see the way DCEU was going. It had ups with Man of Steel and wonder woman, and it's low with Suciede squad.
But The king of Atlantis stands apart from all the other DCEU movies to be one of the best DC movies ever made. Visually rich, with a great cinematographic experience and Vision of James Wan, Aquaman is a rebirth of DCEU.
Scenes are spectacular, Acting is at its top with this movie. Jason momoa as Aquaman was perfect in every sense, so as patrick wilson, Amber heard and Nicole kidman.
But the reason of success of movie is a wan himself. Wan's vision to show the world with a vibrant color is noteworthy and to be very frank, deserves a nomination at most of the awards show.
Altogether, VFX makes it so rich and exprerience in 3D makes the deep ocean and action sequence much more vibrant and rich.
World of DC is much more imaginative than MCU and tough to represent. To show the hope of superman, justice of wonder woman, darkness of Batman, speed of flash and brilliance of cyborg, Aquaman gave a base on which Epic mega-structure of DC is possible to be made.
King of oceans is here and you will definetely love it."

A horribly stereotypical movie. 1 dimensional black guys villians, women characters whose exposed breasts speak louder than their words. This is not the 60s anymore. At least they didn't do blackface.<br/><br/>4. The black villian subplot is a waste of screen time and can be removed with absolutely NO effects to the movie<br/><br/>5. Problematic source material means overuse of CGI. It feels more like an Xbox / computer game than a movie.<br/><br/>6. Insipid shallow dialog. Everyone is treated as a 5 year old. Just a step up from hulk smash.<br/><br/>7. Costume design is hilarious. Look like star wars Storm troopers or something clobbered together in 5 minutes. Leathery fin on Nicole Kidman's back like see Halloween swimming costume? Seriously<br/><br/>You do better, hell lot better than that.<br/><br/>8. Unnecessary plot holes. Where's the almighty BFG gifted to the black villian? Not used at all. Wasting audience time.<br/><br/>9. Queen reunites with illegitimate hubby at the end. So there's going to be more Aquaman children running around in the future? Please, tie up all your plot holes and prevent necessary jokes.<br/><br/>10. You remember the soundtrack of the movie inception. Aquaman? What, there is even a soundtrack? Totally nonexistent / insipid / uninspiring audio makes it difficult to connect to a movie already hard to begin with.<br/><br/>11. There is zero character transformation of the hero from beginning to end. Still the same old beer swagging tattoo bar brute than a ""King"". What, he is perfect as he is? What sort of an origin story is this<br/><br/>12. The jokes are not funny. Bar scene joke is more of a distraction than adding value.

It was so entertaining, the visuals were like nothing else you've ever seen, the story was coherent (well done DC) the action never stops yet doesn't get exhausting, the pacing is perfect, even the 'back in time' scenes slot in well and never become dull, and they are usually an annoyance of mine! Mera is a strong and awesome female character, without them having to shove feminism down your throat, Kidman, Defoe and Lungdren are superb, as os Wilson, Moama naturally and rightly steals the show ... There's not much else to add really, to pull off an underwater movie like Waan has done here is a true feat, I just hope people go and see it and haven't been put off by previous offerings from DC (even though I have personally liked them all) if you come out of this movie not having truely enjoyed it, you are either biased to a scary level or are dead inside!<br/><br/>If you want to be picky, the 'selfie' scene joke falls flat and it gets a bit busy in the end underwater battle scene, but if any of that bothers you, you've gone in to it with a negative attitude and looking for issues!"

Finally a big screen film of ""Aquaman"", and much different from my memory of fish man as with Jason Momoa's take this superhero looks more like a heavy metal weight lifting super star! And the film is filled with plenty of action scenes and the ""CGI"" and special effects are plenty. Still aside from all of the big stuff it's a good origin story of how his parents meet and how ""Aquaman"" comes about. And it's a journey of sibling conflict and war under sea as the kingdom and water country of Atlantis is at risk and along the way Mera(Amber Heard) gives support as King Orm is a big threat to underwater peace. Thru it all Aqua's mom Atlanna(Nicole Kidman) is an underwater spirit that's still present for things to stay afloat.

"vidhyasagarm","4","4","8","16 December 2018"," AQUAMAN is greatly confused whether to make us laugh or to makes us feel!!!
","""Call me the ocean master!"" King Orm (Patrick Wilson), the villain in James Wan's Aquaman, portentously shouts at the outset of the film's climactic scene. Warner Bros.'s latest attempt to shift its DC brand away from the dour machoism that marked (and marred) such films as Man of Steel embraces high fantasy, but for Wan and screenwriters David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, this turns out to mostly mean having characters proclaim their silly comic book names as assertively as possible. ""I'm Black Manta!"" growls Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the film's other supervillain. Instead of a deep, detailed world, what Wan's undersea fantasy constructs is a series of scenes, often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, that seem to dare the viewer to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero.<br/><br/>This defensive posture was evident in the calculated decision to cast the at once beautiful and threatening Jason Momoa as the man who talks to fish. Aquaman, whose unassuming alter ego is Arthur Curry, is introduced in the film with a fight on board a Russian submarine, a sequence in which Momoa, in close-up, practically snarls directly into the camera as he hurls pirates into bulkheads. That'll teach the audience to make fun of Aquaman.<br/><br/>
But there's plenty more in Aquaman that will provoke unintentional laughter. It's less that the world presented here-with its fish-human hybrids, legendary kings, and coveted tridents-is inherently funny, and more that the film rushes through its story at such a breakneck pace that viewers never have a chance to settle into it, to see it as a lived-in universe. After a while, it all begins to feel arbitrary. We have little time to process the functioning of water-based laser rifles before we're introduced to fish people in brightly colored togas, or to a stone-faced Willem Defoe wearing a onesie and a top-knot.<br/><br/>The film's origin story resembles that of mythological superheroes like Thor and Wonder Woman, in which a superpowered being awkwardly adjusts to an unfamiliar environment. (One is tempted to call Aquaman a fish-out-of-water story.) Arthur is the child of Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), part of the ruling family of the fabled underwater city Atlantis, and a human man (Temuera Morrison). After his mother is forced to return to Atlantis, Arthur grows up with his father in Maine, isolated from the undersea kingdom that is his birthright, until Mera (Amber Heard) arrives on shore to convince him to return and prevent the war Orm and her father, Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), are planning against the humans on the surface. Although, and in standard hero's-journey fashion, Arthur initially refuses Mera's call for help, he's soon compelled to take up her cause after a tidal wave nearly kills his father.<br/><br/>
A bounty of CG-heavy action scenes follow, from hand-to-hand combat in an underwater colosseum, to a chase through a Sicilian village, to a full-fledged confrontation of armies on the ocean floor. At its best, the film's underwater action, with its traveling shots that zoom through crowds of fantastical marine species and past moss-encrusted classical ruins, are vibrant, aesthetically engrossing spectacle. A few shots in particular stand out for their compositional flair, such as Mera and Arthur's climactic kiss against the chaotic backdrop of a raging undersea battle, and one which frames the couple swimming toward the bottom of the frame as a horde of Lovecraftian fish-monsters coalesce behind them and give pursuit.<br/><br/>At its weakest moments, however, the film offers a parade of ocean-floor vistas that evoke the substanceless world-building of George Lucas's second Star Wars trilogy, a supersaturated digital landscape of smooth surfaces and expensive-looking designs. Aquaman exacerbates-almost by design-some of the worst tendencies of today's superhero movies. The weightlessness of fights rendered with CG is compounded by that of fights between people suspended in water, and the sexlessness of superhero movies is only emphasized by the perfunctory romance between two leads who seem to have been cast largely because they look good dripping wet.<br/><br/>
The best point of comparison for Aquaman is Black Panther, another superhero movie about a king of a forgotten realm reclaiming his throne. But whereas Ryan Coogler's surprisingly affecting superhero film restored weight to both the choreography and the drama of the genre, Aquaman remains adrift, so much fantasy flotsam and jetsam floating before our eyes."
"erhanachmad","8","4","8","16 December 2018"," MCU 'FANBOY' PERSPECTIVE
","Lets make it clear, this IS the BEST DCEU movie so far! The visual is out of this world. There's not really a boring scene of this movie, there are some but it didnt feel like dragging. there's something quite satisfying to see Black Manta on live action movie, but even though its arguably the coolest looking dude in the movie, his story is really shallow. He's just there to kill Aquaman. idk about comic book but it seems like he should've, i dont know, a little bit more important ( i dont know if this is the right word to use or not) to the story. Also there's some kinda romance between Aquaman and Mera that feel forced, like its kind of cringeworthy a little bit at some part. other than those things, its definitely very good movie, the final battle felt huge and amazing. Aquaman is really struggling before he have the trident. definitely recommended, i even think this should have higher rating than WW. its just my humble opinion though.

James Wan provides exceptional quality as a director who has been directing films with horror genres, challenged to handle different genres.
The actors in the film Aquaman also gave outstanding performance and were in line with the expectations of the fans considering that for some things, films with super hero genre were very difficult to accept if those who played them did not meet the expectations of the audience.
Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are suitable choices for acting as Orm and Black Manta.
The audio visual effects produced by this film are also very extraordinary and dialogues are given if we look as if they are talking in the water but in the appropriate tone.
What is lacking in this first film is the showtime of characters like Black Manta who are not too prominent. But I'm sure if this film has a sequel, then the showtime of characters like Black Manta can be extended."

Honestly the way Wonder Woman was stupidly shown being a badass by deflecting bullet..I mean what!..Here Wan actually gives amazing contextual scenes to Mera and Queen Atlanna...Especially showing Mera as smart and powerful in ACTUAL BAD SITUATIONS and not for the sake of it!
And Queen Atlanna as a protective and powerful Mother and Wife!<br/><br/>Realistic Action Sequences! I mean the sensibility of the fact that Arthur jumping from a rooftop and not landing on his feet almost all the time shows that being a hero does not mean you can do it! Also there are scenes where Arthur also gets beat up and hurt as he should...REALISTICALLY SPEAKING!<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY IS OTHER WORLDLY!<br/><br/>CONS-
If you have to honestly nitpick anything then I would say it would be the music in some scenes and the little backstory of Black Manta and King Orm.I felt they should have been given more stuff...but since its James Wan I believe he will unfold more about them in Aquaman 2!!<br/><br/>Finally try and watch it in IMAX 3D if possible with your friends and family its the most entertaining movie of the year!"

"alindsay-al","8","5","11","19 December 2018"," A Great Unique comic book film
","I have been anticipating this film for a long time and now Aquaman has come and I thought this was a great film that hopefully gets the DC Universe back on its feet. The premise of the film sees Arthur Curry having to travel to Atlantis to stop his half brother from waging a war on the surface world. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman and I think he is really great in this film, he is very charismatic in this film and has a real presence about him. His character has alot of development and depth added to him in this film that improve from his previous appearance in Justice League. The supporting cast all do a great job aswell, Amber Heard plays Mera and she is a much betetr character here then she was in her scene in Justice League. She was more bright and interesting in this film with a unique personality that really worked with her and Mamoa's chemistry that was great to watch on screen. Patrick Wilson plays Orm/ Ocean Master and he was a great villain for this film, he has got similarities to Loki and Killmonger but I thought he did a good job in this film to give the audience a possibly layered villain that makes there confrontation more intersting. I also thought, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren & Willem Dafoe did a really good job with their roles as the more experienced actors on show. Another shoutout is the character of Black Manta who looks amazing on screen and was an interesting character, however, he wasn't in the film enough to leave me fully satisfied by his character. The story is interesting seeing this guy having to step up for a society he isn't really accepted in, plus I do find a sibling rivalry to be very interesting. But this films plot is very bloated, they try to fit so much story into this film that certain elements such as Black Manta get lost in the shuffle and end up not getting the attention that they needed. The script is great, the drama is well done and provides some pretty emotional moments, also the humour in the film came across well and felt pretty natural to me. The style of the film is a huge talking point in this film and i must say that mostly it looks amazing. Seeing these beautiful underwater fight scenes and cities is great and it felt like were beingintroduced to a new community. Though especially at the beginning of the film the CGI isn't completely up to par and takes you out of the film but it improves as the film progresses. Overall Aquaman is another hit for DC after Wonder Woman and is definitley worth a watch maybe even in 3D."

The most beautiful cgi that I have ever seen in a movie. I mean everything looks real.<br/><br/>When you compare Zack footage of Arthur, Mera and Vulko, you will notice that it is cheap compared to the great costumes James has given us (Sorry Zack, I love you.. but your Mera looked ridiculous).<br/><br/>The characters are strong in this one, not a single character was bad. The actors did an amazing job especially Jason Momoa, Amber Heard and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.<br/><br/>A lazy director would cut some of the fight scenes but James is not lazy. Almoat every few minutes there is an epic scene. He also added some of the elements he used in his previous movies. The Horror element and the use of song made me feel that I am watching Fast and Furious.<br/><br/>The score is wonderful, especially Black Manta's theme and the Kingdom of Atlantis theme...<br/><br/>I don't usually say this, but Aquaman is the best comic book movie in 2018 and it is better than Avengers: Infinity War."

"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","2","3","13 October 2019"," Everything is 'awesome'...
","Or so Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) seems to think, considering he uses that word to describe things several times. Aquadude is the offspring of Nicole Kidman's Atlantean Queen, Atlanna (lots of things start with 'Atlan' in the aquatic city of Atlantis, apparently) and human lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison, who we first meet in creepily de-aged form, but later appears normal. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman just seems to change hair colour from blonde to grey to signify the passage of time). Both actors try to sell the whole 'star-crossed lovers' thing (with mixed results), there's some humour (ever wanted to see Nicole Kidman slurp up a goldfish?), but the beginning's stand-out moments come from watching Kidman's Atlanna kick major butt. Nicole Kidman: Action Star...who'da thunk it? Blah, blah, seemingly-dead-parent origin story, blah. There's nothing really 'new' here (and it pales in comparison to Wonder Woman's origin story).<br/><br/>Things pick up once we're introduced to adult Arthur, who battles a bunch of pirates, including a father/son duo who tries to kill Arthur (learning just how tough he is in the process). They end up needing his help, but he leaves, thus quickly establishing Aquadude as a 'different' type of superhero (yet somehow still less of a jerk than Batfleck or Neck-snapper). Naturally, the son swears revenge against him for his father's death. Dude, your motivation is CRAP. As Arthur rightly points out, you guys got YOURSELVES into this mess/killed innocent people, and then blame *him* for your father dying when it was HIS OWN actions that led to his fate? You get no sympathy from me.<br/><br/>Arthur proves he's not totally ruthless in a funny moment where you think the typical barroom brawl is going to break out, but instead it's just fans seeking a selfie. Flashbacks to kid Arthur show that he learned to communicate with marine life at an early age (and show those who made jokes about him 'talking to fishes'), then later ones feature his mentor/trainer, Vulko (Willem Dafoe), teaching him how to use his gifts both underwater and on land.<br/><br/>Things REALLY kick up a notch once Princess Mera (Amber Heard, complete with long flowing bright red hair, impressive butt-kicking skills and cleavage to match) enters the picture. Their history/previous encounter in Justice League feels a bit vague, but they get to know each other and Arthur soon learns her skills are equal to his (but with extra neat water-controlling abilities). They snark/bicker, save each other, and naturally this eventually leads to underwater snogging.<br/><br/>Heard impresses as Mera, showing her character to be brave, intelligent, funny (her snarkiness towards Arthur is fun, but her expressions she makes at him are even better. Then there's the flower-eating...) and worthy of becoming a Queen...but, of course, this is Arthur's story, so everything's about characters wanting HIM to become King (even though he doesn't want to)...or in the case of his half-brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), trying to PREVENT that from happening. Meanwhile, they've got perfectly good King material in Mera!<br/><br/>Momoa grunts and groans his way through the movie, getting tossed around countless times and seemingly 'severely injured' a bunch...only for him to basically shrug it all off. Once you realise any injuries he sustains will barely slow him down, any sense of 'danger' fades away. Really, that goes for basically ALL the characters (except cannon fodder, of course). It gets a bit ridiculous how often characters *should* be dead, but seem fine. It kind of kills any 'weight' the fights might have.<br/><br/>Some are pretty neat to watch, though, like Mera's Italy rooftop chase (though apparently they still haven't learned from the 'destruction porn' of MoS, as there's SO MUCH property damage here), but others are less so, such as the CGI-heavy underwater battle at the end that just winds up losing all meaning after a while. That's not to say that the visuals aren't impressive. The creatures on display are quite a wonder to behold (Julie Andrews voicing a an enormous sea beast is probably something nobody realised they needed/wanted, but *will* after they see it). It's just that the battle blurs together/goes on too long.<br/><br/>Much better are 'smaller' fight scenes, like the aforementioned Atlanna fight and Italy fight, then there's a wee bit of 'horror' during the trench scene, which is welcome. Too bad things got overblown at the end. Still, it's no wonder this movie has taken so long to be made, considering the fact that technology/effects have probably taken this long to reach a point where these underwater scenes can be brought to life as believably as they are. They might not entirely convince, but there are certain moments where you forget this is an effects-heavy world and just lose yourself in the majesty of the underwater kingdom.<br/><br/>There's no really 'memorable' theme here (unlike Wonder Woman's, which remains the best/most memorable theme from ALL of these DCEU films), but there's some decent music sprinkled through the movie, both in the score and the choice of songs used (Roy Orbison's 'She's A Mystery To Me' makes an unexpected, yet very welcome/fitting, appearance. The end credits song isn't as 'rock 'n' roll' as you might expect from Aquadude, but also manages to fit well, given that it's his parents' love story which bookends the film).<br/><br/>Momoa mightn't be the best actor out there, but he gets by a lot on his charm/likeability and is ably supported by Heard, who ensures Mera isn't just a 'love interest'. She too is a hero, and like Wonder Woman's Steve Trevor, doesn't 'steal' the spotlight from the 'title' character, but rather 'shares' it with him. Speaking of Wonder Woman, that film's still easily the best one of the DCEU by a country mile, but this movie isn't bad either. It's certainly more fun than MoS or BvS. Give Batfleck and Neck-snapper a break for a while, DC. Wonder Gal and Aquadude can take it from here."

There is no real plot, we are told the outcome in the first 3 minutes, Nicole Kidman has a fish suit that appears to age, there is no real explanation of what she had been doing for the 20 odd years that she went off grid. Bottom line, the film is complete fantasy with strange humour thrown in amongst gruesome fifer scenes. Very disjointed, almost as though 3 children had conspired to outdo each other then random bits of each story were cobbled together. BUT I actually enjoyed it."
"redcanofevil","7","2","3","12 June 2019"," Better than Justice League atleast
","I always have a soft spot while reviewing and rating comic book movies and this will be no exception. I was one of those who believed Aquaman wouldn't be anything special, and even though it earned over a billion dollar pandering to a select demographic I wasn't wrong.<br/><br/>For every step this movie takes in the right direction, it rewards itself a flaw that in the end brings it back to where it started. Let's start with the story, it is surprisingly an almost faithful adaptation of the ""Throne of the Atlantis"" without any of the Justice league; and if you watched the Snyder-Whedon travesty you'll know it's a good thing. A linear but enjoyable storytelling that isn't convoluted with exposition heavy dialogues nor peppered with the 90's laugh track. Being a fairly simple plot it enjoys the freedom of incorporating elementary gimmicks that is enjoyable for the whole family but wouldn't necessarily leave a bad taste for movie purists either. And as a result Aquaman doesn't shy away from taking a hearty approach to make the titular character more relatable and lovable. Aquaman ironically worked best when it pandered to the 12 year olds and played its strong suit of heart, emotion and family.<br/><br/>As simple as the storytelling and plot is, the script is indifferent. I would have a hard time believing this wasn't actually written by a 12 year old. You hear a line and if you can't immediately guess the comeback you really haven't been seeing movies much lately. The script has to be one of the most generic stacks of line ever put together in a billion dollar movie.<br/><br/>The jokes are minimal and are not bombarded after every 10 seconds, which doesn't make the J-bombs decent though. Most of the time they're not even funny but you'll still crack a smile a few times because your inner 12 year old is still alive inside you. One thing I have to appreciate is how they don't ruin heartfelt emotional scenes with a joke, which has become quite the CBM tradition nowadays.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely delighted with the cinematography; it's pretty rough around the edges and really hard to believe this was by James Wan. This is a type of movie that could've been made by literally any director and if you didn't know who it is by, you never could've guessed it. Everything about this movie lacks originality and you can't help but feel it quite often. There are some undoubtedly cool shots here and there like the trench diving scene or waterfall scene but those are too few and far between. The awkward camera pans made it feel like a Hindi TV serial at times. Hugely disappointed that James Wan allowed all these bloated mess of a camera work in the final edit.<br/><br/>The score was nonexistent, aside from the Toto remix by Pitbull I can't seem to remember any sound even slightly resembling a theme or tone. CBM's really needs a decent score to pump up the juices, which Aquaman offered none. The pacing as I mentioned earlier is actually quite satisfying, which doesn't drag on and overstay its welcome in the slightest.<br/><br/>This is the part where the aforementioned ""one step forward- one step back"" quote comes to play. The costume design for Aquaman, Orm and Manta were absolutely impeccable. Emphasis on the word impeccable as I never could've conceived that they could make the corny looking orange outfit so badass on screen, the prop obviously goes to Jason for pulling it off but I'll come to him in a bit. Mera also had her comic accurate leotard on and not gonna lie looked really well on Amber Heard. But for every good costume design there are also few horrendous ones. The white Atlantean suit looked beyond ridiculous and cheap. It reminded me of those henchmen in the old Power Rangers series, and not in a good way. The terrible wig of Nicole Kidman was too bad to ignore, Amber wore her wig better although it's just the longer end of the same straw.<br/><br/>The CGI in this movie was painfully inconsistent; some amazing underwater scene gets totally overshadowed by a stack of utter disgraceful CGI work. I am sure the slow-mo Mera jumping off buildings during the Black Manta chase sequence is a perfect example how rough the edges really were. On the contrary the visuals were actually quite delightful and the backgrounds selected pleasant. The sea creatures looked as good as how bad the CGI looked. The trench creatures played in accordance with James's horror root and looked pretty good.<br/><br/>Some of the biggest surprises I got from the movie were actually due to the acting. You got more renowned actors like Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Amber Heard and on the other side relative lesser known creds like Dolph Lungdren (not exactly lesser known, but stereotyped), Jason Momoa, and Yahya Mateen. And guess which side did a better job! I always believed Jason Momoa cannot carry a whole movie himself, and he brutally proved me wrong. He practically carried the whole movie for me. If Aquaman was someone other than Momoa I don't think the rating would've been what I gave, it could've easily been far less. He pumped the charisma up to eleven and even managed to rock that goofy orange outfit like a total badass. Honestly though, most of the points I gave are because of Manta, Orm and Momoa.<br/><br/>As for the villains, lets just get it out the way: Aquaman had the best villain adaptations so far in DCEU. Manta was exactly how I know him to be, down to his iconic outfit in a proper adaptation. Although he was fairly underutilized and sidelined I can't wait to see him pop back up in the sequels. Yahya did some sweetass work properly portraying Black Manta and deserves more praise.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is silently becoming a household name each year and his role in Aquaman cements his case. He naturally blended in with the character like no ones business, and actually added subtle nuances. Orm looked, behaved and sounded just perfect, where he easily could've been a Luther, an Ares or even a *Honka Honka*. Props to the costume design team for the faithful recreation of the iconic facemask and cowl and finally doing justice to the rogues of DC universe. I am also kinda glad he wasn't made out to be a power-hungry one dimensional stereotype (even though he was sort of) right in his first outing.<br/><br/>Now for the terrible acting, Dafoe wins it by a mile with his most horrendous acting ever, really hurts seeing such a talented actor just be there to cash in. Nicole kidman was a step up but nothing extraordinary. You can blame the script she was given and I'd agree with you. Mera on the other hand was definitely the better among the trio having more screen time and a better script to work on, but as I said, nothing that speaks volume.<br/><br/>For a superhero movie Aquaman doesn't have many fights to showcase. I didn't like any DCEU action sequence other than the warehouse scene in BVS and maybe it's just me but overall it was below subpar. The first Orm Vs Momoa was bland and contained no gravity and the stakes felt artificial. The final encounter was better in every way which unfortunately was abrupt. So aside from the Manta fights there is absolutely nothing that Aquaman offers that begs a rewatch.<br/><br/>For all the highs and lows Aquaman was quite enjoyable to me; more than I thought was possible. It had a good heart and was brimming with a weird innocence that I appreciate. I can't stop thinking how better this movie could've been if they paid more attention to the little stuffs. But I can say for sure this was a onetime movie and really has no merit to secure a second watch. But hey lucky for them, it worked out just fine.<br/><br/>RATING: 6.5/10"

Even though it is shorter than the ridiculous 3hr+ run time of Batman vs Superman, it still feels like too much. Normally, I wouldn't complain. I'm an avid movie-goer and would generally enjoy watching a lengthy story, but the 2.5hr length of this film made me groan and wonder when it will be over. Had it been a better film that kept me on the edge of my seat in excitement, I wouldn't even have noticed but this felt like all the epic grandeur of a Star Wars adventure minus the thrills and excitement, and that risks the onset of boredom. The story itself is needlessly complex and burdened by the weight of too many secondary sub-plots. We get it. Aquaman is discovering his destiny. He's on a mission to reclaim his rightful place as heir to the throne of Atlantis. That's a pretty straight forward story. Go with that. Why they had to introduce all these extra elements and side missions is beyond me.
It genuinely seemed like the producers wanted to incorporate as much of the comic book mythos as possible in the span of one film. It felt like they went out of their way to get all the locations, all the characters and species of creatures and mortals alike, in the comic books and highlight them in the film. It's almost as if they anticipated the criticisms of comic book and superhero purists who would challenge them on their choices and sought to go out of their way to ensure that those groups would catered to, and as a result, it felt forced. For instance, not only did you have Aquaman's plot to reclaim Atlantis, but you also have wars between several different races of underwater people resulting from the politics of this imaginary place we're only briefly aware of, as well as a sub-plot focused on the revenge of a black-ops mercenary turned laser-faced super villain named Black Manta (who just felt tacked on and unnecessary btw). The film also features gladiatorial combat involving sea creatures (which post-Thor Ragnarok felt like a rip-off). Heck it even had a giant Octopus playing tribal war drums. I'm not joking. The story was silly. Basically, Aquaman must reclaim his rightful place as the heir to the throne of Atlantis but in order to do that he has to go to a particular place to find a thing, so that he could take the thing to the other place to do the other thing. All the while fighting Atlanteans, and humans, and super-villains, and naval sub-marines, and simultaneously remembering all of the super-secret training he received from Willem Dafoe, to become an Atlantean Warrior, which we are slow-drip fed via flashbacks throughout the film. Oh and he falls in love. Of course.
Frankly, I would have preferred if they had split it into 2 films or condensed it by cutting out a lot of the extra stuff that did not move the film forward at all. Aquaman can talk to animals, he can ride waves, he can summon sharks and whales, and control the element of water and do cool stuff with it but none of these special powers are ever used when the need arises. If he can summon a school of killer sharks to do his bidding, then why doesn't he just summon them to eat his enemies and be done with it?
As far as acting, Jason Mamoa, just doesn't have any skills. He's good at flexing his muscles and looking intimidating, which, I guess, is good enough for a superhero film. His best asset is his looks. It's when he has to deliver lines that he looks awkward and out of his element (no pun intended). His portrayal of Aquaman is a very sharp contrast to the traditional look of character. One wonders where the line is drawn on the look of a superhero. For instance, Batman looks like Batman. He has a cowl and pointy ears and Superman has a red cape and blue tights, much like how Superman is traditionally supposed to look. So then why did DC/Warner opt to portray Aquaman as a tattooed biker that probably smells like fish instead of dressing him in green and orange tights with fish scales on them?"

","Review:
I was surprised to see that this movie is in 21st place in all-time box office takings because I really didn't think that it was that amazing. Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman, but the script was awful, and the music throughout the film REALLY got on my nerves. Some of the scenes looked great, especially on the big screen, and the few witty moments were delivered well from Momoa but I found the core of the plot to be predictable and a bit annoying in places. The whole ""step-brother wanting to gain the power to control the seas"" theme was weak, and Aquaman's sidekick, Mera (Amber Heard), seemed to take centre stage during the important parts of the concept, more than Momoa. Dolph Lundgren put in a decent performance as King Nereus, alongside Patrick Wilson (King Orm), but that Fly looking ""Baddie"", Manta (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) was completely useless, and the acting was terrible. I liked the relationship between Aquaman and his father Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison), but Nicole Kidman seemed a bit out of place, as Atlanna. Visually, it was a great achievement because it must have been hard to make the characters look like they were actually underwater, and some of the action scenes were put together well, but it's really Momoa's fresh acting style, that saved the day. He would have been great in a Marvel movie, but now he's stuck with DC's Aquaman, it really could do with Ragnorak's director, Taiki Waititi, touch. With all that aside, it is a decent watch, and it's much better than some of the movies that have come out of DC's camp, but it wasn't memorable and I'm glad that I didn't pay top dollar to watch it in the cinema. With a sequel due to come out in 2022, it's a shame that the same director is making the movie because I can't see it being dramatically different from this one. Now that Aquaman is king, there are many different avenues that they can take the character, but I don't think that the director is willing to take many risks, in terms of wit and really letting Momoa loose. Judging by the scenes after the credits, it's obvious that Manta is returning to revenge his dad, and the fact that King Orm is in a room with a view, I'm sure that he will be returning to gain the throne but it really needs a charismatic character to make this movie something to remember. Anyway, it's worth a watch, especially if you're a comic book fan, but I preferred Wonderwoman. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by James Wan, who brought you Saw in 2004, Dead Silence, Death Sentence starring Kevin Bacon, Doggie Heaven, Insidious 1 & 2, The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Fast & Furious 7. He has quite a versatile filmography, which was originally based on horror mysteries, so he was a questionable choice to bring this epic movie to the big screen. He also produced all of the Saw movies, Annabelle, Demonic, Lights Out, Jigsaw, Annabelle: Creation, The Nun and the Curse of La Llorona, so he has a passion for the supernatural genre. As this is the highest grossing movie from DC, including all of the Batman movies, it certainly passed all expectations, especially after the disappointing Justice League movie. I just hope they cut down on the visuals, and concentrate on a decent plot for the sequel.<br/><br/>Budget: $160-$200million
Worldwide Gross: $1.15billion<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi
Cast: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison, Lundi Lin, Michael Beach and Randall Park. 5/10"
"mikyb21","5","2","3","7 May 2019"," CGI on Steroids
","Wanted to enjoy this film but couldn't. Just about every aspect of the film let me down. Could not stop feeling like I was watching a PS4 game. Mamoa was about the only charming character, and just barely. All the supporting cast offered no support. I simply cannot recommend this film, even as a dumb popcorn film.
DC needs to up its game and spend more budget on writing and acting, and less on CGI."
"CinematicGarbage","4","2","3","1 May 2019"," It's not a waste of popcorn to be brought to this movie
","Aquaman (2018) is the latest movie directed by the director of Saw (2004), Insidious (2010), The Conjuring (2013),.., James Wan. He's known as one of the most talented modern movie directors. I haven't seen his horror movies but I saw a few clips and they were scary. And now, he took a challenge on a superhero movie: Aquaman (2018).
Starring Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Amber Heard as Princess Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master/Orm, Willem Dafoe as Vulko. I'm okay with how they acted, there's nothing bad but the problem is that the screenplay was really childish, making the acting a bit childish. In that case, Jason just made Aquaman not really one true king but more like one funny king.
The plot is about a man arthur curry born by a father from the land and a mother from the sea. When his mother went away, he heard that he had a brother, who tried to conquer his mother's land Atlantis and he had to stop his brother to be king. A bit childish right? I saw many superhero plots are like this and this is quite normal and sometimes too easy. I really like the jokes they had done to the movie. I laughed at many scenes, especially when Arthur realized that peeing on the...(I don't know how to call it) a thing is much better then Mera taking his sweat from his forehead into...that thing. It made me giggled.
""Showoff! You could have just peed on it!""
--Aquaman--
The action scenes were quite epic as Atlantis looked better than a paradise with underwater technology and high-tech ships and other transports. People wore robotic armors and creative weapons. The battles are quite unforgettable with stunts here and there and also explosions and disasters.The CGI was mind-blowing and jaw-dropping. It was surpring that the budget was just $200 million but the box office had crushed a lot: $1,147 billion. But for the CGI, Aquaman (2018) wouldn't have had its box office so high like this. It was totally worth a good DCEU movie. I also liked the costumes: the robotic armor with suitable colours and they even put some on animals like sharks or a few more unreal creatures.
I like the score. It made us feel like we're in a high-tech paradise. Rupert Gregson-Williams did a good job with the original score. It was really good and it sounded like Tron. I had no idea how he made those sounds (as long as it's not orchestra like John Williams). I wasn't just relaxed but I also felt really impressed because it's really satisfying like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle or Black Panther.
I like Aquaman a lot, though it was really childish at the screenplay. It is one of the best, most mind-blowing, jaw-dropping and unforgettable movies in the DC extended universe. I recommend people like wars underwater should watch this movie.
Points: 7.4/10"

","I thought Jason Momoa was extremely bad casting, but then I saw the preview and it looked amazing. So I went in with high hopes. Unfortunately I was right. Momoa doesn't look the part and doesn't have the acting ability to sell himself despite this. He is stiff and awkward.
But it is not just Momoa. Nicole Kidman, who has previously turned in decent performances, makes no effort, even stumbling over her words at times.
Tamuera Morrison does okay, but the horrible makeup and CG on him makes his parts difficult to watch.
But the director has to be the worst offender... what the hell is with the CSI styles stings? and the cringeworthy hair flip as Momoa walks through steam?
The one star is because I couldn't motivate myself to finish watching the movie."

Shades of bad daytime soap opera dialogue and equal acting literally made us laugh, almost with embarrassment to those on screen. The director was completely unqualified for this gig and did his fair share to fuel this dumpster fire. The camera angles were unimaginative, the lighting was contrived and distracting. It very sad that we waited all these years for Aquaman and this is what we get, an absolute clunker and an embarrassment. Bad, bad, bad."

In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.<br/><br/>Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing."

","Aquaman was amazing. It had plenty of thrilling action sequences and a decent soundtrack. The casting for both leads (Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Amber Heard as Princess Mera) were absolutely spot-on. Momoa's excitable attitude and mannerisms authentically made Arthur Curry a smug charismatic badass in every right. Jason Momoa couldn't be a better Aquaman and he played the role perfectly. Princess Mera's collected personality and actions complemented his character well (and vice versa) Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Mera proved themselves as compelling characters with rich and meaningful motives to drive their actions and choices forward. The chemistry between them was equally solid. Aquaman built on Mera's perceptive view and helped her learn to not judge a place or person at first glance; whereas she gave him clarity towards his responsibilities and helped him learn how to become accepting of them and his birthright; helping him to understand that he needed to become Atlantis' king despite the mental deconstruction that he received at the colosseum about how a half-breed Atlantean Human wasn't fit to be king. They both taught one another to look beyond the surface and do what they thought was right for them. These characters built upon one another and gave us believability to their partnership. The storyline itself was solid: a good mix of heart and action. Black Manta was albeit a bit driven-thinking with his heart and not his head; but proved himself as a okay done villan with a sort of dramatic vengeance towards Aquaman. Patrick Wilson's Ocean Master proved better and was the right choice for the main villan. His egotistical pride and arrogance combined with his motives of striking against the surface served him well throughout the movie. His beliefs that Atlants was superior to the surface world due to sophistication and his arrogant pride coincided with this and proved again that every great villan is a hero in his own story. Vulko, Queen Atlanna, and Tom Curry were also well written characters; prominent in their own rights. Aquaman's visuals/VFX were a stunning sight to witness and were surprisingly well done. Atlantis and the various types of sea creatures were precisely crafted (especially the monsters of the trench and the kraken at King Atlan's tomb.) The costumes of Aquaman, Mera, Vulko, and others were surpsingly well done and authentic enough to their comic book counterparts; but also modified to fit a fresh and new take of the cast. However there were a few flaws too; being the teenage actor of Aquaman, the unanswered question of how Arthur and Mera got from the middle of the Sahara to Sicily, Italy despite the close proximity of each location. These flaws among others are noticeable; but not too distracting from an overall enjoyable and exciting story. James Wan did an amazing job as did the cast and crew to make a visual spectacle and a story with both action and heart to provide depth to it's ensemble cast of memorable characters. In short, this is a flawed but extremely enjoyable movie that does Aquaman justice."

","My headline explain everything! This is the 2nd best DCEU movie for me, with all the intense storyline and awesome underwatee CGI.<br/><br/>I give 8, minus Jason Momoa's costume. For me it's too fancy as an aquaman, with all the shiny green and gold. Keep it simple like smallville's aquaman with Jason in it, will make it look more awesome!"
"mightyyendys","9","2","3","29 January 2019"," Spectacular!
","When I heard James Wan was going to direct, I was cautiously optimistic. DC Comic movies are dark and gloomy, the only exception being Wonder Woman.
Then I saw the trailers and knew DC had made the right choice in choosing the man who also directed Fast 7.
Aquaman is easily DC's best movie. In my opinion it bests Marvel's best (apart from Infinity War).
Jason Momoa totally nails it. He is not your everyday comic book hero. He is a beer drinking, fist slugging, rugged, foul mouthed protagonist who develops into something more.
The story is not that special but the way it was executed was what impressed me. The flashback scenes came in at the right times. The action scenes are just so cool and wonderful, hard hitting too!
The visuals just left me gaping. Just imagine Star Wars combined with Avatar and you get an idea of what I'm talking about.
The score was just out of this world! All the actors did a great job. The outstanding ones are Jason Momoa and Willem Dafoe.
The Russo Brothers had better think of a way to top this (Avengers Endgame) cos this movie is the pinnacle of superhero movies!
Thank you, James Wan and Jason Momoa! I am so proud of this movie! Undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies ever made!"

"gracedownie","7","2","3","26 January 2019"," Better than I expected
","With my standard set low, I came in to this film expecting it to be an over processed piece of junk, with the only thing keeping it a float being Jason Momona, aka his body. However this film took me by surprise. They reinvisioned aquaman, making him likable, funny and a rounded (but rough) main character. I felt a depth to his character, and to his female counter part was more than a pretty face as well. She complimented him and was also fitting to the role (once you got pass her devilishly red hair) She also didn't just sit by as he did all the work, she had her share of the battles and did better than aquaman in most of the fights.<br/><br/>In the same way Wonderman knew little of the outside world, she knew little of the above world (although she didn't brush her hair with any forks) She felt a real character and part of the team and it worked well with Aquaman not knowing as much about the undersea world, but it made me wonder how he spent so much time in the ocean and not come across the under water city? Or any other Atlanitans?<br/><br/>Look away now if you don't want any spoilers...<br/><br/>I'm glad you like the spoilers, I like them too.<br/><br/>So things didn't always make sense. Whether it was the badly put together bad guys (really... Black Manta? Seriously) or the war which was waged on a shoe string. The plot was thin and very much like black panther in all honesty, but there was so much going on you didn't have time to think about it.<br/><br/>From new creatures, to the predictable jump scares, to the over the top music, they flooded the screen with one thing after another. Although the funniest thing in the whole movie was the music... and the biggest let down. It took over. One scene was supposed to be romanic and they had no speaking, only the music to carry the scene along. It felt out of place and out of touch. Very much like guardians of the Galaxy 2.<br/><br/>The other let down was in coalition with the music... the zooming in. As if we don't know who the character is or what meaning is it supposed to be without loud drums and sudden shots just of the heros face. It was tacky and over done. It was a problem not carried as much throughout the movie but at the begining it was very over the top, while the ending, well you'll just have to watch it to find out that drama.<br/><br/>So in all I found it funny and really enjoyed it, for the comedy it is.<br/><br/>The film deserves it's place, just under Wonderman, far above Superman but still. It's a comedy, take it for what it is and don't worry. They'll remake the DC world again and hopefully will get it the right balance."
"lurpak","4","2","3","26 January 2019"," The Aquaman Game
","While watching this film my sone and I devised the Aquaman game. The premise is simple. You watch this film with a timer running and a pen and notepad. Every time you see a line, concept, scene or cliche which is undeniably stolen from another film you write the time and the reference down. The person with the most wins.<br/><br/>The whole film is just scenes from some of the most successful films of all time, strung together in some sort of ""guaranteed formula"" concept of ensuring success, that patently has failed to work.
IIt'snot a bad film, it's not as terrible as people make out, but it has too many plot holes and failures to allow yourself to escape into the universe and put the faults behind you to make any real constructed frame which makes the film whole. But, no joke its like watching every film you have ever seen before strung into one, with scenes from star wars, Warcraft, harry potter, game of thrones, how to train your dragon,""King Arthur"", Avatar, Finding Nemo, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean, Hercules....and I don't mean these are similar themes, they are full identifiable scenes!<br/><br/>Throughout the film you question choices of rational, like why did the mother stay away so long? it tries to explain, but the answer doesnt make sense?
Overall switch your brain off and enjoy the ride, if you bother to think in the film you will quickly turn into dispising it,"

"ryanwinning1","8","2","3","26 January 2019"," Aquaman was far better than I thought it would be
","Aquaman exceeded my expectations in every way. This is the type of superhero story that I've seen directors in the past get over confident in, and simply tell the story. It appears the director James Wan has seen that far too often and really got creative on how to keep the viewer engaged beyond just the CGI.
The story within the story is how a man who was raised on land, but the powers to live under the sea adapts to living in the abyss for longer than he has before. Some of my favourite moments are when Mera/Amber Heard is adapting to life on the surface, and her acting indicates that she's enjoying her experience on land more than she thought she would.
James Wan has all sorts of little plot twists that helped keep me engaged throughout the whole movie. I would like to see more of that style in the upcoming DC films.
The acting is just OK for me in this film and that's why I didn't score it a 9 or a 10. No one really steals the show, and Jason Momoa has a tough rugged image, but I haven't seen anything from him that would suggests there is an Oscar in his future.
This is a movie you can just sit back and let it entertain you for 2 hours+. I highly recommend the film and I believe this is a cut above the rest of the DC movies I have seen to date other than the Nolan movies."

","What a underwhelming experience this was. Great material completely wasted by poor writing, leading to mediocre acting in a movie that feels rushes from start to finish.<br/><br/>The Aquaman backstory is quite rich in emotionally poising element which are never really exploited. A great example is the honorable relationship between the hero and ocean life in the comics. In the movie, the animals of the sea are reduced to expendable weapons, which Atlanteans do not hesitate to destroy by the hundreds.<br/><br/>Compelling visuals: the CGI is quite good in some aspects and creates an engaging atmosphere but the film relies way too much on it, losing touch with any kind of realism.<br/><br/>Entirely predictable: the script holds no surprise or twist and the dramatic moments are poorly executed, leaving you wishing for a special moment that never comes.<br/><br/>Horrific dialogue: cheesy, contrived and often cringe-worthy.

"philworthington","5","2","3","21 January 2019"," Cheesy, obvious, stupid, fun
","Here's the short version: If I were still a 14 year old boy I would think this was great, but I'm not, so I don't. But it was still fun in a B-movie kind of way.<br/><br/>
Bad points:<br/><br/>1) It telegraphs every plot point, the love interest is obvious, the mother returning is obvious, the victory is obvious. There are no plot surprises in this movie, unless you have never seen a movie before.<br/><br/>2) The plot holes are gaping wide. The Sahara desert sequence is a prime example: two primarily underwater creatures strand themselves in the middle of the world's biggest desert with no water, and no transport.. and then instantly appear in Sicily with no explanation.
Yes, it's really that bad.<br/><br/>3) The dialogue is awful.<br/><br/>4) It suffers from too many villains. The Black Manta would have better saved for a sequel, he is just an annoying distraction here.<br/><br/>5) It relies a bit too heavily on CGI, which just emphasises the 'teen boy fantasy' vibe (although I suppose that's fair if it's the target audience.)<br/><br/>
Good points:<br/><br/>1) It's fun as a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>2) Jason Momoa is fun as Aquaman, in the few moments he's allowed to have any character development he really shines.<br/><br/>3) The final battle is unexpectedly great.<br/><br/>
It's a harmless way to kill a couple of hours, but I suspect it's best watched at home where you can laugh at the bad script with your friends, talk about the crazy plot holes (do Atlatean women always have a change of clothes with them at all times?), and fast-forward the Sahara bit. Not really worth paying to see at the cinema, aside from the end battle."

","Wow...<br/><br/>I have a new least favorite superhero movie.<br/><br/>There were very few ""good"" parts of this movie. The CGI was overdone, and the acting was very subpar. The worst part, though, was the entirely inconsistent physics. It's normal in any fictional universe to have different physics from real life, but it needs to be consistent, and this movie was like the writers and director didn't even think about it. So, when underwater, apparently some things move slower, but others don't. Some things fall slowly, and other things fall like they're in air. It's apparently just fine to stand on something while being propelled through the water, and the water has the same friction as air.<br/><br/>The only way this Aquaman gets anything better than a 4 or 5 is because DC is paying reviewers."

"funtasticfour","7","2","3","3 January 2019"," An impressive feat for a movie that seemed impossible to make!
","Who ever thought Aquaman would get a movie? Or Guardians of the Galaxy or most of the other super hero movies we've gotten. Jason Mamoa is a big presence, but not the best actor, so DC surrounded him with great actors. This is a super cast, and a pretty good story, though it's pretty much what I expected, and a lot more stuffed in, just in case they don't get another chance. I think they will get to do another, but it's going to be hard because we've seen so much in this movie. This movie is fun, and well done, and also clearly a James Wan movie-for those Fast and the Furious watchers, there is a scene ripped right out of Fast Five. The main flaw, and it's hard to fault an underwater movie, is the overuse of CG effects. This is a problem with all DC movies, especially in the third act, and this one overly so. Marvel does CG too, but don't rely on it as much. But it's hard to help it, as I said, with so much under the sea. A lot of it looked great (hair flowing around, some of the huge explosions) Now that I've seen this movie competently done, I can't imagine what can't be done in movies, in the right hands."
"healingtoolbox","9","2","3","3 January 2019"," this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams.
","I think this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams. Audience I saw it with clapped at the end. I tell you: We have not seen such a creative fantasy script and VFX since the last JJ film.<br/><br/>While James and JJ both lack the strong moral compass of Spielberg, excepting this, Aquaman is as creative a fantasy script and VFX as you could hope for. I come from seeing close to every fantasy movie and superhero movie made. I first liked James Wan on the X-Files and have followed his horror films from a distance. James brings a great deal together here. He's working with well-worn tropes but manages again and again to make them seem fresh.<br/><br/>Thor: Ragnarok is the appropriate comparison here, another crowd please, another comic book come to life successfully. Aquaman has more weight and depth than Thor:R due to its hero's journey arc.<br/><br/>I see critics criticizing Aquaman for clashes of tone. When multiple critics say this and I do not, I always wonder how many were simply looking between the screen and checking their emails on their smart phone. I went to art school and have written 44 books where shadings of tone visually and verbally are crucial. Aquaman is a masterful blending of goofy and serious moods. Even an octopus playing multiple drums fits in.<br/><br/>A lesser presence in one or more of the main roles could have sunk this effort. The plot point shuffling of trident fight one ending inconclusively leading to a whole middle section hero's journey to get to the second and final trident fight, is amazing effective to keep the narrative afloat. The drone rooftop chase footage is used to great effect. In a behind the scenes YouTube, James says at a superhero movie the audience should feel like they are learning something from the characters; and, that they inspire us to see our own capacity to do good in our own lives. Aquaman does 9/10 on both of these."
"jyttrup1","8","2","3","3 January 2019"," DC Pulls a Marvel!
","My issue with DC movies since Christopher Nolan's Batman Series has been that they've tried too hard to repackage the dramatic seriousness of those films, and have come up short multiple times. With Aquaman, DC has finally done a great job imitating the tried and true recipe for quality Marvel films... not taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Aquaman isn't supposed to be an overly dramatized superhero. He represents what Batman and Superman don't; a sense of humanity in an otherwise sideways world. With witty humor and a star who you'd be stupid to not want to grab a beer with, Aquaman hits in all the right notes.<br/><br/>James Wan brought to life a completely new vibe for DC films. From the masterful cinematography to the outstanding use of vibrant colors to bring to life the deep sea, nothing feels recycled or over the top.<br/><br/>If I had any drawback at all, it would be that the film kind of feels like a typical superhero movie that's hard to connect with on a personal level. It didn't do an incredible job of demanding your buy-in and emotional connectivity with the characters, and the final battle takes place in a relatively meaningless location, leaving a lot to be desired here.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was brilliantly well done and should quickly become a standard bearer for how DC films of the future should be made!"

","For some reason Fresh Tomatoes and I believe many critics are leaving reviews of this film that lead you to believe that it is not very good. This is not true. This movie is almost as good as Wonder Woman. It stands head to shoulders in quality with Wonder Woman, the recent Batman movies, and the recent Superman movies. It is truly that good.<br/><br/>The way James Wan (the guy behind Dead Silence and other horror movies) and crew have brought Atlantis to life is simply amazing and epic in scope. It reminds me of the depth and quality of Valerian. I felt the same way, watching this, as I did when I watched the first Iron Man movie. I enjoyed this as much as I have enjoyed Iron Man, the Batman movies and Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>It is not perfect by any means, and both my parents thought it was slightly cheesy in parts. I did not. I was thoroughly caught up the scope of the adventure here. I enjoyed this even more than Mortal Engines, yet another gem. I am not a fan of Momoa, and Lundgren is not much better as an actor. Neither of them could act their way out of a wet paper bag. But both were at the top of their game here. Did you even recognize Dolphie in this?<br/><br/>Sadly this movie is being railroaded in my area. They tell me it is brand new, yet they have only one 3D showing, at around 11am -12pm at Regal Cinemas and Cinetopia. Look it up for yourself. Writing this on 1-2-2019, and am in the Vancouver, WA. area. There is some sort of concerted effort between local theaters and the folks at Fresh Tomatoes to destroy this film, to sabotage it, and I have no idea why.<br/><br/>If you have been hesitating you better go and see it in 3D for yourself right now. avoid IMAX if you can, Real 3D has the most comfortable glasses. If you are stuck with IMAX swallow the price tag and uncomfortable glasses. You will not regret it. Trust me. If you loved Wonder Woman, if you enjoyed Valerian, then you will certainly love this movie! It is backed by a number of excellent actors and actresses, and everyone is doing their best in their various roles. This movie is an absolutely stunning epic you do not want to miss.<br/><br/>And if the theaters in your area are not providing afternoon and evening 3D showings, or even 2D showings, you need to speak up. The only way to stop them is to break the silence. Check the disparity in user reviews to the Fresh Tomato score. You will see something is fishy here, no pun intended.<br/><br/>I wish they had let James Wan handle Justice League. That movie truly was a flop. But this one just about makes up for it."

When I heard they were doing Green Lantern I did a happy dance but after watching it however it was bitterly disappointing. I liked Man of Steele and Batman v Superman and thought Wonder Woman was really good. Justice League was just ok with a few really good scenes. Aquaman blew all recent DC offerings away. As many have said, the visuals are spectacular. The acting was great, storyline was great. Jason Mamoa was prefect in the title role. The movie held my interest from start to finish and bulit up pace nicely till the climax. There's always going to be those people, especially those familiar with the character, who will say they could have done better, that's true for every film.

","Read this while listening to Everything I need by Skylar Grey on looping - ðŸŽ§<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/><br/>""There is only one true King"" - Zack Snyder (2015)<br/><br/>I'm really selective when reviewing a film. However, I put an exception on this one. Aquaman (2018) is a mind blown! Simple and powerful performance from the cast is enough to inspire tears or at least goosebumps. This is my third time watching in the theatre, and I rated this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10. The movie is deserved to get my money, and I think I will continue to support it until the 4th time. If u guys know me you guys know that I'm a movie aficionado aka cinephile and a film that has a good combination of cinematography and music will certainly make me enjoy it to the higher level.<br/><br/>I love and enjoyed our Kuching-born underdog Director, Mr. James Wan. I've followed his work since Saw film, and his work in The Conjuring universe is exceptional, his skills in directing is well respected.<br/><br/>Even though DCEU is a ""Second Class"" or B-List while MCU is a ""First Class"" or an A-List type of film, Wan, however, proves that it's possible to rebuild DCEU to a quality film on-par with MCU. Kudos to Mr. Wan because moving towards a right direction, after flops from Justice League (2017), BvS (2016) and Man of Steel (2013), I can guarantee that any DC fanboy will love Aquaman film, and possibly they will cry because of the mind blown cinematic experience. Aquaman (2018) is best rated film (soft reboot) after The Dark Knight (2008), a 10 year progression.<br/><br/>I like the myth of Atlantis, the idea of an advanced, Utopian civilization is intriguing. Some people view Atlantis as fiction while others believed it's real. The mystery around it makes me think deeply there could be a technological advancement that was wiped in history - nothing is lasting forever.<br/><br/>I'm not superheroes/comic fanboy, but Aquaman is a type of movie you'll never miss. Aquaman is one of the masterpiece from DCEU, an emotional ride, and a family drama. James Wan nailed it! Thank you, James Wan! I'm not interested to spoil it, so, Go watch it now!! ðŸ”±"
"Gpanther67","7","2","3","16 December 2018"," Momoa is worth the price of admission, but not the writing
","Poor, poor Aquaman. Has there ever been a more maligned, ridiculed character in comic hero history? As a member of television's Super Friends, he was the least used or seen. Although he has been around since the early 40's and even spawned a more popular Marvel rip-off (Namor), he is probably been one of the least popular super heroes in comics, having canceled title after canceled title. Even Raj, one of the comic loving guys from ""The Big Bang Theory"" famously said ""Aquaman sucks!"". But in recent years, writers have taken him more seriously, making him more powerful and even gaining the public's respect. In ""Justice League"", he was one of the bright spots in the film and because of it he gets his own solo film. I never thought I would see the day when Aquaman would have his very own major motion picture but it is now out. The question is can it help the fledgling DC movie universe or (forgive the pun) sink it?
We learn that Aquaman'a parents were from different worlds; his father a lighthouse keeper from Main and his mother the princess of the underwater nation of Atlantis. He discovers her on the rocks on the seashore, badly wounded. After nursing her back to health, the two fall in love and they have a son, Arthur. When Arthur is an infant, they are attacked by soldiers from Atlantis and his mother is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis. As Arthur grows, he discovers he has powers to communicate with the creatures from the seas. He is taught by his mother's loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko, who trains Arthur to become a warrior, but is rejected by the people of Atlantis because he is a half-breed. After the events of ""Justice League"", Arthur has become a celebrity of sorts and considered a hero in the eyes of many on the surface. But Arthur's half-brother, Orm hails himself as Ocean Master and plans to build an army consisting of the armies of the 7 seas to destroy the surface dwellers for the harm they have caused to the oceans of the world. The daughter of one of the army's leader, Mera reaches out to Aquaman to help her stop his brother and reclaim his rightful birthright as king of Atlantis.
""Aquaman"" is a film that suffers from illusions of grandeur. It wants to be an epic superhero movie but it grinds itself down with silly and clichÃ© scenes and characters. It often tries too hard to be an impressive, all-time great superhero movie and ends up becoming laughable and over-the-top. Director James Wan, who is best known for his horror films like ""The Conjuring"" and ""Saw"" gives us too many jump scares for a superhero movie. I counted four scenes in where a huge explosion or a monster was supposed to incite a reaction from moviegoers. But if you can get through some of the film's major weaknesses, there is a true gem in this film... Jason Momoa. The Hawaiian actor is a star in the making. Just like Gal Godot from ""Wonder Woman"" the producers found a relatively unknown actor and gave him a role that will define him for awhile and one that he brings a lot of charisma and natural screen presence to. Momoa can be funny, truly entertaining without really trying. Early in the film, he has some great fight scenes, which is what he excels at as an action star. The script is not always the strongest, but Momoa makes the best with what he is given. Amber Heard is also strong as Mera but some of the other supporting performers are oddly cast with veteran, capable actors like Willem Dafoe & Nicole Kidman seeming like they are out of sorts and maybe uncomfortable in this film. Patrick Wilson as the main villain, Orm isn't bad but he also won't go down as one of the best comic villains of film. Most exciting is Black Manta, a personal favorite of mine who also provides one of the film's best scenes with his fight against Aquaman. I really wished he was the main villain, but I have a feeling if there is a sequel, we will see him again. The art direction and special effects are also a strength, and the money they spent on those aspects were well spent. But, like so many popcorn films if they had just delivered on a stronger script, this film could have been something special.
""Aquaman"" is not the strongest film of its genre, even though it really tries. It has a great actor to build a solid series around if they can just come up with a better script instead of going with old, tired plots and ideals. I would suggest they make it simple & subtle, not loud & predictable. I had a good enough time to recommend this film for a matinee, but you may find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time. No Raj, Aquaman doesn't suck, but his writers do."

","This movie is one of those that aren't good at all if you analyse them as mere movies, but are actually so stupid at times that they're entertaining. This thing is ridiculously cheesy, over the top, with an extremely basic plot, forced romance and cliches. But I'll take that over something boring any day of the week. Just leave your brain at the door and laugh at the stupidity of it. A perfect example of this is the fact that at least 4 times in the movie someone is taking, only for it to be cut off by an explosion. It's actually hilarious how they do this again and again and again! Gotta say I did like Black Mantas character and some scenes were nice. The fight scenes were ridiculously over the top, especially the last one, but thats fine. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and rightfully so, cause its extremely stupid. And if you wanna enjoy this movie, I suggest you don't take it seriously either. This movie is like a 3/10 but William Dafoe is in it so I'll give it a 4, plus it unintentionally made me laugh more than I'd like to admit.

We couldn't find anything and saw this show up in HBO. So we tried it. Fit the mood exactly! Cheesy, sometimes funny, good visuals and holy crap moments when you see some of the big name actors involved. Wonder if Wilem Dafoe liked his role.

Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule. But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end. Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.

","I didn't believe the reviews. I watched it anyway. I got exactly what I expected out of a DC movie - terrible writing (I mean you think I'm supposed to CARE about what happens to an awful person who murders innocent people ""but he killed my dad!!!1!!""), goofy CGI (although very colorful and creative), and laughable dialogue (not in a good way). I just don't understand how DC just can't quite capture the lightning and write a good story. A bad guy who wants to take over the world is just not enough anymore - DC is stuck in 1997 as far as their writing is concerned.<br/><br/>But the biggest disappointment is the dude himself. It feels like the writers were like ""ehhh just make something up"" and he ad-libbed half of his dialogue...and it was goofy even in context.

"ollywill-08723","6","1","1","4 April 2019"," Average & hollow.
","Aquaman is an ""alright"" movie which relies solely on its breathtaking visuals to maintain the audience's interest; the camera-work is kinetic & inventive & brings a real sense of liveliness to the sequences which are expertly choreographed & shot together harmoniously, as are the enormous battles - akin to James Cameron's Avatar or Star Wars set underwater; the visual effects are groundbreaking, mind-blowing & in abundance throughout - shot in a beautiful IMAX ratio that captures the scale of the film's multiple set-pieces but unfortunately, besides that, all the movie really offers is just mindless visual spectacle...
Granted, the world-building is impressive & the costume & set design really are a sight to behold but all of these things simply add to the slightly superficial feel... Purely aesthetic.
Won't however deny it it was fun to sit through - it's watchable - & Jason Momoa & Amber Heard have great on-screen chemistry but that doesn't excuse the paper thin plot & its total lack of substance underneath, not to mention the plot conveniences which had my eyes rolling, the cringey choices of music, wasted villain with great potential, weird score, forced humour & one-liners etc.
It's messy, convoluted, inconsistent & tries desperately to distract you from these flaws with its only reliable strength or selling point: the CGI."

"moriahseaman","5","1","1","2 April 2019"," Three movies crammed into one, bad dialogue, poor character and plot development
","There's a lot of worthy praise about this movie's visuals and action sequences. The movie really is stunning. Some incredible visuals, truly. That being said, that's about all that's praiseworthy about Aquaman. The character and plot development is either rushed or sorely lacking. It really left me hurting for more. Not in a good way. A few of the one-liners made me chuckle, but most made me cringe or groan. The dialogue is poor and the story seems hastily patched together amidst a deluge of action scenes.<br/><br/>Honestly I was most disappointed because of the incredible potential of this material. Wan really showed incredible imagination, he just crammed way too much into one movie. The incredible potential for Atlantis world-building is clearly there, but it's just blasted through at such a wastefully fast pace. There's enough content for three movies crammed into a span of two and a half hours...<br/><br/>Picture this: (SPOILERS ahead) The first film could have simply introduced Aquaman and Black Manta, two origin stories, as the core of the film. This would allow more time for proper character and plot development. Glimpses of the Atlantis culture could be included, Mera's character could begin investigating this half-breed, assisting Aquaman with his battle against Black Manta, and the end of the film would tease the unrest of the seven kingdoms.<br/><br/>Film two: the war of the seven kingdoms begins. Aquaman is not crowned king yet, but still plays a vital role in protecting the surface-dwelling world. Perhaps Orm remains prince (a minor antagonist) and his father, still alive, is the primary antagonist that stirs conflict. This allows so much more time for world-building and character development for these amazing seven kingdoms.<br/><br/>Potential film three: Orm becomes the main antagonist after the defeat of his father (in film two) and stirs conflict again in the seven kingdoms. Aquaman journeys to the trench to discover his mother, claim the trident, and become king, ending the conflict, defeating Orm, and bringing peace to Atlantis.<br/><br/>This is just spitballing, but my point is that this movie covered WAY too much content in one sitting. Such a waste. So much potential. So much imagination, just horribly paced. I had no TIME to really digest or appreciate anything, since it was flying by at the speed of light. Justice League suffered from the same issue: trying to accomplish too much in one film."

","Marvel has Thor, and he was larger than life, at least while those charming blond curls lasted. Disney has Frozen, and it was all over the place. What could have DC done to prove that it's them who must be the most shiny and sparkling princesses of this realm? The answer is: to make The Most Epic Film Ever!<br/><br/>Imagine putting together Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Black Panther, The Lord of the Rings, TRON, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible, Fifth Element, G.I. Joe, King Arthur, Jurassic Park, and even Shrek to spruce things up a bit. Then crumb a ton of lesser blockbusters and blockbuster wannabes on top. Sounds terrific, ""but will it blend?"" Of course it will! With the new WarnerBro 3000, we could mill this into a uniform, fine-grained mess, with giant seahorses, roaring sharks and blaster-wielding steampunk dudes bestriding them.<br/><br/>Some superhero films at least have the decency to pretend to have some sense about them before plunging into the abyss of brain-convulsing insanity, but not Aquaman! Aquaman wants to be a Superman x Deadpool, both unparalleledly badass and unbelievably corny. Aquaman is a champion of heavy submarine-lifting and a wizard of cheesy oneliners. Aquaman flies, Aquaman jumps, he does all but sing Italian opera under the sea - and for that omission alone I'm indeed grateful.<br/><br/>Being a total self-belittling goofus was maybe the only point of indulgence for the Aquaman himself, so at least we don't have to try to watch this farce with serious faces (like we had to with the latest Batman and Superman movies). Maybe if I was a woman, I'd find some another redeeming point about this movie, but seriously, if you just want to watch Jason Momoa look all buff, watch that Conan film instead, you would feel much smarter while you do. Watch this, however, if you've been sitting in a dark cellar for the last fifty years, and you want to recall what colors and moving objects look like. You might even be surprised by the (not so) delicately delivered ecological message - and start reducing, reusing and recycling right away.<br/><br/>And if you do, please go ahead and recycle this trash first. It would make a better confetti filler than it had made a screen one."

"martynmccarthy1965","4","1","1","24 March 2019"," Spectacular effects sunk by a predictable and cliched plot.
","Arthur is the heir apparant to a subaquean dynasty ruling a society that is a smorgasbord of fustian and fantasy, despite being born to out of wedlock to a mother in exile from the feudal kingdom to which she belongs. Thus setting the standard of inconsistancy that permeates the plot throughout the movie.
Nicole Kidman, as ""The Queen"" (Should that be Princess if her father is still king?), does lift the movie out of the normal, bland, macho bravado dialogue and action that takes place as our hero battles his way from one perilous incident to the next. It's a pity she is dead, oh wait, now she isn't (inconsistant again).
Our hero is a (very) predictable impervious superman who can leap thousands of feet out of an airplane whithout a parachute, but struggles on a two-storey roof in Italy. Watch as he boldly goes where almost no subaquean half-human has gone before.
Borrowed from other genres? --
A submarine seizure (James Bond); Power Rangers; Sea Monsters (Godzilla and Lord of The Rings); Domesticated sea creatures (Finding Nemo) ...
Even Arthur himself is described as more or less as ""The once and future king"" - King Arthur of The Britons of the Round Table fame.

","This review was written on Dec. 22, 2018.
*******<br/><br/>I got home and turned on my laptop specifically to write this. In one word, this movie is beautiful.<br/><br/>Hands down, it is the best thing that happened to the DC universe since Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story is very well robust, the actors are perfectly chosen (thanks Zneyder), and the graphics magnificent.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying I am a big geek of ancient history and mythology. Atlantis and its legends instill in me a feeling of mystery and an intrigue that always make me contemplate the fantasies of its existence. This movie simply stirs up those feelings and takes you to the lost throne, explaining its majesty, its rise, its demise and now, its renaissance.<br/><br/>The story has a beautiful path. Every sequence is well justified and so well connected that Aquaman's universe is well established.
The chemistry between the characters also flows so naturally that nothing seems forced or unexplained.<br/><br/>Without adding any spoilers, despite my reservation of its ""completely"" happy ending, I will end by saying that indeed, Aquaman appears to be the hero who has lifted the DCEU from its years in the abyss, the movie that holds the DC universe to its rightful place among the legends.<br/><br/>Also, ""Everything I Need"" by Skylar Grey is truly a masterpiece. A beautiful ending to a great movie.<br/><br/>Bravo James Wan!"

","You don't necessarily have to be a fan of superhero movies but it helps if you watch Aquaman. It looks like they're going to make a movie of every possible comic character and I have no problem with that as long as I'm entertained. Aquaman, based on a DC Comic this time, is for the major part just CGI's like most of those movies. There are some terrific action scenes but sometimes the CGI's looked also a bit fake, that would be the only minor point to me. As for the rest the story is easy to watch and has a high entertainment level. Jason Momoa is candy for the eye for women (if I have to believe my wife) like Amber Heard is candy for the eye for men. And Nicole Kidman looks like she never ages (the Botox did help in her case). It's obvious there will be more Aquaman movies in the future and I'm fine with that."

","One thing I can finally say, DC finally has it right with Wonder Woman and Aquaman now under their belts. The special effects were astonishing in this movie, the way they made you believe they were really under water and breathing! The scope of the movie was amazing and the story held your interest. I would have rated it a 10, but here comes the, BUT! The vilian and men in the submarine their acting and parts to me were flawed. For me this is where it became cheesy and none of it just didn't seem to fit. In fact I think just leaving the villian being the brother would have worked fine for the movie. The whole submarine bit in the beginnning and the making of the vilian because Aquaman left his Dad to die just didn't work or seem to fit for me. This is something that they could have done better with if they wanted it to work, it just seemed to be a side bar that doesn't fit in the scheme of things. If they had done it up better or just left this out, then for me it would have been an easy 10! Otherwise a great addition to the DC family and one I would recommend to go see if you haven't!"

","I wasn't a DC fan so far, but this movie should be on the top of the superhero movies' tops. The visuals are stunning, the music is wonderful, great actors and characters, good storyline. The movie was well made, it had great rhythm, entertaining till the end. I think Jason Momoa did justice to Aquaman, noone else wouldn't be better.

"anselmdaniel","7","1","1","9 February 2019"," Impressive visuals
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a superhero movie directed by Justin Lin. The movie based off of the DC Comics character Aquaman. The movie stars Jason Mamoa in the titular role. Amber Heard plays an Atlantean that assists Aquaman in claiming his destiny.<br/><br/>Aquaman is an incredibly silly movie. This movie does not take itself seriously. There are many scenes in this moine that have ridiculous visuals or soundtracks. Two examples is an octopus playing the drums and the song 'Africa' played once the two leading characters are flying over Africa. There is no way that this movie is meant to be taken seriously. This also makes the movie more entertaining as a result. The movie does not restrict itself to the serious Aquaman in Justice League which makes this movie have a lighter tone.<br/><br/>The story in this movie is non-existent. The plot is only an excuse to have dazzling set pieces and impressive visuals. The movie tells Arthur Curry, or Aqnaman's story from his mother's affair with his father and his youth. There is much in this movie that felt like filler or an excuse to show cool effects or costumes. The flashback scenes to Arthur Curry's youth, felt bloated even if it is fitting for the story. The story and characters are all bloated as the story stays simple. Even the villain that is introduced at the beginning of the movie becomes utterly irrelevant towards the end. The Manta had no purpose at all to the overall plot.<br/><br/>The visuals are the best part of this movie. The movie's effort and budget clearly went to this part of the movie. Every scene has fantastic visuals. I was surprised that every scene had better visuals than the last. The scenes have these great effects and costumes. Not only that but the direction by Justin Lin makes the action scenes much more exciting. There is frequently a 360 degrees turn as the action moves on the screen. The movie has so many great action scenes that it makes the movie worthwhile to watch. There is no awesome action scene but many small action scenes. The action scenes are one of the reasons to watch this movie. The other reason is the funny script.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Aquaman'. Although the movie has its flaws, the sharp humor and great visuals are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"muvi-fan-73","7","1","1","9 February 2019"," A visual extravaganza with an above average story.
","Tone, Script & Story: The story is about how ruler of water world 'Aquaman' comes into existence. A fate, a war (with land dwellers) is in his hands when he comes to power. The movie portrays an above average story.<br/><br/>Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The biggest strength of the movie is its visuals. The ones at the end are spectacular. The ones on land too are very good. For me the ones in ocean were crowdie and blurry. The same appeared when I saw finding Nemo. I guess that happened to portray a reality (in the sea) more precisely. I wished if they were clear even after being in Ocean. Despite that they were nice. This movie was first of its kind given to us by director James Wan. It was a nice job. Most of his earlier work circulated around horror genre.<br/><br/>Music: Above average. Acting: Justified.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It is a visual extravaganza. If you can watch it, opt for a big screen."

","I've just gotten home from the theater and was wowed by the movie. The actors, except Dafoe and Lundgren, are new to me, so they had the appeal of not comparing them to other roles. Flash Gordon was the first thing to mind after seeing the Fishermen, Trench, familiar two-legged Atlanteans, and so forth in the matter of undersea races - all it needed was the Hawkmen.<br/><br/>I just loved it and didn't expect it to be a Power Couple movie at all, but then I stopped reading comics about four years back so maybe the latest comics do more with Mera? Anyway, Momoa, in addition to being smoking hot, did okay as Aquaman. He rushed his lines a little once or twice, yet held up in the dramatic and romantic moments. The effects couldn't have been better, either, seamlessly sliding from land to water. Atlantis was perfectly composed. Since Aquaman became my first superhero love in the Silver Age, not Superman or Batman or any other 'man,' this was a happy 2 hours and 23 minutes. Recognizing Temuera Morrison was the icing on the cake. The aquarium scene with young Arthur hailed back to a favorite panel from a long ago comic, with Art's hand the focus of multiple fish species' attention. Aquaman's ending costume couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Speaking of ending, upon reading credits to Nick Cardy and Mort Weisinger, my little ol' fan's heart beat faster."

In this case, the result is satisfactory. Because ...Jason Momoa. Sure, CGI, old cliches, the trident and the wise guide, the beautiful girl and the terrible enemy. But, except the effort of Momoa to sustain in honorable way his character, nothing new. Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar ""it could be better"" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films. Sure, it is heroic and propose a high noble, powerful hero. But something is missing. What ? Maybe, in essence, the answer has no significance."

","As the title of my review suggests, Aquaman is saved from being a 2 star film by the effects, which while sometimes being a bit OTT, are the best I've seen in a DC movie - not in the same league as Marvel of course, but a step on from previous DC offerings. The real problems lie with the hackneyed story (hero returns to his people, overthrows evil brother, takes his rightful place on the throne, blah, blah, blah), and the daytime-soap acting - yes, Amber Heard, I'm looking at you. (A tip for you Ms Heard, don't ever share a screen with Nicole Kidman again - you've done it once now and it did you no favours). Against these two deal-breakers the mediocre script and odd soundtrack somehow fade into insignificance, leaving the viewer feeling decidedly 'meh', which is arguably the cruellest indictment of all.<br/><br/>Despite my opinion though, I'm sure a sequel will appear, and having seen the post-credits scene I'm pretty certain what the storyline will be - I just won't be watching it."

The performance by Jason Momoa was a highlight along with an excellent final fight. At times the plot was complete nonsense (how did they get out of the desert, why does the little girl hand Mera the Pinocchio book, etc) the action scenes felt ripped off (the roof chase had been done in many, many better films) and at times I felt I was watching an animated movie due to the amount of CGI.

","First of all, based on the title what I'd like to praise about the movie is the direction, the VFX and the acting. I thought the direction and the acting waswere really good, and the Visuals were amazing. This is definitely one of the best looking comic book movies. It almost looks like a comic book that came to life.<br/><br/>Now that all the positives are done, let me tell you why I didn't like this movie. First of all, I just didn't like the protagonists in the movie : Aquaman & Mera. I thought the actors did a fairly good job but I just couldn't connect with their characters and that just took me out of the movie. Secondly, the non stop barrage of action sequences which would have felt awesome if I had time to pause and take a break after each sequences. It almost felt like the director was putting on one action scene after another to make up for Aquaman and Mera. By the time the movie reached it's climax I was completely exhausted and I couldn't focus much on the the battle with the Ocean master. Thirdly, they could have done a better job with the Ocean master. The actor who plays him is such an amazing actor, and I thought they kind of wasted his potential.<br/><br/>Aquaman IMO is not a terrible or a bad movie but just that I didn't find the central characters appealing and that just made the movie mediocre for me."

","Besides Wonder woman I have not been too impressed with DC movies recently. But growing up and loving those superheroes I always give those films a go. There were things that worked and didn't work for Aquaman. Sadly more things didn't work. The CGI and fight scenes were often over the top. The biggest issue for me was 'buying into' this universe. If you look at Guardians of the Galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures. Aquaman in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and you're not really immersed or taken on a journey.<br/><br/>One positive is the somewhat decent plot. On one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans. Jason Momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film. It tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable. This is not a terrible film but its not memorable. Let's just say if viewers saw it showing on TV years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes. It's passable and not the win that DC so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by Marvel.

I found the computer graphics to be the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Momoa was fine but they made his role a bit hokey with the way he stared at the camera and also some of his lines.

","I thought after Wonder Woman, which was fantastic, these DC films had turned a corner. But no. Aquaman, for any good points it has, is legit a bad film. I spent most of it hoping it would be over soon. It's all endless, over-long CGI and boring, protracted dialogue. Literally everything a character says is either dull, tedious, flat exposition or some cheesy, CHEESY joke. The script is terrible and the plot is meaningless and the whole thing looks like it's straight out of 1994. The costumes deserve a particular mention because they look exactly like a 1990s TV sci-fi show. Some of the costumes, notably Nicole Kidman's, got a laugh in the cinema I was in. And I don't think that was intentional. The only saving grace for me is Jason Momoa. He seems likeable and made the best of some genuinely bad lines. He looks the part too. And I suppose it is MARGINALLY better than Justice League, though not by much.<br/><br/>Personally, if I'd known what it's like I wouldn't have gone to see it.

"Enchorde","5","1","1","12 January 2019"," A lot of fighting but little else
","Aquaman is special effects extra vaganza, but seriously lacks in plot, character development and some serious directorial decisions.<br/><br/>So, in just about the first scene we learn that Arthur, or Aquaman as he is known as, is pretty much invincible. He takes a grenade in the chest and doesn't get a scratch. So, physically, you can't get to him. For a movie that is just about 150 minutes of fighting, that is kind of a problem. Yes, I know, the hero will win in all movies, but it is easier to get engaged into a movie if there actually is a theoretical chance the hero might get hurt. Kind of a basic rule with heroes; they should have a a weakness. Something that his enemies might exploit. Superman's kryptonite is a fine example. Aquaman seems to have no weakness. Sure, atlantean technology can cut his skin, but even when he is stabbed or shot with plasma (strong enough to make stone explode) he isn't much worse for wear. Not to stop fighting anyway, or deliver some oneliner.<br/><br/>Not even when Aquaman acquires the superweapon Atlan's trident, guarded by the ancient powerful monster Karathen, are there any suspense. There actually is no fight at all. So, the movie seriously lacks suspense. What's worse is, Arthur himself doesn't seem to think there is any either. He mostly cracks som weak jokes and seem to take very little seriously (so why should we?). Another side effect of all the weak jokes and fighting is that Arthur and Mera never really develops any chemistry.<br/><br/>And why, aside from setting up a sequel, was Black Mantha in the movie at all? It didn't need more fights, and that was about all you got out of that character (you might have used it to explore and develop Arthur's relationship with his father - a possible weakness). And when the movie is full of action, and running over 150 minutes, you might want to consider sutting a subplot out.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is stunning. The settings in Atlantis is wondrous, and I really liked the use of electronic music and the neon lights (got some flashbacks of Tron there). However, it is not enough to carry a movie. Still, the action is good, so it is not like inte isn't an entertaining movie. But, it doesn't really live up to the competition."

","Story doesn't take precedence in this world any longer. Gone are the days of DARK epics and COMPLEX anti-heroes that fall over their own motives. The DCEU has realised it's better off trying not to emulate Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy and Aquaman strikes a much finer balance because of it. As far as origin stories go (if you can call it one after Jason Momoa's equally strong performance in Justice League), it's much larger than the usual efforts that aim more precisely to establish rather than finish anything. Instead, Aquaman has loftier ambitions and though the pace can border on unrelenting at times, it's forgivable given how big this world is and how thoroughly the filmmakers immersed themselves in it. There's enjoyment to be found in simply being along for the ride, even if most of it was clearly computer generated. Aquaman knows that we aren't going to take everything it gives us with the utmost seriousness and it's refreshing that the film doesn't try to play its sillier moments with a straight face. It's definitely a fine instalment into the ever-growing panoply of superhero movies and absolutely worth watching on a Friday evening with handful after handful of popcorn."

","I really enjoyed this one and I kind of wish I'd have waited to watch it the first time at home in 4K. Am I the only one that feels that theater isn't as good quality anymore? Anyway I don't know much about Aquaman, so that is maybe what furthered my enjoyment. This movie was funny at times, awesome action, and looked amazing. The underwater stuff was so pretty. Aquaman might be a good one for Imax, but nearest one for me is about 45 minutes to an 1 hour away. I am a bit confused as to where the movie falls in the DCU timeline. There are 1 or 2 lines that maybe should have just been thrown out and would have solved that issue. This one feels like it should happen before Justice League, but because of those lines it has to be after. The confusing part is that if this is post Justice League, why does it feel like he has never been to Atlantis before? Black Manta was pretty cool and stay tuned for the post credits scene at the end. He didn't have much in this movie and that's ok because there is already a lot going on. It feels like they are building him up for future things too. Other than the confusing timeline stuff some of the underwater creatures brought Gears of War images to the mind. You will know what I'm talking about when you see it! Please let this be a sign to the powers that be to discontinue the use of Zack Snyder. James Wan did such a great job with a much lesser known character. Just imagine what he or someone other than Snyder could do with Batman. All in all there is still hope for the DCU, so now let's hope for the best with Shazam!"
"aa-24124","7","1","1","4 January 2019"," Good but not great.
","Im not sure if it was because i was tired or not but i thought the movie was kinda boring. But i will say that the world building is great and Atlantis is beautiful. But everything else is kinda a mess. The cgi was over the top and looked extremely unrealistic in some scenes, the lighthouse scenes in particular. The pacing was bad and went really fast that for me didnt allow me to keep up with the story. Although the movie had one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen. Would recommend you go see it though to make a decision for youself and the movie is better that some other stuff DC have put out. Not as good a wonder woman though."

","Arthur has become disenchanted with the idea of Atlantis and prefers life with his father on land. But he's still the hero we know as Aquaman. His confusion leads him through the most entertaining adventure the DC universe has shared with us recently. Parents should know that there are a lot of jump scares and plenty of violent, scary scenes in the movie. It's directed by someone who typically directs horror movies. But it is a lot lighter than Batman Vs. Superman. There are lots of fun, comedic moments- but this is not for a younger audience.

","The film kicks off with an extended introduction showing Aquaman's inception before the title page appears.<br/><br/>The characters seemed well-cast and the acting held up.<br/><br/>However the script was fairly predictable and the story arc very familiar.

"jellyneckr","Null","1","1","2 January 2019"," A win for DC
","Aquaman always seemed like a character that wouldn't translate well to the big screen. A bit over a decade ago, HBO's ""Entourage"" did a season-long storyline about the ridiculousness of the concept of an Aquaman movie. Even before that, the character had routinely been a punchline to many, even comic fans. That's why it was pretty surprising that Jason Momoa's portrayal of Arthur Curry/Aquaman in 2017's Justice League was one of the highpoints of the film. For those who enjoyed Momoa's performance in Justice League, his solo movie is more of the same, if not better.<br/><br/>Director James Wan's greatest decision with Aquaman is in the fact the tone is kept relatively light and fun. Wan is smart enough to realize that a dark, brooding Aquaman just would never work. Wan doesn't overload his film with too many jokes, but keeps the dialogue snappy and occasionally tongue-in-cheek. Complementing the tone is great use of color to match the beautiful ocean cinematography. A lot of comic book adaptations have a very similar look to them, but Aquaman is infinitely more colorful and distinct in its color palette. The only real problem with the look of the film is that a lot of the CGI resembles a video game. This is the most common problem with blockbusters today, as even pretty good CGI is still obvious CGI, which tends to take me out of the movie a bit.<br/><br/>Despite the overuse of CGI for the costumes, none of the actors come off as ridiculous. Jason Momoa gives a charismatic, fun performance. Amber Heard's performance has received some criticism, but I found nothing wrong with it. Dolph Lungdren makes the most of his small role, though it's weird to see Lungdren in a role where he doesn't punch anything. Patrick Wilson comes the closest to almost crossing the line between silly and foolish, though that's due more to the dialogue he's given more than anything else. Wilson still makes for an effective villain. The scenes with him and Momoa going against each other are amongst the more interesting, although the final confrontation is slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>It's unclear at this time whether an Aquaman sequel is in the works as Warner Bros. seems unsure about what to do with their DC series right now. Despite minor problems, Aquaman is the most entertaining DC film released this decade. What could have been a disaster is an absolute blast from start to finish and James Wan's strongest film yet. Recommended to even those who don't particularly love the titular character. 7.5/10"

"moviemaniac_1978","6","1","1","2 January 2019"," So close to being great.
","The good. Film score is very different and memorable unlike the formulaic Marvel scores. Jason Mamoa is the best part of Aquaman he does a fantastic job of balancing the action, drama and comedy in the film. The CGI is beautiful. James Wan's vision for this new cinematic world was ambitious and bold.
The Bad. The dialogue is just horrible in several spots. Jason Mamoa had the better part of the dialogue but Amber Hurd, Kidman and black Mantas suffered the most. Casting aside from Mamoa was weird. I felt like they sought out actors to be unique rather than fit the chemistry for Mamoa.
Despite my weak rating on this movie overall, I am looking forward to the 4K release because it was a beautiful movie."

"The_Man_XX7","7","1","1","2 January 2019"," Is this the start to the Rise of DC
","I liked Aquamam it was big,colorful, fun and overall an enjoyable DC superhero movie however it did have some significant flaws.<br/><br/>I can say that Aquamam was DC's most ambitious movie to date and they nailed most.The first act of the movie is pretty solid you get some backstory on Author Curry, some nice foundation for the plot and interesting interactions between Aquamam and the villain Black Manta earlier on which the movie does a good job of making you understand his motivations for hating Aquamam and wanting to kill him and Makes Aquamam reconsider some of his actions regarding Black Manta which was some nice writing.<br/><br/>The second act of the movie was surprisingly the weakest just when the story was about to kick into gear the movie gets goofy I mean characters like Mera and Aquaman become cartoony and silly as the movie's attempts to make you laugh becomes forced and awkward I mean there is literally toilet humor in this movie.It looked like two different people were directing the movie compared to the first half of the movie. Even characters like Black Manta became campy with him saying some weird dialogue. I wouldn't say the second act is terrible but compared to the first act of the movie it's just not as good.Luckily the movie comes into focus in the last third of the movie with some very good action, compelling story and surprisingly great CGI throughout the movie and some of the best I've seen in a long while.<br/><br/>The best characters in the movie were undoubtedly Aquaman and Mera. Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard had nice chemistry with each other even in the goofy scenes, Aquaman's journey to becoming King was well done as the movie made you understand why he reluctant to be King and how Aquaman's character grew throughout the movie especially with the help of Mera who also has a good mini arc in the movie and she had some badass scenes in the movie and again her best moments was with Aquaman as they went well together.<br/><br/>The villain Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson was bland, I mean they could have done much more with him but as the movie went on he became just another generic bad guy. Earlier in the movie he had some decent reasons for wanting to have War with the surface and had some good interactions between him and Aquaman since their brothers but you never got to see more of that. Patrick Wilson's performance wasn't even bad it was actually decent but the story involving him didn't have anything significant to do besides being evil because he is a bad guy.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier the visuals were incredible and very colorful especially with the scenes under water and the sea creatures i never knew James Wan was capable of directing a movie with such incredible visuals and great CGI so one thing you could say about Aquaman is that it was truly a spectacle at times. Atlantis and other sea kingdoms looked pretty good and contributed to the story well however sometimes these under water kingdoms like Atlantis felt empty at times I mean it looked interesting but you never got to see more of it besides action scenes and water battles which was kind of disappointing.The action was also very good again the visuals helped make the action good at times especially the final battle it wasn't the best thing ever but it was very nice.<br/><br/>The story is pretty solid and Aquaman's journey is interesting as he deals with responsibilities he doesn't want to have but he grows over time into a hero and despite being campy at times the movie has some pretty funny scenes so that's another plus.So I enjoyed Aquaman it's DC best movie since Wonder Woman not as great but still a pretty good movie with a solid story, great CGI and visuals and characters despite a bland villain and silly second act. Hope this continues for DC movies."
"jackson_ro","7","1","1","2 January 2019"," Aquaman
","I think Wan's Aquaman portrays the character and stays loyal to the story as well as it can. It's impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology, a true dream come true for comic book fans. The story is a great standalone movie but doesn't feel like it serves any greater purpose like those Marvel films, I guess for both better and for worse. Also unlike Marvel movies or previous DC films, I think the movie finds a good balance between being dark/deep and comical. The build-up is a little long, but the content within doesn't feel like filler and makes the world of Atlantis more interesting, it's impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated. The biggest problem with the film are the dialogues. They are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward, someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues!"
"aguilarandrew-79732","9","1","1","2 January 2019"," Visual Masterpiece
","Aquaman is a visual masterpiece and a great movie in general. The acting is solid and all try their best and clearly are having fun.

","I didn't like the first trailer so I wasn't expecting much, but it was actually a pretty good movie. It's not anything astounding that'll leave you amazed, but it'll keep you occupied and interested. The visuals are amazing for the most part, but when they try to combine CGI with real-life scenes the difference can be pretty jarring. The acting is great, though I don't think the movie spends much time actually looking at or developing its characters--it focuses on the story, and kind of throws simple character archetypes into it, but the story itself is great enough to cover that. The soundtrack is often amazing but there's this one tune that they kept playing whenever something Significant happened and I started getting sick of it. There was a total of 4 times that characters were chilling when they were suddenly surprised by a fiery explosion. All in all it won't be the greatest movie you've ever seen but I'd definitely recommend it if you have time."
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","8","1","1","2 January 2019"," The young man and the sea
","Aquaman may well be the least original film you have ever seen. Literally everything that happens and is of any significance to the plot can be seen from a mile away, but it doesn't really matter. DC has had enough failures in recent years to excuse their lack of risk, at least when this avalanche of cliches works to make an enjoyable film. And I thought it's nice that in such a formulaic story they found a place for Dolph Lundgren, because how best to wrap up a cliche-fest than with a washed up action star. Moreover, if the film was a bit older, Jason Momoa would have gotten a haircut during the first 5 minutes, which would be disastrous.<br/><br/>I haven't really said anything about the film itself - disappointed hero/heir to throne gets called to save homeland, has to face evil brother, needs magic swo..trident, has help of wise old guy and pretty girl. I feel like Willem Dafoe should be rejecting this kind of roles, not that I can blame him.<br/><br/>I wish superhero films weren't so hell-bent on advanced civilisations / aliens having so much blind faith in hereditary absolute monarchy, but as we established, this is not the place for such moon-talk. What you might complain about in terms of messages is that the whole ""humans / land-people are destroying the oceans"" thing isn't given the gravity it deserves."
"abbs-39952","7","1","1","1 January 2019"," Avatar, but Underwater
","With Jason Momoa as Aquaman himself and Amber Heard casted as the beautiful Mera, you already know it's going to be a good looking movie. Knowing that James Wan is more of a horror producer than an action movie director, he did a good job tackling this installment. Bringing in Patrick Wilson as Kind Orm was a good tribute to having him be familiar within Wan's work. In general, the movie was great action packed adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the idea of Atlantis and how the characters looked underwater as well as their relationships with the different characters to see how they played within the story line. However, the CGI has been getting slightly more noticeable within the last couple movies that I have seen. Some of the stunts preformed in this movie that should have either injured the character or end up in a fatality, to return a few scene later didn't feel authentic. If you have seen Avatar, directed by James Cameron there is no doubt to where Wan got his inspiration from. Aquaman's Atlantis has the same feel as if you were in the land of Pandora, but just underwater. All in all, a great addition to the DC universe and can't wait to see what comes next."
"armaniboy","7","1","1","1 January 2019"," A pleasant surprise!
","I generally don't like DCEU because it doesn't know what it wants to be, but this movie is different because to me, it belongs to the MCU. It has everything I'd want in a superhero movie: background story, comedy, romance, action, and most importantly, quirkiness. I'm not saying it is perfect because it obviously isn't. The jokes felt somehow forced and very lame sometimes, and the romance was a bit stiff and very predictable, but I still enjoyed my time. It felt more like an animation film than a live action movie honestly, which is great."
"tsaryadhlia","9","1","1","1 January 2019"," Totally eyegasm
","The first 2 and a half hours got me gasping. Such a magnificent pictures, nice soundtracks and sounds, light story, and perfect dose of humours. Totally worth to be watch more than 10 times!"
"secretzfan","7","1","1","1 January 2019"," A fun generic blockbuster
","For a decent while now the DCEU has been subject to controversy with the only movie being loved by both fans and critics to be Wonder Woman. Beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release. Rather that be Suicide Squad with all of the Joker scenes being cut or Justice League with its infamous Superman mustache issue. All of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans. So going into Aquaman there were many who were very skeptical.<br/><br/>However with James Wan at the helm I had little worry. The man was known for making films that were commercially viable. The Conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget. Saw made 103 million on a meager 1.2 million dollar budget, and Furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost. So there was little doubt that the film would do well. As far as quality Wan usually churns out quality work. His Saw series is beloved by many fans, his Conjuring work had been exceptional, and Insidious while not as beloved as Saw is also its own franchise. So I was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was ""Man who can talk to fish: The Movie.""<br/><br/>In regards to visual effects the movie isn't all that spectacular. There were areas that I found to be very clunky. Mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real, there were a lot of water effects that looked fake. The designs of the home where Aquaman lived were nice looking, but still needed a bit more rendering to be done. The fight scenes I will admit are pretty bad ass. Every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me. The ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flares.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role. His flirtatious attitude with Mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face. He was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superhero.<br/><br/>Additionally the film tends to be very funny. It always knew how to make you feel good when you watched. There was a lot of great chemistry between Aquaman and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear. It was just a good, upbeat, and fun experience at the movies.<br/><br/>But my favorite aspect of the film was Black Manta. He was a marvelous villain. From start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how Aquaman chose not to save him. This anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance. This desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revenge.<br/><br/>King Orm wasn't nearly as compelling, but I did like his character. He was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface. There is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one. Perhaps then King Orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to be.<br/><br/>I really loved Aquaman and Mera's relationship. It was really sweet and funny. Jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly, and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each other.<br/><br/>Overall though there isn't really anything surprising here. It pretty standard superhero stuff. There a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see. Mera and Aquaman have a overly dramatic kiss, and the movie ends with Aquaman giving a hopeful monologue to the future. So it was good."

Alas, they messed it up with a bad storyline, some random ""OceanMaster"" brother and a wasted Black Manta. There are some good parts in this movie, though. Jason Momoa as Aquaman is a great pick, and he does a great job as the funny beer drinker that enjoys a swim from time to time. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking, and some of the best I've seen in quite some time. This movie would've been much lower in rating if it weren't for Momoa and the gorgeous visuals."

","Thankfully, finally, DC comes through in a big big way. What a beautiful, well written movie. The best part? Zak Snyder is nowhere near this project. The soundtrack, cinematography, and cast worked so well together. I believe it also helped that this origin story hasn't been told that often. I was beyond impressed. I think I only caught one mention of the monstrosity that was Justice League and once this movie was tied to that universe they made the right decision and steered clear. Seeing this movie done so well, it made me wonder what could have been for the DCEU had they been smart about things and you know actually built their universe from the ground up with movies like this. Either way, it looks like things are finally looking up if they can continue to make movies like this. Give it a try! 8/10<br/><br/>

Plot wasn't complicated, even if there were deviations from what might be Canon, and there was just enough of everything to make me love this film. Jason Mamoa seemed to enjoy his role.

","Aquaman Review by Hezy James
Director: James Wan
Release Date: 12/21/1018
My Own Personal Score: 9.5/10
Rating: PG-13
Runtime: 2Hrs, 23 Mins
Cast: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson<br/><br/>**********WARNING! - Major Spoiler Alert**********<br/><br/>
Okay, So I have seen it twice now with 2 different groups. I have to say that I am very impressed. Been a while since I seen a good movie that combines everything: Action, Family Drama, Comedy, Romance and Mystery. The Story/Plot is good even though there are some moments that are questionable, but I will get into that later. I absolutely loved it and would recommend you go see it yourself. The trailers do not give it enough credit. In honesty, the trailers sucked but the movie was 100 times better than the trailer. I was not sure what to expect the first time because I did not see the trailers at all before my friends took me to the movie theater. It was not until the first fight scene where the guards came to take Atlanna that I was thinking ""Oh, Okay. It's going to be one in those movies. Okay let me get comfortable then."" It was so good that the first time I saw it, I had to pee like 1 hour and 15 mins into the movie and I did not want to miss a scene, so I held it. I'm guessing everyone else did the same cause as soon as the post credits scene finished, we all ran out to the bathroom. The second time, I filled my bookbag with candy and junk food (do not Judge...We all have done it.) When the movie finishes, I completely forgot all the stuff in my bookbag. I got so hooked into the movie, I forgot I had snacks and candy. Well, let's dive right into it.<br/><br/>Plot/Story:
I personally think the plot was well written overall minus a few moments which I will address in the ""Feedback"" section lower down. The plot is about Arthur who is Aquaman going on a journey of self-discovery. The whole movie he keeps saying he is not worthy to be king, but he finally accepts it with the help of some friends. I feel the plot had just enough of everything. Love: Between Tom and Atlanna and between Mera and Arthur. The love between Tom and Atlanna, we felt his pain all right. Imagine walking to the end of a dock every morning for 20 years just hoping the love of your life would be there. Comedy: they threw in a few jokes with Arthur that made him not look like the ""I'm all about Seriousness 24/7"" type and I loved that. Also made the whole movie theater laugh too. Family Drama: we can feel the tension coming from Arthur's little brother Orm. In Orm's opinion, Arthur is the reason their mother was killed. Mystery: they added little mystery with Atlanna and what really happened to her. All they kept saying is she was sacrificed to the Trench. Which Arthur comes to learn is their form of a ""execution."" We don't get to see what the Trench is until the very end of the movie. And woah, not a nice way to be sacrificed for sure.<br/><br/>
Characters/Cast
The cast did an amazing job. I feel as if they all fitted their characters perfectly. In my opinion, I did not see any flaws or anything I did not like. The acting was good and made the characters come to life even more.<br/><br/>Cinematography
The shots and camera angles were amazing, specially during the fight scenes. Movement with the actors was good. I loved how it would switch scenes quickly. Like when Vulko threw the trident at Arthur and then it's a flashback of young Arthur catching a trident. The colors used to show Atlantis was stunning. The scene where Arthur arrives in Atlantis for the first time, it was just so colorful and beautiful. The Dessert scene, even though I loved it made me feel as if I was playing uncharted again. I mean I loved the game, so I did not mind that scene. Special effects were awesome with all the underwater scenes and the creatures. Overall, the scenes were shot beautifully, and the environment looked amazing.<br/><br/>Feedback
Okay, So I have been seeing a lot of the comments for the movie. And about those questionable scenes. Let's get into it. First, the Scene where Black Manta is upgrading the weapons and armor, he got from Orm. Okay, I'm seeing a lot of comments that is asking how he knows how to re work the well what is considered ""Alien Tech"" to him. He could have messed with the wrong thing and blow himself up. Second, Atlanna and how she survived on that island alone for so long. What did she eat? Where did she get the awesome end game high level armor she was wearing? Where did she keep her bottles of Loreal on the island to keep her hair looking just like when she left in the beginning? We have to remember that they had a time limit to work with. And when movies are being editing in the final moments, a lot of scenes get deleted to meet the time goal. Aquaman is already very long at 2Hrs and 23mins. They could not really add in any extra scenes that was not really needed. Yes, we could of use a scene where a younger Black Manta was trying to sneak into Atlantis to steal weapon manuals or blueprints or instead, kidnapping one of their weapon/armor builders and him torturing them to teach him how to. Or, a scene where Atlanna was on the island trying to start a fire and cutting up some dinosaur meat. Yes, dinosaur meat: in the scene where they show the island, you can see dinosaurs running around. So, yea these scenes that we feel are missing, we will just have to use our imagination to fill in the blanks and understand that the movie is already as long as it is.<br/><br/>Favorite Quotes
Mera: What did he just say?
Arthur: Something, Something, Trident<br/><br/>Mera: We need water, you're the closest source.
Arthur: Show Off, I could've just peed on it<br/><br/>Orm: My Brother has come from the surface to challenge me for the throne!
Arthur: I call it an Ass-Whooping<br/><br/>So Overall, I would give this movie a 9.5/10 as my own personal rating and would recommend you go watch it and see for yourself. It is a wonderful movie that displays a strong plot with an amazing group of actors set in a unforgettable environment mixed in with love, comedy and drama. Oh, and stay for the post credits scene. It shows that Black Manta might be the Big bad guy in part 2. And trust me, the End credits song is just beautiful that I actually think people stayed more just because of the song than the post credits scene. The song is Skylar Grey - Everything I need for those who are wondering. There is a original and a film version. Just remember to use the bathroom right before you go into the movie theater and don't forget that you have any snacks or junk food."

","As a box office success this entry for DC has almost made as much as Justice League in a week.<br/><br/>Aimed at a much younger demographic then the dark Batman V Superman films this movie is light, comedic and sometimes quite corny. What a DC movie should be. Aquaman was my favourite character in DC and he's done justice in this version.<br/><br/>However, it works and it is entertaining. A stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson do a great job with the source material. Jason Momoa is solid as the title character but far different to the Aquaman I remember as a kid back in the 80s. Amber Heard plays a pivotal role as the Princess and holds the movie together. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>Directed by James Wan who specialises in horror films the styling of this films was my major concern based on it being mostly underwater but it's done well and after a while you get used to the visual aspects of the movie. Whilst watching I felt aspects of movies like TRON, Guardians of the Galaxy and Flash Gordon!<br/><br/>As usual with superhero films the running time at 140 minutes is probably 25 minutes too long.<br/><br/>6.9/10<br/><br/>Couldn't quite give it 7 but good option at the cinema with the family ( probably not small children). There's quite a body count in a cartoon kind of way."

","It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. I like superhero genre in general and it makes me sad how DC keep on disappointing and failing to justify my expectations which were huge considering how hyped this movie was.<br/><br/>DC just keep making the same mistakes:
-typical plot
-very easy to predict
-poor dialogues<br/><br/>Not sure how many fail movies they need to make to realize their mistakes. This movie could've been a lot better if anything unexpected happened and if they dosed those crazy fx (which were decent) properly.<br/><br/>For example his father could've died when that garbage wave hit them. That would give him a reason to leave surface looking for culprit.
Than sneaking in Atlantis(ok) but getting attacked suddenly in some hidden place makes zero sense. They could've caught him on his way out or something.
Before fight with his brother he didn't say a word to his people...
Last fight should've been on surface because that was his brothers plan - right? Instead aquaman found him fighting crabs.
Also that antflea guy was so unnecessary. They added him just because of second part. Fight in Sicily could happen without him."
"generationofswine","8","1","1","30 December 2018"," An Honest Review
","I am so tired of CGI battles it's getting to the point where they put me to sleep. It was just too much there.<br/><br/>However for most of the film it felt like an adventure, that is an improvement over Wonder Women which felt too much like it was trying to be the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Aquaman goes into Dark Knight territory enough to irritate the audience. That was my complaint about MOST DCEU films, they aren't made to fit the character, they are all just Batman clones.<br/><br/>It should have stuck with the adventure feel and been a great film.<br/><br/>Instead it went in the same direction that ruined Wonder Women and every other DC film of late, it tried to emulate Batman"

","This movie was so entertaining. I spent every minute with my eyes wide in amazement looking at the cinematography and the visuals. The world is so well realized and so detailed. And the cartoonish nature of Aquaman is fully realized and taken full advantage of! Also, its mythic-style story fully complements its grande scale that it fully embraces. Admittedly it is a dumb movie, but it isnt a ""turn your brain off"" movie like the Michael Bay Transformers films. It takes full advantage of its dumbness and knows exactly what it is! If you want a great, entertaining time at the theatre, Aquaman is your movie. I loved it."

"rustonreviews","7","1","1","30 December 2018"," A step in the right direction for the DCEU.
","James Wan, a director-producer mostly known for his immensely popular horror films, shifts genre gears once again to take on one of DC's most iconic heroes. Having made his first appearance in last year's Justice League, Aquaman (Momoa) returns in his first stand-alone adventure that is both ridiculously corny yet ludicrously enjoyable. Aquaman, A.K.A Arthur Curry (half Atlantean-half human) is the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis, and is reluctant to leave his human life behind in order to face up to his true destiny. With the help of warrior Mera (Heard) and Atlantis counsellor Nuidis Vulko (Dafoe), Arthur must fight to overthrow his malevolent half-brother Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson, a frequent collaborator with Wan), who is preparing to wage a cataclysmic war with the surface world.<br/><br/>The DCEU, in a nutshell, is a complete misfire of a cinematic universe. Although Wonder Woman (2017) showed great promise for the franchise, even the most hardcore fans can't ignore the disaster that was Suicide Squad (2016) or the total mess that was Batman V Superman (2016). With Aquaman, James Wan makes the most of a cliché ridden script and delivers a surprisingly fun film. Momoa leads the film with great charisma; his performance holds the film together entirely, and it is clear he's having an absolute blast in the role. Patrick Wilson was a fitting choice for Orm; he's menacing when required, yet his performance at times is corny beyond belief. Both Heard and Dafoe were also excellent casting choices, although their characters aren't as developed as they could have been. It is the action sequences that work best in the film. In previous DCEU films, the action sequences have ranged from excessively dull to criminally forgettable (with the exception of the terrific No Man's Land sequence from Wonder Woman), but Wan crafts sequences that are thrilling in execution and epic in scope. A fight sequence with side villain Black Manta (who makes an appearance more in the name of fan service rather than plot) is particularly awesome, and the final conflict may be an overload of CGI, but it's certainly epic and absurdly entertaining.<br/><br/>Aquaman is definitely one of the stronger entries of the DCEU. It's cheesy for sure, and the writing is clunky in parts, but with Momoa's excellent screen presence and Wan at the helm, Aquaman manages to pull off all its absurdity. If the DCEU continues in this direction, it could finally live up to its full potential and even rival the MCU."
"en_ca_go","8","1","1","30 December 2018"," An immersive and visually rich underwater epic
","More than a movie, Aquaman is a visual JOURNEY, an immersive experience. This movie is all about its breathtaking world-building, lavish CGI and VFX. The very straightforward story and its charming characters serve one purpose: make you dive deep into their world and fall in love with it. Remember Avatar? Well, Aquaman delivers ten times more joy, awe-inspiring views and badass characters, with almost no political agendas. This movie is aware of what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything else, because it really doesn't need to, which makes it DCEU's most honest film so far. Back to CGI and VFX, it's the most ambitious film since Avatar and even Gravity, as it makes possible what was believed to be impossible (and even unthinkable): an underwater epic, of which we only really had gotten a glimpse with James Cameron's The Abyss. That was almost 30 years ago!"
"votedavepurdy","8","1","1","30 December 2018"," The Funnest Movie Of The Year!
","Finally, DC doesn't make a movie that feels like a funeral! As much as I loved Wonder Woman, the Dark Knight Trilogy, and Man of Steel, it became crystal clear that DC was more interested in making darker films for adults, while alienating the kids that make up most of the target audience for a superhero film. There were actually children asleep at Justice League! Whereas my 11-year old was on the edge of his seat through Aquaman! It's fun, upbeat, emotional, visually stunning, and worth the price of, not just your ticket, but the whole family."

Another issue is an extreme use of expositional diologue which (every time with out fail) was followed up immediately and explosion near our protagonist just as, or before, an important part of that ""beautiful"" expositional diologue was presented to us, forcing unnatural feeling advance in the plot.
However aside from some issues a great cast well directed and standard cinematography (for this type of film) and some okay writing combine to make a decent movie which I did enjoy.

While this is all good, the dialogue which is good in some places, is way too corny at other times. The pacing was okay, but always just a bit too long or too short. Another thing I didn't love was king Orm, he was too over the top villainy. And a mcguffin move that is used late in act 3 is only shown very briefly but we never get to know what it is or does, and that really bothers me for some reason."

The story felt large in scale, the production design was unique and interesting and the visual effects were stunning. The chemistry between Arthur and Mera was great too with some great moments of humor.<br/><br/>It was a overall a very well directed and fun Boxing Day blockbuster and probably DC's best standalone film which brought an interesting origin story and broughtas much justice as they could to a DC character that hardly anyone can actually take seriously at this point.

"Eclectic-Boogaloo","8","1","1","26 December 2018"," So good. So much more than a just a superhero movie
","Aquaman is unlike anything I've ever seen on the big screen. The look and feel of Atlantis, the costume design, creature effects, are rivaled only by Avatar and the Middle Earth movies amongst recent tent poles. More than just a really good superhero movie, Aquaman is a great sci-fi/fantasy epic. It can't be stressed enough, the underwater world of Atlantis is so rich and absorbing as to merit the price of the ticket on its own (not that the dry land stuff isn't good too. It is, but it's not game changing like the underwater stuff is).<br/><br/>And don't be worried about the underwater sequences as it pertains to the movement and talking either. It was outstanding. The action, especially the third act stuff was phenomenal (among superhero movies released in the last 3-4 years only Infinity War's was better).<br/><br/>The only weaknesses the movie had were the handling of Arthur/Aquaman and the movie's ambition: Jason Momoa spent most of the movie playing Aquaman as Arthur, the dudebro, which got a little tiring (many of his comedic moments were spoiled in the trailers, and others fell flat). But once the third act came around and the dudebro stuff gave way to more kingly matters, Jason really came through. All the other actors were note perfect: Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, William Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Temurea Morrison, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Julie Andrews. They were all terrific.<br/><br/>And on the ambition: just how much story there was to tell was probably the only real negative. The many side plots and changes of scenery, and the degree to which they necessitated a change of tone did make the movie feel a tad bit uneven and clunky at times, but ultimately, every single plot thread was entertaining and interwoven. The ending was fantastic, and there was really no fat to the movie. It was just a really big, decadent, swashbuckling superhero sci-fi-fantasy epic with a little Shakespearean tragedy, comedy, and a smidge of horror. So much to digest. So good."

I expected a decent movie, but I expected one that just capitalized on Jason's looks. No questions that's happening here. But then they also capitalize on our heroine's, Amber. But in reality, they spin a good story and make it very entertaining.<br/><br/>I actually really enjoyed the cinematography, especially in the opening fights scenes.

","I do not know the DC Universe very well, but most of his films are medium-sized. The best so far was Wonder Women. The story could have been better. I think it lacked more care and love for the production. Everything seems sloppy and hastily done, than being an incomplete feature film. CGI has the same problems as in previous DCEU films, in some scenes they are medium, in others they are horrible. The dialogue was cliché and without any creativity. Sometimes I rolled my eyes, imagining what was going on in the writers' heads ...
Why is it too long? Some scenes were unnecessary. It did not need so much flashback. And the Romance? Too forced. Why two villains in the movie? The performance of Black Manta was really bad. I could get him out of the movie, I was not going to miss it. Both villains are generic. I love Patrick Wilson in other roles, unfortunately in this movie it was a torturing to see his wasted talent. Jason Mamoa made the give to do with the script. The guilt in part is the script poorly written, it does not deliver us character development. That spoils the movie a lot. If had a right storyline, good dialogue and character development, I'd totally ignore the horrible CGI and give it a 7.5. But I must be honest so I give 4 + 1 (because of Nicole Kidman)."

"politicidal","8","1","1","24 December 2018"," DC finally learns the most important lession from the MCU: PURE IMAGINATIVE FUN!
","AQUAMAN is one of the strangest superhero movies ever made and it is also one hell of a crowd pleasing popcorn flick. It sucessfully combines action, adventure, fantasy, romance, and even horror in spectacular fashion!<br/><br/>Director James Wan (The Conjuring; Furious 7) handles the gargantuan scale with gusto, unafraid to embrace the absolute absurdity that comes with a superhero that can talk to fish. Atlantis is a glistening metropolis of aquatic creatures, skyscrapers made of lava and coral, and technology that would feel at home in a Star Wars movie. Aquaman battles sea monsters that look like the offspring of the Xenomorph while underwater gladiators ride atop giant seahorses, laser equipped sharks, or even draconic leviathans.<br/><br/>The movie looks HUGE and the action scenes are outstanding. They put most of the recent DC movies to shame, with perhaps only being rivaled by the unfairly maligned Man of Steel. Instead of having to rescue a city of human civilians, Aquaman has to fend for the lives of his fellow Atlanteans plus crab people, and even mermaids!<br/><br/>If the movie was po faced and self serious, it would fall apart and result in a disaster. But James Wan luckily remembers how much fun and joy can be had in a superhero story. The visuals are bright and wondrously imaginative while the tone is pleasantly cheerful.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is a swaggering roguish hero that smiles at danger and cracks one-liners aplomb instead of frowning in scorn, That is Patrick Wilson's job as the villainous Ocean Master (yes you read correctly). And with a name like that, he hams it right up. Momoa has the chops to be a strong likable action lead. As Princess Mera, Amber Heard acquits herself to the action surprisingly well but unfortunately, some of her lines are wooden.<br/><br/>Indeed, their romance is one of the weaker links of the movie. But due to the movie's earnest sincerity and the buoyant spirit, it remains digestible. Also there is a key character who is built up as a major villain (even remaining true stylistically to the comics). But then is promptly dispatched as soon as they appear. Patrick Wilson is appropriately smarmy and haughty as Aquaman's half brother King Orm (aka Ocean Master). But it feels odd he doesn't have this other antagonist at his side as a henchman in the big climax.<br/><br/>It may sound hokey but there is a heart to the proceedings that falls back on the warm family ties between Aquaman and his parents (Morrison; Kidman). Their family dynamic clearly serving as a metaphor of biracial families. And isn't it nice to see a superhero movie where both parents are still alive?<br/><br/>Aquaman is yet another step in the right direction for Warner Brothers' DC film franchise. It's a blast from start to finish with outrageous action and an enormous sense of fun."

OG Mary Poppins as Krathen? Hell yea!<br/><br/>Those wide angel and tracking shots were stunning.

One of best 3rd act in comic book movie probably.<br/><br/>Negatives<br/><br/>Simply one of the worst music choices. Ugh, Pitbull doing Africa by Toto.<br/><br/>DCEU really need to fix their poor dialogues and writing. Some of the lines were really cheesy and they tried to cram too many storylines and the plot was predictable.<br/><br/>If I had a nickle for every time a conversation got interrupted by an explosion....<br/><br/>Orm performance could have been way better without the over the top dialogues.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall, a really solid family friendly flick with some flaws but offers a great visual experience, action sequences. I would recommend watching this in IMAX or 4DX."

","A very, very watchable movie, you won't regret the 10 dollars you might pay for it. Digital Graphics are just awesome, I prefer the dark tone, like the one in BvS, this isn't justice league which was a hybrid of 'light and dark' which turned out to be god awful in the screenings. A very decent movie."
"IAmTheShyGuy","8","1","1","23 December 2018"," An immersive story of the underwater Kingdom of Atlantis!
","The movie interweaves a fictional story with today's ground reality of how the humans have polluted the seas and lakes around the world. The incumbent King of Atlantis, King Orm is ready to wage a war with the surface world along with the help of the other oceanic kingdoms and conquer them. But if this happens, there'll be mass destruction and loss of lives. The movie shows how Aquaman dethrones King Orm and stops the destruction from taking place. The movie has all the right elements to keep you glued to the screen. Jason Momoa as Aquaman shines brightly throughout the screenplay. The movie is very immersive & makes for a great weekend watch!"
"r1vz","8","1","1","23 December 2018"," Aquaman: THe review
","The movie definitely exceeded my expectations for the most part and it was really pleasant to watch, however, it was a far cry from perfect.
What I liked the most, and this is of course my personal opinion, is that the incorporated a lot of jokes. Even though at times it seemed corny, it was still funny for me so I enjoyed them. The visuals were amazing, the color selection ( for the most part ) was extremely high level, the whole concept of filming everything underwater was pure delight to watch.<br/><br/>Now for the things that could have been improved. All the things I am about to say, I reviewed them on my way home, since I wanted to concentrate on the movie in the cinema.
Black Manta. In my opinion, the back story was somewhat weak, and the dialogue was not strong for the character. I think this was mostly an issue on the director's side, not the authors. Further, since when do pirates have the ability to dismantle atlantian tech and the reassemble it according to what they need ? Did the Black Manta have a degree in robotics/physics degree or something ?
The second submarine that attacked the meeting between Orm and King Nereus, where did it come from? Who was behind it? Not sure I understood that part. Most likely it was Orm's doing but never really explained by whom it was piloted or how.
The scene jumping from the plane into the desert. Since when do children of King's and Queens can just dive from, suppose 500 meters and above, and have no damage ? :) Of course they have super strength and all but if we were to take actual physics into account here, it did seem rather weird.
Lastly, the last fighting scene between the two armies - Orm's united forces and crab looking people ( forgot their name ) it was not done in a good manner. Absolutely, the effects were stunning, the light show display was amazing, but the camera was moving so fast that you could hardly understand what was going on. To continue, the last fighting scene between Aquaman an Orm, how did that ship get up there to the surface? It was not shown, neither did Aquaman push it to the surface so who knows..
My biggest surprise was the transition of Aquaman from this cool, confident, slightly cocky person to this timid, unworthy Kind towards the moment of obtaining the trident. Honestly, it felt somewhat strange. Of course, I do know the fact he never wanted to be king, but his whole personality of fighting for what is right, protecting the people and then suddenly changing to the sour face person, who thinks he is unworthy? I think the writing of that scene was strange.
There were other small plot holes, but for the most part, it was truly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The acting. I definitely liked everyone in the movie, especially Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. One could say there was little chemistry between them, but in my eyes, I saw their sparkle, these little hints of something to come. It gave me this nice and warm feeling. Therefore, my compliments to the whole crew on delivering this movie to us, and on good acting. I was going for a 7, but ended up putting an 8. Despite the fact I am objective and realistic, it is Christmas after all."
"jetmoviereviews","7","1","1","23 December 2018"," Not bad, DC. Not bad.
","The DCEU, or Worlds of DC as they are now calling it, have released another standalone movie, this time with the character of Aquaman. Now, DC has been pretty good with their standalone films; the only films that I have major problems with are Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. Justice League wasn't even that bad of a movie. It just felt rushed. One of the best parts about that movie was the character of Aquaman, a character that everyone thought of as weak and stupid before that movie was released. What Justice League did, however, was turn Aquaman into badass, so I was really excited to see how they would expand on his story in his standalone film. Luckily, he is still a badass.
Aquaman is not the best film in the DCEU, but it is definitely not the worst. I don't think this is James Wan's best work, either. However, I still think that is is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of stuff to love. It's weird to think that this movie belongs to the same universe as Batman V Superman, Man of Steel, and the like. It's so much brighter; so much more colorful. It is beautiful to look at. All of the CGI, makeup effects, and costumes look amazing. It is the most colorful film in the DCEU by far.
Aquaman is an awesome character, and Jason Momoa brings a lot of character and comedy to him. Mera was a very likable partner for Aquaman to have, and she also knew how to kick butt. Willem Defoe's character Vulko was fine; nothing great about him, but also nothing bad. The villains were actually quite good, and you could really reason with almost everything they were doing. Orm, played by Patrick Wilson, bounced off of Aquaman very well. The seriousness of Orm and the goofiness of Aquaman meshed together very well. Black Manta was a fun villain, too. I liked every scene he was in, and his on-screen suit didn't look half bad. I just feel that for being Aquaman's most iconic foe, he wasn't in the movie enough.
Now, this movie had some very cringy dialogue that took me out of the movie at times. There were also some shots in the film that made it seem like the movie was trying to be too mainstream. At one point in the film, Aquaman and Mera walk out of the ocean onto a beach in slow motion, like something you'd see during a swimsuit ad. While this is happening, a horrible - and I mean HORRIBLE - cover of Africa by Toto, being performed by Pitbull, was playing in the background. It was such a ridiculous shot, and it took me out of the movie. The film also had a lot going on, and I feel with a little more cutting, it could have been shortened without ruining the plot.
Overall, I think this is a very entertaining movie. It adds a lot more color and character to the DCEU, which is something it much needed. It's not better than Wonder Woman, but it definitely is better and more well put together than the other films in the DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go next with the character. If you are skeptical about seeing this movie, just give it a try. It's very entertaining, whether you like the DC films or not."
"erik-normantino","8","1","1","23 December 2018"," This film will bring DC back from the grave
","Most satisfying DC film since the Nolan franchise. Awesome action sequences and amazing cinamatgraphy. James Wan did a fantastic job telling this story of, in my opinion, an underrated character and Jason Momoa brought it to life. Looking forward to seeing what DC has up their sleeve for aqua man, as well as other DC characters, in future films. Overall, you won't be disappointed with this film; it's worth it! Would like to also see James Wan direct more DC films and help put DCCU back on the map for entertaining super hero films. Awesome job!"

","If you are having any doubts about this, stop right now. I am a Marvel stan but movies like this show me that DC is capable of producing incredible movies. Wonder Woman blew my mind and this did just the same. Of course there is some cheese (Patrick Wilson I am looking at you) but it didn't tarnish anything. When the movie ended I wanted more...so thank god for that mid-credits scene. Considering how well this is reviewed I am positive there will be a sequel. So to make it simple...if you like attractive leading roles with fantastic personalities, non-stop action (and I really mean non-stop), and beautiful CGI with equally beautiful camerawork, this is the movie for you."

"Benslie","9","1","1","23 December 2018"," A surprisingly good movie
","First of all, the actors did great jobs as their characters. One that shocked me the most was Jason Momoa. I honestly thought I wasn't going to like him as Aquaman but I did. He had some funny lines that made me laugh and he also came across as a guy who honestly didn't want to be king. This film has a lot of underwater scenes which means that they're going to need great visual effects and they did. Every time you see Atlantis it makes you feel like you're there with those characters. It kind of reminded me of Avatar with how the visuals looked. The musical score, which was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, helped intensify every scene. The music matched each scene perfectly. My only complaint about the music was the song ""Ocean to Ocean"" which is a hilariously bad version of ""Africa"" by Toto. I'm just thankful it only played for a few seconds in the movie. All of the action in this film is well choreographed and well shot. Every scene where people are fighting you can clearly see everything that's happening in that scene. There was not a lot of camera angle changes and when there were they were to keep somebody in focus and to show what they were doing. James Wan directs this film and he's mainly known for horror movies, and there are elements of that in here, but he makes it clear he can direct anything and make it great. The main villain Orm is a great villain and is well portrayed by Patrick Wilson but I wish they gave him more of a reason for hating the surface world. I wish they did his training scenes before they showed him as an adult. This way you would know how he got to be this comfortable with his powers. There is an end credit scene that gives a hint to a possible storyline for the possible sequel. In the end, Aquaman was a surprisingly good movie. Hopefully, DC continues with stuff like this because then maybe they will be able to challenge Marvel."

","This movie has a bit of everything. From the little mermaid, visual influences of blade runner, mixed with fantasy epic, plus the adventure of Indiana jones. All mixed up in a super hero movie package, and somehow the director's direction and the charisma of the cast make this movie work. It's a strange movie, but it's fun, the visual effects do not always work, but when they work they are a spectacle. It is a pure escapist and meta-surrealist film, which does not make the mistake of taking itself too seriously.
For those looking to see a fun movie, Aquaman does not disappoint."

"intrepidami","8","1","1","22 December 2018"," An Honest Review
","The 10's? are a bit ridiculous. This was not a ten movie. This guy is clearly Aquaman. Society hasn't kind of figured that out? He's not trying to hide or disguise himself. He's not working a regular job in an alternate identity. Lex Luthor is not required to figure this out. Yet Manta says several times he needs help finding him? Clearly Mantas...a retard! Yet....<br/><br/>There was nothing to imply Manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology, yet he does it in 2 minutes? Because he needed to! It would have been far better to have an Atlantian weapons tech create it for him He's one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed. Like how 100's of people in TV and Movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time. In this case Manta is Tony Stark when he needs to be.<br/><br/>To me if somebody is THIS SMART, why are they a pirate? Why are they covertly working for Atlantis? How did they meet? Too many ""just because"" things. Another annoying thing...the bad guys of Atlantis clearly know EXACTLY where Arthur lives, which opens a large kettle of fish.<br/><br/>At one point a villain will reveal he's known who was loyal to him and who wasn't the entire time. Which again brings up more questions than answers.<br/><br/>Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman as a surfer/biker. It helps cement him as about as non royal as King Ralph. He's a fish out of water. One thing that should be amended is he's able to talk to all sorts of Marine life, not just fish.<br/><br/>Ok so there's flaws. Then there's these 1/10 reviews. Also ridiculous. The movie is light hearted without mimicking Thor Ragnarok which got a little too silly. The acting is not going to win any awards. But I don't see Anthony Hopkins getting considerations for his Marvel work either.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning. The fight scenes are great! The chase scene rivals any Bond movie. Aquaman is very strong and invulnerable. But he's not Superman and this is shown very well that he's a notch below, but not too far below.<br/><br/>This was a great effort. Not as good as WonderWoman, but not too far off."
"AnishMisra","8","1","1","22 December 2018"," Aquaman Review
","Aquaman is a film co-written and directed by James Wan. I remember being the few people who actually liked the trailer and what it was actually going for. I was with the film from the beginning. After watching it today, it felt like an adventure filled ride.<br/><br/>Plot: Arthur Curry, the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.<br/><br/>Story and direction: I have adored James Wan as a director for quite a long time. I even liked his film Furious 7 (maybe I will go on to say the best the series had). So, with the film I was quite positive that I would fully understand as to what Wan wants to achieve. And he totally achieves it in this film. His vision is huge and he does complete justice to it. The film is a big celebration of CGI and style. The action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed on wide angles, which hugely impressed me. The creature designs and production design are impressive. Also, the comedy is just spot on. I laughed at even the smallest joke that was cracked. The emotional aspect of the film, although very small, was just great. The characterization for most of the characters were spot on. They were not perfect which is what I liked. The musical score was fabulous. The VFX was great and in 3D it just was awesome. Some things that bogged me down was the runtime. At times, it does feel that the film was dragging. Also, the first act did feel a bit rushed and I did feel that they could have built on certain aspects of that act. Orm as a villain was a bit cliched. He didn't have any such motivation for his actions.<br/><br/>Performances: Jason Mamoa lived through the role of Arthur Curry. From the first scene onwards, he just makes you believe that he is strong. Amber Heard complements Jason's character nicely. Patrick Wilson was good with what he was given to do. William Dafoe was good as Nuis Vulko. Yahta Abdul Mateen II was bad-ass. It was god to see Dolph Ludgren. Finally, Nicole Kidman and Temeura Morrison were great as Aquaman's parents.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene with Arthur and Mera on the Sahara. That scene was very funny. The jokes were spot on. Adding to that, the scenery was just awesome.<br/><br/>Verdict: If you enjoy big adventure and CGI filled action films, then this film is perfect for you. If not, then I would advise to stay away from the film. Yes, the film is not perfect and has some flaws, but I did have a fun time with the film. If the makers are planning a sequel they surely have excited me. The DC Extended Universe has definitely redeemed itself and I am looking forward to its future films.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"jkuun96","8","1","1","22 December 2018"," Good superhero movie
","Aquaman is the archetypal good superhero movie. It has fun (a lot of fun), comedy, a hero's quest, action (which is remarkably well done and different from the Marvel type), self-discovery and a touch of romance.<br/><br/>The downside is a somewhat predictable plot, but the joy is in the adventure rather than the story. Mamoa aces his character.<br/><br/>The underwater theme also gives this film a unique feel that you didn't get in any prior superhero movie.<br/><br/>And all of this comes from a guy who expected nothing and didn't really wish to even watch it.

At the beginning I thought it might hae been involuntarily funny, but in the end I hope it was intentional. The colors, the costumes, the music, the characters, the storyline...

","So the best Aqua-version doesn't come from James Cameron and Vinnie Chase anymore but from James Wan and Jason Mamoa.<br/><br/>Mamoa is Arthur, the son of a love affair between a human and the fish queen of Atlantis. A grown-up Arthur wants nothing to do with his mother's kingdom but is called upon to stop his half-brother from starting a war with the surface world.<br/><br/>And Mamoa's got this, turning what is a silly looking character into a true Son of Anarchy. He checks off all the boxes, the physique, the brood, the macho rough-necking, and the funny.<br/><br/>Really the whole cast is excellent here. He's got good chemistry with Amber Heard, who trades comic barbs and personal lessons with him, and fights well, but will be remembered most for this.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe shows up sporting a man bun as Arthur's former mentor, Nicole Kidman plays Arthur's mom.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson plays the half-brother, he does a fine job, but runs into the problem that usually plagues Marvel villains of having nothing to do after a while.<br/><br/>I much preferred Manta, a villain with a legit reason for wanting revenge on Arthur.<br/><br/>Most of these fish people talk perfectly underwater, which is silly, but the way they're able to see underwater is a gorgeous effect that rivals Avatar.<br/><br/>Really everything from the action sequences, sets, costumes is a fantastical visual. Is it going for realism? Well at one point we see an octopus playing bongo drums so you tell me.<br/><br/>Point is- it's pretty zany mix of things you might see in a Thor film and Pixar film and it's fun.<br/><br/>Much of this focuses on a magical trident and fish people angry over pollution. Do we care? To a point. 2 hours and 20 minutes of this is a little much though and there should have been more of an effort to curb that.<br/><br/>Overall this is fun, thrilling, and a visual pleasure with a real star turn from Mamoa. You'll want to see it on a big screen.<br/><br/>If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more"

","Let me preface this by saying that I am normally VERY forgiving of subpar movies.<br/><br/>However, this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. At this point, I feel as if the world is playing a joke on me with the positive reviews I've been seeing.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that I had high hopes of this movie being spectacular. The moment I read about Mamoa being cast a few years ago, I was ecstatic! He seems to be the perfect fit for Aquaman! However, the concept of an Aquaman movie, seems kind of silly. He talks to animals? In the water? Sure, but a movie? Just saying, no high hopes, just wanted a good time!<br/><br/>The acting? Terrible. Character development? None! Visual effects? Seems like a beginner. If 1993 Jurassic Park could create effects like it did, why was this so bad 15 years later? Directing? Awful. So many shots were pointless, and honestly, dumb. The script? Well, let's just say there was a solid 10 minutes where the back and forth dialogue was comprised of 4 word sentences. Villains? Two half assed villains, that don't really seem that awful...which is, you know, not great for a villian! It seemed like there was an attempt made at a soundtrack, and then just quit. There were 3 heavy synth 80s songs, and then Pitbull for a bit. What was that about?<br/><br/>I don't even want to start on Willem Dafoe's wig and costume.<br/><br/>The plot seemed to grab aspects of other movies, and threw them together, trying to make something stick. 3 points for every moment you recognize: Aladdin, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Power Rangers.<br/><br/>I have never cringed as much, or as consistently, as I did during this movie. I could honestly go on and on about every aspect of this movie that I found terrible, but it's doubtful that anyone will read.<br/><br/>TLDR; DC has to be deleting negative reviews. The cast should be ashamed of this movie. Don't go see it."

The movie, like most DC origin movies, takes place at a lighthouse on the east coast in 1985, where Aquaman is born to an American husband and an Atlantian queen and is raised by his underwater friends. Along the way, he will face many foes, the most important being Black Manta (if you don't know who that it, read the comics as well as watch the Super Friends cartoon), who will play a major role in the upcoming sequel after you see the mid credits scene.

Don't you think Superman would have been there in damned seconds to save the day? Or the rest of Justice League? See what I mean by timeline? The timeline is wrong. I see why they did it that way, but it still makes no sense for Sups not to be there when all that was happening. Unless, they showed somewhere that Superman wasn't on the planet at the time.

","Arthur Curry's (Jason Momoa) parents are a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and Atlantean queen (Nicole Kidman). When a war between the subsurface world of Atlantis and its ruler Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens the human world, Curry must confront his past to save the day.
Imagine if someone cut together all the biggest action sequences from the last few decades of Hollywood, resulting in a mash of Tron, Avatar, Clash Of The Titans, Superman, Jurassic Park, and Gladiator. Imagine a film where an octopus gets a drum solo, and it isn't among the top ten weirdest moments. Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either.
Our lead is Aquaman/Arthur Curry, a portrait of the superhero as bar-brawler. This sometime Justice Leaguer (it's barely mentioned) is larger than life and twice as fond of a beer. Arthur gives the impression Momoa just rolled out of bed, went surfing and drove from the beach straight to set, and the film's all the better for his slightly hungover air. But instead we cut away to endless Atlantean politicking, with Patrick Wilson's CGI-suited Orm floating around on a war-shark (which is a thing?), working on his Julian Sands impression. Orm wants a war with humanity, so executes a false-flag submarine attack. That might lead another hero on a film-long quest to prove humanity's innocence, but here it's barely mentioned again; nor is a first-act tsunami felt around the world. There are bigger, er, fish to fry.
There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top.
Instead we're on two parallel but equally bonkers quests. Orm must unite his kingdom of Atlantis with Dolph Lundgren's seahorse riders, Djimon Hounsou's mer-men and Brian Blessed's crab dudes. Meanwhile, Arthur must escape a place, and decipher a thing to find another thing in order to earn the throne and stop the war. His primarily human upbringing means he's a fish out of water whenever he's in the water, following the long-ago disappearance of his mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman). For guidance and a modicum of sense Arthur relies entirely on Amber Heard's Mera, a Little Mermaid cosplayer who is his main source of exposition.
The plot is honestly a mess: over-complicated yet predictable. What makes the film passably entertaining is that director James Wan throws astonishing amounts of action at the wall, and much of it sticks (though not always together). There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top, exploding in such strange ways. Just when you think you have a handle on it, something bizarre will happen. Nicole Kidman defending her baby son by taking out a death squad, say, or villain Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, underserved) inexplicably detouring to the North Sea (the film's geography is deeply non-specific), or a Star Wars-alike battle on the seabed.
Momoa takes every inch of space the film gives him and runs a mile on sheer roguish charm, and Wan is a sufficiently gifted action director not just to keep you watching but to regularly dazzle you. But it's all just so much. You sense that they didn't trust this hero to hold our attention, and they really should have done. He's more fun than any octopoid percussionist."

Another tiny flaw .....even though the dialogues are quite good in this movie ... but unfortunately I didn't got any goosbumping dialogues that I got in Infinity war .....but it was washed away by the mindboggling VFX that kept me wowing ðŸ˜µ

"jeannefrancoise","9","5","12","12 December 2018"," This movie will stay for a very long time in our heart and make us want to live in the ocean
","Dear DC fans, here is Aquaman finally played in Indonesian theaters. Jason Mamoa, wooowww of course he is beyond perfect. Amber Heard is so much improved and proved herself as part of DC heroes. This movie also remarks that James Wan could produce a very good action packed superhero movie. This is a really sexy movie with bold characters beautifully built to make us want to live in the ocean. The plots are combination with gentle romance of love, origin of superhero Aquaman, the appearance of politics under the water kingdoms, and also some real footages about global warming. In this globalization world, perhaps humankind just felt guilty about what happened in our oceans, but here the main idea is how far a population could defend the existence of their kingdom and how much the power to have peace than to do war. Peace and war is finally seen in the actions of Aquaman, as the master of ocean, King of Atlantis, and the peacemaker of Earth and the Sea. Aquaman never denied his hidden identity, but at the same time, he felt guilty as the death of his mother. On the other side, his half-brother doesn't want to approve Aquaman as his family. Family conflict then becomes international issue with the timing of global warming against the existence of the ocean kingdoms, credited by profitable scientists who argue and debate for the myth of Atlantis itself. Atlantis is protected by the Trisula and the appearance of Trisula many times. Trisula is also the symbol of Aquaman. Triangle form of Trisula is somehow a perfection, balance, and solid ground theory to do more and more to be the best and unbeatable foundation of life's aspects. To support the main story, we are being told the Aquaman insight in his ""Trisula"" stages; in child times, growing up, and being mature that all directed us to his identity to be himself, but by scarifying some of his ego in land base to be united with sea base, being defeated, then cameback, and tried to be peace maker. The beautiful editing finalization, professional special effects, cool back sounds, and soft developing characters make us believe that ocean has a more beautiful underwater kingdom, than the bad political condition above (on the Earth). All details are so real. This movie will stay for a very long time in our heart and make us want to live in the ocean."

","After Arthur Curry aka Aqua Man was properly introduced in Justice League, I felt the character was lacking and wasn't given enough material to work with. Justice League left a bland taste in my mouth but I'm very happy to say Aqua Man is excellent!<br/><br/>Essential it's the DC equivalent of Thor Ragnarok; the visuals are amazing with an explosion of colours on screen which were actually goosebump inducing at times and the action is the best seen in the DCEU yet! The choreography and wide camera shots mean you can track every fight scene and really see the impact of the fight. The battles are just epic in scale and destruction<br/><br/>The story has definitely cemented Arthur Curry's place in the DCEU, much like what was done with Diana in Wonder Woman. At times it is silly, a bit cheesy but honestly, it works in favour of the character. I couldn't see a gritty Aqua Man film working because look at the character material!<br/><br/>8.5 / 9"
"mwpowellhtx","2","4","9","27 January 2019"," I do not ever want to hear another dig on the GL movie
","Really. I mean it. GL was arguable better than this one, I think. This one had a number of name actors from various tracks, from earlier Spider-Man franchise, from the Watchmen franchise, and so on. The childhood trips down memory lane felt forced and, in large part, I think, entirely unnecessary. There was a pseudo arch-villain mini-origin inside this sort-of-origin-sort-of-JL-sequel: namely, that of Black Manta. Which was, I think, kind of a funny sub-plot, dig on the old Super Friends franchise. But all we got from BM was a minor skirmish and a rather ignominious demise; we do get a teaser in the post-credits, though. If you know the reference, you know what I am talking about. But he was really just a tool in the movie, used by the political coup over tones. So many plots and subplots in this one, the film really didn't know what it wanted to be: an origin, or a sequel. It would have been interesting to see a couple of cameos of JL heroes, but with the depth of the cast, I can see why that would be difficult. Last but not least, really, this one was pretty bad, IMO, and gives the GL movie a run for its money for its stench. Just one man's opinion, FWIW."

","There was tons of potential for a good story. But they didn't really develop a storyline much. They instead only gave a bunch of CGI and fight scenes mainly. And the acting... not that great.

"aliases-53334","2","4","9","28 December 2018"," What a snoozefest
","This film caught me by surprise by how bad it was. While the effects and the underwater world were nice, the entire movie was lacking a smart script and storyline that can drow the viewer in, however packed with cliche jokes, pointless characters, too long battle scenes to the point of yawning, and a very childish like design of the enemies.
Aquaman is clearly a great actor who drew attantion with his drooling body, but after 15 minutes the lure is gone, and the very long film could have easily cut 40 minutes.
Amber Heard lacks charisma and her only role being in the film was clearly to creata a romance interest for the lead actor, which is flat out boring.
The best part in the film was Nicole Kidman's story, which was sadly only a fracture of the film. Maybe they should have done a movie about her story instead of Aquaman."
"austin0731","6","4","9","28 December 2018"," Visually stunning step in the right direction for DC
","Aquaman sets itself aside from the rest of the DC films by being what in my opinion is the best the franchise had to offer so far. Comparisons are bound to be made with the franchise's other arguable hit, Wonder Woman. Personally I think Aquaman beats Wonder Woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows Wonder Woman's failure of a third act out of the water.<br/><br/>Which really is the story of Aquaman's success, it is a film that is wonderful to look at, the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level, with underwater shots and CGI that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before. The film had an interesting villain in Ocean mater, his motivations were well justified as the best villains should.<br/><br/>Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were brilliant as Arthur and Mera as director James Wan excellently blends the actor's own traits into the characters. Utilizing Momoa's culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of Aquaman.<br/><br/>Aquaman is bound to wow audiences, while it's not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals."
"zacharywcole","5","4","9","26 December 2018"," So Bad It's Hilarious
","Aquaman (2018) was a highly anticipated film for fans of the DCEU. With the release of Wonder Woman (2017) getting praised by critics, Warner Brothers seemed to have stepped up their game in comparison to Marvel Studios. When the trailer first dropped excitement among DC Universe fans was split. Many people were very excited for the upcoming film, whereas others thought the trailer seemed very cheesy and their excitement for the film began to die out. Then, the movie hit theaters.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is interesting. Aquaman's mother washes up on some rocks in Maine during a thunderstorm, when Aquaman's father sees her. He takes her into his home and she is scared at first, until she passes out on his couch. When she wakes up, she eats his goldfish right in front of him. After a little bit of conversation, she reveals that she is the Queen of Atlantis. This is one of the many very weird scenes. It is discussed that many people believe in Atlantis and the existence of Atlantians, and we can assume that Aquaman's father is one of them. This is a very funny moment in the movie. Later, they conceive Aquaman. Years later, some Atlantian soldiers come to take back their Queen, after a slow-motion fight scene with many awkward camera angles, she goes with them. It is told to the audience later that she dies. The movie spends so much time on the fact that she is dead that it is such a shock when she is revealed to be alive. Though, her character remains flat and adds little emotion. She is also used as a plot device to get Aquaman and his brother to stop fighting later.<br/><br/>The conflict between Aquaman and his brother is forced. They both decide they mutually hate each other for stupid reasons. They both say they want to kill the other, and both reluctantly accept that the the other will have to die.<br/><br/>Black Manta's character in this film is useless and stupid. The characters are only ever running from him and they always escape. He is provided with Atlantian armor and then he suddenly knows everything about is and is an engineer as he does work on the armor and paints it black. He makes a comment about how he will need a bigger helmet and the next time we see him he has a comically large helmet.<br/><br/>Every time there is any important dialogue between Aquaman and his love interest there is also an explosion. It is pretty lame and ridiculous. Nobody is ever affected by the explosions and there are way too many in the film.<br/><br/>There is also an attack on Atlantis by the surface world and it is never explained who attacked Atlantis or why. Nobody on the surface world knows about this attack. It is only ever mentioned a couple more times in the film.<br/><br/>There are very kid-like dialogues in this film. However the movie is very visually appealing. The colors are astounding as well as the CGI. If you are looking for an action packed, very serious movie then this is not for you. If you are looking for a hilariously bad superhero movie then this is for you."
"rclldc","8","4","9","26 December 2018"," Great fun
","I actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I felt Jason Mamoa IS Aquaman. Not comic book red head pale skinned Aquaman which after thinking about it made no sense... Especially since the story of Atlantis are not pale skinned gingers. I liked Manta. their fight scene could have been a little longer, but you care more about the brother rivalry. Special effects were also super good. I hope this is a turning point for DC. they now have 2 good movies. And an abundance of bad ones. Next up is Shazam!"

"ethan-33027","8","4","9","21 December 2018"," A very solid blockbuster movie
","I went in to this movie with very low expectations. DC movies tend to be very inconsistent with their movies so even though I really liked the trailer, I really liked BVS's trailer as well, but we all know how that movie turned out. Wonder Woman did really well and was quite a solid movie so I'm hoping that this movie will be on par with Wonder Woman, and i must say, it was so freaking amazing. I've heard before going in that it feels like a Marvel Phase 1 movie, like Thor or something, and to some extent I agree. But, in my opinion, this movie feels like it has a very simple premise, but somehow their execution was so damm well that it turned out better than it should have been. And i'm not mad at all.<br/><br/>I'd like to discuss about certain aspects of the movie like the plot, cgi, setting all those goodies as well as running down the character's list to check out each actor and actresses individual performance. First off, I must say the plot is actually pretty simple. The whole arc of the movie revolves around Aruther distinguishing the idea between King and Hero. He also has to learn to get over the ""hold everything responsible"" trope and learn to take on responsibility as the king. I thought that the movie did really well trying to conveys this through Mera and Aruther's first encounter, where we dive straight into the issue that Aruther must learn to overcome, as well as I think the most important scene in the movie, which is Mera and Aruther's talk on the boat, where he has to learn to accept reality and stop doubting himself.<br/><br/>Speaking of Aruther, let's talk about the Aquaman himself. He feels very real and although, I didn't initially liked the casting of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, he's grown on me and really like all the emotional scenes he has with Mera, his mother and everyone else. He really does sell the idea and Director James Wan makes the character seem very genuine and relatable. Mera was great. She's how I always thought she should be. Badass, hot and not a damsel in distress. Her chemistry with Aruther was really believable and they're really good couple, and that kiss though!!<br/><br/>The CGI was really breathtaking and just, really really good. From the underwater swimming scenes, to the Atlantis structures and scenes to the fight scenes (especially the fight scenes, freaking amazing), there's so much to see in this movie. The attention to detail is just really nice to see.<br/><br/>Now for the villains, black manta and Ocean master. I would just like to say that that their suits are one of the most comic accurate costumes I've seen in a while and its just very nice to see. Black Manta was pretty good in this movie. I liked that they were able to integrate an origin story of sorts into the movie without making too forced. Black manta was a nice addition but wasn't really needed and was just here to set up the sequel. Ocean Master on the other hand, who I thought was going to a joke in this movie, was actually not that bad of a villain. I mean he does have his own twisted motivation, it makes sense, and he is menacing while doing it. So kudos to the actor. I particularly like his and Aruther's exchange before their first fight because it showed not only his motivations, but the conflict between Aquaman and Him, and thus showing a clash in ideologies, which I love.<br/><br/>The father and mother of Aruther storyline was quite boring and put aside. I didn't really cared for either of them and when it was revealed spoiler alert that Aruther's mother was still alive, it really wasn't that surprising and honestly the movie could probably have been the same without her showing up. Oh well...<br/><br/>If I had one more complaint, it would be that the plot was quite predictable, and there were no twist or surprises. No cameos as well. But that's it. I can't think I anything else I didn't like.<br/><br/>Overall, this a very solid movie, full with exciting action pieces, compelling characters and beautiful visuals. I'd say it's the perfect family movie or blockbuster movie and if you have the time, which you should have (it's Christmas), you should definitely give this movie a try."

","I will just say that this movie is not terrible, so there's that. But it's literally just 2 hours of world building and CGI. It's boring. This is certainly one of the better DCEU movies in recent years, as it isn't as ridiculous as BVS and it isn't a broken dumpster fire like Suicide Squad, but at the same time, if the best DC has managed to do in recent years is this and Wonder Woman, which was only decent, then I don't think this cinematic universe thing is gonna take off. I get that quite a few people like this movie and in the end that's fine, but this movie made me incredibly bored by the half way point. And this movie tries to be retro a lot and while I appreciate the effort, it just came off as jarring.<br/><br/>It's an average movie with glimmers of a great one throughout, but they're only that.

","Jason Momoa is yet another hyped up actor in a big budget film, kinda similar to when Vin Diesel was in XXX and women watched it mainly just to see the star and his muscles.

These types of movies are for kids, eye candy visuals with no substance."
"PlataVilla","10","3","6","1 January 2019"," Spectacular All Around
","This movie, to me, was spectacular all around. I was pleasantly surprised at both the ""Earthy, human love"" elements and quick spots of humor that subtly permeated the movie - how Arthur came into being, incidents at various points of his childhood, and how he was trained as a warrior. You don't see that in many Superhero movies. Oh yeah, there was that Wonder Woman movie. I loved Arthur's reluctant hero attitude, smart mouth, and negative view toward his Mother's people. How would you feel about them if you knew what he knew?<br/><br/>The story line was straightforward and clear, the bad guys weren't really without cause but still needed to be put down, and the movie did not drag along. Actually, the action was virtually non-stop throughout the movie. The casting was awesome. Momoa, Kidman, Heard, Dafoe, and Wilson seemed to be made for their roles - most of all Jason Momoa. Who but he could have done as well as Arthur?<br/><br/>And the CGI/graphic portions of the movie were amazing. James Wan was able to let it all hang out here - I think partially because a lot of the movie takes place under water, we get a chance to see CGI in all it's three-dimensional glory. I remember thinking while watching that I had not seen such visually stunning scenes in a movie since Avatar - and, no, I'm not saying this movie in any way matches up with Avarar; just some of the amazing visual aspects.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding movie. Go see it on the big screen!"

","So I watched Aquaman and I have to say it has quickly become one of my favourite superhero movies together with the Dark Knight and the Deadpool movies.The visuals, costumes and cgi are stunning, the musical score is great the fight scenes are beautifully shot and choreographed but most important all the characters are very well fleshed out, with motivations and complete arcs. Especially the villains and Aquaman himself. The movie is epic in scope and the climax is very satisfying. 100% recommend!"
"classicsoncall","8","3","6","29 December 2018"," ""Legend has it that one day... a new king will come.""
","The movie is visually impressive, I'll give it that. The underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done. Story wise, though, it was fairly formulaic, and quite honestly, after about the first hour or so, I started getting bored with it. The dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the DC Comics universe. When Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) response to one of his beleaguered foes, (can't even remember who that was now), was 'Screw you!"", I could only groan in embarrassment. This is not what I expected to be coming from the mouth of the future King of Atlantis.<br/><br/>I thought Jason Momoa was a very good choice for the Aquaman role. He has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and I think he's a credit to the DC universe. Maybe it was Amber Heard's brilliantly rendered red hair, but I couldn't warm up to her character as Mera, Aquaman's future queen. The rest of the A-list cast was generally OK, although personally, I don't think Nicole Kidman should come anywhere near super-hero movies based on comic books.<br/><br/>Though my rating of the movie is favorably high, it's all due to the cinematography and capable CGI utilized by the film makers. The after credits sequence sets up the sequel with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who didn't impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind King Orm (Patrick Wilson). His look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes, perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up Aquaman flick.<br/><br/>As an aside, I couldn't get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on IMDb since it came out. They really offer nothing in the way of an individual writer's support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it. Could do that in a tweet. I guess that says I'm in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that IMDb used to have."
"darkguardian-99861","8","3","6","29 December 2018"," The ""Worst DC hero"" has the best DCEU film...so far
","Before I start, know that I know nothing about Aquaman, aside from the many jokes about how he can talk to fish.
So, I went to see the movie and frankly, I enjoyed it a lot. The visuals are excellent with vibrant intense colors (but I will have to give you a SEIZURE WARNING if you have an issue), humour and nice action. The characters were written decently and the pacing was nice enough, so that no point in the movie became boring.
I had my doubts about the director, since all I could see were horror movies, but the guy knew just what the movie needed and props to the guy to know just when the movie had to be dark and when it had to be light.<br/><br/>I hope I don't trigger a lot of you but my ranking of the DCEU films so far is Aquaman>Wonder Woman>Justice League>BatmanVSuperman>Suicide Squad.
The reason I put Aquaman above is that Wonder Woman reminds me a bit of Captain America: The First Avenger.<br/><br/>To conclude, Aquaman resparked my interest in DC movies, since the director knew the proper style he had to use and I'm hopeful that the new DCEU movies will have directors that know their stuff and we don't have another dark DC movie, unless the hero fits it."

It had its cheesy/cringey moments and it had its really great moments. The first hour (maybe hour and a half) of the movie dragged on a little, but it picked up the pace pretty fast after that.<br/><br/>I think it did a great job explaining the origin and enjoyable for those who love sci fi.

The dialogue was horrible, the acting was really bad and the writing (script) was a mess! I am a DC fan and was very disappointed. They destroyed Aquaman. I grew up watching and reading about Aquaman and the sea creatures that was loyal to him. This movie didn't capture the relationship Aquaman had with the sea creatures. Instead they attempted to copy Star Wars with enemy soldiers and all of the special effects. If you want to see a movie with lots of special effects, ridiculous fight scenes, stupid costumes and poor actors then this movie is for you. By the way, Amber Heard cannot act! She was absolutely horrible."

To say this movie is visually stunning is an understatement and every reason you need as to why you should go see it on the big screen. Choose your theater wisely. You could tell the theater I was at had a dated projection and sound system which hindered the overall experience. It was the equivalent of watching a movie on an old 720p TV with the built in sound instead of a state of the art OLED 4K with 7.2 surround sound or better.

But for being a mostly CGI movie, it worked, and it made me think a live action version of The Little Mermaid may be possible after all. And the action sequences actually held my interest! What I think a lot of people will not like about this movie is that it had more of a comic book-y feeling than the others, but that's probably why I liked it! With that being said, it meant that the costumes were laughably over-the-top. I would say the weakest aspect of the movie is the acting, which is pretty sub par, especially from the 2 leads and Aquaman's teenage self (that acting was cringe-worthy!) Overall, between this film and Wonder Woman, I think DC may have a chance of catching up to Marvel!"

Go and watch it for yourself. Only after you experienced the movie, only then you can have an informed decision about it. If I wanted to be treated to a philosophical debate about a meaning of life or culture, I would not go to a movie theater. I would read books. A movie is an 'escape' from reality, an entertainment so to speak in order to decompress. Aquaman does just that. It's pure entertainment topped with stunning visual effects.

"philday44","5","3","6","21 December 2018"," Huge Disappointment
","I am a huge fan of comic book movies and while the DC universe movies are no where near as close to the Avengers movies, I still enjoyed and rate highly the majority of what DC has brought to the big screen recently. However, I was expecting big things from Jason Mamoa's character in Aquaman based on his performance in Justice League and maybe that was the problem with this movie is that my expectations were not met by a long shot. Mamoa's appeal is his raw crudeness as a character but he comes across less than sophomoric and actually quite boring. I think DC was trying to bring a Thor-like character to Aquaman, strong but humorous in nature but they missed the mark greatly. Mamoa's dialogue is weak and wasn't even slightly funny. So basically, Momoa's is more of a supporting actor in my opinion and hasn't yet risen to lead actor. Nicole Kidman's performance was fantastic and so was Amber Heard's. Even Dafoe, Wilson and Lundgren did great jobs in their character, which probably made Mamoa look even weaker. I imagine it is tough to look like a star when playing alongside movie greats like Kidman and Dafoe.<br/><br/>
Second issue I had with the film is the writing. The story is weak and predictable. If this had been a ""pre-marvel universe"" movie such that it had come out prior the epic series by Marvel, I would have given the movie much closer to a perfect score because it was cinematically well done. But that is just it, it now competes and measures up against what Marvel is doing and it is no where close. The movie feels self-contained and focuses on delivering a jaw-dropping visual adventure while forgetting the story. The graphic visualization of Atlantis and the underwater battles are fantastic, but that is just it, it overwhelms the audience and leaves the story to just that, a battle of good against evil with nothing else. There is no Superman, or Batman, or Flash or even Wonder Woman that make an appearance to somewhat tie the movies together. So if you like the self-contained movie in a box experience, this isn't bad. But if you wanted to see a DC universe film that extends ""justice league"" concept, I am not sure you will find it here."

It follows a compacted linear storyline with multiple character origins. I felt pushed through the movie rather than lead through the plot. Dialogue seems rushed just to get to another panorama or fight scenes. Basically ""travel- talk- boom!- fight- travel- talk- boom!- fight"". There are no space between scenes or conversations to take in what happened.
Plus the treasure hunting in the movie is a bit forced, They get to a place, spend minimal time searching, and instantly found the next clue, and repeat.
In comparison to other DCEU movies, fight sequences and visuals are on par or even better, but the writing is just not that good."

"southdavid","5","3","6","18 December 2018"," Dampen your enthusiasm
","I'm at a bit of a quandary about how to review ""Aquaman"" here. It's not good, that's fair to say but I've a strange feeling it's about as good as its ridiculous source material would allow it to be.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is Arthur Curry. Hilariously he's supposed to be 29 years old. He's also the son of Atlanna, fleeing queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) and Tom, a lighthouse keeper, played (in unconvincing de-aging CGI by Temurea Morrison). His half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens to unite the undersea kingdoms and wage war on the land dwellers, so Arthur returns home to challenge his brother for control of the undersea realms.<br/><br/>So, whilst it's not really acting as such, Jason Momoa is always watchable and his charisma will carry you through quite a distance. The film also has a few decent action sequences along the way, particularly the underwater battle that concludes it and the opening fight scene on board a submarine. That's about it for the positives though.<br/><br/>On dozens of occasions, ""Aquaman"" is laugh out loud hilariously awful. The plot is terrible, a clichÃ© ridden McGuffin hunt, a painfully obvious twist towards the end and some awful foreshadowing plot points. It has, noticeably, terrible music choices throughout - a horrible score of pretend wonder. The rest of the performances apart from Momoa are dreadful, particularly Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren but nobody else comes off particularly well. It's the script though, that should have been drowned. From ""This was your grandfathers knife, he was a frogman in World War 2, then they turned their back on him"" onwards it's a terrible collection of recycled everything you've heard before in action movies for the last thirty years. It's painfully unaware how unfunny it is too.<br/><br/>The CGI is patchy, happier with real creatures and vehicles than it is with fictional characters. It often ignores its own internal logic too, at one point Curry hangs onto to a building to avoid a ten foot drop - but before and after that he happily falls hundreds of feet and shrugs it off. Conventional weapons can't damage Curry, until towards the end, where one can. Nobody runs away when a shark starts to crack an aquarium wall.<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm not convinced there is a better ""Aquaman"" movie possible than this one but I'm not sure that's any reason to pretend this one is any good."

This movie contains Star wars city experience, Avatar type world exploring, Uncharted type of adventure, Final Fantasy type of technology (you got advanced tech and mythical tech), Fast Furious type of scoring and new type of fighting and choreography. The cinematography also is the best point of this movie. Experiencing this movie in IMAX or 3D is a must!<br/><br/>The story is kinda simple, since this is an adventure movie. And that's for me is a safe game from Wan, since DCEU needs to be enjoyed by everyone.<br/><br/>In the end, its not the best DC Movie, not the worst, not the plain one, not popcorn type one too. But AQUAMAN is the movie that you must enjoy and experience!"

","Aquaman is an incredibly epic adventure and great fun, resulting in one of the best films in the DCEU. Jason Momoa is great as Arthur Curry/Aquaman and surprisingly good at comedy. Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman all give great supporting performances. Yayha Abdul-Mateen II is also really good as Black Manta and Patrick Wilson is good as Orm/Ocean Master. James Wan's direction is incredible resulting in incredible action sequences and visually stunning moments throughout. The cg is amazing for the most part. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is amazing. However, the de-aging cg at the beginning isn't good."

","Here's a superhero movie which is a good one time watch but nothing that you'll remember in 30 days. The SFX & VFX is great. The cast in the movie does a respectable job & the dialogues (every now and then) are pretty funny. However, the script is 30 mins too long & somewhere you start looking at your watch in the last half hour or so. I do not think the audience will look forward to the next instalment (if there is a plan for one)."

"scanhead25-113-819834","10","3","6","16 December 2018"," DC finally made something that can wow every MCU fan
","I am overwhelmed and so amazed by this film, I am a fan of both DC and MCU characters. The last time that i am trilled watching the action and awesome storyline was during the Superman, but after I was waiting for something like that again and finally you gave us Aquaman. Every part of the film, visuals,action and cinematography made me to glue to screen ...so amazing!!!"
"anupapu8","8","3","6","16 December 2018"," Yes It delivers on the promise.
","AQUAMAN - Before starting the review a little box office update. Right now Aquaman is forth highest grossing Superhero movie in China behind just Infinity War , Venom and Age of Ultron. And with this speed it will probably cross Age of Ultron and then Venom to take the 2nd spot , so i think the box office prospects of the movie are going to be good.<br/><br/>Now just for the sake of Comparison i think Aquaman is on the par with Batman Begins in Ranking DC movies behind Dark Knight , Dark Knight Rises and Wonder Woman. But just like last year's Thor 3 (being the most fun movie of MCU) this is the most fun movie of DCEU , which is not saying much actually because DCEU is not known for being fun and no the Jokes of this film doesn't go as high as Thor 3 but its still a movie as good as that one (another Comparison).<br/><br/>I mean this movie doesn't go dark ever. And honestly m not a big fan of this type of Superhero Movies . Its not like i dislike them , its just something which i don't prefer in comparison to the darker movies likes of Batman Trilogy and Man Of Steel. But in anytime i would prefer a good fun movie then an average Darker Film. And thats what Aquaman provides.<br/><br/>Honestly saying the storyline is pretty basic. There is not much in the writing section. Its very much like Fast and Furious films , having a basic plot and jumping from one location to another for one after another actions sequence not providing much when action is not happening. But we still love Fast and Furious films for its action and its gorgeous visual , and I loved Aquaman for the same.<br/><br/>The imagination and World building is on some other level (Oscar for Best Visual Effect written all over it). Far far far better then Black Panther (with which it also had some storyline similarities). Watching this movie in 3D (which i did) and if possible in IMAX(which i unfortunately didn't) is the best possible way. Its so grand and gorgeous that it will take another whole review to just discuss about ATLANTIS.<br/><br/>The action scenes ? They were HARD , i mean really really HARD. Another comparison to Fast and Furious movies. Every punch in the movie is like a Steel Punch, with Heart Pumping sound effects. U can feel the hurt that the person receiving the punch was feeling.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only technical department which disappointed me was the music. Its good in some parts but weird in some other parts. Never unique , some weird song choices , i mean who needs songs in Superhero movies , there 4-5 of them in this film. Which is shocking because its the same composer who did Wonder Woman , which had exceptionally good music.<br/><br/>Them comes Jason Mamoa. Well he is a below average actor, but thats what we got. And he managed really well when tough scenes were not provided to them. He certainly looks the part and damn good in the action scenes. But that's it. And i am not complaining.<br/><br/>In comparison Amber Heard acted really well. I always liked her acting but she has always been considered a B Grade average actress with alot of bad movies in her filmography. I hope this will changer that thinking. Nicole Kidman didn't get much to do , but got one really small yet great action scene.<br/><br/>So its a step in the right direction for DCEU(a line many reviewers are saying because its true). Lets see what SHAZAM will have in its bag when it will release next year.<br/><br/>8.1/10"

"dianaradney","9","3","6","16 December 2018"," Visually stunning and I I'm not just talking Momoa
","Let's face it, Mamoa is physical perfection. You could roll 2 hrs of him and have a hit. But Aquaman is Momoa and a lot more! The underwater scenes as they explore the different kingdoms and Seas are just awesome. At times the movie reminded me of the bright neon colors from Tron and Avatar... other times the creatures seemed to cross over from Pacific Rim. The story was beautiful and the characters engaging. I didn't think I'd like Mira but she stole the screen on more than one occassion and could hold her own with Momoas personality. She's a fun cross between Ariel and the Black Widow. Go see it, buy the popcorn and enjoy the eye candy. It's worth every penny."
"kingsgrl2010","7","3","6","16 December 2018"," I really hope DC makes a Sequel, these characters deserve it.
","A movie where Nicole Kidman is a badass Atlantian Queen, Jason Momoa is a badass rightful Atlantian King, and Amber Heard is a badass Xebellian Princess.<br/><br/>oh, and it's directed by James Wan.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a fun undersea romp of a movie. Nothing groundbreaking here but a solid addition to the DC universe. As a fan of Wonder Woman and Man of Steel, this is my third favorite movie of the franchise so far.<br/><br/>The writing is lacking and this movie definitely is a paint by the numbers superhero movie, but I really enjoyed the ride. The visual effects, the music, and the acting are all top notch.<br/><br/>It is not a full set up of him becoming Aquaman but it is a setup of him becoming King. I really love Jason Momoa in this role, and I hope we get to see more of him playing this character in the future.<br/><br/>A nice enjoyable movie to ride out the new year, worth seeing for a good time on a holiday afternoon."

"sureka-abhinav","10","3","6","14 December 2018"," What can be better than this?
","Unconventional but principle points for the movie :<br/><br/>1) Movie does a pretty good job with the origin story, only that this movie takes place chronologically after the Steppen Wolf event in The Justice League movie.
The significance of this is that Aquaman's story gives the hero's character tremendous boost after how he was portrayed in The Justice League movie.<br/><br/>2) The story bestows you with different characters, villains and groups of villains with just enough development time for each as required.<br/><br/>3) When into the movie, for the most of the it, the story is nothing that you haven't seen before. But it still feels new every time, even though your anticipation might be met for many scenes in terms of the storyline.<br/><br/>4) The final act of the movie does an unbelievable job in single-handedly lifting the already-going-great movie to new heights, in terms of cinematography, direction, visuals and much more.<br/><br/>5) The movie doesn't hold back in showing you the amazing war visuals towards the climax, which is only comparable with that of The LOTR or Avatar. You may feel that Aquaman even surpasses those movies in this aspect.<br/><br/>6) It is a whole new world underwater which has been meticulously created with immense diligence. Yes, this is truly something which you might not have seen before.<br/><br/>7) Most importantly, the movie ends on a solid note followed by a lingering song from Skylar Grey, that captures the essence of the entire movie."

"sefrafer","9","3","6","13 December 2018"," Aquaman good movie, the fans will finally be able to sleep peacefully
","Dc comics has had a few and unfortunate setbacks when trying to make movies, but this is not one of those stumbles the movie, Aquaman gives us a story based on one of the best comics of the character Throne of Atlantis and in this adaptation gives us a pretty solid story full of emotion that immerses us in a world not seen the film is an amalgam of perfectly well combined genres of moments is an action movie, others is adventure, science fiction and even romantic and horror, director James Wan undoubtedly knows very well how to get into the plot of a film, contains a message of environmental awareness quite good, but that could see was still better exploited even so James Wan perfectly well leads the actors under his charge Jason Momoa we It gives a stunning and totally incredible Aquaman that makes the jokes towards the character disappear,Amber Heard is wonderful as Mera who proves not to be a damsel in danger and rather a rough heroine, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gives us a rather intimidating Black Manta and Patrick Wilson gives us an imposing Ocean Master, also acts Willem Dafoe , Dolph Lundgreen and Nicole Kidman who do it quite well, on the other hand the CGI effects are mostly impressive, except for some moments that are too noticeable, but the scenes in combat are sublime and the handling of the camera in those scenes is spectacular , the music of Rupert Gregson-Williams is quite good and according to the scenes that keeps you entertained, in Conclusion Aquaman is the best movie in the universe of Dc? Well definitely, it has bad things in it I do not deny it, but in my opinion details that can be done aside, if something makes clear is that when Warner allows his directors to work on their stories something good comes out of it, to my personal taste Aquaman seemed infinitely superior to that seen in Wonder woman, which is highly recommended not to lose it"
"krishnasahith","9","3","6","13 December 2018"," Best DCEU movie ever

"kaushik201394","9","3","6","13 December 2018"," An absolute visual treat
","Will keep the review short and straightforward.<br/><br/>Aquaman to many would be the best DC has offered since The Dark knight Trilogy and Watchmen. The amount of action packed sequences in this movie is too much. And everyone of them is done absolutely amazing . The Vfx/Cgi is one of the best you can experience . You would definitely fall in love with the camera work that James Wan has pulled off. The script is also good , not great. I missed the amazing dialogues and one-liners from Zack Snyder movies. Also the background scores were also not as per the scene. The place where they should have put an epic score, they put a pop music. I know the taste to mucic is different for everyone , but still I thought it didn't fit right. Also sometimes the actors were doing some over-the-top acting. Once you watch the movie you can see it.<br/><br/>That been said, the overall movie experience is just awesome. You would definitely get the value of your money. Do experience it on IMAX."

","Thought this would be a nice entertaining movie like Wonder Woman. The first ten minutes were very promising but soon after it turns out to be a movie for teenagers or comic nerds which is fine but not exactly what I expected from the trailer. The visuals were pretty but the story and the actors failed to make a connection with the audience. The acting is very robotic and certainly not captivating. It creates distance. You don't feel with them, unfortunately.
The fight scenes were nice to watch but not blown away. DC can do better."
"tww35","4","7","20","15 December 2018"," So bad it's entertaining
","Went into Aquaman with an expected low bench mark and it certainly lived down to it.<br/><br/>Best parts are all with Black Manta and if they make a sequel with him as the villain they've got my money again.<br/><br/>The cgi swings wildly between incredible and something you would have seen 30 years ago.<br/><br/>The plot, dialogue and acting is as wooden as an old treasure chest at times.<br/><br/>It's at least 50 minutes longer than it needed to be, if they'd brought this in at 1hr 40 you'd almost watch it again as a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>But they didn't so you won't.<br/><br/>4/10.

"tony330","1","5","13","27 December 2018"," Seriously cheesy and total dross
","Aquaman perfectly captures the inane Hollywood bu!!5hit that ruins every good movie premise. Like all the DC classics, Aquaman could have been good if it was darker like Batman and focused on character and story rather than special effects and cheesy one liners. Seriously, one liners should have stopped after Arnie did Commando, but here we are in 2018 with bikers taking selfies and stereotype bad guys in black, with ridiculous weapons and the worst dressed underwater royalty I've seen. The costumes in The Little Mermaid were better.<br/><br/>Probably the worst movie I saw in 2018 (and the last one)."
"halfdim","1","5","13","26 December 2018"," Complete waste of time and money
","This movie justifies the addition of a Zero Stars rating. Or even minus numbers. What a dog. I feel terrible for Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe, two really great actors who apparently are past their commercial prime and have to take gigs in drivel like this. The story, what there is of it, is a mish-mash of all previous titles in its genre plus a hell of a lot of water. Every cliche in the book is employed, and how the actors kept a straight face while delivering some of these lines is astonishing. One would have to be a 10 year old boy on the verge of puberty to enjoy this flick, just for the skin-tight mermaid outfits on the female characters. Compared to this movie, Waterworld is a masterpiece."

First the main actor is not much with words so not sure why they make him do comedy. The story you don't even understand, especially the underwater people. The one villain is just killed off with pretty good ease in middle of film. The connection between main characters doesn't match.

","We first saw the popular DC Comics character when he joined the team in Justice League, this was the first full-length centred around him, and the sixth entry in the DC Extended Universe, which has been a mixed bag, I hoped for some improvement, directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring). Basically in Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas ""Tom"" Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater nation of Atlantis during a storm. She stays on land, they fall in love and have a son, Arthur (Kaan Guldur and Otis Dhanji), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, she gives her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) the mission to train Arthur. With his guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind. One year after Steppenwolf's invasion, Arthur (Jason Momoa) confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine. Their leader, Jesse Kane (Michael Beach), is trapped under rubble during the confrontation, he forces his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to leave him behind to drown, David vows revenge against Arthur. David later targets Atlantis at the behest of King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's younger half-brother and ruler of Atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface. King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren) swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard), who is betrothed to Orm, refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, she earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, he says if he can find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler, he will reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape, while Arthur is captured, Orm visits Arthur in captivity and tells him Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, he blames Arthur and the surface for her death. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava, Orm has the upper hand, but Arthur is rescued by Mera. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert to find information about the trident, a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to Sicily, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with Atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them, he imprisons Vulko after learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface. In Sicily, David, now calling himself Black Manta, ambushes Arthur and Mera and injures Arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to find the trident, she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as The Trench, they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the Earth. They Arthur is shocked to be reunited with Atlanna, she was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes, but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since. Arthur must face mythical leviathan Karathen (Dame Julie Andrews), who guards the trident, he voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Arthur, Mera, and Atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against Orm and his followers, it is after learning that Arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his half-brother's life, Orm accepts his fate after seeing that Arthur has found and rescued their mother. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side. During the credits, Black Manta is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur. Also starring Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, Graham McTavish as King Atlan, Leigh Whannell as Cargo Pilot, John Rhys-Davies as the voice of the Brine King and Djimon Hounsou as the voice of King Ricou. Momoa does a great job as the charismatic Atlantean prince who has a destiny, Heard is compelling as his sexy red-head sidekick, Wilson is rather stiff as the villain, Kidman is really likeable, and Lundgren does alright as well. I will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy, it is ridiculous at times, and it is perhaps a little too long, but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant, and the fast-paced fight and explosive sequences are engaging, it is fun to watch, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. Good!"

","Notwithstanding being an absurd film, the characters have little purpose, are often unchallenged and everything seems to be oversimplified for the sake of having more stuff in the same film.
DC apparently likes to take one step forward and two back with their films. Aquaman is unfunny when it attempts at humour, its dull when it tries to be exciting and rather confusing in general.<br/><br/>I would particularly like to understand more about Atlantis. How does that work? Is it just a massive underwater authoritarian state with a mad, misguided king? Why exactly is he so obsessed with waging war? Why do some people can breathe air? Are they two species? Why exactly is his fiancÃ© looking for Aquaman? Actually, why was Aquaman's mum on the surface in the first place?<br/><br/>There are no answers here, just a bunch of crazy ideas tossed at the viewer with the promise we will understand everything eventually, and it never delivers those answers. Characters are shallow, unmotivated and just.. kind of.. there.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, Aquaman is an absurd character anyway. Perhaps that's why no one made a film with him before. If he is not surrounded by water and all the creatures living in it, his only assets are being really strong and really resistant, which are his only super powers. In which case.. probably Wonder Woman and Superman would be best suited to do whatever has to be done. At least Wonder Woman can make people speak the truth and bounce bullets back. What can Aquaman do besides hit people with his trident and wrestle bad guys? Well, the film doesn't tell.<br/><br/>Oh, the CGI is good. And there are some nice jokes and action sequences, so I rate it 3 out of 10. I wouldn't bother paying to see it, but it is worth a glimpse on the telly or some streaming service when it's available, if you like DC heroes, that is."

This is a CGI heavy film, but that's hardly at fault since there is really no other way to faithfully present such an imaginative landscape as it takes place in.<br/><br/>There is also a level of the heart to it that is simple, but effective enough. It's not without its cheesiness though, lots of over the top creatures, and Patrick Wilsons villain, but they all fit. At the end of it, all this film can be viewed simply as a fun, creative action romp with a good deal of exaggerated landscapes and the characters found in those landscapes that seem to know what kind of movie they're in. It's epic and fun and, despite the simple tired story, is one of the DCEUs better outings. It has a color where the others were grainy and charisma where the others were stoic.

","I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just disappointing. The action sequences and visuals are really well done, but unfortunately they're bogged down by incredibly weak writing. I've liked Jason Momoa since Game of Thrones, and was actually excited to hear he would be playing Aquaman. He has more than enough charm to play a great superhero lead (see: any Chris from the Marvel Universe), especially compared to the lackluster leads we've seen in the other DC films - not including Gal Gadot. But Momoa, Heard, and Dafoe are sorely underutilized. The acting in Aquaman really isn't great - but that's what you get when the actors are given boring, flat dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie never seems to stop unloading exposition at you, and it's crammed into every conversation. You never get a chance to see the characters develop because everyone is too busy trying to explain the next 'world-building' element. I mean I don't need 2 hours of exposition to understand a bunch of guys riding sharks shooting blasters at crab people. Give me the essentials and focus on making me care about the people I'm watching - let the world speak for itself.<br/><br/>It really is a shame because (almost) everything else is great. Aquaman's saving grace is its effects and set designs. Everything - except some questionable costumes - is extremely visually appealing and there is some wonderful imagery to be found. But the thing is, all of this beautiful shiny exterior is just serving as a means to distract you from a movie that refuses to even try to give you information in a creative way."

"ThomasDrufke","7","3","7","27 December 2018"," Flawed but Undeniably Fun
","Is Aquaman the savior for the DCEU like people want it to be? Well, I would lean towards saying no, but it's far from the disaster some may have expected. James Wan not only brings a new flavor to the universe, but makes a separate entry into a series that desperately needed it.<br/><br/>There are two mindsets at play here, one being that Wan ""clearly"" meant to make a overly dramatic and bombastic adventure with cheesy dialogue, the other that the film is a tonal mess that at times takes itself far too serious, and at other times, almost having too much fun. I fall somewhere in the middle. I can acknowledge that a film that has a massive octopus playing the drums under water has a certain sense of self awareness, but there's no doubt in my mind that the mixture of tones just doesn't work in some moments.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman/Arthur Curry and I'm mad that I had any doubt over his casting all those years ago. Despite not having the best chemistry romantically, his love interest Mera (Amber Heard) plays well off of him. When they aren't making out in the midst of an all out under water war, they share some of the best action scenes of the film, including a rooftop chase that displays the true genius behind Wan's framing/camera work.<br/><br/>I could have completely done without Black Manta as it felt very much like the unnecessary presence of Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange. Also, his costume is absolutely absurd, and I don't care how close it is to the comic book iteration of Manta. The other villain, Patrick Wilson's 'Oceanmaster', is an overcooked & cliched power hungry super villain that did next to nothing for me. There's a good antagonist in there somewhere for Aquaman, but it sure wasn't in this origin story.<br/><br/>I'd be remiss not to mention Nicole Kidman, considering how great of a year she is having, and her turn as Atlanna is no different. Owning her action sequences and elevating all of her dialogue, Kidman is likely the most memorable thing from the film, and I hope to see more of her character at some point or another.<br/><br/>Extravagant, colorful, bombastic, a tonal mess, and cheesy, Aquaman is right around where I expected it would be. And hopefully the beginning of a new era of DC movies. Here's hoping.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

"alvesmarceloalves-73751","5","3","7","24 December 2018"," Aquaman, another flop of DC
","Marvel x DC is the rivalry of this century. Clearly, though, Marvel has always taken a lot of advantage in this confrontation. Simply because their adaptations are better, better done, and especially, have infinitely better scripts.<br/><br/>It's amazing that at a time when technology is so advanced as to create amazing scenarios and great underwater scenes, perhaps what ""Aquaman"" does best, DC can not get someone decent to write a story that is minimal enough evoke Freudian problems with father or mother, and embarrassing situations. The scripts are the greatest Achilles heel of DC productions. If ""Batman vs Superman"" (2016) had that embarrassing scene of the two heroes resolving a fight just because they discovered that they had the same name of the mother, in ""Aquaman"" we were presented to the monster alone and with depression. Alone and isolated from the world in the depths of the endless sea, Karathen warmed his heart just because Arthur (Jason Momoa) talked to him.<br/><br/>""Ohh, you talked to me. How beautiful. In a thousand years, no one has ever done that. Can take the trident for you"".<br/><br/>This is just an example of how ""Aquaman"" is flopped, although it had great potential.<br/><br/>Overall, the tacky aesthetics established by Zack Snyder also tired. And let's face it, never worked very well in the DC film series. The best works in this sense were precisely the ""300"" (2006) and the ""Watchmen"" (2009), perhaps one of the best films based on comics.<br/><br/>Joining this to the moments worthy of a cinema that is not practiced more - what was that kiss of the Aquaman in the princess Meira (Amber Heard) in the middle of the war? - there is very little left to praise about the film.<br/><br/>But let's try a few moments. For example, the underwater scenes are actually very good and well made. The special effects idem. The whole fight in Sicily is also a high point. All the aesthetics and design of Atlantis, a civilization extremely advanced in relation to the human, have also been very well made, although sometimes Atlantis looks like a scrap of ""Avatar"" (2009) with ""Carbono Alterado"" (2018) .<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is too tiring Aquaman's quest for such a magic trident. Was it even necessary to show in detail and with generous time all the peoples of the seven seas? If they were more restrained, it would save at least half an hour of film. And there was still the parallel plot of the Manta (Yahia Abdul-Mateen II), a surface villain who gave a hook for a second movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of villains, King Orm (Patrick Wilson) is an embarrassment that only DC gives us. He has tantrums because he has a half-blooded half-brother, wants to start a war with the surface based on a supposedly nasty assault. In addition to becoming the Lord of the Oceans, what ambitions are Orm wanting to start a war with the surface? Want to be the lord of the planet? After all, you can not believe that men are polluting the planet and you have to act before it's too late. And all part of an anger of the half brother, whom he blames for the death of his mother, in short, everything very badly counted.<br/><br/>Speaking of the relationship of Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) with her children, another DC problem arises. Lack of care with what we call transmedia storytelling. This is another moment in which Marvel is giving a bath in the rival. During the film, Princess Meira quotes that the Aquaman needs to reclaim the throne or the brother will initiate a war. And it recalls its importance in defeating Stepenwolf, thus implying that the film follows the events of the ""Justice League"". So far so good. The problem is that in ""Aquaman,"" Arthur says that he never treads on Atlantis because of what the people did to his mother. Only that of stepped there in ""Justice League"" to speak and fight Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>In addition, in ""Aquaman"", it is clear the love and devotion of Arthur for the mother since always. The problem is that in ""Justice League"" he speaks of Atlanna with rancor, as if he had been abandoned (""Your queen left me at the door of my father's house""). But in ""Aquaman,"" it is shown that both had a coexistence in Arthur's childhood and the clear love between them, in addition to the devotion that has lasted forever. That is, the DC multiverse has holes and contradictions. And it is not tied tightly. And this is further evidenced by the lack of planning for the next steps.<br/><br/>James Wan did not deliver the Aquaman to his full potential, but Jason Momoa looked very well in the lead role. It looked like it was the right choice, though the alpha male bombed look was very different from the original Aquaman.<br/><br/>But DC still owes a string of great movies in its new phase. The only one that deserves all the praise remains ""Wonder Woman"" (2009)."

","I was hoping this movie was going to be a good watch and be competitive against a marvel film, but it just isn't.
Positives first - finally a DC film that isn't so dark. Lot more light hearted and at some points fairly funny. Some of the CGI is amazing
Negatives - where to start. The cringe one liners. Felt like a 70's bond movie.
I know it's based in atlantas, but some people ride sharks and other ride weird sea horses lol. Just doesn't work.
Makers seemed to have used CGI on everything even when you could use real people or vehicles. Why?<br/><br/>Marvel has nothing to worry about comparing this to there films. Try again DC."
"j-mayo1999","10","3","7","23 December 2018"," One of the BEST DC movies of our time, and hopefully there is more to come!!!!!
","I'm not a big DC fan, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to watch the movies. When Man of Steel came out I was okay with how it turned out. Then the movies that followed in suit were a complete disaster. Wonder Woman turned out good and lifted the spirits in all of us. However, we need more than just Wonder Woman to save this franchise. Aquaman is the movie that gives the franchise a fresh new take, and the turning point that these mucky waters surely need.
Aquaman is the best DC movie in my opinion. After watching this masterpiece I can say that without a doubt that Warner Bros. is on the right track. I can only hope that they decide to make more movies like Aquaman. This is the turning point that DC needs. The tides are changing, and from the looks of it they are changing for the better."

","Aquaman as a movie is the best and the most surprise I've got from the DCEU till now when it managed to turn a quite bland character in the Justice League movie and a joke character that never meant to be taken seriously according to many DC comic fan that I read online into this one large tatted up man with a larger than life personality who embodiment all the things that kids love when they watch a superhero movie. The movie is part traditional superhero movie, part horror movie, part kaiju movie all wrapped up neatly into one thank to director James Wan risking his career out there when he decided to direct a movie about a not many people know superhero that unlike the already established Superman or Batman just like James Gunn with his Guardians of the Galaxy series and director Zack Snyder for choosing Jason Momoa to be the live action version Aquaman for the DCEU"

Marvel copied DC first,Marvel are pretty good at creating childish and meaningless plots,Marvel invented a plenty of supernatural and ridiculous stuffs. Besides,movies published by Disney or the other companies subordinated by Disney nearly got no pretty harsh comments made by critics on Metascore. You may say:oh,Venom's an exception! Sorry,its copyright still belongs to Sony instead of Disney. D wanna characters related to Spider-man back to complete MCU,probably it's the one that ordered critics to make terrible comments on Venom so it could find a good and proper reason to take that back. It's not a coincidence. It's a part of Disney's horrible plans. That sounds like kinda conspiracy theory,but the facts exist there. Do not be fooled by Darth Mickey,never!!!"

","Only after watching Aquaman did I realize how hard it was for the director and his team to make a movie with a DC character. Most of them are godly which makes it hard to develop them into believable and relatable characters. Yet all DC origin movies succeeds in this aspect. Aquaman movie is the best way anyone could portray his origin story and keep the viewers engaged at the same time.
DC has the best story arcs in comics. If the initial movies succeed then we will get to view all those wonderful stories come to life on big screen."

"jesse-jmart","9","3","7","16 December 2018"," GREAT MOVIE!
","DC Films comes in with a tidal wave sized splash with Aquaman! Things are still rocky in terms of the DCEU, however Marvel still has competition for solo outings and Aquaman is that strong contender that was needed.<br/><br/>James Wan takes the metaphorical throne for this one and this movie has his finger prints all over it. I am such a fan of his work. The movie's story played out so well, and the camera shots from the way the angles are used, to the panning around action scenes, when they choose to spiral around or stay steady. The CGI, I might add, is amazing. There is no mountain of mustache mayhem to be found here. The colors are so vibrant and unique but blend together to create truly magical scenery.<br/><br/>This movie makes quick mention of Arthur's involvement in Justice League, but is barely attached to the previous batch of DC Films. We are treated to the origin of Aquaman via short flashback moments that tie in with the present day plot that give you a deep connection to our underwater hero. It's very similar to the first season of CW's Arrow, but only in the sense of two stories intertwining to support the overall story-arch. But Aquaman doesn't keep going back to the past for the entire duration of the film.<br/><br/>This movie has action every where you look but also tells a great, impactful tale of a loner more or less needing convincing to go from rags to riches in order to save not only Atlantis, but Earth from Arthur's younger brother, King Orm who plans on uniting the kingdoms of the sea, and taking a battle to us surface dwellers for the murders and poisonings of the oceans creatures.<br/><br/>Not a single character felt insignificant or out of place and absolutely everything that was done had tremendous purpose. Each actor brought their characters out of the water and into life where you could truly feel connection to everyone. Jason Momoa really turns the charisma on and keeps the wit and charm Aquaman showed off in Justice League and became a completely lovable leading man, and Amber Heard is right up there with him in a constant back and forth battle for leading standout of the film. Both deliver perhaps their own respective performances of their careers, and Heard fully keeps Mera as a strong willed bad ass and Momoa oozes machismo as the film continues on. I could go on for days and describe the outstanding performances of Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lungren, Willem Dafoe, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II but just trust me, and see for yourselves how great they are.<br/><br/>I truly feel that this is a knock out of the ballpark for DC & WB. If you like giant battle scenes, swords (or in this case trident ðŸ”±) fight scenes, or just bad ass combat, this ones for you!"

Visuals and CGI are simply the best I've seen in a while. Perfect use of comedy. They didn't insert a funny scene in between a serious moment. Loved the music. The use of music was very different than other superhero movies. All characters are lovable, even aquaman's dad who didn't had much screentime. James wan gave his horror touch in this movie as well which was awesome. Atlantis is much more than shown in the trailers. 3D effects and camera movement are so good that you'll feel like you're actually in a ship taking a tour of atlantis.

"ebeckstr-1","2","4","11","2 May 2019"," Abysmal
","Wow. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Aquaman clearly demonstrates what Marvel has over DC in the cinematic universe. Aquaman suffers from weak storytelling, a poor script and terrible dialogue, incompetent directing, and some very poor casting choices. I have not seen Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones. Maybe he is excellent in that, but he is unwatchable in Aquaman, delivering his lines in a contrived, shallow manner. Maybe this is not entirely his fault. Given how bad the dialogue is, even Nicole Kidman could not deliver hers with any enthusiasm or sincerity. Momoa speaks almost every line of dialogue with two dimensional, cocky bravado, and his character is basically developed as a rather dim surfer dude, all of which I gather is supposed to be humorous. Whereas Marvel, despite occasional flaws, manages excellent storytelling in which the viewer feels invested, develops characters with genuine personalities, and conveys both genuine humor and pathos through those characters and that storytelling, Aquaman Falls flat on every level.<br/><br/>I understand the overall fun people have with superhero movies, but that generalized enthusiasm should not extend to giving a movie this poorly made an average of 7.1 on IMDb. I don't know where people are getting this. The one thing this movie has going for it is beautiful animation. The fact that it looks like a video game, and more literally resembles a cartoon, is another factor which detracts from the overall effect, but it sure is pretty to look at."

"gmrich94","2","4","11","22 December 2018"," not worth paying for
","Well Jason momoa looks amazing but the plot of the movie was terrible. This is not even looking at the inaccuracies of this movie. First off black manta and his father are pirates that already obtain high tech equipment and then it is found out that aqua mans half brother orm paid them to do so. If he is also a powerful aquaman why did he not do it himself and just become king. Anyways later black manta basically becomes ironman making his own suit without any scientific background which makes no sense. The water holograms seemed unnecessary as well. Also they are many lights seen underwater in atlantis which if you are in that depth of water where is this light coming from. Another side note would be how the color red is not visible at a depth further than 5 meters so how is mera's hair so red underwater. There are also random monsters thrown in and it seemed like there was no reasoning behind it. I love James Waan but this movie was a major disappointment. You can't just throw action scenes together and expect a great movie. DC movies are not even worth seeing anymore"
"pokedom","3","4","11","21 December 2018"," Alright who peed in the ocean?
","While I can tell that an effort was made to make this movie good, Aquaman still reeks of untapped potential, completely goofy and dumb moments, and all the cheese you've come to expect from the DCEU. I went in open minded, as I had heard good things about this movie. I left pretty disappointed, and even kinda baffled. They thought this was enough to redeem the cinematic universe? It isn't.<br/><br/>We'll start with the cons and then work our way to the pros. If a movie has more pros than cons I start with those first, but more cons than pros I go with cons first. There's a lot to wade through, so bear with me.<br/><br/>* Horrific overcompensation of the character of Aquaman. With powers as lame on paper as ""can breathe underwater"" and ""can talk to fish"", they tried making him an utterly unstoppable beast with as many muscles as possible. ""He can chug a whole glass in a second!"" ""He doesn't even flinch at bullets!"" ""He can bend steel!"" Am I describing Aquaman or a mad science experiment with a heavy emphasis on drinking? The dude is completely invincible except for when the script needs him to be weak, like when he's fighting his brother in the first act and gets his butt handed to him.<br/><br/>* Awful effects. I swear half the sea creatures are missing frames of animation. Anything that was designed for the movie looks just plain ugly. For a movie mostly set underwater you would think it would be more magical than what I'm seeing here. Seeing characters float around and interact with each other underwater also comes with an awful microphone effect. I get its underwater but it sounds broken. Also really bad green-screen. It sticks out a lot and you can tell at all times.<br/><br/>* Boring as hell. People sitting near me were taking naps and not missing anything. Interspersed with the action and effects are, at minimum, 20 minute scenes consisting of underwater politics and Aquaman talking with his red haired lady friend. Nothing is achieved with these scenes. Sometimes its plot relevant but most of the time it really isn't.<br/><br/>* BAAAAAAAAD soundtrack. Whoever gave Pitbull and Rhea the green light to ruin Africa by Toto should be thrown into the trench with Aquaman's mom, then we should throw Pitbull in there too. The rest is that mystical ""wow look at this scenery"" music, thrown in with synth ripped straight from Thor Ragnarok and other bland music similar to Pitbull. Seriously no one likes Pitbull. He's a joke in the music industry and he shouldn't be allowed near movies ever.<br/><br/>* Speaking of Ragnarok, this movie is trying really really hard to be Ragnarok. A strong man who thinks he's got it all has to learn how to be a leader after being exiled by a relative bent on conquering all that is. Wow that's the same exact plot description as Ragnarok. On top of the half synth soundtrack and reliance on CG I just felt like I was watching, and forgive me for this, a watered down Ragnarok.<br/><br/>* The twists and turns this movie goes through don't add up to much, and you can see them coming from the horizon.<br/><br/>* When the action works, it works. When it doesn't, it really doesn't. Stop getting fancy with the camera! The first two action scenes are great. They don't move the camera much, hell the first one is a one-take. Oceanmaster vs Aquaman in the first act was awful. There's this moment where the camera zooms out to them being little specks on a statue, and you can barely see what's going on. I don't care about the statue, I care about the two men with pointy sticks! Is it because they're fighting over something bigger than themselves? Just keep the action on them, their actions speak much louder symbolically than the statue. Black Manta vs Aquaman was also lame, Oceanic Warfare in the third act was just baffling, and the rematch at the end was also lame. Why is it so inconsistent? You had it right the first time!<br/><br/>* Costume design was just plain goofy. The Aquaman suit looks super dumb. The Oceanmaster suit looks like LEGO. Black Manta's suit looks simply idiotic in broad daylight, and of course that's the only time they use it. Atlanticops (the police people in the red and white suits from Atlantis) all look stupid.<br/><br/>* Positives now. Like I said the first two action scenes are great. One takes will always make me happy in any movie, and one take action scenes are very impressive. The second scene where Aquaman is taking out the pirates is also great. Even though its just more Aquaman compensation, the sound design and close quarters action makes this look and feel brutal.<br/><br/>* Black Manta, as a character, is great. Easily the best thing about the movie. It's dumb that the first thing he does with Atlantis technology is vandalize it, but other than that he's awesome. Reminds me a lot of Killmonger, who was also one of the better things about the movie he was in.<br/><br/>* I'm happy that Aquaman isn't just given all the strength in the world right away. He's really strong but he still has room to grow, and needs to learn new things to get an edge on people that have been waiting for this moment for years and years.<br/><br/>* I think that's it.<br/><br/>TL;DR, this movie is bad and isn't worth your time. DCEU has done nothing but disappoint for... what, 5 movies now? Of course they won't die, we've been saying ""DC's goose is cooked!"" since Suicide Squad and nothing has changed. So just keep away and let the tide pull this one out to sea."

","""It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea . . . ."" Edgar Allen Poe's Annabel Lee<br/><br/>While the women in the audience for character Aquaman/Arthur can ogle Jason Momoa's fit pecs, the men can enjoy the young Amber Heard 's beauty as Princess Mera and for a bonus, that of the nicely-put-together Nicole Kidman as the matriarch Atlanna. And that's all there is folks, at least for adults. For 8-year-old boys, explosions and fights excitingly occupy almost all the film.
Aquaman/Arthur's reluctant struggle to find the magic trident (think a sword in a stone and claim his right to be king of Atlantis follows the usual mythical arc which includes fighting the evil brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), and finding the trident. Like the legendary King Arthur, this Arthur must wrest the trident from a monster, not a stone. Otherwise director James Wan can cut back to the lighthouse and Arthur's real father, Temuera (a fit Tom Curry), who waits patiently for the return from the sea of his mermaid wife, Atlanna.
Usually some relief can be had in the CGI setting under water, but here the scenes are so dense with creatures and ruins and, yes, explosions, that you can't digest it all and may end up not appreciating any. Nor can you possibly give a pass for Willem Dafoe, the true actor, with Kidman, in the whole lot. Because I just saw Dafoe play a memorable Vincent van Gogh in Edge of Eternity, I am miffed that he would play the king's vizier, with one line worthy of his acting ability and not any another.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa, formerly of a Conan remake, is a physically-appealing choice, for previous iterations have him blonde, blue-eyed, and Thor like rather than the more interesting smoky-eyed, long-tressed surfer/biker dude here. Beyond the physical attributes, Momoa is given next-to-none smart lines or anything to help develop his character.<br/><br/>Oh, well, 8-year old boys win this round. Yet, a fetching Kidman can be its own reward for us caregivers."

This movie - or at least as much of it as I watched - showed none of that. It felt more like something I might have enjoyed as a 12-year-old comic book fan than anything I'd want to watch as an adult.<br/><br/>Maybe your kid will enjoy it, but if you're a grown up fan of the superhero genre, you can let this one pass."

(well maybe I rolled my eyes a bit somewhere in the last 10mins after the 'final' sibling battle)<br/><br/>Superhero movies should be all about bringing a certain magic to the screen, a spectacle that you can marvel at and simply switch off and enjoy. And Aquaman does exactly that. Plenty of beautiful locations, lots of action/fighting, some awesome effects (especially all the under-water stuff) and a nice mix of Superman and Indiana Jones type adventure.
The kind of movie I could watch with my kid one day (when he's old enough) that will give him that sense of wonder and magic that some older movies from my childhood did for me.<br/><br/>I also think they did some justice to the whole Atlantis mythology here. Great stuff.
And having 'good guy' Patrick Wilson play the villain to good guy Willem Dafoe? A welcome and interesting choice."

","One of the worst superhero films out there and no surprise it's another from DC. A vast improvement on Justice League it's not much of a step up from rock bottom. It's at times unreasonable to expect realism from this type of film but I've never ever seen an outing that's looked so fan made or cheap as this. The non CGI costumes, characters etc. Look horrendous and there's two or three fairly big scale action sequences which are visually quite big moments but are vastly over crowded and just blur into a multi coloured mess. Overly long at nearly 2 and a half hours it's got no right to be so long and does seem to have moments where the foot is taken off the gas and becomes stagnant. Only positives to come from this are clearly Momoa and Dafoe who seem genuinely happy to be involved and perform quite well, other than that it could've been handled differently over multiple films maybe to be more impactful. Has similarities to the first Thor film but as you know by now the way these two franchises have been handled is vastly different and such Aquaman is a toothless and dull release"

I saw some Marvel movie and it was increadibly politicized and preachy. That so many Hollywood movies are preachy and political have made me stop watching Hollywood movies, by and large.<br/><br/>Another aspect where Aquaman really really excells is that it does not divide the world into good vs evil. Instead it divides the world into factions pursuing their own self interest, with varying degrees of wisdom. The main ""baddie"" in Aquaman simply has another opinion of what is best for his faction and does his best to pursue such a course of action. But he is not demonized and he is not portrayed as dishonerable, unlike in ""normal"" hollywood movies that go out of their way to demonize and crush the faction or person that is the designated ""baddie"". This was immensely refreshing to me. I will definitively check out more movies made by the same company/director/producer/writer or whoever made this movie watchable."

Aquaman created 70+ years ago when science (crude compared to today) for young adults was poor at best. A time when ancient myths such as Atlantis held sway in people's imaginations. Atlantis a city w/humans? Living at the bottom of the ocean. Never mind pressures & its effects at different depths, and even how cities could be constructed;. How human Atlanteans could breathe w/out gills or any other mode of O2 absorption; how they could talk at any depth & in perfect English (try talking under water and see how H2O density makes speech unintelligible). How there could be a paradise of trees & waterfalls at the Earth's core (forget pressure; thousands of degrees heat; molten iron).<br/><br/>Usual script hooks of bullying of young Aquaman; lots of lasers & martial arts kicks (also found in recently released Bumblebee); lots of strength displays like lifting a submarine out of the water, but oddly it takes more effort to just toss a human about. Lots of stereotyping of characters - formula good 'n' bad. Our underwater humans say they have the greatest military on the planet yet they're riding around on giant seahorses & sharks. The one positive to the movie was the justification for war against the surface because our plastic pollution (millions of tons per year) is destroying their habitat.

Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF?

But this one was big, loud, colourful and not great (to me).<br/><br/>Everyone is commenting on how Jason Momoa is having fun. I'd be having fun too if I was paid a couple of million $ to basically do nothing. Plus, when the film is a bad as Aqauman, what else was he going to do?<br/><br/>Aquaman probably worked as a comic but on the big screen, no so much. The story is okay, but drowns in the ludicrousness of being, you know, underwater. The film drowns in CGI. There's lasers underwater, armour underwater, flying around underwater - you get the idea. Admittedly, what else could you do with a character as lame as Arthur Curry? At least James Wan had a go at it. He failed, but whatever. It made a billion $, so he wins and the rest of humanity pays the price.<br/><br/>I think that it proves that CGI wins the kiddies over every time, regardless of how lame the story is, or even how lame the premise of the film is. Without the CGI, this film would still suck, it just wouldn't look as good.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, if the acting equivalent of watching wet fish are your thing. These days in films like this, you don't really need to act. You just stand there. You may have to jump around a bit, but that's all. The 'acting' part is not really required.<br/><br/>The story is bleached like today's coral, lifeless and cliched.<br/><br/>The CGI is numbing, like your eyeballs getting slapped with a million tiny wet fishes.<br/><br/>I'm sick over CGI, over-hyped comic book hero movies.

I didn't even know they were capable of such horrible CGI these days. I'm talking about the parts where young Aquaman was learning how to swim, and also when Aquaman was taken prisoner for the first time in that long white room. Also towards the beginning when Nicole Kidman was fighting those people in the living room. I mean, those parts looked like they were taken from a Playstation game from 20 years ago."

"tylerblackevans","8","2","4","11 January 2019"," All Right!
","It's very difficult to satisfy the world of comics. Especially, Aquaman! James Wan truly earned his right to join billion dollar club.
Casting was great. I was really terrified after hearing that Jason Mamoa & Amber Heard is going to lead $200 million dollars project. They both stole the show. Jason is really played Arthur character nicely. Director & Writers definitely knows what they're doing. They didn't do like comic book Arthur Curry's character. They have created their own version of Aquaman who is going to lead more future DCEU movies. Mera is beautiful queen and badass heroine. My man! Black Manta has definite character development to hate Aquaman. Dolph was a big surprise. Williem Dalfoe was perfectly casted as Vulko. At first time, I thought King Orm character was under utilised. But, Patrick Wilson stole the entire show while I watch this movie for the second time. I can see clearly what James and Writers did to this character. Origin of Ocean Master. Best thing about in this whole movie is love story between Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman.
Oh about music! Some moments took my breath away just like Blade Runner & Avatar. Awesome soundtrack. For the record, DCEU movies has awesome soundtracks till now! Except Suicide Squad which I don't remember.<br/><br/>James Wan admires everything equally... Story, cringy comic stuffs, showing earth's 70% of underwater atmosphere as real as fantasy, Atlantis and other kingdoms and importantly global warming issues and embracing the real sea creatures. Only thing bugged me in this movie is that scoreboard showed just before their gladiator fight. Some critics complaining about plot shifting, pitbull song, flashback character's vfx... For me, those things never bugged me...<br/><br/>Definitely I've enjoyed this movie more in my second round. We're in the era of Jason Bourne action style, Christopher Nolan's reality style of fantasy, Blockbuster fever for past 6 years of MCU & Star Wars movie which Aquaman did the job in it's own way. People have forgot about 80's adventure movies & 90's action movies. James Wan brought that back as epic action packed fantasy adventure movie.
Switch off your book mind & open your comic book mind.
You will sink inside this movie!
Aquaman is definitely worth watching with the whole family.
Oh I forgot to mention this!

","With everything I had heard and previews I had seen of this movie beforehand, I was expecting something that was truly worth my time. But in the first thirty minutes, I knew this was to be a huge disappointment. As some reviewers explained before, the acting is soo cheesy and cocky that it takes away all the interest. Except from okay performances from Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren (yes sadly...if Dolph is among the good performers of this movie, try to imagine the rest!) and a so-so presence from Jason Momoa the rest of the acting is really, really lame. Lines are delivered with a visibly forced attitude, body language is not congruent and exaggerated poses and looks that last too long made me want to stop watching. Even Nicole Kidman is not up to the task here or is playing way below her conventional high standards which made her such a famous and sought after actress. Amber Heard probably gives one of the worst perfomances I've seen on screen after Kristen Stewart in Twilight and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is for sure not helping either.<br/><br/>This being said, the movie is visually amazing even if many computerized graphics are way too obvious . But since when can a movie be qualified as excellent or get such high ratings simply based on this? If the visual cannot be supported with strong and believable acting, it is simply like a beautiful postcard with nothing written on it, so it becomes meaningless. And that is what this movie is for me."

Jason even ripped Amber Heard's pages from her books without her permission while working with her for the Aquaman film.

Every single occurrence from the ostentatious opening voice-over to the sun rise over dear dad's lighthouse is utterly predictable and poorly produced. I am ready for a superhero film that doesn't try to rest on the tired laurels of ""stunning"" cgi because, guess what, we've seen it all and we are at full capacity for these expensive light shows. Give us, instead, a story, some actors and a well-written screenplay. I more than understand that this movie could not have come off without some cgi but this movie relies on it and would truly be nothing without it; it exists as a 2.5 hour fireworks display with zero substance. It's got a few big names earning, hopefully, very large paychecks in order to fund their next real movie (i.e. Willem Defoe, Nicole Kidman) but overall I was embarrassed for them having to stoop to this level. In fact, I was kind of embarrassed sitting in the theatre proving I'd paid real money to see this. Now, I do have a soft spot for Jason Momoa because he was a great Khal Drogo and seems like a genuinely likable guy. I wanted to like him in this but I couldn't due to an abysmal screenplay that no actor could make sound believable. Too bad. All in all, I'd say this is a perfect movie for 10 year old boys."

The movie has some issues with these two, some characters aren't fully developed, the story doesn't really have 1 main villain too, and the love between Mera and Aquaman feels forced.
And this movie is amazing visually, the production design is top-notch, but to be honest some of the de-aging CGI is so obvious, that it's annoying, some models aren't fully rendered here and there. The story is really full of cliches and that sometimes ruins moments, but overall the movie looks and feels amazing due to the charisma of the actors, the musical score and the overall comic-booky atmosphere of the movie.

I think it's really well done, and DC is improving on their movies. Shazam I believe will be really good. But this movie is still not better than most of the MCU. I am more of a DC guy actually but Marvel movies are much more consistent with tone and quality, with the CGI, and with all characters, and they are I think overall better movies. Saying that this movie is better than most MCU movies is just too much and DC doesn't deserve it. They should work their asses off to finally give us 1 movie that everyone can say that it's great, until than, I will say that most of their movies are mediocre, because they deserve it.

This isn't any Trident. It is made will Posiden steel and has a genuine Corinthian leather grip. The script raised some questions. Why is Aquaman desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute? And why would he take a slow-moving fishing boat anywhere? They attempted to make Amber Heard's first time on the surface cute but not clever. Are Atlantians the only sea mammals that never have to breathe air?<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think of Avatar...this needs a 3D IMAX.

","As a comic book fan of Marvel. I am happy to report that Aquaman surprised me. Although I am not a hater of DC, I am a hater of bad comic book movies.<br/><br/>DC has been really hit or miss with their movies. But to me this was a hit. Let me just start by saying, I went to see this with my girl, a couple and 3 guy friends. All of us with different likes. 1/2 liked the movie, the 1/2 not so much.<br/><br/>Why was it good:
The story was a good story, giving Aquaman a outsider feel. A reluctant hero of sorts. But overall a strong presence. Jason Momoa does a great job of giving a new spin on the comic book version of Arthur Curry.
The action was a blast. There was a couple of really cool fight scenes and the ending battle was a blast.
Amber Heard was better than I thought. Now lets say she is not going to win an oscar here, but she is believable and could handle her own.
CG was off the hook. Really Amazing.
Imagination was really cool, all the different species and monsters.<br/><br/>Why was it bad:
Well lets say this was a fondue party. Cheese was at an all time high. So many needless poses from Jason and bad one liners. Nothing that we haven't seen in any Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone movie. But still more than usual from a DC movie.
To me, it seem like it copied a couple of things from other movies, again nothing new, but for me to notice, its sometimes makes it not so cool.<br/><br/>Overall:
Yes its Corny and Cheesy, but man was a lot of fun. I was impressed by the action and the CG. The main stars did a great job playing their superhero characters and I for one think it will come off very well with fans and non fans alike.
If you are looking for Great acting, great story telling, well you may be disappointed, but if you are looking for a lot of fun, which is why I go in the first place, then this movie will be great for you. Enjoy."

","There is no doubt that the British legend of King Arthur played a large role ( the character was even named Arthur and there was a pivotal ""Sword In The Stone"" scene, so if you like such stories Aquaman will be very appealing. What I really liked was 1: Spoilers ahead: Vulko did not die. In so many movies the mentor of the hero or heroine ( in the case of Wonder Woman) ends up well ""Sleeping With The Fish."" 2: The relationship between Mera and Arthur. It is serious ( Mera saving him), playful and finally romantic. In addition, both characters grow throughout the movie ( always welcome). 4: The special effects really worked. Far too often they are predictable ( like in Avatar where they created scenes that were supposed to be ground breaking but were rehashes of westerns like the Indian campfire and the animals which were obviously stuff like panthers). 5: Humor. Too many DC Movies lacked humor ( Suicide Squad excluded), here you get some without insulting the audience. Spoilers ahead: The scene with the bikers in the bar was exceptionally well done and it's outcome was not what I expected. Basically Aquaman was my favorite Non-Batman DC movie. 10/10 stars."

","The DC Extended Universe has a spotty record to say the least: ""Man of Steel"" had mixed reception, ""Batman v Superman"" divided critics and fans alike, ""Suicide Squad"" was an overall failure, ""Wonder Woman"" brought hope, and ""Justice League"" underperformed financially. It was an uphill battle from there and, thanks to James Wan (Saw, Insidious), this latest entry struck the right chords like a tidal wave.<br/><br/>Plot: Arthur Curry/Aquaman was born a child of two worlds, his father an ordinary lighthouse keeper and his mother queen of the legendary Atlantis. Now, he must rise up to realize his destiny as the bridge between land and sea. He must journey across the world with the sexy princess Mera in order to prevent his half-brother Orm aka Ocean Master from bringing together the seven undersea kingdoms in order to wage war on the surface.<br/><br/>Like ""Wonder Woman"", this film was not bound by excessive sequel-baiting or studio intervention and instead told a complete story into itself and, boy, was the story something to behold, one of love and legacy. This film embodies everything that makes Aquaman such a grand and badass hero (he rules 2/3 of the planet after all) and added enough flair and compelling character writing to make it a phenomenal work of art. The underwater world is a splendor filled with stunning technology, fantastical creatures, wonderful colors, varied environments, and a lore worthy of this world. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams definitely left an impression, providing the right feelings in every scene. All the actors did a terrific job portraying these larger-than-life characters, especially Jason Momoa who made me cheer, laugh, and root for him in every conflict, carrying the right balance of drama and humor. And let's not forget the actions scenes, which got me excited every time fists, water, and laser blasts fly; the Black Manta fight and the climactic undersea war had me pumped. I also gotta give creds to all the little nods to classic nautical tales and ancient mythology.<br/><br/>Amazing doesn't even cut it for this one. By the time it was over, the audience gave an applause, something I rarely see in theaters and it's well-deserved.

Plot is interesting, there are no aliens invading us this time, it's purely a survival matter that happens all underwater of our world. Most of the movie is underwater, so imagine how brilliant and awesome the visual effects are. I can only say: give them already their Oscar, please! Amazing. Not only all the animals we see but also the clothes and specially the hair of the main characters, you feel like you are inside a tank of your town's aquarium.<br/><br/>All along the movie you will feel like you are watching another movie, because at some point there is a mix of other movies or simply things that will remind you of them, like: Riders of the Lost Ark or Avatar. And let's not forget that Little Mermaid moment with the Octopus playing the drums. Fantastic! Plus the female character reminds us of Black Widow, just kicking asses but with her own power too and she's not just a secondary player. Marvel, please take note on that. It's like a mix of movies, but in a good way. Not for a minute will you check your watch while watching the film.<br/><br/>It seems that DC is finally finding their path with the storylines. Aquaman is as Wonder Woman was, a really entertaining movie. It has mythology, it has action, it has a good speed and it has humor. And probably the best visual effects of the year. So what are you waiting for?"

A hopeful, borderline realistic, joyful and emotional tone is what everyone wants from comic book movies.

","One word for this movie.Triumphant.<br/><br/>James Wan reminds us how ok it is to imagine as wide as we can. And he did that by by showing us what those imaginations can do. The effects,style,CGI and acting were all great but more importantly each scene had you wondering what's going to happen next and what happened next was awesome. You relish every scene in this movie.<br/><br/>If DC and WB carry the universe in this light they could come close to what the MCU has done so far"
"nahtlus","7","2","4","23 December 2018"," it just right
","Treat my self as someone who doesn't know about Aquaman , also ignoring the justice league.<br/><br/>Overall I thought it just right. Amazing CGI, nice casting. The story is good but it's too pacey that made it feels like very complicated."
"robfamman","9","2","4","23 December 2018"," Fun and entertaining
","Enjoyed this film all the way through. Some of the dialogue was a little rough and the comedy was a bit forced. I felt the characters had good chemistry and the story was fun and captivating. DC never does a very good job with the villains but this movie was pretty damn good. Scenes were awesome as they took silly things from the old cartoon and in the comics and made them extremely cool."
"thebricks","5","2","4","23 December 2018"," Felt like watching high school kids make a superhero movie
","What can I say? Pretty mediocre movie from start to finish. Everyone is just here to pick up a paycheck. The lead, Jason Momoa, is too busy trying to channel nineties metal rockstars instead of trying to play Aquaman. It's disturbing at times to see alcoholism being glorified onscreen. What's up with that? Everyone onscreen is going through the motions because they're being asked to play a part in a movie that's already been done a few dozen times before or more that's been done to death. I'm honestly surprised no one has done a parody of superhero movies yet. So many of them follow the same formula.<br/><br/>The end was the worst part of the movie. Nothing was convincing about it. Amber Heard just looked embarrassed. She can't act. It's tragic. She totally knew she was on a set, doing a movie role for a quick buck. She put no effort into convincing the audience of who she was playing onscreen.<br/><br/>Watch in IMAX if you can, some of the cinematography is just gorgeous. Yahya Abdul-Mateen deserves some recognition for his part. I felt this movie may have been a lot better with him as Aquaman. Jason Momoa can't act, I mean, if this was the best you could do, at least just cast Yahya as the lead. He deserves much better and was the one good thing about this film."

","I am so sick of comic book characters changing color. It has nothing to do with racism, I am an originalist. In almost every movie now we have a main or minor character turn from white to Asian, black, Hispanic and now Aquaman is Hawaiian.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Jason Momoa is great for the role, and his exotic looks make the character more interesting. But he isn't Aquaman.<br/><br/>The original 1940's Aquaman was a regular man who could breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute, and he was white.<br/><br/>The Silver Age Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis, and again he was a blonde haired white man.<br/><br/>I just can't imagine the fallout of turning a long time black character into a white person, it would never happen.<br/><br/>Here is a partial list of characters who have changed colors....only from white.<br/><br/>Nick Fury

","Presented in bid D screen projected at single projector top and bottom 3d process.There was no trouble with the 3d presentation, perfect. Too bad Stan Lee died ,he usually showed up in these comic strip movie made 3D features of super heroes.He was never able to see the premiere.The character were good,but very confusing ,there were many super heroes and potentials ,like Black manta and his father,played Yahya Abdul Manteen,the son and Michael Beach as his father as they fight in a submarine and kills a white man,who might have been a bad guy,or was manteen the bad guy? but, fails to kill Aqua man and ends up being being injured,instead. It seems that Atlantis was sunken in the ocean,but ,the people who survived it .Aqua mother ,played by Nicole Kidman, had met his father ,a light house man,played by Temuera Morrison,when he rescued her from a storm.Later they fall in love and Aqua would be born,but then she has to leave her lover because she is still wanted by the enemy,causing Tem to have to raise Aqua himself.When he grows up ,Aqua. Princess Mera,played as a red head,portrayed by Amber Heard and shows up to him and tells him that a war is being started by the bad guys against Atlantis head up by king Orm who is played by Patrick Wilson, and that he Aqua is inherent to Atlantis and must com back to the under water and help them the Atlantis to win.It seems when Mera introduces aqua to her king Orm, does not trust Aqua and puts him in a hard duel that Mera rescues Aqua and both ends up in adventures in an underground of a desert to Greece ,where Mera eats flowers,but more of the bad guys shows up and they have to fight. It seems like the bad guys look like a dinosaur whale combo crocodile half man.A percentage of the story is adapted form the king Arthur stories,since Aqua man name is Arthur and the huge monster he has to deal with,reminds you of Lord of the ring dragon,when Aqua fights to get the sword that is held by the corps ,well preserved in water of King Atlan,played by Graham McTavish.It seems there is another enemy too King Nereus,played by Dolph Lundgen .Everyone is fighting to take over Atlantis ,so they can take over the land and attack the humans.This is what princes Mera is trying to stop.This film was very impressive in 3D ,like creature from the black lagoon,the under water set were impressive of the city,but, whats good is that the story just like in,"" Ready player One,""stands out and can be enjoyed equally in 2D also. There could be another sequel,because near the end you see Manta recovering from a wound,looks like he at a house of some scientist and a bomb goes through the ceiling almost hitting the scientist,and he is wanting revenge against aqua and thinking about his next plans for that.Good entertainment. 12/21/18"

I was on the edge of my seat all the way through. This is Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard's real chance to shine together and all the side character's were great as well. It also had real emotional moments. I would suggest seeing this and if you haven't seen Justice League yet, just please skip over that movie"

WW is also something special, but it left us with not to satisfying with its main villain. BVS is perfect, but only for its ultimate edition. While Aquaman proved to be a solid part of DCEU with its specific tones, but with an improved refreshment in the atmosphere and visual cinematography. Yet, its not overflowed to be similar with MCU.

"Lewis_Heather787","6","2","4","20 December 2018"," Very conflicted about this film!
","To be totally honest and up front I am personally suffering from Comic book film fatigue at the moment, there is just an over saturation. I'd even go as far to say that I am getting less and less bothered or interested in them, the more that come out. I am more of a DC fan than Marvel but I have enjoyed films from both however I really couldn't care less anymore. Maybe thats just me.<br/><br/>With that overly long intro out of the way onto the film itself, which I have to say I am very conflicted on because there are parts I really enjoyed but that there are also parts that were just ok for me. Unfortunately though that is the overriding feeling after viewing this film is that, it is just ok. Which is a real bummer because I go into every film hoping to love it.<br/><br/>Lets start with positives firstly, James Wan. Wow can that man direct!! This probably from a visual standpoint one of the most amazing and breath-taking comic book films you're going to see. Some of the visuals underwater in the world of Atlantis are just incredible, and more importantly the camera work throughout some of the action scenes. Idea of showing two different action scenes going on simultaneously, switching between the two without cutting away is a brilliant way to give perspective on the overall area and scale of the action. Overall though it is nothing less than I expected from Wan because he is an uber talented director and he definitely added something fresh to comic book films in that respect.<br/><br/>Strangely I thought that Jason Momoa was a good as I thought he was gonna be nothing spectacular but not terrible either, however I think there are couple other performances that really stood out to me. Firstly Nicole Kidman, she is one of the best around today period. So it shouldn't really be a surprise that she is really good, but you do worry now and then when you here about a huge name staring in a film like this. Are they just doing it for the pay check?? I thought her performance was really strong and is the heart of the film even though she has ""limited"" screen time. Every time she does appear on screen she is a scene steeler. Overall top class. The other scene steeler and this one was a shock is Amber Heard as Mera. Now this might be just me but I'm not the greatest Amber Heard fan, don't actually think she's that good an actress, average at best, maybe a little harsh. Wow has this got to be her best performance of her career as of yet. She commands the screen whenever she is on and I think she does a better job of carrying the film than Momoa. As soon as she is introduced to us you immediately warm to her or just latch onto her character and her motivations. However the best thing and probably the most harshest thing I could say is that she wasn't playing Amber Heard, she was actually playing a character......Do you get what i mean? Maybe my bar is set really low for her and actually this isn't really that good but who knows really......each to your own.<br/><br/>All the other performances are really strong Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe and even Dolph Lundgren. They all do well in there respective roles.<br/><br/>Now onto the negatives. Firstly the tone of the film, which needless to say is all over the place. In a way it sort of reminds me of the tone of ""Justice League"" or some of the Marvel films, one minute begin serious the next second being light hearted out of nowhere. There are so many ups and downs with the tone that it never really felt like an overall theme or tone to latch onto........Is it just me or am I going crazy. I can't quite put my finger on in it, but there was just a strange tone.<br/><br/>Did we really need the character of Black Manta and he's sub-story? There is a lot going on in this film and I just think it might have been helped a little with a bit more of a simpler story with less characters. The character of Black Manta, although there was nothing wrong with the character itself or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II performance its just felt a little shoehorned in.<br/><br/>Finally there wasn't anything in the film that made my jaw drop or was really fascinated by. Erm.......................can't find the words to describe it really, the film was just fine there was a lot of it that was forgettable not because it was bad but it wasn't really that great. Ah thats it there was no great moments in the film for me plenty of fine/ok moments, some good directing and performances but nothing......great.<br/><br/>Overall this film is just 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out 10 it is ok/average, which is a real bummer because if you'd told me that about 2 and a bit years ago I wouldn't have believe you. I'm just a bit worn out with these films whether that is Marvel and sadly even DC now, and boy have I given DC some passes recently.....I'm looking at you ""Justice League"", ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"". Some good directing from James Wan, two standout performances from Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard but as I said nothing great.......just fine."

They didn't inject any political junk, it was well-paced and acted, the story was good, the effects were great.<br/><br/>I'm a MARVEL fan mostly, but I love the DC characters as well and it made me happy to see DC put out something so entertaining. I really hope they can keep it up because they have so many awesome characters that need movies that do them justice.<br/><br/>Amber Heard did great, even she would have been a better choice for Captain Marvel IMO.<br/><br/>I give this a solid 7.5/10 with no real complaints."

"jordang73","5","2","4","18 December 2018"," A little bit too much of mess
","Well, another blockbuster with too much emphasis on the visuals and no much care for everything else. A somehow uneven script, trying to connect an undersea story with an on the ground plot. I had a hard time trying to feel confortable with the connection of these 2 dimensions. I enjoyed the undersea battles, though. The worst part for me was the beyond dull characters that populated this movie. Aquaman's father: sorry for that guy, but it was like the opposite of substance, as well as the bad guy with a gun that looked like extracted from a gangsta movie from the 80's. I gave this film 5 stars because the protaginist did a good job and he seems to be like a cool guy in real life. Also the visuals were good and, oh! one the best actors on the planet got a role here... Guess who?"
"Bigjl98","8","2","4","18 December 2018"," Beautiful scenery, excellent CGI, and great characters produce a DC movie that isn't anywhere as dark as most of the other DCEU movies.
","In AQUAMAN, the movie does a beautiful job at being both a sequel to Justice League as well as an introduction of the Aquaman origin story through its use of flashbacks that didn't jar the viewer out of the tempo of the film. Hopefully the DCEU bosses can remember how to replicate the feeling of this movie and how it was done in their future stand alone character films.<br/><br/>In most movies an actor and their character tends to steal the spotlight whenever on screen and Jason Mamoa skirting the line between hero of the common man, man who would be king, and hero of all; shows his ability to be a mixture of a man who wants to help others without recognition, doesn't want or like to take himself so serious, and finally becoming the man his mom told him about in 'Atlantian fork stories.' Momoa shows the hurt he has when thinking that he was the fault of so many peoples.
Overall the characters, and use of beautiful colors and backgrounds, the interwoven mix of the past and the present to tell the story as well as the origin story of AQUAMAN help the movie to become the second strongest film of the DCEU by a very wide margin."

-Jason Momoa is a very charismatic lead, I was concerned going into it because I didn't care for his Conan movie.
-Amber Heard does a great job as Mera, she's just like her comic book counterpart.
-Patrick Wilson is a good foil to Momoa's Aquaman
-Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe are great in their parts, but they aren't in the movie that much.
-Great environmental message
-The Second and Third Acts come together nicely.<br/><br/>Cons:

-Some of the dialogue and music choices don't work at times
-First Act feels a little bit rushed"

"zekopunisher","9","2","4","16 December 2018"," MASTERPIECE
","SPOILER REVIEW!!<br/><br/>This movie is entertaining begining to end!! It flowed so well the cinematography and scenes were so well done and so are the characters.<br/><br/>Aquaman - love Jason's performance and how james wan showed Aquaman is more than just a king and has a lovely relationship with his Father, Mera and Atlanna especially when Author gets to see her when he goes to find the Trident.
Mera - Amber heard is literally born to play mera!! She is such a strong, bad ass and empowered superhero. I love how she constantly has to help Author become a King and love the beautiful kiss at the end. I enjoyed that Mera was no damsel in distress. She took care of herself. I loved that Mera and Author worked as a team not just one saves another. Overall Amber killed it and Mera is Badass!
Ocean Master - loved how Patrick Wilson protrayed orm. Orm was a great villain but even though hes the main villain black manta definitely got some rounds handed to Aquaman. But Orm all in all was great and actually has great reasoning to attack the surface because of us killing the oceans with pollution. He also had great fights with aquaman and i love the dialogue he has. Such a well read script.
Black Manta - Fantasitc! Love how comic accurate he is and i loved how they went for the New 52 storyline for him. This whole movie is pretty muched based off of New 52 which is my personal favorite version of comics. Fights scenes were amazing with him and just everything was spot on.
Atlanna - Nicole kidman was beautiful and amazing as always. So happy James kept her alive. Also every character who wasn't necessarily the main role had a good amount of scenes and overall didnt feel like they were rushed or poorly written in the movie.
Everones role had a purpose and was so well written. And this movie by far is the best cgi/vfx of this year. Most parts I total forgot that the underwater scenes were cgi because of how amazing everything was. It wasnt a cgi mess like some other movies this year that im not gonna mention.<br/><br/>But please!!! Go watch AQUAMAN. YOU WILL BE WASHED AWAY FROM AWESOMENESS! Definitely believe the hype. This movie is worth seeing in the biggest screen possible."

DC surely has mad mistake by releasing justice league before solo movies of those individual characters.

"davidmvining","3","0","0","7 July 2020"," Expensive Looking, for sure
","I'll have to write through the DCEU at some point, but I guess I'm starting here. I'm one of those weird people that really likes Zack Snyder's take on the Superman and Batman stories. There's real cinematic ambition at work there, and while its reach may exceed its grasp, it tries to be mythic in scope. James Wan's Aquaman is a very different animal. It's certainly big and obviously very expensive, but the film feels smaller, and its not the stakes at play. Also, it seems obvious that Wan's time making mediocre popcorn horror films have not taught him the ins and outs of how to build a story.<br/><br/>Looking through some positive reviews of the film I see some common themes. There's a lot of praise for the visuals, the special effects, the action, and the humor. Well, the movie certainly very often looks quite expensive and it sometimes does look pretty good (especially the Trench attack late in the film), but this is mostly praise for a film's ability to hire hundreds of visual effects artists more than anything else. A lot of this is to do with the movie's poor world building.<br/><br/>The story first, though. Arthur Curry is the son of the queen of Atlantis and some guy who lives in a house by the sea in New England. Being the son of the queen of Atlantis, he has special water powers like breathing underwater and swimming really fast and, apparently, being just this side of invincible. After his mother gets torn from him at a very young age, Nuidis, the vizier from Atlantis, comes and trains him for years in short little scenes that don't even amount to a training montage. After the events of Justice League, Arthur is somewhat responsible for the death of a pirate, leaving the pirate's son itching for murder. In the middle of the ocean, Orm, Arthur's half-brother from their mother and another Atlantian, is consolidating power to become the Ocean Master and wage war on the surface. This doesn't sit well with Nuidis or Mera, Orm's betrothed and daughter to another of the sea kings. They go off to recruit Arthur to challenge Orm and become King of Atlantis.<br/><br/>So, when this movie isn't giving us really expensive special effects shots of submarines, giant seahorses, and vibrantly colored underwater cities, it's giving us really boring scenes where people with names we cannot remember explain things to other people with names we cannot remember. In most movies, these would be done in bland environments, but in Aquaman, they're done in, well, bland environments with some thin layers of water effects around them. Seriously, most of the world building in this film is Orm flatly explaining to people his plan to consolidate power without giving us a clear view of who in Earth he's talking about.<br/><br/>Then, for really inexplicable reasons, the movie decides to become an Indiana Jones knockoff for about forty minutes where Arthur and Mera have to take a thing to a place where they get another thing which they have to take to another place which directs them to another place and finally directs them to the Trench, one of the seven kingdoms under the sea. This is where the funny is supposed to come in, but like pretty much every scene in the film, nothing here feels fleshed out enough to carry any amount of character beyond some quick quips (which, of course, means that Arthur and Mera are going to totally fall in love by the end). I would say it's an excuse to get them out of the way of Orm so that Orm can consolidate more power while they're away, but they end up trapped in the Trench with no escape at one point. Instead of having a forty minute and unsatisfying Indiana Jones knockoff, they could have given us twenty minutes of the pair trying to find a way out, getting to know each other, and then finding the surprise guest near the end.<br/><br/>For a movie that's a hundred and sixty minutes long, it does feel shockingly short in some ways, and that's because it doesn't spend any time with any single scene beyond those that demand lots of special effects, like fights. It's paced very quickly, and that ends up being a bad thing because it makes the film very thin where character interactions feel perfunctory rather than meaningful.<br/><br/>And, the special effects. Again, this movie very often looks expensive, but it only occasionally looks good. The approach to the Trench, when Arthur and Mera have to jump from their rinky dink boat and into the water (why two creatures that can swim much faster than a small boat can putter along actually take the boat, I do not know) actually looks really striking as Arthur holds out a series of flares that lights them and the swarm of creatures trying to get to them that surrounds them. However, the flight through Atlantis offers a good counterpoint. It's full of colors and it looks like a team of digital artists spent hundreds of hours each on every little detail to bring it out, but it ends up feeling flat because we don't get any sense of what anything we're seeing is. This is where some actual world building would have benefited the film, allowing us time to explore Atlantis a bit with Arthur as our eye and ears into this new world, learning about what's going on in this fantastic city. Instead, they quickly move to a sunken ship where they hide away from the special effects and then have a fight.<br/><br/>I really did not like this movie. It's thin with little focus and an almost complete inability to tell a story. I imagine it's not going to age particularly well for those who were blown away by it on their first viewing."

","Plain, run of the mill overly dependent on action and explosion with little story or character or character development. It was EXTREMELY obvious how this movie was going to go, the ending the not dead mother and all the other part of this were projected from almost the start. By the way even if it is was supposed to be assumed that Atlanta abdicated to be with her love it should have been in the movie all the same because she was still queen. Unless of course you are meant to assume a masculine only ruler-ship. But with all the other junk about the 'surface dwellers' being the bad guys and destroying all the sea and world it is doubtful that they wanted a male dominated image for this film. It was okay at best but had the promise to be so much more than it is. Tsk-Tsk DC."

"mhhondas","4","0","0","4 March 2020"," Why are people praising this movie?!
","I'm going to brutally honest and admit Aquaman is totally underwhelming. I like most of the actors and actresses of the cast individually, but almost no one besides Momoa matches their role. Despite my admiration of them, Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe just don't feel like they fit in this world, but I suppose that could just be because Wilson feels more like an elf the whole way through (think Thranduil from The Hobbit). I'm not going to say that I expect a superhero movie to have a lot of realism, especially when it's about a famous myth, but the visuals are far too Avatar-like. Atlantis can look however they wish, but the entire ocean looking like a glow rave is undeniably wacky. I know it's difficult to explain every detail when world-building, but very little of even the basic technical stuff makes sense (once again, I know it's fictional, but frankly some of their world is downright silly). The fight scenes tend to have shots that are overly dramatic and choppy. I think the intention was to go for a more comic book style of conflict (with severe zoom-ins, comedic smirks, and etc.) like many of the latest adaptations are doing (ie. Wayne and Deadpool), but does so unfortunately poorly (to the point of wooziness or motion sickness). Many of the backgrounds, look like very cheap and stock-quality CGI. I can't believe that most of the praise for this movie was for the visuals, for me that was the worst part. Most of the laughs are cheap and juvenile, not unlike many other movies though. The characters who get the most screen time are the best developed and most funny, so basically only Heard and Momoa. This fact alone is why Marvel continues to beat DC at the box office. After Wonder Woman, I was just expecting better than this, not the same quality as WW even, but just not as disappointing as this. The costuming looked a lot like actual Halloween costumes (the Atlantian guards look like they took the suits from Power Rangers villains and painted them white, Mera's green suit is very cheap-looking, and Black Manta looks like a squashed version of Ant-Man). Even my own mother, who knows nothing of comics and is generally easily pleased by action movies (especially with main characters played by guys she thinks are hot), had to say the music choices were far from the best (I mean an Africa cover, seriously?) and often disruptive to the scenes rather than building them up. For me the most promising thing in the DC Universe now is Ezra Miller's goofy and relatable Flash."

"andrewmerritt-31652","7","0","0","4 November 2019"," They managed to turn a worthless superhero into a decent movie
","Aquaman stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, and Patrick Wilson. Aquaman is how the story of how Aquaman became the king of Atlantis. I was never a big fan of Aquaman because he talks to fish and that's not really a superpower and he's the useless superhero in the D.C. universe. But D.C. had an idea to give Aquaman a makeover and make a movie where audiences around the world could respect him. I didn't think it was possible, but they did that and I was wrong. After seeing Jason Momoa's performance as Aquaman, my opinion on Aquaman is changed and he did a fantastic job. I could see that he wanted to take the role seriously and bring an Aquaman to life that we've never seen before. There was a show called Entourage and one of the seasons involved Vincent Chase as Aquaman. So when I watch Jason Momoa's portrayal of Aquaman compared to the fictionalized portrayal of Vincent Chase's Aquaman I believe that Jason Momoa would blow Vincent Chase out of the water. I wonder if the Entourage Aquaman was released how would they have stuck with this plot that I saw now or come up with a different one? We'll never know, but I would like to think that what I just watch would be what they had in mind. I felt a slight beacon of hope for the D.C. universe cause I see that they're trying to do, but the movie does have its problems. The problem that I found was the villains and how they chose to handle them. We have Oceanmaster who is the main villain and then we have Black Manta. When they first mentioned Black Manta I was excited because I remember him from the Challenge of the Super Friends and how I always wanted to see him on the big screen. And we finally have him, but unfortunately he has little screen time and I was disappointed because I was hoping for him to be the main villain and not Oceanmaster. Also we don't see much of Atlantis at all. We see Atlantis, but not very much that we don't get to explore enough of Atlantis to enjoy. The director of Aquaman is James Wan who directed Furious 7 who I thought was a great choice of a director as the action sequences are very well choreographed that even if I found the movie to be average it does make up for its action scenes. So overall, D.C. is on the right track with a movie that has problems here and there, but I found that they did a great job in turning the worst superhero into something fantastic."

"disposalrobot","4","0","0","15 October 2019"," A typical DC movie
","A big part of the movie happens underwater but almost nothing looks or sounds underwater. Most of the CGI looks like a rainbow puked on it and sound design is a lot more sci-fi than underwater. Basically it feels like unicorns flying in space shooting lasers at each other in slow motion. The CGI overall appears very outdated and disconnected from the real-world footage. People's voices don't change in any way to give the feeling that they are underwater - instead all of the lines sound like clean studio recordings. At one point I thought they are still regularly underwater when in fact they were in an air bubble of sorts, and the only thing that gave it away was gravity.<br/><br/>What is watery, though, is the watered down action in general. Everything is desperately trying to be epic all the time, but fails miserably and ends up causing no emotion whatsoever. That also goes for everything else besides the action. There is music absolutely all the time, and the music sounds exactly the same as in other DC movies (where there is also music all the time). Almost feels as if they have just bought a pile of generic stock music to fill in for the conversation bits to keep things dramatic enough. The camera also zooms, pans, flies or makes circles almost all the time. When you put all this together the end result is that nothing has any impact on the viewer because of the complete lack of contrast between calm and action-filled or dramatic moments.<br/><br/>It's also a pity to see good actors give underwhelming performances under bad direction and trying to work with a story and characters completely devoid of any substance. In essence the story is one that has been written many times before in many forms, and everything you expect to happen, happens. There is no element of surprise, no plot-twist, nothing. Only a big bag of clichés strung together using bad jokes and generic lines that are so obvious they become mere background noise.<br/><br/>Yet these below-mediocre mass-produced superhero films keep selling so very well - and even get decent reviews. It indicates that people in genreal do not demand anything more from their action. Rarely is an action movie a masterpiece, but it's not at all impossible to make them entertaining or even thought-provoking. Aquaman was none of those, but to be fair I didn't hate it either. It wasn't disappointing since I wasn't expecting much to begin with. It was just... meh."

The movies starring some of the most iconic and beloved DC characters? Hated them. The movie based on arguably the stupidest DC character that is pretty much only popular because he's seen as a joke? I really liked it! It had fun action, a brisk pace that took you all over the place, a light tone that didn't take itself too seriously, enjoyable characters to go on an adventure with, and breathtakingly beautiful colours. Imagine that, a DC movie that's bright and colourful! I'm a sucker for neon and bioluminescence especially (Avatar, Tron Legacy, and Blade Runner are some of my favourite movies for that aspect alone), and this movie has a lot of that! Some of the CGI looked a little phoney at times, almost like a video game cutscene, but that just added to the charm in my opinion. Another thing I really appreciated was the fact that it was a stand-alone film with little to no connection to the other movies. There's a loose connection to Wonder Woman and a reference to Justice League, but that's it. This is the kind of movie they should've been making for the DCEU from the beginning, I'm glad that they seem to be going in this lighter, more fun direction rather than the dark, convoluted Zack Snyder stuff. I highly recommend this movie if you just want to have a good time. It's The Little Mermaid meets Indiana Jones meets Black Panther featuring battle sharks, crab people, and dinosaurs! Doesn't that sound awesome? If it does, you'll like this movie a lot, I think! I'm gonna go watch Wonder Woman and Shazam now. Maybe I do like the DCEU after all!"

In spite of the excellent CGI and the environmental message it tries to convey, it just doesn't resonate enough. It's certainly not as terrible as Tom Cruise's ""Mummy"" (what is?) but it's not that great either. The dialogue is pathetic at times and a lot of the action scenes feel way too long and only made to fill out time and mask a lack of substance.

","The movie was pretty cheesy not gonna lie.

And how everyone thought she was dead but surprise surprise she wasn't dead, and of course both she and her son both recognized each other immediately when the reunited. Now I'll give it up for some of the fight scenes because they were kind of cool, and the crab king was actually cute which I don't really say that often so that's good I guess. if I have to sum it up, DC was intimidated by the awe that is Marvel's success, panicked, and created Aquaman. The build up was really rough; with all the exposition and drama. Aquaman didn't really have too much of a personality up until a 4th of the movie, just illustrating the kind of cocky hero-Type main character the box office thinks we want to see, and then giving him more of a reckless attitude later on. I'll also give it up for DC's attempt to keep both roles equal instead of empowering just the female role, like most movies nowadays. I'll end it with this: let's just be happy it's not Justice League."

","Any rating I give this movie should come with a massive asterisk because this movie may have broken me a little.<br/><br/>I want to say right upfront that this is not a good movie, this is far from being a good movie but I implore you to see this right now! Aquaman has provided one of the most fun movie going experience I have had in a while.<br/><br/>If you read my 2018 retrospective you will know that this film reminded me of many other films, that is one of the things that fascinates me so much about this Aquaman. Really this should feel kind of fresh and new given the director's previous work and the less serious tone within the DC movie universe but so many scenes feel ripped from other movies.<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely incredible throughout the movie, the attention to detail with the underwater world makes watching this on the big screen feel rewarding, every action sequence in the kingdom of Atlantis feels like the exact opposite to the one on Wakanda during Black Panther. In that movie often the special effects and action choreography felt like an after thought so that the movie could focus on other things while in Aquaman they are given the time they deserve to leave an impact. Having said that the other moments in the film are also polar opposite to Black Panther, where in that movie slow dialogue heavy moments felt like they had real weight here they are usually laughable (and not when they mean to be).<br/><br/>James Wan is a great director and their is no denying that. He has had an impact on the horror genre with greats such as Saw, The Conjuring and Insidious and his mark will felt on that genre for years. But in recently his foray into the action genre has had interesting results. There is no doubt that Furious 7 was more than a little goofy but with Aquaman Wan has outdone himself. None of the character arcs are memorable or interesting, the two leads have no chemistry, there is no real villain of the movie but there are two side villains and about an hour into the film I lost track of the plot and started laughing uncontrollably for way to long.<br/><br/>I am seriously finding it difficult to put into words how bizarre this movie is because on paper it sounds almost par for the course with comic book movies but really this is so much more than that.<br/><br/>I have to recommend checking this film out but as I said earlier I don't recommend it as a good movie, just a fun one. Like a lot of people I hope that Wan will return to his horror roots soon and stop dragging Patrick Wilson into strange action films, they both deserve better than Aquaman.<br/><br/>Also they play the Pitbull's version of Toto's Africa in this movie right when Saw co-creator Leigh Whannell makes a cameo. That might be my favourite moment of 2018 cinema."
"Michaelayeve","4","0","0","5 April 2019"," Plays it safe and avoids trying anything new
","Aqua-man is yet another DCEU movie that manages to catch a fantastic start, but gradually declines into a messy generic movie which only exists to appeal to mainstream audiences.<br/><br/>The same old formula has once again been used, but this time our hero is Aqua-man, and for the first time ever, we have an underwater super hero movie. I must say the way the managed to portray the underwater world exceeded my expectations as I have not seen anything like it before, but unfortunately it's one of the high points of this flick.<br/><br/>The movie begins like your average Disney movie. Two characters fall in love, have a child, and they get separated. This child is aquaman, a boy with seemingly unique powers of being able to communicate with sea creatures.<br/><br/>Fast forward to when he's grown up, aquaman is your generic character that is slowly transferred into a hero, one that is the last hope of stopping the war versus the Atlantans and the ""earth people"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't really go any further without spoiling the plot (there's not really that much to spoil) but let's just say you can predict everything that happens in the movie, including some of the dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie feels one linear. One dimensional. There is no sense of wonder, no atmospheric environment, nothing. The movie has managed to bring the best cgi within the DCEU universe, but at the end of the day, it just feels like a movie.<br/><br/>There is honestly nothing going for this movie. It just manages to succeed at not being as bad as some of DC's lowest (suicide squad, justice league). It plays everything safe, sticking to the core roots that the audience seems to enjoy and want out of a movie, regardless or not if they have seen it a thousand times.<br/><br/>The writing is poor, the screenplay is poor, the cgi is fantastic, the acting is bland, and the movie lacks any memorable moments except for the eye candy fight near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall if you're okay with the same old movie following the same old formula, you can't really go wrong with this movie. But for someone who is sick and tired of the same stuff over and over again, I'm going to have to give this movie a 4/10."

Some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a Power Rangers TV show, especially the Black Manta scenes. Just awful and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene - when we all know the Aquaman from the comics, TV shows, and video games - is portrayed to be more of a serious, charismatic person with leadership qualities - all of which Jason Momoa fails to bring to the table. In addition, if you're a REAL fan of the Aquaman character and have seen the DC animated film 'Justice League: Throne of Atlantis', then you may have noticed how significantly different the story is.<br/><br/>Not sure what the writers, producers, and director were thinking, but this is an epic fail in the story-line department because they decided to basically make Aquaman a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of Aquaman's backstory.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the CGI action sequences (when Aquaman fights the trench monsters, for example).<br/><br/>The villains (Orm and Black Manta) are extremely weak. Orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown, he doesn't put up much of a fight.<br/><br/>Black Manta is another major disappointment. Again, if you've read the comics or even played the 'Injustice' video games, you know Black Manta is a warrior with some DAMAGING fighting skills and abilities - but again, is under-utilized and comes off as a weak side villain.<br/><br/>These villains should have been much more BRUTAL, but unfortunately, they were weak.<br/><br/>Skip this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aquaman from the comics, video games, or animated content.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","0","0","23 March 2019"," A Jason Momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films.
","Now that Marvel's 10-year behemoth of its cinematic universe is starting to pay off, it's becoming more and more obvious that DC is trying desperately to catch up. There's no doubt that DC has interesting characters, considering how often Superman has been rebooted and how successful Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy was. Even Wonder Woman (2017) had its great moments, despite also feeling derivative influences from movies like Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Aquaman (2018) seems to continue this trend, despite again having a strong leading character (both physically and in backstory/lore).<br/><br/>I will give DC credit for their casting decisions here. For decades, Aquaman has been the butt of the joke amongst many superhero aficionados. The fact that Jason Momoa is a badass, snarky, and overall entertaining actor to watch in the role speaks to their awareness of ""image management."" Perhaps featuring him in previous films like Justice League (2017) also helped to get audiences interested in seeing this superhero in a standalone movie. Needless to say, my interest was piqued, and I finally went to see this film. Knowing little to nothing about Aquaman, I was in for an experience.<br/><br/>While the movie overall wasn't bad, it felt a little too long. I think the Black Manta storyline was a bit distracting, especially as a setup for a future sequel. After all, when there's this huge Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars conflict going on, there shouldn't be time for these other plotlines. I'll also say that the plot felt a little derivative of Black Panther (2018), which only had the advantage of being released earlier in the year. There was also a bit of a Tron: Legacy (2010) aesthetic in this movie that I liked. I did feel the Little Mermaid (1989) nod was perhaps a little too obvious, though.<br/><br/>A Jason Momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films, I give Aquaman 3.5 stars out of 5."
"yasas_bandara","6","0","0","21 March 2019"," Inconsistent storyline, plot & characters
","I'm only focusing on the storyline and characters here. The special effects and stuff was great. Acting was bad and there was little character development.<br/><br/>This movie suffers from the same problem common to many superhero movies these days. The hero can be regarded a hero ONLY IN THE CONTEXT of the absolutely stupid plan/purpose of the villain.<br/><br/>1. King Orm wants to scorch the surface. OK but then what? What are they going to do with all that land? They can't possibly expect to rule it. Are they planning to sell the surface to the highest alien bidder? (it would make perfect sense if this was the case) Only the royalists can even breathe on land. 99% of their population can't. There is no resource on land that they crave. They have absolutely nothing to gain through an invasion and a lot to lose. So what's the point?
2. And just because king Orm's plan is absolutely ridiculous, the hero becomes the hero by stopping him. That's the whole story.
3. Now just for a moment, imagine a more sensible plan from the 'bad guy'. Let's say Orm only wanted to unite all the clans (and become ocean master) just so that he can prepare for any possible threat from the above. Let's say he's using the fear/hate for surface dweller only to gain support from the others. Say he never really planned on scorching the surface. If this was the case, can we totally vote for Arthur?
Basically, Arthur is the hero only because the bad guy's plan was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now, take a look at the characters...<br/><br/>4. Arthur is not really a hero for Atlantis. He had a little brother down there and he knew it. He says he wanted to visit him but this was clearly a lie as he never even tried. He finally came (only as an enemy) when he thought his loved ones were in danger.
5. Now Orm on the other hand, knows that his brother above was trained by a traitor to take his throne. He also knows that Arthur wanted to do nothing with Atlantis. Orm says he hated Arthur. However, Orm never tries to harm Arthur (or his father) in any way even though he knew Arthur could become a threat someday. Even when Arthur comes as an enemy, Orm still tries to send him back before the combat so that he doesn't have to kill him. So, which one of them is more honest & honorable?
6. Vulko is a pure traitor. He swore to serve the throne but trains the half-breed to take the throne from the pure-blood king for no logical reason. He just sits there and lies to the face of his king on a daily basis. When Orm asks ""Why?"", Vulko's reply is just laughable. How on earth can he possibly know that Arthur would have become a better king than Orm would ever be WHEN ORM WAS JUST A KID?? He started training Arthur when Orm was even younger that Arthur.
7. When Orm says he had dedicated his whole life to Atlantis, Vulko does not deny that. So there is clearly no reason why he would support Arthur (since the time Orm was just a kid) unless he wanted to make Arthur king based on the Queen's beliefs. Why can't he just say that?
8. If Vulko really served the throne (as he claimed), he could have tried to unite the brothers after the king's death. Remember that Orm had no other family except his brother above. Vulko doesn't do that but just keeps on believing that Arthur MUST be the king they're looking for."

Manta's doing a better job as a villain, but he didn't exactly drew me in either. Still more complexity than Orm, for sure.<br/><br/>Now, the film's a bit allover the place at times, there are a bit too many subplots that are rushed in the the final act and a couple too-obvious-cliches we didn't need (but didn't hurt us either). Still as a whole it is more consistent and definitely more enjoyable and well executed than BvS and Justice League, so it's safe to say that DCEU is finding what it needs.
I liked Heard's Mera, Kidman was also ok as Atlana, but I found Kidman's and Mr Curry's young selves awkward. Too awkward. I most definitely needed a bit de-aging effect."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>Well, that was impressive! There is no shortage of stunning visuals or graphics here. ""Aquaman"" is as epic as they come - the quest for a king becomes the story of a hero. This one delivers the goods.<br/><br/>Every hero has to come from somewhere ... Aquaman's story begins with his parents. A lighthouse keeper and a Queen from the ocean. A love that should've never happened, but was destined to be. When soldiers are sent from Atlantis to bring home the Queen, she goes back to save and protect her husband and son. Years pass by, and Aquaman is doing his part to watch over the waters and the crimes committed within - but when a beautiful stranger appears to him one night asking him to come back and claim the throne that is rightfully his, he balks at the idea. Him? A half-breed? And his mother dead? However, when a display of power comes from the depths of the ocean, he knows what he must do.<br/><br/>At first, I was skeptical heading into this one. It was nothing like what I expected. Then I realized, that I really didn't know what to expect. So, I guess it would be more accurate to say that it was better than what I expected. Usually when you have such striking visuals and CG work, it detracts from the overall story. Not so here. It actually adds to it. Jason Momoa really handles himself well in this role. He is completely believable and does a fine job of acting - not just a brute force, but showed appropriate emotion as well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for action and superhero enthusiasts. Be prepared to be blown away by an explosive film that is high on eye candy - with a good story to match. One of my favorites of the year."

We loved them as kids for the eye candy and the hilariously dumb stories that they were.
But then you grow up and realise that it will always be kids watching superhero movies. So they'll never make them any cleverer or grown-up(as in an overall better movie not swear words and sexual stuff)..
(Dark Knight trilogy never existed shoo shoo -,-)<br/><br/>When all hope was lost I thought they were starting to go somewhere with the release of Wonder Woman. But hey (: Seems like it will always be the never ending cycle of Marvel making their ground with each new release and DC desperately but failingly trying to catch up to them while both their equally toxic and dumb fanbases screw with the film ratings. They need to realise that just because a movie gives you goosebumps, doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good movie.<br/><br/>About this movie however,<br/><br/>Bad dialogue coupled with bad attempts at comedy.
Over the top CGI (Low budget video games does it better).
Extremely bad and cliché storyline.
4/10 because Karathen and Black Manta.<br/><br/>Don't recommend watching it. If you want good DC stories just go watch the animated movies.
Now waiting in disappointment for the next flop to be that is ""Shazam!""."

","The most impressive superhero movie so far, and I thought it was important enough to add my review given the recent senseless negative commentary which could put some off from enjoying it sooner than later. There have been good and mediocre superhero movies over the past few years but Aquaman nails is right in every category. Awesome acting, awesome story and special effects. Casting is perfect and locations and scenery that is not CGI is incredible. No one watches this movie without knowing that it's part of a superhero franchise, so I won't make absurd comments about whether it's cheesy or cliche, it plays the part it's supposed to in the movie experience perfectly."
"AhmedSpielberg99","8","0","0","16 March 2019"," All hail the true King, James Wan!
","Callmeyourkingsobeit: The Movie.<br/><br/>It's admittedly overlong because it's overstuffed with too many story-lines, and a long introductory opening sequence that could, and should, have easily been omitted; as there are many better-executed flashbacks which are more than enough. Add to this the fact that the aforementioned opening sequence is filled with cringe-inducing moments, including those which concern the romantic aspect, which is, in my opinion, the only silly thing that didn't work in the movie.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is packed with thrilling, kinetic, and meticulously designed and choreographed action set-pieces, in which you really can follow the action and the liberated fight sequences buoyed by raucous deluge of dazzling array of visual effects. Replicating underwater movement, and offering exotic creatures and characters' outfits that contrast the deep blue sea with splashes of bright colors, James Wan did a tremendous job creating an underwater world that's a visual feast that's consistently boasting a visual feast for the eyes. I enjoyed the out-of-water action sequences more, they are better and more masterfully designed than those that take place underwater; but nothing can compete with the stunning free-flowing underwater action scenes from the visual standpoint.<br/><br/>Aside from Furious 7, Wan's filmography is strictly horror related, having launched franchises in his own right with Saw and The Conjuring. Here we can see that he still uses his background in horror to deliver some moments that have shocking and surprising value, and they are quite effective.<br/><br/>It's not hard to tell that the entire cast and crew went all out. Their dedication does not go unnoticed. All the cast did their best to give a strong comeback, considering that most of them once had a quite promising and auspicious career. As for Jason Momoa, he really shines as the titular superhero. His physical appearance suits the badass character that the DCEU wanted to make from the get-go. He looks and fights as if he is a WWE superstar! Amber Heard is great, and the chemistry between her Indiana Jonesian character, Mera and Momoa's Aquaman is electric and gripping. They make an awesome dynamic duo, and their sugary cheerful relationship made up for the nauseating, saccharine romance of Tom Curry and Queen Atlanna.<br/><br/>The two villains have quite compelling background and convincing motives. And each one's sub-plot never overshadows the other's. Also, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are pretty good.<br/><br/>Aquaman is An Extremely Cool and Bad-ass Epic Fantasy Adventure of Cheesiness! It's decidedly a step in the right direction for DC. I still think Wonder Woman is the best movie in their extended universe, so far; but Aquaman is now my personal favorite.<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","DC never learn, do they? Well, baby steps. They thought that the success of Wooden Woman would do the trick... and they were right, clearly there aren't enough pirates in the world to show that making bad movies is bad for business.<br/><br/>The first thing I'd like to say is that this movie is extremely dumb. Painfully. Clinically. Not Gravity level, not Prometheus or even Martian. It is Logan level of dumb. The absolute abyss, it is technically impossible to watch this movie and think rationally, so the only survivors either have their brains disabled by default, or had to. Luckily, unlike Logan - this movie is more like Avatar. It's probably the most visual since Avatar. Yes, both Nibber Panther and Infinity Quip were stunning, but... not really visual. The difference is like a game with good graphics and... Subnautica. This makes Aquaman more or less easy to swallow. Indeed, if you do NOT think about what you are watching - this is a fancy popcorn-muncher. Perhaps even worthy of going to some IMAX.<br/><br/>Another very important feature about this movie - is that, unlike Nibber Panther and Wooden Woman, or even Captain Feminist - this movie doesn't seem to have a deep agenda. Sure, there are a few allusions and suggestions, but... I'd hardly compare it to the modern world, because we don't have a ""Karathen"" and any attempt to replicate such a scenario for politics would hardly be done in CGI. Agenda, propaganda, the things that pollute Martian, Wooden Woman, Nibber Panther, Zootopia, Frozen - they are the first and foremost things that inhibit the suspension of disbelief. Because you are almost ready to give in, when the writers remind you that ""hey, this is kinda relatable, dontcha *think*?"" The same goes for pretentiousness. Logan, The Shape of Water - when movies actively try to pretend to be something... that also tends to itch for people, who have problems turning their brains off. And that's the thing - Aquaman doesn't have any of that. It's a perfect example of a visually brilliant, sort of fun, filled with action superhero flick. For that - I can sort of agree that it's worth 6\10. It's nowhere near the first Avengers, it's not half as thrilling as the Dark Knight and it doesn't even begin to scrape the surface of the Watchmen, these movies were first of all ""whole"" movies, with superheroes and CGI being sort of... a background. And that's what truly deserves the peaks of the rating.<br/><br/>Aquaman isn't insightful, it doesn't show anything new. In fact, its plot is even more stupid and painful than Logan. Its characters - a copypasta from Wooden Woman. Most of the ""memorable"" scenes have a ""Blue Steel"" face in them, just like Wooden Woman(sorry, Galya Gadot, a model ain't an actress), so you can't really feel the characters, you don't feel anything towards them. There is no danger, no real drama, everything is as artificial, as superficial as it could be. Nichole Kidman washed up ashore? Well, let's get busy. She was hiding? Well, but how does Aquaman learn to do things? Oh, apparently he is trained already. He's fighting the bad guy? Oh, well, skip that part. Then there's some desert quipping, property damage in actually better parts of the world, then they go where they need to go, do things they need to do, chop in a CGI battle and voila - that there's a movie. I've watched a full-spoiler review of this movie before watching, so if you consider this summary a spoiler... I feel sorry for you. Someone has to.<br/><br/>The villains make Lex Luthor look good. I guess Patrick Wilson signed up just because he was told there's an Annabelle cameo. That nibber with his father... That whole scene makes Martha look painless. There are two absolutely, clearly and unmistakably a-hole guys, one of them is allowed to live. Then he gets a chance for revenge. Then he also lives. Okay, I am a racist, but casting him as a Black Manta after Black Panther... seriously, writers, YOU make the world racist. YOU do. Either way, the perpetual survival of this absolutely E-level villain that makes Malekith and Ronan look impressive(and that's saying a LOT) - doesn't help this movie, it only helps to establish an even more stupid sequel.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes... An effort should've been made to turn Aquaman into the Ocean Master. Because clearly there haven't been any for a while and it's not like anyone but Momoa can do that. Ocean Master... that resounds. That's somehow more meaningful than Starlord. Aquaman? That's a Seaman joke bait. Good for a movie title, I suppose, people wouldn't have 1\5th of a brain to figure out what is the movie about otherwise, but for the movie to end with him accepting the name ""Aquaman"", a moniker given by hell knows whom, when he clearly has a title... Again, I suppose the target audience wouldn't understand what ""Ocean Master"" stands for.<br/><br/>Speaking of target audience, I guess the shareholders at DC figured that DC has only one set of powers - the As-Man. So no matter who that is - Cyborg, Batman, Wooden Woman, Aquaman - all heroes need to be some sort of bullet-proof, need to be crushed into buildings and stuff, need to occasionally bleed, need to fly and be super fast. Sure, Aquaman doesn't fly or run. But somehow the only identifier that the movie sort of happened underwater - was the visual background. Otherwise it's absolutely, 101% no different from ... Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. People talk, things fly, sounds are heard, you know, bullets, battles, physics and all that. So, yes, Aquaman is about as original as Drax. Okay, scratch that. Drax is a memelord and an actually good character. Aquaman is just Jason Momoa, and his enemy is just Patrick Wilson.<br/><br/>Maybe in a few years - DC would learn to flesh out their characters. Plots. To imagine heroes with more abilities than virtual invulnerability and lasers out of their eyes. Maybe origin stories would have some moments, where the audience would feel something for their heroes, when heroes do actually incredible things. Instead of pulling the sword from the stone. Until then - Seaman is a decent movie to download, worthy of some popcorn and IMAX. But it's not something to write home about. People, who praise it... clearly have abyss-bottom low expectations for DC movies and, in DCEU, ignoring the Dark Knight trilogy - yes, Aquaman is definitely the best movie so far. Sadly, a hero in town is only a commoner in a city, and most people live in cities..."

"s-maniatopoulos","8","0","0","6 March 2019"," Very entertaining
","DC has finally decided not to take its filmmaking endeavors too seriously. Though the film does not follow the successful Marvel recipe of laughs and explosions, it still manages to entertain by combining different genres: the Atlantis scenes remind a Space Opera. The plot (a quest for the King's trident) is a successful combinations of Lord of the Rings and (on occasion) Indiana Jones movies. How can these different genres be combined? All one needs is an inventive and intelligent director.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very entertaining movie and compared to all other DC titles, it clearly stands out as their finest yet, up there with Wonder Woman, and in my opinion, this one is even better. Mr Wan proves he is a top tier director, as he successfully combines different cinematic elements with seamless grace.<br/><br/>In his extremely apt hands, Aquaman is a long and fun journey, that has nothing to do with the terrible and gloomy DC Universe, as captured in the Snyder movies.<br/><br/>I had given up in DC; I thought Wonder Woman was the fortunate mistake. Aquaman changes the expectations. It seems there may be some hope for DC's cinematic future, after all.<br/><br/>On a final note, the cast is generally good. Momoa carries the movie successfully, which to me was a surprise after his abysmal performance in Conan. The only big mistake of the movie is that it lacks a convincing villain. Wilson was clearly miscast, I imagine under the misapprehension that the actor playing the part should slightly remind us of his mother. A bulkier and meaner looking actor would make the rivalry between him and Momoa more interesting.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, does it really matter that much? Nobody expects Aquaman to lose. Still, next time please try not to have Momoa trade punches with Remi Malek.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Even if you are not thrilled, you will be entertained. DC's Aquaman is a nicely structured action/sci-fi/fantasy/adventure (!) with impressive visuals, excellent direction, and a sense of originality."

-- throwing half a torpedo on the ground and nothing happens<br/><br/>There have been many other mistakes in just a few minutes but i tried to keep a my observation count at 3 , and all this mistakes takes you out of the movie as there is to much fantasy in the movie and any law of physics are just nonexistent .
A good movie will anchor it self to a type of reality but here they decided to go with fantasy and i understand its a superhero movie but superhero or not there are things that just do not work."

","Aquaman is just the next comic book hero movie to come along that nobody in particular asked for. Part of the underwhelming DC universe its a surprise that this movie was released based on the bad reviews of so many of the DC universe cannon. It was a strange decision to release the Justice League movie which was an ensemble cast before each of the individual characters had their own movies released.
Back to Aquaman. The basic story is that Aquamans mother (Nicole Kidman) is cast out of her underwater kingdom and is taken in by a lighthouse keeper, played by Temuera Morrison. Fast forward and Aquaman is born and his mother is dragged away by some angry Aquaworld police in space uniforms. This sets the tone for the movie as it seems that any time we have any relative quiet, something explodes. This a repeated theme throughout which begins to seem laughable on repetition. Another odd motif is the use of shouting. Not people shouting in arguments using actual words, just AAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHH for no real reason. Trust me this happens. Although this is supposed to be an underwater story it really looks like a sci-fi set in space with lazers, space ships and space suits. At one point it actually looks like Tron Legacy and even sounds like the Tron Legacy soundtrack, this cant have been a mistake?
As for the actual storyline its quite hard to keep up as it seems to bounce around quite a bit, there is a subplot about an evil pirate who is out for revenge against Aquaman called Manta, but he should really be called Frog Helmet due to his ridiculous costume. Watching the movie you basically forget he exists until BOOOM, another explosion and there he is. I warned you about the Booms.
Despite a few well known faces the acting is quite poor, Aquamans is case in point, he seems to chew his words and it looks like the only reason he got the role was his looks. His jokes and pretty much all of the jokes in the movie fall flat.
Some of the visuals are impressive but its a 95% CGI movie and despite the sheer amount of onscreen action its neither engaging or exciting. Its a very Zach Snyder type of movie, at times dark visuals with slow mo but a very hollow experience.
You could easily stick this on to watch while you tidy your house but I doubt that it would be enough to draw you in to make you give up the housework.
It can be interesting visually at times but with a messy script, zero emotional content, sub par acting and very little to remember after. Still, you will have managed to complete over two hours worth of housework with some flashing lights and loud noises for company."
"CountVladDracula","10","0","0","6 March 2019"," A pleasant surprise
","I just saw Aquaman. I liked it. Yes, he made a huge mistake in not showing mercy to that pirate in the beginning but it becomes apparent he had a chip on his shoulder because he thought his mother was dead and by the end of the movie he's learned to show mercy. It's like half scifi and half medieval / ancient Greek with some Game of Thrones elements and it has some nice visuals. I also love that his parents reunite at the end. This is what a DC movie should be. Action, drama, and hope. Not that darkity, dark, dark nonsense Zack Snyder was pushing. Also Mera is a well developed character here. This is probably the best depiction of Mera I've seen."

","I think we need to take a step back and look at how the comics portray Aquaman; he shown as a magical creature who can talk to fish and ride them like surfboards and whatever - and surely the people behind this film would want to make Aquaman as close to the comics as possible. However, such a character would be a joke compared to the dark brooding universe DC typically is associated with. It would be too silly to have such a character and try to somehow make him as cool as Batman, instead the filmmakers tried to make this a cheesy as possible and it works! It's has similarities to corny children's cartoons and doesn't take itself seriously. It's refreshing to see a light-hearted film like this and I really recommend it - just don't expect something as dark and deep as Batman."

I went with a group of 13 ladies the first time (My husband didn't want to listen to the banter of that) and he and I went the following week after I promised him that I thought he would like it.

","DC may never admit it, but Aquaman has too much in common with Taika Waititi's Thor Ragnarok: the overpowered protagonist destined to be king - although he does not wish to rule a realm that mixes mysticism and technology - needs to dethrone a sibling with expansionist ideas, aided by a female warrior / supermodel way more mature than him, having strong colors and 80's inspired soundtrack as a backdrop. There are no great performances, but the cast works the script well enough and the film amuses the audience, standin beside Wonder Woman as a enterteinment far superior to Batman v Sperman or Justice League, although that's something not really that hard to achieve."

","Preface: I love DC. Marvel is good, but I love the characters of DC. I love the dark, serious tones and the emotional depth of the backstories. BvS (ultimate edition) is my favorite DC movie. I loved Justice League (ending needed more work), Man of Steel was far too long, but good, and Wonder Woman was indeed phenomenal.<br/><br/>Review: C'mon guys, this movie is cheesy, silly, overly flamboyant and utterly forgettable. It's most like watching a high-budget episode of the power rangers. The main villain literally says ""Call me, Black Manta"", and wears an oversized helmet looking like a Power Rangers or old-school Godzilla villian. The dialogue is cringy in many places, the Atlantians are completely shallow, every villian is cheesy (""Call me Ocean Master!""), the plot is disjointed and aloof. This movie sucks. I struggled to get through it and I will not watch it again. It is predictable in every sense.
Oh, and I think we can see that Jason Momoa is a great secondary actor, but definitely cannot lead a feature film.<br/><br/>Redeeming points?
i wanted to love this movie just because I love DC much more than Marvel, but I just don't. The good parts are that the CGI is much better than Superman's mustache in Justice League. In fact, the CGI/live action mix for both woman fights are nearly seemless and very enjoyable. The rooftop running sequence was also very well done. The movie is also very colorful (not always a good thing - see Ocean Master's costume).<br/><br/>TL;DR
Anything over 7 stars is likely a paid review, or a DC super-fanboy, or a James Wan fanboy. Honest DC fans will have to admit this is a low point. Bring back Zack Snyder."

"strassermarlies","6","0","0","16 February 2019"," Another mediocre superhero movie
","People who complain about the cheesy dialogue and missing story, often say things like ""this is for children"" or ""this is like a cartoon"". The thing is children shows like Peppa Pig (I watch it with my 3 years old nephew) or Ladybug (I watch it with my 6 years old niece) are hundred million times more mature and more suspenseful than the average superhero movie. Not to mention that the many animation movies out there have some of the best storytelling you can find nowadays. So why Hollywood? Why does it have to be so ... dumb? I don't get it. I'm a writer myself. How hard can it be to write some good dialogues? I was never a DC fan, but I always thought the DC Universe would be more mature and darker. Maybe the whole atmosphere is ""darker"" but sure the stories aren't more mature.
So talking about Aquaman: I like the character and the actor. The movie was not terrible, but it was like 99% CGI (even the hair in the water was animated), some superhero things happened, there were a lot of fights going on and yeah ... he became the king of Atlantis. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm writing this review. I just wonder why Hollywood cannot make a blockbuster movie with a good and intriguing story. Do good stories don't sell anymore? It's just sad."

","Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people -- and then the surface world. Standing in his way is Aquaman, Orm's half-human, half-Atlantean brother and true heir to the throne. With help from royal counselor Vulko, Aquaman must retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep. (Credit: Google)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm not a fan of DC films for the most part, but I accepted my friend's invitation to go see this in theatres. It looks great, it's visually stunning and well-acted, but it's a bit of a tedious experience. It runs about 20 minutes too long and the pacing is highly inconsistent. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of action, but even when it's throwing all that action in your face, it's never truly exciting, I prefer Marvel films because they know how to properly balance everything. The acting definitely can't be faulted. Jason Momoa is a very good Aquaman. He's got charisma to spare and was the main reason I was able to tolerate sitting in the theatre for as long as I did. Amber Heard oozes sex appeal and does a great job as Mera, Nicole Kidman is always a treat to watch, and this time is no different. The always dependable, Willem Dafoe is excellent as Aquaman's mentor. My only gripe is Patrick Wilson's performance. He was a dull villain, in my opinion. It was also great to see Dolph Lundgren have a decent part in a major film once again.<br/><br/>
This movie is not horrible, but it's not something I'm ever going to go out of my way to see again either. It did well at the box office, and I've read a sequel is in development. Hopefully, the sequel is more entertaining. Jason Momoa deserves it.<br/><br/>6/10"

My bottom line is that it was a fine movie, one that doesn't hinder DC's continuing effort to make movies. It does feature some strong performances (Momoa, Heard, Kidman, Wilson), but there's way too many myths and legends crammed in. In fact, there were times when I felt like I was watching an Indiana Jones movie than a superhero movie. There were more Maguffins in this movie than there were human actors. Also, while one certainly must suspend one's disbelief for these movies, it's counterintuitive to proclaim certain rules for a new (to the audience) setting and then either ignore those rules or break them outright. It's also not a good idea for a hero or heroine to forget they have certain abilities until the plot says it's time to wrap up the scene And let's try to ignore the cliches, while we're at it.

In fact, all the original content was used in the trailer, and the rest of the film felt like obligatory filler. That being said, the filler was pretty good, and there's a reason why super hero films are so popular.

","Aquaman did not live up to the hype. I'm not sure why I had high hopes for another DC film. You would think I might have learned my lesson, after the last few let-downs. I didn't, and I was thoroughly disappointed with this shell of a movie.<br/><br/>The story is generic and boring. The acting is unconvincing and even comical at times. The CGI is so overwhelming and obvious, that it distracts the audience. The fighting/war sequences are not choreographed well, and the conflict at the end of the movie, didn't even make sense.<br/><br/>I love superhero movies, and am not a stranger to movies that require a little imagination, in order to digest.

","Aquaman movie in DC universe reminds me of Black Panther in MCU. High Box office number for a flashy movie. The issue is however if you are a true comic fan you will walk a way with mix feelings.<br/><br/>I'm don't know DC as much as I know Marvel but I had few obvious problems with the movie.. Big one was the power ranger costumes of Atlatis and then somewhat subpar script and acting. To be honest I would rate Justice League more than Aquaman any day.. At least Justice league carried more DC essence in the movie. You can clearly see that Aquaman is made for better entertainment experience than focusing on DC attributes. Somewhat similar to recent Thor Ragnarok, Black Panter etc in MCU where they were really pop cone movies made for general audiences to talk away with a relaxed feeling.<br/><br/>End of the day studios need to make $$ and this movie is made to do just that. DC's darker attributes didn't work so well to attract a larger audience in any recent movies. You can't achieve big box office numbers by trying to impress the comic fan base. You need everyone to watch the movie. So, for that you need a movie with good CGI, flashy story line (not necessarily a good script), good action and happy ending.<br/><br/>I rate Aquaman 6.5. It is watchable and entertaining at most parts... But then as a comic fan I walk away little disappointed."

"srdjan_veljkovic","5","0","0","8 February 2019"," Not interesting
","It's not boring all the time. It's actually boring just a few times. But, most of the other time it's simply not interesting.<br/><br/>It has many flaws. It's way too long. It looks like a not-so-good video-game. Amber Heard is past her prime, at times she actually looks bad - and has not learned acting skills to compensate. Temuera Morisson's ""digital deaging"" is terrible. It was supposed to give us Jango Fett, instead we got some overweight strange-looking middle-aged guy. The story is way too ""all over the place"" and derivative (of Black Panther movie, Dune and bunch of others). There's no explanation for Mera's powers of water manipulation, which nobody else demonstrates. Most of the humor is pretty flat as is most of the acting (it's not only Amber). Most of the stuff that's going on does not make sense, even for a comic book movie.<br/><br/>But, it's not terrible, not even really bad. There are good jokes here and there, most of the time it's not boring, it carries through and doesn't fall apart at the end. Feminism isn't too crazy. Sure, Mera saves and guides our hero in ways that don't make sense, including beating up several commandos, but at least she doesn't beat Aquaman and his brother up. The Sicily segment is nice, its action sequences are the only ones that make much sense and are interesting - hell, even Amber looks decent here and almost really acts.<br/><br/>There are worse super-hero-origin movies, but, this one, all things considered, is not worth a watch.<br/><br/>Probably the best joke comes at the start, when Nicole Kidman, finding herself above water for the first time, sees the terrible device that is the TV set and immediately destroys it as the biggest threat. But, there are a few later on. Just don't get annoyed at the many one-liners that Aquaman tries to pull (only a few of which actually work)."

","Following the marvel way and encouraged by the success of dark knight trilogy, DC established dceu in 2013 with man of steel which I found slow and boring but was a decent success. Then came another boring film dawn of justice and pathetic suicide squad. After that came the first female superhero film wonder woman which worked wonders for dceu. But those wonders didn't last after the release of justice league, a blatant copy of avengers.
And now, dceu comes with aquaman who we saw in justice league (but I was wondering where he was as only focus was on wonder woman flash and Superman).
Aquaman narrates the origin of Arthur curry half human half atlantean. In the first few minutes it captures your attention, with excellent action scene of Nicole Kidman. After then the film takes you to a visual treat. Jason momoa mass intro, underwater scenes, Atlanta kingdom, fight between Arthur and his half brother, escaping from Atlanta to get the golden trident, the superb action scene in Italy, Arthur getting the Trident and the final battle all these does not let you take off your eyes at the screen. Only drawback is story is not that great and slightly similar to Thor 1. Aquaman was my best 3d experience. On the whole, aquaman is an absolute visual treat which not even a marvel film provided me. DC must concentrate for the time being only on solo superhero films. Hats off to director James wan."

","Another late screening for a film released last year, I wasn't dying to see it but had heard great and exciting things about the film and caught a late screening with my best friend to which we cackled and laughed throughout almost the entire film and I have no idea if this was good or bad.<br/><br/>This film was laughably cringy. The dialogue and delivery by actors was at times awful and head shakingly poor. The slow motion and L'Oreal esque style zooms on the femme fatales were so laughable.<br/><br/>The story was there I guess, a sort of swash buckling adventure film. Momoa was Momoa and not really a character. Amber Heard was much better then her shameful appearance in Justice League although some plot points seemed to be created with Arthur not even knowing her name despite meeting each other before and the two seemingly having a history.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were surprisingly poor. Willem Dafoe did nothing and you could tell he was immensely bored. Nicole Kidman was bad and I hate writing that as I LOVE her. Her American accent which she couldn't even hold was shocking as well as Temuera Morrison's accent he attempted to put on here and there.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson was suitably over the top and chewing the scenery and he managed to make me laugh with his long drawn out war cries.<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren was there I guess and his third act character shift was so poor. Djimon Hounsou, Ludi Lin and Randall Park were not in the film enough to make an impact. Graham McTavish was probably the least worst, with his suitable powering performance. Michael Beach whom I also enjoy had some disgustingly cringy lines as did his son played by Yahya Abdul Mateen II who portrayed fan favourite Black Manta.<br/><br/>The effects at times were great and at other times horrible. The cinematography was decent. The music was decent if not forgettable. Some music choices were so bad, SO bad that they had to be pranking the audience, especially that scene in Italy, we were just laughing our heads off it was unbelievable. This film is so unbelievably cringy that it makes one wonder if what they are viewing is even real.<br/><br/>Lord knows how Julie Andrews and John Rhys Davies got into this mess.<br/><br/>The imagination was great, props to Wan especially with character designs, creatures and weapons etc.<br/><br/>I can't express enough how laughable the film is and this is what worries me as since I was laughing, I technically enjoyed the film at it's own expense so I really have no clue what to rate it. Yes it was enjoyable with the action sequences and frankly superb uses of the long take in those scenes but it was also so hilariously poor.<br/><br/>The dialogue which is at times was hard to hear was so expected that I was literally guessing the lines that would come next. Shameful. Another small gripe I had was the fact that the inhabitants of an underwater kingdom had American accents, like really?<br/><br/>Everything is over directed, Wan must've been saying on production that everything needs to be bigger, sillier more ridicilious as if this was his only chance to make a superhero film (which it doesn't even feel like).<br/><br/>Cringy dialogue, cringy close ups and cringy delivery makes Aquaman a laughably defective but still somehow entertaining few hours.<br/><br/>It's a must see rubbish film, like Clash of the Titans or Prince of Persia"

","Aquaman looks a million dollars without ever looking real. We can see the film has a mega-budget, but at the same time, unlike many of the Marvel Universe films, it just doesn't look real, even during the rare times in the film where the action is on land and not in the sea. You always have the very real sense that what you are watching, was primarily played out against a green screen.<br/><br/>The cast do their very best, whilst being saddled with some uninspiring dialogue, especially many of the Atlantean characters who just sound unintentionally (I'm sure) pompous. Jason Momoa is fine as the title character and Amber Heard is appealing as Princess Mera, his developing undersea love interest. But I would have dearly loved to have seen their characters, as well as those of Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison for instance play out a few more scenes on dry land.<br/><br/>The best I can say about the production is that it is imaginative and very creatively put together in a cross-generic fashion. But herein lies one of the major problems with the movie ... its weirded out storyline. Much of this so called origin tale, seems to be an excuse to create a hybrid of styles, which I personally had great difficulty in subscribing too. The whole idea of 7 civilisations living under the sea, with advanced technology and amongst mutant species of fish and the like, which land-based society has no idea about is just bizarre (to be kind).<br/><br/>Imagine a mix of Star Wars, with The Abyss and Clash of the Titans. Yes, Star Wars; at the bottom of the sea. If you think that'll rock your boat, you'll probably love Aquaman. Me? Much as I like a good super hero film, Aquaman just doesn't fit the bill. I'll take The Avengers before this sort of cartoonish stuff any day. The action is better choreographed, the villains more serious, the dialogue is far more consistently funny and things do seemingly appear to be occurring in the real world."

Their was a lot of cgi in this movie, maybe just a tad too much. Lots of fighting and under water scenes. The story line is about the same as every other superhero movie, so the lazy writers must have had hangovers or just didn't care when they were writing this because their was nothing new or extravagant in it. Basically all the main characters were casted with all the wrong people except for Jason Momoa who played Aquaman perfectly! I give him a 10/10. Amber heard scenes made me want a refund. She gets a 2/10 and I'm being very generous. Patrick Wilson was acting a little over the top and it was hard to ever take him seriously he gets a 6/10. Nicole Kidman started the movie with poor acting as well but surprised me towards the end by finishing very strong. (I think it was because she was standing next to amber heard and, a turnip acts better than her) she get a 8/10. William Defoe player a lesser of a part than I had hoped and wished to see him a little more within the story. He always gets very ""into"" his characters and performs stunningly.

"calm22","9","0","0","18 January 2019"," Can CGI and Audio Keep Aquaman Afloat?
","To say that superhero movies are liked in this day and age is an astronomical
understatement. No matter what realm or studio these heroes come from, people are lining up to see every movie starring a supernatural hero, DC Universe (DCU) has been riding this wave for some time and while they may have fallen off a little bit here with their newest movie Aquaman, there are still a lot of things to hang in there for.
The film starts off by introducing two characters through Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Moana) narration, his father, Tom Curry (Temeura Morrison) and his mother, Queen Atlanta (Nicole Kidman) and how their meeting and falling in love and ultimately more important the child they had were never supposed to be. Then after a few years have passed Queen Atlanta's old life catches up to her as she was part of an arranged marriage in Atlantis so in order to protect her family she must return to fulfill her part in the marriage. After this, the movie zips ahead 20 years and viewers can see that Arthur has grown up to be a mammoth of a man who possess special powers thanks to his mother's genetics and we quickly and violently learn that he is using these powers to help those in need.
The dialogue was lacking and in spots, the humor was rather dry and short-lived, the poor script causes there to be moments where something seems to be lost from the scene because of how it seems the words are just thrown in. It seems the scriptwriters tried to be funny in situations that called for something serious or smooth and this leads to a choppy sounding dialogue that leaves viewers wondering if the scriptwriters didn't read things over before they submitted it. An example of this is when Arthur dramatically breaks his way into a submarine then gives a sheepish grin and says, ""Permission to come aboard?"" The screenwriters couldn't have come up with a less original quote, causing everyone to shake their heads as there is nothing more predictable that could have been said and yet they kept it. Also, there is a major lacking of back story for Black Manta, he plays a major role in the film and yet we know next to nothing about his past. This leaves Manta to be a shallow husk of a potentially wonderful character and gives the viewers almost no reason to even like him let alone cheer for him.
With over five different studios working on the CGI for this film, it's not surprising the filmmakers were able to pull off the realistic water effects and seemingly-accurate battle scenes. The way that they made the fight scenes not only look very real but also had to work with transitioning from land to water shots quickly and there was no scene disruption which allowed the viewers to stay focused on the movie. The CGI in this movie is comparable if not better then almost any other action movie out today, some examples could be Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Justice League, and with all of these, advanced CGI is utilized to create an almost undeniable reality.
Something that really stood out to me even as I cringed through the dialogue was how the movie used its audio. I really enjoyed how they used not only songs during action pieces or peaceful pans over beautiful scenery but just the simple non-diegetic music that helps to deepen the moment. Looking back now I can count more than a few times where I got goosebumps leading up to or in a scene because of the audio.
After diving into the underwater world of Aquaman viewers can see that though there were some rough patches, overall this movie was rather smooth sailing. When you look at the animation combined with the audio you get one great movie and though the dialogue can be rough I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun and beautiful looking action movie."

","It's always a pleasure to see a studio recognize their flaws and do their best to correct the mistakes that caused them so much heartache in the past. With a very enjoyable Man of Steel setting a tone that would be completely overdone by the time Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice hit theatres, it was only a matter of time before they decided to change it up. Suicide Squad was financially successful, but admittedly a step in the wrong direction. Justice League was a mess of a movie, but the saving grace of the franchise will always be known as Wonder Woman. Loved by critics and fans across the globe, DC and Warner Brothers decided to steer the ship in a new direction, taking a step into the past and creating origin stories for the characters we've only briefly seen. It worked with Wonder Woman, and I'm happy to say that I believe it's also working with Aquaman.<br/><br/>Being very, very loosely tied to the previous films (almost not at all), Aquaman sees Arthur Curry go from an infant to a full-grown man. Being a half-breed from both land in our world and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, he comes to the realization that he's the rightful heir to the throne. Challenged by his only brother who despises his existence, this creates tension amongst the people. With some very likable side characters and others who will more than likely have repercussions in future installments, there's a lot to like about this film in terms of character and story, which is what I was expecting to find lacking.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa once again demands the audience's attention as he completely invests himself in this wacky character. His charisma is easily one of the highlights of this film and his many journeys with Amber Heard's Mera are a blast to watch. This is a film filled with tons of adventure and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a lot of it. It's visually stunning (for the most part) and I found that made it the biggest looking film of the franchise in terms of scope. Although it does borrow from pretty much every movie you've ever seen, it mixes in enough new content to differentiate itself from others.<br/><br/>As it seems from my review, I had a blast watching Aquaman, but it's by no means a perfect movie, even by the standards set by this franchise. Patrick Wilson plays King Orm, Arthur's younger brother and although his motivations are clear, his portrayal is quite over-the-top. I personally took issue with this, as he's in quite a bit of the film. The disposable villains of this film actually have quite a bit of depth and backstory but are highly under-utilized. I felt like they were part of a set-up for something bigger in the future. Without ruining it, the scenes where these characters are used are very well-done, so it's a very minor flaw in my opinion. There are many small issues I have with the movie as a whole, but in retrospect, they're all nitpicks.<br/><br/>In the end, Aquaman embraces the fact that the premise of an underwater city is ridiculous and runs with that from beginning to end. From giant sea battles to genuine heart-to-heart moments between characters that stood out to me, this is a film that has every I like about good blockbusters. While it's not one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, it's a joy to watch and easily in the discussion for as one of the best movies of this franchise. If you're a fan of comic-based films, I'd definitely suggest giving this one a shot."
"xcver-1","6","0","0","18 January 2019"," A good to watch movie that has some flaws behind the facade
","So first off I really enjoyed the movie, especially after some of the other horrendous DC offerings. However after the shiny front there are some things that disturb me, because they are a bit strange. I think technically the film is good although a bit too much CGI. Here are some of the quarrels I have with it:<br/><br/>The motives of the first villain that is introduced. So first off why are the Pirates shooting the whole submarine up (to potentially reduce its ability to work?) including all the seamen inside? It would seem a lot easier to use some gas, since they are all wearing masks anyhow (except the named characters of course). Also the very valid argument Acquaman makes that they killed all these innocents and now complain that he does not help them. I feel very little compassion for this villain and it seems forced.<br/><br/>While the underwater visuals are stunning to look it, some stuff is just over top. For instance...underwater waterfalls?<br/><br/>Fake looking movements. Some of the CGI enhanced movements just look irritatingly fake, for instance when someone jumps in the water and accelerates mid-air. It just feels physically very wrong.<br/><br/>So we are looking at a potential war on a global scale, yet the rest of the justice league does nothing?<br/><br/>Wanting to prevent the deaths of millions doesn't prevent Acquaman from charging in with the Trench and killing everything in the path.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, still enjoyed the movie. But how someone can give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating is beyond me. 10 should mean, that this is the best movie in this type of movies. Acquaman is enjoyable, which at least should give it a 6 or 7 but it is in no way unique or phantastically acted etc."

","This film reminded me of almost all other action films including Transformers. It is definitely a blockbuster film aimed at getting us to the theater!<br/><br/>This is not a film to watch because the acting is good or the plot is great or because you are a serious film buff. This is the type of film you go to see when you just want pure entertainment with lots of special effects and visuals. Aquaman was not so great, in my opinion, as a comic.<br/><br/>The film's first scenes made me gag a bit at the over abundance of makeup on the actors to make them look younger. They almost looked like dolls and the acting was quite dull. It gets better once you are past that.<br/><br/>But again, it's a blockbuster film aimed to satisfy your eyes with big colorful visuals on a big screen. I gave it a decent rating because it was just what I expected when I went to see it. I really doubt anyone expects this film to be a masterpiece film worthy of filmmaking awards and great acting kudos. Good for the kid inside."

This is a popular and simple story about the growth of superheroes.<br/><br/>James Wan, a great director, was invited to direct Aquaman. James Wan made up for the loopholes in the narrative of the film with exquisite pictures and exciting fights. He also paved the way for the bitter enmity of the hero's prehistory.

","Aquaman is an entertaining movie about the Oedipus complex. Two sons are separated from their mother. As a result, they are totally desperate. One son (Aquaman) blames Atlantis for his loss; the other son (King Orm) blames humans. He is desperate to the extent that he wants to destroy the world.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, both sons reunite with their mother and it seems they are going to live happily ever after. I think this is a rather superficial ending. Both Aquaman and King Orm needed their mum when they were growing up. Not only they never fully experienced a (semi)healthy family life, but, most likely, they also projected all of their frustrations on the loss of mother. In other words, for both of them, mum symbolises both 'mother figure' and also everything that they lack in their lives (e.g. I could achieve this or that only if I had a mother). We know Atlanna (the mother) can't fill these roles now.<br/><br/>In a more realistic world, I bet after few days both Aquaman and king Orm are going to feel miserable again because ""no one ever fully recovers from the sadomasochism of their childhood""(1).<br/><br/>(1) Adam Phillips, Psychotherapist and literary critic"

","The most noticeable issue with it as a film is that it takes itself way too seriously for the B-movie level dialogue, story, and acting to be taken as tongue-in-cheek, particularly the performances by Patrick Wilson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, and Nicole Kidman. The story is also not very engaging and doesn't give you much reason to care about the characters, so the third act's big reveal just feels like a dues ex machina to give the end of the film some kind of emotional weight. There were definitely some fun action sequences and a couple of funny moments, but nothing about this movie made me interested in seeing more Aquaman movies, or the others in its extended universe."

"Phemt666","6","0","0","12 January 2019"," Entertaining but with a big plot hole
","Aquaman it's a nice action movie that completely embrace the Marvel Cinematic Universe style.
The movie is fun and entertaining, but the characters are somehow inconsistent (Nicole Kidman is a little ludicrous with her wig and acting) and there is a big plot hole: the events take place about a year after Justice League (like it's said during a scene), and here comes the question ""where is Superman""? There is no point in fearing a war with Atlantis if there is superman. The movie could end after one phone call ""Hello Clark? It's me, Arthur... Yeah, I'm fine... Listen, can you kick my brother's ass? Ok, thank you, see you later"".
Ok, maybe Arthur is too proud and doesn't want to seek help, but after the first warning from Atlantis (tsunami and so on) I think that superman could just go above Atlantis, use his heat vision and boil everyone...
If you watch Aquaman with this in mind it's hard to enjoy it, because there is no sense at all in what is happening, but if you can pretend that Superman does not exist it's a nice movie."

","At a young age, Arthur Carry discovers that he has the power to communicate with sea creatures and discovers he is only half human. Arthur also learns about his mother who was a Queen of an underwater kingdom known as ""Atlantis"".<br/><br/>Arthur aka Aquaman is now fully grown and has been called to return to his kingdom to claim his throne and accept his destiny. Arthur will now also be hunted by a new ruler known as ""King Orm"" (Patrick Wilson), who desires to destroy Aquaman and rule the earth.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the film Justice League, you will know that the actor Jason Momoa is fantastic as the character of Aquaman. Once again, Jason Momoa is easily the best element of this new superhero instalment. I also enjoyed how this film provided further character development in Aquaman's past and upbringing. I also enjoyed seeing his new enemies. Aquaman is a hero who has awesome skills but also isn't perfect. He is a hero who has faults which I feel many audience members will enjoy connecting with. I enjoyed seeing how Aquaman is a rather humourus character and as an actor, it's obvious that Jason Momoa is simply enjoying playing the character. I personally feel he was somewhat born to play Aquaman.<br/><br/>As far as visuals go, this would easily be DC's best looking film. Sure, my mind tell me this is mostly digital effects and green screen, but I cannot deny how good this film looks and sounds. Visually this is a stunning film. The film's audio track is also fun, snappy and somewhat beautiful. The film's soundtrack reminded me of what we saw in Thor: Ragnorok, but still differs in its own way.<br/><br/>As a plot I don't feel this is something that differs too much to what we have already seen in films. But! you know what, I still found this film fun and rather enjoyable. Previously, the highest rated film from DC from me was Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman delivered a great story and a dramatic film, but its jokes somewhat suffered. Here we now have what I feel is a simple plot with colourful fun, action and jokes. Some viewers may feel the duration is a slight stretch, but given this also includes Aquaman's origin story, I felt this was to be expected.<br/><br/>Overall, once again DC has delivered a sucessful superhero. This movie is brainless, fun, colourful and not to mention... humourous. Jason Momoa is fantastic as Aquaman and brings a great addition to the DC world of superheros. While the plot might be something we have seen before, I still had a blast watching this film and look forward to what's to come next from DC.<br/><br/>8.0/10

","AQUAMAN - T²C² (tonguetocheekcelluloid )
In this sea of the comic book heroes it's getting tough to do something different. So I guess that crazy idea got abandoned. The lead, Mamoa, delivers his lines fluidly. He perfectly personifies the smarmy, slightly vulnerable, affable, wise cracking, confident, charismatic ... and somehow critically, not arrogant, character. That's hard to do.
Willem, the foe, of immorality spits out evil faster than a Goblin shark. Dolphen Lundgren plays the wise, yet stable voice of reason to the goofy bad Prince (Patrick Wilson) I think Nicole Kidman thought she was in Benjamin Button (wth?)
In terms of plot and story line... it was Marvelous. There was a misunderstood, much more fit, kind, outcast of a prince with great morals who was trying to return to a kingdom left behind by a missing or deceased parent. And it's not like the body building demi-god like, much more charismatic brother character was looking for an almighty hammer. He was looking for a trident. Not even close. They're different shapes. And it's not like the bad power mongering cruel, impossible to like and moreover, easy to hate, sibling of a brother, turned around emotionally and became a good guy. The writers however did great with the thin plot given. They cleverly used hydrology to create some cool water related concepts, such as unique weaponry. There were some interesting original concepts in here that I won't spoil . The CGI was awesome. The only blurring was on the lines of reality. As they would say in Akronym Ohio... IMHO3DIMAX is the only way to see this movie. (ya I know;) It shows up great in this format and really accentuates the production effort"

","Aquaman has more going for it than most of the latest contributions from DC.<br/><br/>I'd say Wonder Woman has a clear upper hand on Aquaman, and I do not for the life of me understand anyone saying otherwise. But Aquaman is a well litt hope for the DC universe, and I definately want to see more of him! The good:<br/><br/>Arthus/Aquaman is a cool guy. Straight out, and hands down. His character also has a great backstory, and great development in this movie. In my opinion. And I must say that DC did him justice (no pun intended) by the way they presented this backstory. I believe Batman Vs Superman went a little too deep, and too far back with a lot of backstory/buildup - but Aquaman did it just right for me. Deep, emotional, thorough, but not wasting anyone's time. Just the important stuff that hits you in the heart.<br/><br/>Then there is action, cinematography, CGI, colors and all of the above - and the movie is pure eye candy. Maybe not the coolest fighting scenes, but definitely cool fighting scenes. Some original camera handling/rotations made for a nice little twist to certain close combat scenes. When it is not close combat, it's underwater Star Wars. I... think I can dig that.<br/><br/>The bad:
I'm sure this is all very true to the original material and all, but I'm not all that into having 2 bad guys in one movie. Not like this anyhow. One of them was great, the other was not (hint: it's Black Manta). A massive cliche if you ask me, and (and watch this get down voted by the comic book nerds! :O). For the record, I do recognize that he did play a significant role in the plot development. But I still didn't like him - so there!
To me, Black Manta got the same effect on this movie as Team Rockets gets in every pokemon episode (if you get that reference).<br/><br/>Furthermore, while the plot is good ""per se"", it is utterly without plot TWISTS, so you will probably never go ""Whaaaaaat?!"" anytime during this movie. You'll predict most of the movie plot development and ending by the time 20 minutes have passed, and you'll most likely be correct in all your major predictions. But this stuff is totally possible to roll along with and enjoy despite of, and most movies these days are just like this. So, I'm not pulling too many points because of it.<br/><br/>If there is one more tiny setback I feel the need to mention mention, is that I find some of the humor misplaced. The movie has good humor, and strong emotional scenes, both frequent, and well done. Separately. But sometimes the movie just missed my emotional state - which itself is responsible for putting me in. I'm brought half way to tears, then served a joke that feels inappropriate. And visa versa. It's not like this the whole movie, but enough times to for me to make note of it.<br/><br/>All in all: 7 / 10 is GOOD. It's Aquaman, he's cool, and its all pretty. Many good actors btw - I forgot the mention that. It's worth the watch, but no minds will be blown out of the park."

","I will explain why I have the score I did after each recorded score.
Visuals-9
Most astounding cgi I have seen in a long time possibly even first right after Planet Valerian.
But I feel it was a tad by much on the cgi.
The whole battle at the end was the most beautiful cgi battle I've ever seen. I felt engaged and wondering who was going to win in all the chaos( obviously I knew Aquaman would win but bear with me.) It was chaos and I love chaos.<br/><br/>Plot-4
Hero has to endure a treacherous journey to obtain an item that will ensure victory in the end. Honestly, aqua man should've just challenged him to a battle on land and he should've killed him. That is how the movie should've gone but I digress.<br/><br/>Soundtrack-9<br/><br/>Very awesome Opera at scenes of intense action and quick music during times of escape.<br/><br/>Speech-3 Oh god this was horrible. At some points of the movie I couldn't hear Mamoa speak because of the action and music and at other times he doesn't speak clearly. They should've done a retake.<br/><br/>Fight scenes-9<br/><br/>Awesome fighting with the tridents but they seemed to carry on way to long. The fights should've been 60-90 seconds long. Fights don't last that long. The action was really great though.<br/><br/>Love story-9 and 4<br/><br/>We'll start with the 9.
Tho old man and the Queen Atlanta was so heart touching to me. The old man had such a sad look in his eyes when she didn't come back. He went down to the docks for 20 years hoping she would come back and one day she did! At the end.<br/><br/>Now the 3<br/><br/>The love story between the Ginger and Aquaman felt so Forced and very fake. At some points you are able to tell that the actors were disinterested in the love story and it shows on camera.<br/><br/>Enemies-8 The enemies and the plot to start a war with us is very well executed by the director. The acting and the style that is shown made me feel that it was very well thought out.<br/><br/>BUT the enemy that was like a buffer to fighting King Orm was horrible. Aquaman should've just killed him when they were on the submarine along with his father.<br/><br/>Resolution<br/><br/>We all knew that Aquaman would win but he should've mopped his he floor with him in the 1 v 1 which should've been on land. Aquaman is obviously stronger and more talented.<br/><br/>My final score is 7

After every battle Aquaman was acting like a Power Ranger. Even the posing I am not kidding. I couldn't believe my eyes at some scenes. Purely disgusting...<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of superheroe movies but this was a disgrace.<br/><br/>The only thing that was above average was the CGI. Cool effects, some nice battles but not many, and awfully CORNY.<br/><br/>TLDR: This movie should not have more than 5 score but it seems there are a lot of bots and paid people in here. 2 and a half hours of wondering what is happening. 2 and a half hours of regret. I created an IMDB profile just to tell the truth. I have hated so many overrated movies and I desperately wanted to write reviews about them but it was never enough for me to create a profile. This was MORE than enough.... I didn't hear one happy person in the crowd after leaving. Not to say that 99% of the people stormed out before the final scene and it was obvious that they couldn't wait to get out ASAP... Don't waste your money!!!"

","Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.<br/><br/>""Aquaman"" (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It's reminiscent of ""Thor"" (2011) and ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make ""Aquaman"" 'thrilling,' but less compelling story-wise.<br/><br/>Still, it's very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur's mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public's generally weak perception of Aquaman.<br/><br/>The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).<br/><br/>GRADE: B/B-"
"TheVictoriousV","5","0","0","4 January 2019"," DC has achieved mediocrity and I applaud them. (Copied from myself with permission)
","This one's worth skipping.<br/><br/>Aquaman may yet be a beacon of hope for the DC Extended Universe. This one and Wonder Woman managed to get many superhero fans pumped, without needing to take too many cues from the Marvel Universe - which is a thing that other DC films have done, no matter how effectively one blinds oneself to that fact.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Aquaman is especially good, but at least it's acceptable - sans a few laughable VFX shots and Power Rangers-tier costumes. It is fundamentally competent, thus outranking the likes of Suicide Squad and Justice League. It does everything a movie about He Who Speaks With The Fish needs to do, which really isn't much.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa plays a half-human half-Atlantean prince, going by Arthur Curry on the streets and ""Aquaman"" on the underwater streets. Amber Heard is his love interested Mera, the daughter of the king of one of the Atlantis tribes (Dolph Lundgren). There's also Aquaman's evil brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), whose plan is to unite the underwater kingdoms to declare war on humanity. Willem Dafoe plays the typical old mentor (wearing his goofiest suit since Goblin) and Nicole Kidman is the Queen of Atlantis.<br/><br/>This, as you can surely tell, is pretty standard and un-extraordinary. And again, this is quite the step up from the bowel movements DC and Warner Bros. normally release. You have accomplished mediocrity and I applaud you. On some level it is complete.<br/><br/>Sitting in the director's chair this time around is James Wan, a man more at home in horror although not completely dreadful here, even if it goes without saying that this is more of a product than an art project. I wouldn't say this film exemplifies Wan's voice. He was just doin' his job. That said, the action is fairly well shot.<br/><br/>The cityscape of Atlantis is admittedly an interesting setting and probably the main reason to see the film. It's pretty, albeit no more groundbreaking than worlds like Pandora or the city ruled by King Triton. I'm glad DC fans have gotten something more promising, even if my own thumb points downward, but we'll see what this means for the future of the DCEU (recall that key actors have dropped out and people are more hyped for the Joker of another canon). There is some speculation that next year's Avengers finale will double as a finale for the persistent superhero film craze. They say that this might be what finally - FINALLY - kills the comic-book movie. I'm sorry we didn't get to Darkseid."

None of this was part of the story. It was pupil's entertainment and followed chronicle of batman vs superman and justice league.
If DC really wants to compete with Marvel then they need to focus on these aspects.

"sfrostman","8","0","0","30 December 2018"," Refreshing Nuance
","I've been a fan of Jason Momoa since his days as Ronon Dex on Stargate Atlantis. He has come a long way from those days.<br/><br/>After the DC disappointment that was Batman vs Superman this was refreshing! Momoa has made Aquaman his own. I enjoyed all the chemistry between the actors. Momoa especially used his signature humor to add that extra charm to Arthur Curry. I was blown away by performance of Patrick Wilson as Orm Marius. Patrick I've always found to have a great range as a performer.<br/><br/>The movie from beginning to end had great flow. I walked in with no expectations I found the movie to have excellent direction from James Wan right down to the music by Rupert Gregson- Williams. Your in for a real treat with this movie.<br/><br/>As far as flaws go it had some slow points that are to be expected. However the character building was quite excellent. I even really enjoyed a lot of the supporting characters as well. The film had a nuance a lot of super hero movies seem to lack.<br/><br/>If DC keeps to this kind of quality I look forward to many more great films. Hopefully they can translate this into a new Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned those movies were garbage. As fans we deserve better films, like Aquaman!"

","Aquaman was GREAT! Wonderful to see DC release a fun and bright movie! I enjoyed the vast majority, the only parts that could have been left behind on the cutting room floor was the ""Manta"" character.
So Manta and dear old dad are pirates. Murdering pirates. Yes, murderers. Aquaman saves what remains of the submariene's crew, but does not save Manta's dad from being stuck under heavy wreckage and imminent drowning. Manta then grunts under breath ""Aquaman, bad, must die""! And now, Aquaman is supposed to be someone we think of as a villain for this character and we are supposed to care he wants ""revenge"" for the death of his, PIRATE, MURDERING dad, who tried MANY times to kill Aquaman!!
Sorry Manta, you are not a sympathetic character. Neither was your dad. What your dad got was karma. To quote Jim Carey from ""Liar, Liar"". Stop breaking the law (can't use expletives on IMDB)!. Then dear old dad would not have died.
Yay, Aquaman! Nicole Kidman was great! I have also. It been an Amber Heard fan, but she did great as well, I thought she was well suited for the role!"
"mcnaughtonamb","4","0","0","29 December 2018"," Visually stunning but suffers from poor writing and execution.
","I went to see this film with medium to high expectations after reading some stellar reviews on IMDB. I would advise checking the date more closely because DCEU are clearly using the reviews before release as a guerilla marketing campaign.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There are some saving graces. Some of the scene design in this film is wonderful. Atlantis looks stunning and some of the fight scenes are entertaining to watch. However there is inconsistency in how well underwater scenes are rendered and it does sometimes lend itself to video-game cut scene territory. Also some of the costume design looks straight out of old-school power rangers which I'm not sure is a good thing for multi-million pound production.<br/><br/>Where the film suffers most however is in the the god-awful dialogue. If you're a fan of overblown cheesy declarations, this film is for you. If you wanted something more punchy and impactful, this film is not. I heard a couple of audible groans from the audience at a couple of points after the characters make wooden use of already cheesy lines and it really is almost laughable.<br/><br/>Jason Mamoa does his best with the material given and he really looks the part! Nonetheless though he struggles to deliver on some of the more 'cheesy' moments where he is required to emote something more than 'cool surfer man'. I'm unsure if this is due to the bad lines given, poor direction or due to limited ability. The baddies are a bit forgettable and could have used better motivations over all. Mantis was given one but was underused and a bit ridiculous really.<br/><br/>In summary I wouldn't pay to watch this film and I wish that I hadn't. Read the real user reviews folks, check dates and stick to the MCU I guess because apart from Wonder Woman this DCEU is simply not up to par."

Would Aquaman bring DC to justice and save their new live-action library? Well, I'm glad to say that this definitely delivers. I saw this in theatres with my dad, and I didn't look away. It had a lot of action scenes that were put together really well and the water was someof the best effects in years. The two main leads are wonderful, though I do think they could have given Aquaman himself more brains than brawn. I do love the actress who plays Mera, and she does give a really convincing performance, but I do feel like they were a bit pushy with her action scenes.

","First of all please excuse me for my English. I watched this movie due to the box office ratings and reviews. The cinematography, the visuals and the CGI all that were spectacular. However I would want to see a re-make of Aquaman in a more legendary and nature setting. Where do you have the underwater kingdom under the great ocean of the earth and all those troops and the technology? This sounds ridiculous. Instead of a load of CGI and all those fighting that stuff your brain, I want to see more human elements. It could be like when the aqua kid realized he was different, how he could communicate with the marine life and how he try to fit in or stride a balance between the land and sea then evolve to the need to protect marine life by working with the humans all that. Plus do you need fins and grills to swim like that? I am a grown up and I think this movie is more for the kids. In the middle of the movie, I was like am I watching Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars? Come on! I like super hero but please make it more legendary for people to remember this character. That's why the movie Shape of Water is successful because the only CGI is the eyes of the amphibian man thank you."

But that's it. The story is very poor, the titled should be ""National Treasure: Trident of Poseidon"". Not enough time to develop many of this creatures back story, even for Aquaman itself. Mamoa is so-so. Amber Heard is just pretty like she played in every of her movies, no acting skill whatsoever. Manta is copied from Power Rangers with the eyes of Cyclops from X-Men. Patrick Wilson is Loki with the Jaws army. DC still not yet have good villain with the charisma to become the good movie like Heath Ledger ""Joker"" at The Dark Knight anymore. All better villain should be CGI characters. The soundtrack is so lousy and cheezy and the timing of it ruin the mood instantly.<br/><br/>Note: having only good special effect can wow you in very short period only because in the future it will come new and better of it.

","When I first heard that this movie was coming out, I was too excited for words. Now that I have seen it, I have never been more low key dissatisfied.
Let me start off where the movie itself started off, the conception of Aquaman. Tom Curry (Aquaman's father) looked like a cartoon. They were trying to make him look younger, and it looked like a similar past mistake like the horrendous ""mustache"". However, looking at all the other CGI (with minor mistakes that make it look completely awful), it looked very, very good. Just being underwater was incredible, because we really do know more about Mars than our own oceans. Therefore, it was welcoming to see how the underwater features would work, and they definitely worked well.
Now let's talk about the script. This was one of the most laziest scripts and quite predictable. A 6 year old would quite enjoy this movie cause he wouldn't have to think at all. However, a knowledgeable person would get considerably bored."

"sherilcarey","9","0","0","25 December 2018"," Great comic book interpretation
","If I wrote all day I might not finish telling how much I liked about this movie. I've heard several times in the last few years that the character of Aquaman from the past was lame. I realize maybe I'm not the average audience member because I liked him a lot in the animated Justice League of my 70's childhood. And my youngest who strongly preferred ""bearded aquaman"" and I both agreed that this was an excellent updated Aquaman and both thought this would work for very nearly any type of audience.<br/><br/>The movie making ensemble that made this fab show did far better than many superhero movies do in not frustrating or confusing people who actually like comic books or previous screen interpretations. It showed just what's so great in comic books which we refer to in our house as the Moments. This had good writing, acting, directing, editing, etc. There were grand visuals. And the whole thing just swung along from one great moment to another with good (and sometimes awe inspiring) transitions.<br/><br/>And here's my own odd bit: I have a weird quirk where even though I like certain types of action movies in recent years I tend to accidentally tune out fight scenes. It's truly not intentional but its sometimes so thorough that I miss something just after a fight that mattered. I guess they often bore me and often seem to me to have pretty ridiculously poor choices in how they are filmed. But I actually didn't have that problem in this movie. My family would say that was a Very positive commentary on the movie.<br/><br/>It's not that there are no criticisms that could be made by those who seriously enjoy critiquing but from my point of view, just wanting movies to entertain me and this movie reaching a very high level of entertainment value, it just isn't worthwhile to do anything other than to focus on the positive."

","My expectations for Aquaman were kept pretty low. To me, as a DC fan, he's barely considered second string hero and the idea of bringing him to the big screen seemed like an insurmountable task. There are a few things they did very right with this film. It's pure science fiction-fantasy so they use that to their advantage. They did similarly with this what they did with the second and third Thor movies where there is very little realism here so they can take liberties with nearly anything. The CGI is extravagant and well done. The film is a visual sight to behold which helps a lot. James Wan as director is a talented, solid director with great vision and this is a bit different for him but he knows how to tell a story and the fantasy visuals needs a story and it works. There were scenes throughout this that I kept thinking should have been nearly completely laughable, it was so cheesy but it worked within the confines of the fantasy of the film.<br/><br/>
Jason Momoa is a great choice for Arthur (Aquaman) because he's a far cry from the comic book version. Momoa has great charisma on screen and I'm really starting to enjoy him as an actor. He's massive and larger than life and yet there is something very down to earth about it. Amber Heard is the eye candy in the movie and the romantic interest though that is mostly played down. Heard does decently, she's not an amazing actress by any means but she serves her purpose and her and Momoa are okay together. Patrick Wilson is a nice addition to the cast although I found his character very cheesy at times. Even his line delivery is not exactly ""serious"" enough to take seriously. But he is a decent villain to the story. Nicole Kidman is also a nice addition to the cast as Aquaman's mother. She looks amazing and she definitely adds a certain gravitas to the film. Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Graham McTavish and Temuera Morrison all have strong supporting roles. You can tell by the big names they signed to this that on screen charisma helped carry the film a lot.<br/><br/>
James Wan created a fantasy epic and that's an important distinction to your typical ""superhero"" flick. It's very watchable, it's light and fluffy and it's non-stop action. The action scenes will literally have you on the edge of your seat and that helps you ignore the silliness or the one-liners or the cheesy moments and dialog. It ends up working quite well. I don't think this is the best DC Universe film by any means and I don't think it comes even close to Wonder Woman but I think it does well given that it's Aquaman. I'd be surprised to see them pull this off again but if they follow the same recipe and have the same amount of experience behind the camera and in front then maybe. It is clear now that being without Zack Snyder is still the best for the DC Universe. 7.5/10"
"rishabhsinha2611","8","0","0","24 December 2018"," it's fun. Absurd levels of fun
","Aquaman is ridiculous and over the top and a bit insane. And it's fun. So, so, so much fun. Absurd levels of fun. Aquaman has people riding giant seahorses and sharks and firing lasers. It has a Polynesian man living in Maine, a queen played by Nicole Kidman, a king played by Dolph Lundgren and a prince named Orm played by Patrick Wilson. It's packed with mythology and world building and action scenes and a hunt for a Mystical Thing and stuff going boom. It has both Pitbull and Roy Orbison on the soundtrack. And it has an octopus drum solo and Julie Andrews voicing a sea monster the size of Cthulhu."

"lennybuttz","6","12","49","10 December 2018"," Doesn't live up the hype.
","I hate it when they withhold a movie for a holiday release so they have the potential to make more money. If a company decides to do then they better give me something to make the wait worthwhile. In this case they didn't come through for me, I was anticipating something better.<br/><br/>I will say I kind of liked this movie but I expected more, it left me feeling kind of disappointed. I think they sacrificed too much of the story for more action. It felt like they were trying too hard to include too much for 1 movie. I think it might have been better served splitting it up into 2 parts but then it wouldn't have been as exciting. This movie really needed a good writer, someone who could have condensed the story into something that flowed more smoothly. The dialogue was at times silly and out of place. Momoa trying to be funny is like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be funny as the Terminator, awkward. Momoa is a great straight man, he has good comedic timing and had some really funny moments in Stargate Atlantis when he wasn't trying to be funny. If they wanted humor in this movie, they should have used the same technique vs. using corny jokes.<br/><br/>Maybe because I'm older and grew up watching movies with incredible actors and dialogue but the CGI stuff doesn't impress me that much. Some of it was incredible some of it was just off and made the scenes look fake. I knew it was CGI and what they were showing was inaccurate, it took me out of the movie. I admire the movies that use CGI but don't make me aware of it. There were times I wished I'd had a remote control so I could fast forward through parts that were just way too drawn out. I wasn't crazy about the music, at times it didn't enhance the story and sometimes it was downright distracting. I think the music and background noises were overpowering, making it more difficult to understand what was being said.<br/><br/>I like Momoa as an actor, he is visually impressive but I still can't wrap my head around him being Aquaman. It was like he as an actor didn't believe he was Aquaman? Nicole Kidman's performance was not all that believable either. Maybe it was the CGI or lack of great dialogue but it didn't pull me in. The antagonists were the worst, their lines were laughable. I'm reminded of a quote from W.C. Fields ""If you can't dazzle them with Brilliance than Baffle them with Bulls##t"" they tried to dazzle us with Brilliant imagery so we didn't notice all the Bulls##t.<br/><br/>I love Super Hero movies but the biggest problem I have with them is they try too hard to be epic. Yeah I want a Hero and action but I want a good story as well. Too many times the story gets lost in the struggle to make it more Epic than the last Super Hero movie. I hate that they're always trying to outdo each other with action and special effects at the cost of the story. If you have a good story you don't need epic battles. I think this movie really sacrificed story for action. It's like when you go to a buffet and you eat a little of everything but you don't get enough of the few really good things. When you leave you're full but not satisfied. Although there were some great moments in the move it left me unsatisfied."
"rowpotdroid","2","7","25","17 December 2018"," Hollywood has given up!
","Laughable, I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculous under water battles with sea horses and riding giant sharks warriors due battle. I think some of these Hollywood
directors have completely lost touch with reality and are doing way too many drugs.
Comic book Hero's was a distraction initially back when they came out with Superman. But like always Hollywood latches onto anything that generates box office returns they will milk it to death. The art of movie making has been lost to the computer age of CGI it's all about special effects. The age of movie goer's now must be 12 and younger. As for movie making continuing to be an art form it's been lost decades ago as both directors and actors sell out for a fast buck in over hyped productions that cater only to those with the attention span of 5 seconds. Character development, story line, plot, all rolled into on area the Fight Scene. They don't even build up the suspense just drop you right into the violence right from the start and pretty much continues fight scene after fight scene with laughable sprinkles of emotional bonding between pretty girl and boys."
"MichaelTBowman","4","5","16","21 December 2018"," Why are the DC movies so bad?
","Kids will probably enjoy this movie, and if you have the hots for Jason Momoa, you'll probably love it, but objectively it's just not good.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is certainly easy on the eyes but he is just not a good enough actor to headline a ""blockbuster"" film. Aquaman tries to remedy this by padding his performance with other well-known actors, but it's just not enough to fix this movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie itself isn't terrible, but the script is filled with weak dialogue and most of the characters can't seem to use contractions, so that makes the dialogue seem very wooden and awkward.<br/><br/>There are a few nods to the Aquaman from the comics and the old cartoons that fans will enjoy, but there are other parts of the movie (like a drum-playing giant octopus) that will make viewers scratch their heads.<br/><br/>And of course DC still looks amateurish and cartoony when it comes to comparing their CGI to Marvel movies, not only in action sequences, but also when it comes to de-aging actors.<br/><br/>Bottom line, take the kids to see it, but keep your expectations low."

If I ever see underwater flowy hair fx and hear another bloop bloop sound that reminds us that they actually are speaking under water (even they know it's stupid because they take time to underline how senseless it is to no other than Aquaman himself) well, I'll start throwing all my garbage directly in the ocean to show my disgust and hopefully choke Aquaman with plastic in the process."

"CaptainFluffyCuddles","5","4","12","16 December 2018"," Disappointing and cheesy
","I felt like this film had potential. Based on the other films so far you try to keep an open mind because this time it might be different.
Ultimately, the movie gets bogged down in far too much distracting CGI, including Hollywood's penchant for making its stars look younger in flashback segments. Particular CGI and effects that bothered me were the shimmer to make it look like they were underwater and a filter on their voices to make it sound like talking with a mouth full of water.
At times this film felt like a cross between National Treasure and the Sword in the Stone while Jason Momoa's Aquaman stumbles around with a brah attitude.
I thought this film had the potential to break away from the earlier DC movies, be a bit different and set its own bar but it has ended up another longwinded disappointing chapter in the DC franchise."
"lucozade-41304","5","4","12","15 December 2018"," 100% honest without any expectations going in
","I went into this movie with a open mind and I was disappointed. The first opening scene was promising and well directed but the rest of the movie fell flat with cringe moments, noticeably bad CGI, terrible jokes, silly jump scares and pacing issues. James wann the director is very good don't get me wrong but he was either not 100% sure on what he was doing here or the studio was pulling strings most of the time. The movie has all the typical cliches which usually I let pass but these ones you could see coming from a mile away and just make you sigh.<br/><br/>The actors aren't bad but the script they are given here is awful, some of the lines are so bad they look improvised at the last second. The scene in the desert is a great example of this, every line sounds like it was written by a 10 year old with a bad sense of humour.<br/><br/>The good points here are that the villains have motivations which are clear but mostly cliche, the actions scenes are quite badass especially the submarine scene but that's where it ends.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie should have been short and sweet making us want more, instead I never want to see another solo aquaman movie. The post credit scene is pointless and sparks no emotion or excitement for any future instalments."

","Aquaman movie full of business movie element and cannot tell the whole story well. I have to admit it that Wan is very talented. He know how to use elements to attract audiences. Nicole's 45s long camera fighting scene, thriller elements, hero moment, fantastic camera, and highly restored comic character settings which can attract comic fans, but a good movie need to use these elements to tell the story right, to decorate the movie in stead of steal the story's thunder. The film originally had a very clear main line, but it was influenced by the cumbersome elements of the story. Especially, those hero moment. The film is about the growth of Aquaman, so there should be only one real hero moment, that is, when he gets the king's trident. However, this Aquaman seems to be posing from beginning to end, but the real hero time is inferior, because by then the audience has been tired of watching him pose."

Many scenes make you wonder if they have a music director of some sort in the production team or they just have some intern working on it. Perhaps a real intern would do a better job.<br/><br/>Costume design - OMG!!! I laughed at it initially but it later became a pain just to watch another second of those bad designs. If batman still wears the costumes from the 60s, he would look like a clown than a superhero! You can improvise you know!!!

","This movie is visually stunning, don't get me wrong. The CGI is epic and gorgeous, but it's a ridiculously dumb movie. Jason Mamoa is a stunning man that does an okay job as Aquaman, but his character feels very surface. His opening sequence/fight scene is a good intro but you're left wanting more depth to the character as the movie progresses. They tried to add some toughness and snark like Tony Stark, but there's not enough to work with to actually make the personality truly click and shine through to the audience. Amber Herd was excellent as Mera and I think she was perfectly cast, and the most believable character in this film.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson's character was tolerable as the lead villain. I don't have much more to say on him. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was a minor ""bad guy"" character as he became Black Manta. I had to hold in giggles, as his battle armor made him look like more like a cheesy bad guy from the 90s version of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, and less like a Marvel antagonist. So much of this movie just reminded me of Avatar, only underwater. Avatar had mystery to it as it wasn't a world we knew, but this has very recognizable animals in it that are awkward to see in their presentation. For instance, sharks in battle armor. Frickin' sharks with frickin' laser beams on their heads! #austinpowers Seeing Orcas and blue whales presumably miles underneath the ocean was also something difficult to just dismiss as ""it's just movie science"" as these are real animals in our world.<br/><br/>The underwater scenes, particularly the entry into the City of Atlantis, were beautifully done. However, the inexplicable lack of continuity between how physics works in this underwater world (falling off of cliffs underwater?) among other nonsense towards the end of the movie had all of us in the preview audience muttering, shifting in our chairs, and asking aloud many of the same questions. We wanted to much to love this movie, and everyone walking out said it was terrible but the CGI was amazing. I wish I could say I loved it. I didn't. Beautiful, but disappointing movie."

"paulblawrence","6","11","51","11 December 2018"," Everyone calm down. Its not that great.
","Saying that this movie is the best DC movie is rediculous since The Justice League, and Batman vs Sup are terrible. And clearly theyre not counting Nolan's movies, which put this one to shame as well. That being said, Aquaman has Ang Lee, a compliment director, as well as a few good actors(just a few), and plenty of action to keep the viewers from dozing off.<br/><br/>This movie's biggest flaw is its completely unoriginal. Its in-your-face-obvious that the writers all got together and took their ideas from Thor, Black Panther, Iron Man(specifically pt 2), Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Tron: Legacy. Its all on the screen and so many times I found myself saying, ""That's right out of...""<br/><br/>The visuals are definitely good, and the action was fun...sometimes. I love action, but these felt forced.<br/><br/>This movie's second biggest flaw are the villains. And DC clearly tried really, really hard to make these villains good. Sorry, you failed. Again. The main villain is the hero's half brother who wants the thrown. (Sound familiar?). And though he's played by Patrick Wilson, and well, his story is just too cliche'd. In other words, we've seen it before. The second villain, was downright terrible! With an awful story line, an awful costume(which is supposed to be an upgrade), and such a stupid name. ""You can call me, Black Manta!"". WHAT??! Everyone in the room groan at that line. At least Black Panther looked like a black panther, and was badass! This guy looks like a cross between a black-metallic Iron Man(again, ripoff) and Robbie the Robot. Its a waste of time, and he gives that line just moments before he dies.<br/><br/>The fights between Aquaman and the main villain...who's name I never caught, were fun, but again, I've seen it before. The story was very predictable, there was no suspense, and the near-ending's twist was not a surprise at all.<br/><br/>Oh and the cherry on the sunday of lame is the NEVER ENDING preaching of how mankind is killing the oceans, and the environment. Leave politics at home, dammit.<br/><br/>Overall, its definitely much better than the last few DC movies we've seen. But its still a DC film, and that says a lot about the films quality. The money is definitely spent on screen, and it looks great, but I don't see what all the hype is about, looking at some of these reviews.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad, but its nothing compared to Avengers: End Games's trailer. Just the trailer of that is better than this!"

","Let me start out by mentioning this movie Was visually stunning, but lacked a lot when it came to good back stories and villain motivation.<br/><br/>First of all, the cool looks and lame jokes in the beginning of the movie are way too forced<br/><br/>There are two villains frog man and the Atlantians that want to destroy the earth dwellers... The motivation of the frog men to kill aquaman is not at all explained and then they give you the simple reason that aquaman declined to save his father ... Let's take a look at why he didn't save him...<br/><br/>1. Criminal daught in the act
2. Aquaman first showed mercy after getting blasted by an explosive bullet
3. Decided to let him die after he threw a grenade at aquaman when he was on his way out, then died because the submarine collapsed on himself...<br/><br/>Ok, Atlantis people never even tried to negotiate the end of sea pollution or prove their presence to the earth dwellers so their motivation to attack is not at all reasonable since earth dwellers have no idea they are harming an entire civilization of humanoids...<br/><br/>Lastly, there are so many inconsistencies and bending of logic that it all feels very forced and set up...<br/><br/>It's an entertaining movie with stunning visuals, but it's not a good movie and it lacked an overarching score like the one in the MCU.<br/><br/>Oh and what the hell was the Rocky training montage scene where Frog man builds his suit? That was so cringe... To be honest almost all the music in this movie was cringe..<br/><br/>

","Let me start by saying that this is not the worst movie ever made, I think the people who worked on it were actually trying. However, if not for James Wans' direction, this movie would have a been a 2/10. It is a good looking movie, and it is fun, but it's just bad. The script probably being the main problem. Too many characters to introduce, too many storylines going on at once, and frankly just not very exciting. Super hero movies seem to feel the need to throw a joke into every scene but it is just distracting and not at all funny most of the time. How people are giving this a 10/10, which in my opinion should be reserved for only the best movies ever made, I really do not know. The acting is ok at best, but i still cringed at the line delivery in some of the scenes. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, just trying to make sure you don't go into this movie with high expectations like I did, becasue you will be let down. One more thing, the tones throughout the movie are very jumpy which leads to feeling like you're watching two different movies and it can be very irritating."
"reefmavericks","2","3","9","25 December 2018"," Aquaman makes box office splash? More like splat.
","If you care about great acting, dialogue, and character development, maybe this is not the movie for you. James Wan should stick with the jump scare horror movies, because this movie was an embarrassment, compared to his Insidious series.
Jason Momoa, scenery, and the kraken: maybe the only positives of this movie. It also has a good message: Be humble, a true king fights for everyone, not only his people.
But why the bad rating?
1. Awful Dialogue! This movie is stuffed with cheesy one liners, and horribly basic dialogue throughout. This made it hard to really enjoy the movie. I understand this movie is rated PG-13 and mainly meant for children to see, but it really could have been better.
2. Bad acting. The dialogue did make it hard for the actors to really shine with what they were given. However, the man who played Black Manta was not very good. As a revenge character, he just looked like a mad child and was unconvincing. Patrick Wilson also disappointed in this movie. Nicole Kidman did do a good job with the small role she was given though.
3. Overuse of CGI. The underwater scenery was good, very glowy and spectacular like in Avatar. However, the metal suit CGI was pretty bad. Much too shiny and unconvincing. (Iron Man did it better)
4. Bad costumes! Queen Atlanta, Mera, and Aquaman's fish scale suits looked like they had been bought at a Halloween store. The sleeve ends showed too much and the scales looked like they had been drawn on. Some CGI could have been used here, to add dimension to them.
5. Romance? Where? The romance between Mera and Aquaman seemed like an after thought. Just one scene showing real connection would have helped. Very flat and business like relationship. She helps him, he helps her, and then they end up together somehow.
Despite all this, the movie was an okay way to waste time and the children enjoyed it."

","First, everything that is OK about this film happened underwater...<br/><br/>The CGI seemed pretty good, nice style. Good world-building. Most of the acting was decent enough (better from the more seasoned actors). Comedic moments sit a little awkwardly and were pretty flat for me, but are probably not too bad. The story was pretty simple, but that's fine, especially when executed by decent acting.<br/><br/>The rest though.. everything out of the water.. it's like someone completely different was in charge. And it's not good.<br/><br/>There's a long scene that looks like it came out of the old Power Rangers TV show, with the same cheap look, and a clunky villain who had suddenly become a technological genius... just pathetic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was mostly unnoticeable which I find is usually good, except for horrible double use of the 'signature' refrain during the first appearance, but much worse, two crude scene transitions into overbearing songs, one of which starts a laughable scene that looks like the start of a Disney fairytale musical number.<br/><br/>The CGI is bad, including a scene on a boat that looks like they borrowed a backdrop from a film from the 1950s, along with a camera stuck on maximum zoom for some reason.<br/><br/>There are other bits too; when Mera makes a 'speech', all moving about for no reason but to clash with the tone of the moment, or the wildly variable displays of Aquaman's strength, or one underwater bit that was so silly, ill-fitting and cheesy that our audience laughed out loud *at* it.<br/><br/>Overall the good bits are pretty decent, but good grief, I just don't get it, you're watching then the next scene and you're wondering if they swapped the reels to another film.<br/><br/>This is not good film-making."

"snowfre","5","2","5","20 April 2020"," A film that keeps its head above the surface due to its visuals and fun action, but the script is thin as a paper boat
","In James Wan's adaption of DC's classic Athalntean superhero Aquaman, the focus is clearly on entertaining fight scenes, vibrant underwater settings, and some non-imaginary one-liners, with less so on storytelling, pacing narrative, and dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. Jason Mamoa is the film's lead as the land based aquatic demigod who sets out to stop his half-brother, King Orm (Wilson) drom waving against the humans. Honestly, not being any environmentalist of any sort, King Orm's war seems justified as humanity's littering of the oceans is a driving factor for him but I'll just set aside that part I guess. So, what we're left with a film that reminds me of the quite tacky, yet often entertaining, superhero movies of the early 2000s, before Disney bought Marvel and turned comic book superheroes to the latest cinematic craze. ""Aquaman"" is of course visually superior to those old(er) movies, in fact, the underwater environments in the film are breathtakingly beautiful and stunningly well-made, and, besides the action, the CGI and visual effects are what makes ""Aquaman"" float. I wish the writing duo Johnson-McGoldrick and Beall would have polished the script somewhat, cutting down on unnecessary scenes, made Black Manta (Abdul-Mateen II) feel relevant, increased the villain vibes from blondie King Orm, and thought the dialogue through one more time. Damn that dialogue. It's unbearably awkward at times, especially when Aquaman and Mera (Heard) have their more romantically tense moments. It is easily overshadowed by the action sequences, yes, but I wish ""Aquaman"" would have a more mature atmosphere and focused less on filling its tank with the most clichéd superhero elements known to man."

","Aquaman
RATING: 3.2/5<br/><br/>This movie has no business being 2 hours and 22 minutes long for being as dumb as it is. I really don't get how Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse can have more characters and tell a more cohesive story in less than 2 hours, and look way better doing it, while Aquaman trips all over itself. People try to excuse the stupidity of this movie by saying it embraces it's comic book goofiness, except that's a lie. The movie is a mess and it never fully commits to itself. Some characters play it super straight, but their dialogue is so bad that it comes off as generic, over the top, and just dumb.<br/><br/>The movie gives you two villains, Ocean Master and Black Manta. The problem is that they're two of Aquaman's biggest villains and they could each hold their own movies as the main antagonist. Black Manta's intro is something that could have been very powerful and character building for both Aquaman and Black Manta, but the garbage dialogue deflates the entire scene. As the movie continues, Black Manta just fades into the background as Ocean Master takes center stage. However, it makes no sense because Black Manta gets the origin setup and Ocean Master doesn't. Mera and Aquaman have zero chemistry, so when they get this epic kiss, it's practically meaningless. And there's a lot of moments like that where something will be presented as a big deal, visually, but will have piss poor setup and thus have little to no meaning behind it. For example, they literally show you dinosaurs in the background of somewhere they go to, with no explanation whatsoever, and no reaction from the actors. It's just poorly thought out. This is Aquaman's first real venture into this world of Atlantis and the 7 Kingdoms, but you wouldn't know it by the way he acts. This whole movie is really about distraction. They hit you with something shiny and pretty to distract from the fact that the story doesn't add up, and the dialogue is downright stupid most of the time. Character development be damned. Jason Mamoa does his best, but there's only so much he can do with the charisma he has.<br/><br/>As for the positive stuff, the special effects are fantastic. There's one underwater scene that looks really cool, mainly because Wan gets to go all horror movie director with it, and it works to great effect. And then the story starts happening again, and you remember how dumb everything is. Smh.
Atlantis looks gorgeous, better than Wakanda in Black Panther, that's for sure. However, you're not there long enough to get any sense of what Atlantis is, or the people, which Aquaman constantly repeats he has no allegiance to. In fact, they just have Mera beat you over the head with exposition which you can take or leave with her generic acting. The action scenes are solid, nothing super memorable but solid. The big fight between armies at the end is all but forgettable, just a big CGI mess. Not as bad as Wonder Woman's 3rd Act though, Aquaman's still looked gorgeous, but despite the stakes, you just don't really care because you know how everything's gonna turn out. There's no mystery or anything because of how generic and predictable it is.<br/><br/>In the end, yeah it's a gorgeous film but it's story is borderline asinine and it's almost 2 and half hours long, which I will admit, you don't really feel because everything moves so fast. If the movie didn't look as good as it did, and move as fast as it does, this would be an average film, maybe even less. As is, the craftsmanship manages to drag it into above average territory, but just barely... note, this is nowhere near close to the Aquaman in the current comics, but you might have fun with this Aquaman movie, if you don't think about it too much."

"XweAponX","10","2","5","5 July 2019"," Ronon Dex harpoons Aquaman
","I've been a fan of Aquaman since the 60's, so I'll take my own counsel about this film over anyone who was not even born at the time I was originally reading Aquaman comics. If you never read these comics as a child? If you never collected them, if you never watched the Superman-Aquaman ""Hour of Adventure"" cartoon show from the late 60's every Saturday morning with your brother, then you ain't qualified to review it, really. If you have, if you have taken the time do you find reprints and trade paperbacks of the old stories, well then that's good. A person should try to be at least a little bit familiar with the character before watching this. And if you don't have the money to buy a bunch of used comic books, then there is Wikipedia and other online sources that are pretty good that can fill you in with the uniqueness of this character, because once you understand the character, you will see why I highly appreciate this film.<br/><br/>Even though I stopped actively collecting in the 70's, I still kept up with the history of the character. Aquaman was originally a Blonde haired Blue eyed Seawater Breathing, Seahorse Riding gent who could talk to fish and swim around in the deep but not much else. He was the King of Atlantis, and so his comic books always dealt with his administration of the underwater Kingdom while his adventures with the Justice League of America sometimes took him to other planets. He's saved Superman more than once, and at one time, he grew his hair out long and lost one of his hands, replacing it with a Hook. He became a much darker, more unkempt and disheveled figure, much like Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight"" version of Batman, which in my opinion Ben Affleck was the greatest depiction of.<br/><br/>Aquaman, this Aquaman, is the undersea, super powered version of The Dark Knight. And Jason Momoa, who became famous playing Ronon Dex in Stargate Atlantis (another fable which included Atlantis), has been the first and best version of Aquaman. I don't think anyone can take it from here.<br/><br/>I really don't know the state of the DC Cinematic Universe at this time, Zack Snyder started it with his Man of Steel, which lead up to the creation of The Justice League, and it is sad, very sad, that this story is not continuing. Or is it? I think I see plans for Aquaman II and Justice League II. But other New films are planned which are basically reboots of what Zack Snyder created. I don't want that, I want to see a second Justice League movie which includes the characters as they are now.<br/><br/>Aquaman is one of the latest films to be told in the DCCU, and it caps off the tale with a threat that grows from the deep, Arthur Curry has a half-brother (Played by Patrick Wilson, Nite Owl from Watchmen, and I admit he is very handsome as an Atlantean) who wants to be crowned ""Ocean Master"" which will empower him to make war upon the surface. Arthur has to prevent this somehow, and his adventures take him to Atlantis, The Sahara, my Homeland Sicily, and finally The Marianas Trench/Challenger Deep - To meet a unique creature that has killed everyone who has ever come face to ""face"" with it. Can Arthur survive this?<br/><br/>Now, the one thing about this film is that there appears to be a huge knock down drag out fight every 5 minutes. But, they are well choreographed. I thought The Atlanteans had too many Gizmos. Those are my only complaints.<br/><br/>I thought it was cool that Nicole Kidman is his mom while Bobba Fett's Clone-Pop is his Dad. And his GF ""Mera"" (Amber Heard, hm, she was married to Capn Jack Sparrow?), so it's an all in the family affair.<br/><br/>Mainly I loved that a character that I loved as a child has finally been given their own film, and a guy I like played him. That's all anyone can ask.<br/><br/>Notice - Since this review is pretty much the same as the other review that somehow got posted before this one, I'm removing ""spoilers"", because I did not really put any spoilers in here.

","How many CGI bio-luminescent jellyfish can fit on a movie screen? Dozens and dozens. What I remember is monotonous CGI fast-action undersea battles for 2 hours. And an (evil) Power Ranger dressed in black with a big bug head shooting lasers from its eyes - that's supposed to look scary? It's absolutely cringe worthy. No character development at all - a real lost opportunity since a lot more could have been explored about Aquaman's origin and being different, trying to adapt in the human world, his emotional struggles, etc.. Instead, there's 2 hours of CGI battles (no dialogue) with soldiers riding on shark back, Chernobyl crabs, and squid ships firing laser beams. No actor could save this movie and Jason Momoa's talent and charm were wasted."

"samyoung-82648","3","2","5","9 March 2019"," I laughed because it was so terrible
","This movie is a mess. The acting is awful (except Amber Heard, Mara, who is good 1/2 of the time). The first 15 minutes are a competition between Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Nicole Kidman (the Queen) and Amber Heard for who is the most arrogant, stereotyped character. Kidman (usually a great actress) comes in a close second to Momoma for the most obnoxious character.<br/><br/>Then there's the story. What an incoherent mess. This seems to be something Wan struggles with as he had the same problems in Star Trek 3 (which was also an incoherent mess). The story has no continuity and only the flimsiest of arcs. The characters are the most cliched I've seen in many years. I thought it was a spoof at times.<br/><br/>I will give Wan credit though. He's seriously politically correct. If there's a box to be ticked, irrespective of talent, Wan will do it. However, this movie had a black villain and a female who didn't win every fight. Then, the male and female lead weren't antagonistic to each other - there was actually some romance (naughty, naughty Mr Wan). Finally, Kidman and Heard become doe-eyed and say ""Aquaman saved me, what a hero"". I nearly died! That was the sort of rubbish that only made it Into the worst of movies 50-60 years ago. Far too much of the time I felt like I was watching a b-grade direct to TV.<br/><br/>This movie will not stand the test of time. There are very few super-hero movies that will. However, this one was definitely below par. Down there with Wonder Woman, Black Panther and some of the Avengers films.<br/><br/>Score: I only gave it 3/10 because it made me laugh at the stream of cliches and it had nice visual effects of Atlantis. I'd almost give it 4 for those two aspects alone, however, delivering bad performances from Defoe and Kidman?!? That's hard to do for a capable director. So, 3/10 stays."

","I was not expecting this movie to be a patch on the what it delivered.<br/><br/>It literally has everything. And is VERY close to the comic book, and animated canon. (apart from Aquaman's hair.) Which like Sam Jackson Nick Fury, and Supes not have red underpants on his costume, is actually much better than the source material.<br/><br/>Apart from that pretty much everything is on there, from Mera being able to control water, to-- to-- to-- So many things fans will so.. ""Oh thats awesome!"" ... (I dont want to give stuff away.)
Its ridiculously action packed, with insane CGI effects, funny, tender, and just goes from strength to strength.
IMO its one of THE BEST super hero movies by any studio so far.<br/><br/>I'm not even a big fan of Kidman or Heard, and even I have to admit they were both superb in their roles.<br/><br/>There are also hardly any expletives, either religious, or cussing.

Not enough action. Painful acting. Waste of time."
"jackfraniel","4","2","5","11 January 2019"," Seriously?
","I can't express or voice my disappointment in any form or fashion besides simply saying this. I expected a good movie (based off of the 10/10's on this site) but was let down after the screening. This film is essentially black panther, another fairly average movie, but killmonger and T'challa have switched roles.<br/><br/>The first and most important thing to address is the ""romance"". Aqua man and Ariel or whatever her name is have some of the most forced development I have ever seen. They just stare at each other and hold hands/kiss to show they are falling in love. They don't have a great dynamic or anything, it just kind of happens because the movie wants it to happen.<br/><br/>Another thing to address is the costume design. I feel like I could see these at a comic convention. Pretty solid for some random guy to design, but terrible for a movie with this budget. Everything looks like plastic with scales engraved in them. The worst part is the villains who aren't Atlantian. You would think they could've escaped the terrible costumes and they almost did. Then they come back dressed as one of the bad guys from power rangers.<br/><br/>Something else I have to mention, the cliché of it all. I know it's a super hero film, so it's bound to have something familiar but nonetheless, I hold this to the same standard as every other film. The underdog story resembles that of something from a Cars film, A boxing movie, a super hero movie, or literally any movie with the ""Protagonist loses first major stand off and becomes better to beat the villain the next time. It's a played out way of representing character development and conveying a story. Superhero movies have done without this. Logan, The ENTIRE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, and Watchmen to name a few.<br/><br/>The CGI. It's a DCEU film. That's all I have to say.<br/><br/>The action scenes are glorious (sarcasm). I kid you not, every five seconds, BOOM, an explosion from the side knocks a character off their feet. The bad guys come from either above or below, and mediocre coreography ensues. If there isn't an explosion to start, it's not an action scene. At least not to the poor saps who wrote this movie. A superhero movie should deliver on entertaining action and I was laughing, so props for that.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film for kids looking to see the Stars wars to hit the ocean floor. It's not average, it's fairly below average and even laughable at times, but go watch it if your into cheesy stuff. It's a fun movie and you won't be bored. At least not during the action sequences. 4/10"
"NarniaIsAwesome","3","2","5","9 January 2019"," Aquaman is... Corny and Terribly Written.
","Not being a superhero fan, I was surprised when I was impressed with 2017's 'Justice League.' Aquaman was actually my least favorite character, but the trailers for his own movie showed sea monsters, and that sold it. So I saw it.<br/><br/>For starters, the script (written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall) is absolutely awful. Not only can you predict the outcome of the story from the moment the title comes up, but the dialogue is bone chillingly bad. It is even full of cliches like the ""du du DU!"" music that plays when the villain says something ""scary."" It also contains things that I never wanted to see or know, like an octopus playing drums, and apparently Aquaman doesn't wear deodorant.<br/><br/>And then we come to the cast: a fair enough group tainted by terrible lines. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) quotes his ill-timed one liners with all the dignity of smoked ham. So... yeah. Amber Heard (Ariel-Meara) graces the screen as your standard ""tough superhero girlfriend"" with all the dignity of, again, a smoked ham. Patrick Wilson (the evil Orm) is generally a talented actor, but is ruined by cliche ""bad guy"" yelling. Willem Dafoe is impossible to take seriously after his role in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday.' Dolph Lundgren rides a giant seahorse - and that's about it. And finally we come to Nichole Kidman, who looks lovely and doesn't botch her lines or performance. She should be apologized to for working with these people.<br/><br/>The visuals are amazing, if a bit overwhelming at times. The most impressive advancement of Atantis is their waterproof make-up. It's almost 2 hours into the movie before we see the creatures promised to us in the trailer. They are truly the highlight of the film and mostly the reason for my 3 star rating.<br/><br/>This is a long, lingering, rather dull movie and only watchable if there's nothing else to rent at the video store: Carson Clay's 'Playback Time.' I mean, uh, 'Aquaman!'"

CGI was pretty good, the underwater effects and sounds were clever. The fight sequences were cool in wide angles<br/><br/>Negatives
Wooden Actors galore, a few decent perfermances but they did what they could was an appalling script. Story was predictable and the trailer gives it away. After 5 minutes I questioned everything. Extremely childish and literal toilet humour that could have been pulled from a film aimed at 4 year olds.

"domtaylor","4","2","5","28 December 2018"," The worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst full stop.
","The DCEU has never produced a 'good' film and sadly 'Aquaman' is no exception. It's an overlong slog that has a terrible narrative, unbelievable CGI, average performances, and an awful exposition-filled screenplay. The film just gets worse as it progresses, and I had completely lost interest by around the half-way point. There is one good action sequence near the middle of the movie that is actually rather entertaining, and that is probably due to the fact that it uses real stunt-people and fight choreography as opposed to the awkward CGI body doubles that are used in 75% of the action set-pieces. The problem with these is that, since we don't care for any of the characters at all, it is easy to notice that CG has taken over. If we were invested in the narrative and were bothered by the film's stakes, then the CG replacement would probably be less of a problem. Talking about character, some of our hero's decisions are completely unbelievable and make him a totally unlikeable character. The film does use some good scene transitions sometimes, but that's hardly enough to save the picture. The worst thing about it, however, is that it's simply not fun. It could have at least been entertaining, and I could have even excused the bad narrative and dialogue if I was having some kind of fun. Yet, I was bored throughout most of it and was never invested within the story. It's the worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst films full stop. 4/10"

This is the most visibly beautiful and heart warming of the DC films. In spite the leftist, NWO, UN infused propaganda I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Gorgeous cast, and scenes. The only criticism I have, making this a 9/10, is that the lead actor can't act. However, his stature, and appearance make the fight scenes, and his inheritance believable. Definitely had a similar setting as Black Panther - with its hidden world of advanced technology, a brothers' quarrel and a feminist heroine, and with Arthur's demi god status just like Thor, this film still manages to distinguish itself from the others. The battle scenes are accentuated by their magnificent color rather than a murkey, dark blur. The fantastical world under the water and the legends of the seas themselves, make for an escape that was well worth the time."

"ahsawesa","6","2","5","24 December 2018"," Flawed But Entertaining
","Film Review: Aquaman (NO SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Indiana Jones style adventure mixed with Black Panther style of tussle between two contenders for the throne. I was expecting the story to take a different route but it didn't. Also, it's fast paced and that can be a bit jarring because at times the way it abruptly cuts to a scene that explores another subplot.<br/><br/>It feel like it's just another superhero film with just another okay pair of villains. But it's an entertaining one.<br/><br/>Why was I entertained and engaged regardless of cliches? I cared about the characters of Aquaman and Mera. I was rooting for them and was invested in their adventures. They learned from each other and what they went through. This is how a character arc works and while it is a pretty simple form of character arc, it works.<br/><br/>There are some really awe inspiring visuals in underwater scenes especially near the third act. The use of bright and vivid colors in some of those underwater moments is so good that the same cheesy Aquaman moments in some of the old comics pre-New 52 that you would've thought will never work in live action somehow look great. Action scenes are fantastic as well.<br/><br/>While it is beautiful at times, at other times, it looks very very cheesy and artificial. This is one of the negatives that I'm going to discuss in detail. Maybe it's a personal preference but at times the comic book-esque costumes don't mesh well with the world they're inhabiting. This is one of the reasons I don't like visual aesthetic of some of the MCU films. Their worlds look too plain and the costumes end up looking silly.<br/><br/>And talking about silly, I have to say that Aquaman should've taken itself a bit more seriously than it did. Jason Momoa is constantly trying to make you laugh, villains are making cheesy entries in slow motion like Bollywood films. It feels DCEU is giving in to MCU's approach in order to please the critics.. I'm not saying MCU films are bad but DC needs it's own signature style. But Aquaman does not feel like it belongs in the same universe as MoS, BvS or WW.<br/><br/>I preferred Zack Snyder's dark and gritty style. Snyder knew how to balance realism with comic book visuals. Zack Snyder also brought that sense of ""gods among humans"" to these heroes. In his films, you felt the weight of their powers. How the world reacted to them also added to that but in Aquaman it seems like they have kind of nerfed these powers and brought him down to earth in order to make him more human. Yes Aquaman does a better job at making you care for it's hero than Man of Steel did but it doesn't quite treat it's hero like the godlike being he's supposed to be. I preferred the latter approach (with good writing of course)<br/><br/>Back to the pros. Surprisingly, Amber Heard is pretty good in this, I was skeptical about her but she was very charismatic and charming in the role. Jason Momoa did a decent job of carrying the film as well considering he has never really led such a big blockbuster all by himself. Nicole Kidman put on probably one of the best performances in the film. Patrick Wilson was just okay.<br/><br/>My verdict is that Aquaman is a flawed but decent ride for film goers. I will not say that it's a step in the right direction for DC because I want them to at least tone down the humor just a little bit especially with characters that are not entirely comedy based.<br/><br/>Even with the flaws, it pleased me with heroes that I could root for, certain moments of sheer badassery and nicely tied up character arcs. I hope they improve upon the flaws in the sequel.<br/><br/>I give it a 6.8/10"

"thisseatofmars","9","2","5","24 December 2018"," Aquaman is in the same class of Excalibur, Lord of the Rings, Conan, and Highlander.
","When you hear ""comic book movie"" you probably think of Disney/Marvel (D/M) because of all of the D/M movies out there. Let's face it though, D/M have definitely developed a formula to making their movies, which isn't good, because movie formulas make movies samey. It is a successful formula, to be sure: D/M have made, what, 20 movies? But this kind of formulaic approach will kill the comic book movie. Perhaps part of the success of 2018's ""Venom"" is how it broke from the mould by being its own weird and wonderful entity. ""Aquaman"" goes further still: Aquaman does not just break this mould, it *shatters* it. Aquaman is an excellent film, one of the best fantasy films I've seen, and highly worth your time. It is not formulaic, it is not a filler movie until the next crossover: it actually helps reinvigorate the term ""comic book movie"" and succeeds on nearly every level.<br/><br/>The plot is classic fantasy: there is a rightful heir to the throne, an evil dictator, a princess, and magic, all set through the lens of the sea. Instead of swords and sorcery you have tridents and Atlantean technology. It is familiar but different, thanks to the underwater aesthetic and how the movie treats its lore. It is not constantly patronizing us with stupid jokes or nods that break immersion like Marvel and Deadpool movies, nor does it take itself too seriously like the Dark Knight movies. Perhaps that should be the distinction between DC and Marvel: DC adheres to its lore more closely, and in doing so benefits from greater immersion.<br/><br/>The leads, Aquaman and Mera, have chemistry together but neither are fantastic actors. But they are earnest and look their parts, and there is so much wonderful content to this movie that when they fumble a line or a moment it is of little consequence. The movie is also quite long, but that is a nitpick: you can't hurry epic fantasy.<br/><br/>It is fitting that the characters call Aquaman ""King Arthur"" at the end of the movie. Aquaman is in the same class of Excalibur, Lord of the Rings, Conan, and Highlander."

"trex_raz","10","2","5","22 December 2018"," Adventure, awe and wonder
","Aquaman rises from the depths and brings back faith in the DCEU! After the underwhelming Justice League movie, the task of keeping the light on in the darkness of the DCEU falls on the most underestimated member of the roster: Aquaman. In the biggest surprise of the last couple of years, the new DC is movie is not only good, but probably the best of the new universe. All in all, I, for one, left the theatre in good spirits, a feeling that persists even a day later as I'm writing this review.<br/><br/>Even the synopsis is more coherent than most of the other DCEU movies. When it comes to the story, Aquaman is inspired by Geoff Johns's New 52 story-arc that relaunched the character in critical and public acclaim. While they are not profound or thought provoking, the story and the script are simple, easy to follow and very engaging. It is inspired by the Arthurian quest, while also being a swashbuckling-adventure movie. The way the story goes always makes you excited for the next step in the hero's journey, because Aquaman finally manages to follow the classical mythic structure. I'm not saying moviemakers shouldn't take risks bending or modifying this structure, but most of the time we get convoluted and confusing stories like Batman V Superman. The third act of the movie and the fact that it embraces every element, be it silly or not, makes it better than Wonder Woman, for me.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty solid and the characters receive a pretty balanced screen time. Jason Momoa's performance in JL was decent, but felt out of place. Here, Momoa shines. He unleashes all of his charisma and has fun playing a fun character. Aquaman in light-hearted and a little arrogant, coming to terms with his heritage and history. He isn't very changed after the events of JL, but he does understand the consequences of his actions. He grows on his arthurian journey and becomes a more responsible person. His relationships with those around him are also very important. Mera (Amber Heard) is his guide on the journey and the chemistry between Momoa and Heard plays a big part. I was very impressed with Amber's acting. Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is his mentor, the one that showed him the atlantean way and I was sad that his role was not as big as I hoped, but Dafoe makes the best out of his appearances. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Arthur's mother, also does a very good job. Temuera Morrison's role as Tom Curry is small but brings an important emotional element.<br/><br/>The movie has two villains, King Orm, Arthur half-brother, as the main one and Black Manta, as a secondary one. Patrick Wilson as King Orm does a terrific job! His character is constructed as a roman emperor: stern, noble and arrogant. Orm has a purpose and his motives are always clear, so no mumbo-jumbo villain here. He sees himself as the true leader of the Atlantean Empire and acts like it. His experience working with James Wan on both franchises, but also in horrors gives him an edge in playing a menacing, but powerful character. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is Aquaman's main antagonist in the comics, but the story nedeed to focus on Arthur's rise and his battle with Orm, so Manta is merely introduced here. His origin story is very well done, as we find out about him and his hatred for the hero and seeing just enough of him to understand his story. He is clearly set up as a bigger villain the future Aquaman stories.<br/><br/>Visually, Aquaman is breathtaking. The underwater world looks amazing. Blending elements of Sci-Fi and fantasy, Aquaman shows us an imaginary world that is the stuff of dreams. Yes, the movie is bonkers! You have sharks with laser guns on their backs, armored seahorses, warrior crabs and an octopus playing the drums! But it's the kind of stuff we used to imagine as kids, the kind of creations that made us daydream forever and it is amazing. It might seem silly, but Aquaman doesn't shy away from going full on comicbook style and for that, it deserves a golden starfish! The soundtrack is also very well crafted, composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams. The music fills every scene with that sense of wonder and heroism, making the whole journey an adventure for the viewer as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Aquaman is a solid superhero movie! It knows what it wants to make us feel and never strays from the path it chose. When I left the cinema I felt good, I felt entertained and pleasantly surprised, as I was cautious, it being a DC movie. Aquaman made me feel that spirit of adventure, awe and wonder that I haven't felt since I was a kid and stayed up late to watch The Wizard of Oz or The Clash of Titans on TCM and that makes it one of the best comicbook movies. Because, in the end, as much as we want drama and profound lessons, we need superheroes and their stories to make us feel better, to take our minds away from our daily lives and our problems and transport us into a fantastical world brimming with adventures, heroes, monsters and the hope of a better world."

"Troy_Campbell","8","2","5","22 December 2018"," One of 2018's most entertaining blockbusters.
","There's a lot working against the first solo Aquaman movie. The DC cinematic universe has a poor track record, underwater CGI can be extremely difficult to get right, and the concept of Aquaman as a hero is ridiculous even by comic-book standards. Yet somehow director James Wan has dished up one of 2018's most entertaining blockbusters, well and truly matching its Marvel counterparts on the fun-scale. It may be silly, but it's the perfect type of silly. After helping the Justice League defend Earth against Steppenwolf, Arthur Curry (Jason Mamoa) finds himself at the centre of another looming invasion on his home planet - this time from the deep sea Atlantians, led by his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). With action sequences both on land and under water, Wan doesn't miss his opportunity to thrill with inventive and exhilarating set pieces, starting with a pre-credits fight that sees Nicole Kidman's Atlantian Queen kick some serious butt in one, long unbroken shot. The film engages in a game of one-upmanship with itself, the action getting bigger, wilder and more ambitious. Not every single sequence tops the last, but there's a healthy upwards trend leading to the climactic oceanic battle. Like all big budget flicks the computer effects are abundant and lavish, but particular credit goes to the VFX team for making the underwater sequences look amazing and, to a certain extent, feel realistic. It's not just the impressive visuals and exciting action that makes this movie a blast though, the tongue-in-cheek tone and carefree humour signals loud and clear that this movie is in on the joke, and that DC characters can have fun whilst also being a bit moody. It also helps that Mamoa is just so damn likable too; his reluctant superhero is the kind of guy you would want to share a few beers with. Where Mamoa ends and Arthur Curry begins is a blur, his real-life laidback persona forming a large part of the role. Not everything works (Yahya Abdul-Mateen's pirate sub-villain is a misfire, the second act sags a little), yet the film is firing on so many cylinders that these are mere blips quickly forgiven. Throw in an epic Thor: Ragnarok-esque soundtrack and Aquaman is popcorn cinema done right."

"Dragonsouls","9","2","5","21 December 2018"," Great art direction, cinematography, fight choreography and characterizations!
","Aquaman sets a new benchmark and standard for Superhero films on an aesthetic level. The art direction in this film was absolutely mind blowing! The costumes, sets, locales, CGI, was unlike anything seen outside of Game of Thrones. This film was not only immensely epic in scope but it works on a dramatic level, which was something I often wondered about before arriving at the theater. It did not disappoint.<br/><br/>This is why I read pulp fiction and love Superhero films. This is not Deadpool. It's deeply spiritual and emotional and most importantly, relatable. Lots of social commentary in this film regarding real world issues, having to do with the destruction of the environment and pollution of the planet. And even Arthur, as super as he is, is very relatable in this film, written as a rather reclusive, depressed, underachiever archetype that all people will relate too. The DC motto was regarding their heroes was always that it's not about DNA or blood, but what people do that makes them heroes and nothing more. Aquaman is the poster boy for the alien hybrid, or fallen angel, whose Earth blood balances out his alien blood, making him more suitable for the throne than full blooded Atlanteans, who are can be too ruthless at times.<br/><br/>This is supposedly an origin film but I had wished for more flashbacks. Perhaps another ten minutes of young Arthur could have fleshed out his relationship with Vulko, who I absolutely loved. William Dafoe played an excellent, even headed mentor to young Arthur Curry. Fans of Aquaman will be very happy and fans of stories like King Arthur will absolutely adore the neo myth of the Aquaman universe!<br/><br/>James Wan, I am officially a fan. I am not sure how this could be the same director as those horror films. If you love long take action scenes, beautiful wide angles, and action choreography then brace yourselves. So many films today feature chaotic action with no sense of wow factor. This film felt like a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump back into immediately after it ended.<br/><br/>I can't end this review without talking about the art direction again...it is Oscar worthy. This film was like one big Romanesque painting. The makeup, costumes, the design of the Atlantean ships and technology, all looked absolutely gorgeous and this film is clearly a product of passionate filmmaking. Of course, all of this is nothing without a good emotional story with characters you care about and it truly was a touching story. Some of the comedic stuff felt out of place but never ruined tension. It got better and better as it went on and the 3rd act was very tense! Aquaman was always my 2nd favorite superhero film and is no longer underrated thanks to James Wan, who did it!"

One of my favorite DC comics and childhood heroes.<br/><br/>Soundtrack also includes ""She's a Mystery to Me"" by Roy Orbison (written by Bono and The Edge)"
"doeman87","8","2","5","21 December 2018"," Do YOU like superhero movies???

I know DC movies of late get a lot of flak, but I left that theater feeling like Aquaman hit all their check marks... and even moreso.<br/><br/>To that, I say bravo.

"nightelfranger","6","2","5","20 December 2018"," A visual spectacle of cliche
","What do you get if you mash up every superhero cliche together and make it look good? Aquaman. The only depth the film had was that it had scenes deep in the ocean. Every character is very superficial and you can tell this was not due to bad actors, but due to the whole script itself. It lacked any kind of originality, which is great for anyone just looking to watch a classic superhero film. Its lack of depth is actually pretty surprising when you remember that it has a run time of 2 and half hours. That would be plenty to write a complex story.<br/><br/>But if it didn't have any depth then what did it have? Visuals. Lots of action, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. Its like the same genre as Transformers really. You just basically go to watch a huge pile of cash. All focus is on being entertained by something happening and looking good, and this it actually does pretty well. Not once was I bored when watching the film and especially the scenes when they are sailing, the ocean looks really good and Amber Heard's hair is super red and shiny.<br/><br/>So if you want to see this then at least you are gonna know exactly what you're gonna get and Amber Heard is really hot."
"j_man-78380","9","2","5","20 December 2018"," Went in with low expectations... Pleasantly surprised!

The charm of the film is Jason Momoa and he has this gigantic personality and manly voice. But the voice in dubbed version is really no match for this superhero guy. I mean take a look at Marvel franchise! It's not hit due to its graphics and cool action sequences but the dubbed version had that impact over the mind of audience. I strongly suggest to redub the voice of Arthur and everything else is just fine. Scenes and sound is great. It has potential to uplift a new franchise. No more darkness and DC likes colors as well. 👍"
"laurenschung","6","2","5","18 December 2018"," Could have a better story...great graphics thou!
","Ok, I'm not well verse in the DCU, so this first story of Aquaman would be very intriguing for me.
However, that was not the case.
If i were to write this story, i would write it such that it brings out the part why Arthur deserves to be the King. I would imagine he stole the Golden Trident, with the Trident rejecting him by burning his hands. I would imagine the evil brother declaring war with Earth people, both ready to destroy each other, and then Aquaman stood between the two worlds to stop the war! He sacrificed his own life to shield Atlantis from the attacks of Earth's leaders. His Trident would then be the magical weapon it deserves, and stop the rising gigantic tidal waves in suspension, leaving the homo-sapiens in awe. Hence learning a very important lesson: don't screw with Mother Nature! No more pollution! The Atlantis people would recognize him as their true King, the Earth people developed trust with this half-breed, and the Trident accepted him as it's rightful owner...
Nope...none of that.
However, the CGIs are great, the fighting scenes are quite intense, and all the characters used for this movie are beautiful.
DCU's Aquaman got a chance to shine in this holiday season, since MCU is hanging in suspension...well most of it's characters are half dead..."
"publicinspace_patricio","9","2","5","18 December 2018"," Aquaman Accomplishes to be a Good Entry to the DCEU
","I was apprehensive at first when I purchased tickets a month ago from the Amazon Prime Early Screening promotion. If you're asking why, you haven't seen the other films, or you maybe asking why the hell would I bother with the DC films at this point?<br/><br/>Allow me to elaborate: Man of Steel (2013) set the precident for what would become the DC Extended Universe. I liked it for what it was, perhaps not as much as I enjoyed the Superman (1978) epic-but it's no mention that it surpassed the films proceeding it.<br/><br/>Then the highly anticipated Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) hit the cinemas. I was part of that geeked crowd-until that somewhat jarring moment when Jimmy Olson was killed and that was only the tip of iceberg of what ensued the next two hours. I hated Batman v Superman-for doing something things right, specifically with Batman, but having such a chaotic storyline that had a layer of subplots in order to expand the story only to weight it down. But that's just a front, because I was fuming that Superman was killed-in his second film.<br/><br/>We are NOT going to talk about Sucide Squad (2016) beyond the fact that Margot Robbie was the best thing in it.<br/><br/>Then Wonder Woman (2017) came-reassuring me that there was hope for the franchise and finally gave us a superhero movie that fit the sensibilities of it's source material. So when Justice League (2017) was nearing, I thought there could be some hope. Justice League was just as well a ""mixed bag"", but not exactly the same mixture as Batman v Superman. It seemed that it's tone was everywhere-and I can go on all day about it.<br/><br/>Aquaman (2018), however, is in fact a good film. It's performances were strong, especially Yahya Abdul's-Mateen II's Black Manta and Patrick Wilson's Ocean Master. Momoa makes Aquaman his own, and even sort of gives a ""Jack Burton"" vibe to his performance. Amber Heard is also pretty good, but the chemistry between the two seemed at moments forced, albeit brief. I have always been a fan of the Aquaman comics growing up. Granted, as good of a film this was, it had flaws-particularly with it's choice in songs for certain scenes. The cinematic score was solid, but the soundtrack for this film derailed the film's momentum at some points, and truth be told, if you're going to use a cover of a Toto song, just use Toto. The film also suffers from too much exposition in it's story-but it suffers like a a two-day cold, well, more like a ten minute cold in Aquaman's case. But the film gets things right with everything else. What was the most entrancing was the extravagant cinematography (yes, there is some heavy handed CGI that is utilized-but it doesn't hurt the film), and the scope of Atlantis and it's lore are well established. James Wan once again makes a good film, and it's refreshing to see a DC hero that we as an audience never seen before attempted on the screen (nor television for that matter) come to life, and handled well.<br/><br/>But give this film a chance, because it is in fact good. Hopefully this well set the scene for the DCEU in the near future, but I've been fooled before.,,"

Phenomenal Adventure and Impressive graphics story stands strong. Every character has its role and action is the best of 2018 after infinity .No doubt in that .I Happy and I am satisfied. Your money you spend on this movie will be worthwhile . Go for it without hesitation
For me 1.Man of steel 2.Aquaman 3.Wonderwoman 4.Justice League 5.BVS"

","This film would have been great if it came out a few years back...Now it's those kind of superhero origin stories people are getting a little bit tired of. The storytelling is old school and safe, about how a special kid is grown to become a hero, and the obstacles our young-hero has encountered and conquered, which eventually turned him into a real hero and all...The plot is predictable, and there are quite a few awkward moments that absolutely can't bear second thoughts. But anyway it's a popcorn movie, what should we expect more?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, on the contrary, it is quite decent a superhero film that I've watched so far this year. The choreography is good, the actors are great. It's only because all the high hopes that I had for it after seeing the critics. Some people compared it to the Star Wars, but to be honest I don't find any resemblances."

","That line from Aquaman to his defeated half-brother as he lead away summed up nicely my need for counselling after seeing this utterly forgettable drivel.<br/><br/>From reliance to on deep meaningful stares to replace acting to a back story time line that contradicts itself whenever the paper this plot requires, Aquaman is once more proof that apart from Wonder Woman, the DC universe films aren't great - they aren't even good.<br/><br/>Aquaman's character seems as equally confused as the CGI action at points. After condemning Manta Ray's father to death at the opening of the film for ""killing innocents,"" Aquaman at the end regrets not saving him and having made an enemy.<br/><br/>The film at point feels like it can't decide if it wants to be a super hero movie, an Indiana Jones type artifact hunt, a homage to Jason and the Argonauts or movie with a environmental message. Instead it tries to be all and misses the mark on each one.<br/><br/>The villain is one dimensional- until he cries when reunited with his long lost mother - while the story is utterly predictable with no surprises or twists to keep the audience guessing or engaged. After half a hour I'd lost all engagement with the film and for the first time this year I found myself wishing that the movie would soon be ending.<br/><br/>Whilst not as painful as a tooth extraction, such a visit to the dentist could arguably be more entertaining that this damp squib."
"gatsby601","4","4","14","19 December 2018"," Soggy THOR Clone Reverts to Camp Over Quality
","Two brothers fight over a throne that will allow the winner to guide the destiny of multiple kingdoms/worlds etc. The younger brother is an usurper who lies and murders his way to the crown while the older brother is reluctant to accept the responsibility of the office.<br/><br/>Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Aquaman is very familiar from the 'sky bridge' needed to enter Atlantis to the quest to be worthy of a signature weapon we've seen this all of this before only done much better.<br/><br/>And with Loki. No Loki here. Only lots of CGI fish.<br/><br/>I don't mean to pick on Aquaman the character, I didn't expect much from the Wonder Woman film and I came away very impressed and I was willing to give this outing a chance but, God, from the corny dialogue to the idiotic aquatic theme - sharks with lasers strapped to them? - Aquaman is hard to watch after Marvel has raised the bar so high over the last 15+ years.<br/><br/>Aquaman starts taking on water early on, with far too many gosh darn earnest speeches about uniting two worlds, a remarkably clumsy origin story designed to explain how Atlantis went from being, you know, up there to down below and worst of all, a main villain so bland the writers added a SECOND supporting villain who pops up every now and again for the odd inconclusive battle.<br/><br/>Finally, all of this 1970s Saturday morning cartoon level idiocy drags on for a good two plus hours so be sure to set your wake up call for the 68th minute because that's how long you'll have to wait for the first bit of action that doesn't involve talking to fish.<br/><br/>Pixar elevated animated films from kids only dribble to mainstream entertainment because they created interesting characters and thoughtful stories. Richard Donner, Tim Burton and later Marvel would do the same with the superhero films. Basically, they made them better then they had to be. Aquaman is a huge step backwards. Uninspired and dumb I was reminded more of the 1980 Flash Gordon film then anything from recent years. Another bit of evidence that DC is throwing stuff at the wall hoping something will stick."
"markr_smith","3","4","14","16 December 2018"," Visually OK but plot was weak and movie was full of holes
","So yeh, visually I thought the movie wasn't that bad. The problem (for me) was the plot and script.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, the movie was dumb. Let's put this into a stripped down summary:<br/><br/><ul><li>At some point in history ('when people thought the world was flat') Atlantis was an all powerful mecca that had advanced technology. However, they overreached and ended up blowing the place up and sinking it below the sea. &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, sure... I guess.... how did a bunch of people get so much more advance than the rest of the world exactly? But anyway...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then, the King went into exile because he was all upset about what he'd done.. &gt;&gt;&gt; OK, fine.. seems like a pretty poor ruler.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>But wait, he's a good guy really because he wanted the 'one true king' or something, to one day come and get his trident 'to unite the surface and land people'. Wait... there wasn't any issues with the land people before... why was the king bothered about that? Why didn't he just fix it himself?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I digress... So, the king sets up this stupid elaborate treasure hunt. First he, puts a message in a bottle.. why a bottle - do sea people drink out of bottles?... and hid it in a place under the Sahara desert - apparently when you fall under the sand in the sahara desert you end up in a deep cavern THAT HAS SUNLIGHT. Oh, and did I mention that this place is some kind of forge where the trident was made - and it's been there since the Sahara was actually under water... wait... that was around 7 million years ago... really?? So, yeh... then they have to find the message in a bottle in this ancient forge place (that can only be accessed with a drop of water... dumb) and this bottle needs to be placed in the hands of a statue of a roman king to show where the trench is.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then the king wanted the treasure hunter to sail to the Trench (which, can I just point out is an area in the sea filled with big ugly monsters... how has nobody sailed through this place before and been attacked? - how does the world not know about this place that has millions of monsters in it??), go through it to the 'Center of the Earth' (which is apparently some kind of portal into another dimension... why call it the center of the Earth I don't know... it has sunlight) and get past an enormous monster.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All of this gets you a shiny golden trident. Did the King not take his medication or something? What's his deal? Surely anyone that found that place was going in to certain death if they weren't Aquaman.</li></ul><br/><br/>I was just sat there laughing at this dumb elaborate treasure hunt the whole time. My wife, on the other hand, was laughing at the jokes (at them, not with them).<br/><br/>On top of stupid plot line, there were numerous gaffs.<br/><br/><ul><li>When fighting the dude with the big bug head, Aquaman got blasted pretty badly.. he came out without a mark on him.. fine.. but his clothes shouldn't have</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of clothes... there were a few iffy random wardrobe changes there when there really shouldn't have been. AND there weren't wardrobe changes when there should have been. Like when they got to the Sahara and flew across it in their outfits, which they then apparently continued to wear all the way to Sicily</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of random travel... they went from a whale's mouth in the middle of the ocean to the coast of Africa - got some clothes and apparently chartered a plane across the desert. They try to con us that they had a bag full of sea gold.. but no, no they didn't have that. They literally just escaped from the Ring of Fire battle and swam into a whale. There were no bags of gold involved.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then, how did they get to Sicily?? They had fallen deep underground.. in the middle of the desert. Did they walk to Europe??? Seriously.. DC??</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I understand it must have been difficult with all the water/land changes, but there were plenty of times hair was swaying around when they were in air pockets.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fish boy whose father got killed... why are you helping the man that killed him? Literally, when Aquaman shows up at the end and is clearly there to kick his stop his brother... why is that little boy helping the bad guy? He killed your father for no reason... right in front of you... stop helping him!!</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on.. but come on DC. You think you can just make a movie with action and CGI and expect to rival Marvel. Marvel make compelling plots and have people on set that actually check that their movies make a shred of sense. For a movie that cost around $160 mil to make, you would think someone on the set would be like 'But they're underground.. in Africa... how do they get to Sicily? Also, why is there sunlight in here?'...."

"bluepink","Null","5","20","14 December 2018"," Aquaman isn't relateable
","As a whole, I enjoyed the movie but I have some constructive criticism:<br/><br/>1. I didn't feel a connection to Aquaman. The opening scene was great, but after that... he was quickly thrown into the position of trying to save the world, before we got to know and find out more about him as a person. e.g. what does he do on a daily basis? Some context would have built more connection, understanding and likeability of the character. The bar scene with his dad was great, and personally I think more of that would have been beneficial.<br/><br/>2. Normally in a movie you have a clear idea of beginning, middle and end (even if they're following the comic book). Initially I had a clear understanding of what Aquaman's mission was, but too many things came in the way, and it was not re-established what Aquaman was doing. I think this is a key principle for really great movies.<br/><br/>3. Some of it was cringy and clichÃ© e.g. a perfect example is the kissing scene. We all knew they would get together in the end, and when they finally did, it was just an awkward scene and there was no chemistry (I'm not sure if this was due to the acting / script / directing).<br/><br/>4. Lack of diversity - I'm not one to pipe up about diversity, but there were only 2 black characters who happened to be evil, and one of them had a questionable name. I get that it relates to the comic book, but because of the way it looks on camera, I would have suggested more diversity in other aspects of the movie to mitigate this."

I have really liked every other DC universe movie, and I can only imagine the star power involved in this dogs dinner was as a result of how good Wonder Woman was...... James wan doesn't make decent horrors, so why he thought he could make a fantasy I'll never know. I will be telling everybody I meet to avoid this movie.

Its like the director said to himself "" how many scenes can we put Momoa in slow motion and an awkward pose after an action sequence. I felt no connection between any of the characters beside one scene. When Momoa is talking to the guardian of the Trident and you never even saw the face of the monster talking.

The Underwater scenes are those non ever seen on screen and a cinematic experience is a must for this one 😍.<br/><br/>Plot & Story<br/><br/>The begging is a slow start and somehow hints that this would be another disappointing DC film as scenes are rushed. For me Narration is just a lazy style of story telling(not a fan) and it does turn me off, but they added present day narration and flash Backs which make it kind of Unique and i would give it a pass for that. The other thing is that the story is plan simple and straight to the Origin story of Establishing the Plot.<br/><br/>Action & Humor<br/><br/>Action packed film with good fight scenes and well directed Camera Shoots 😱😱 There is one you already saw in the Trailer and it Is well done. After Watching this Film Aquaman ranks Just after Superman and Wonder Woman(sorry Batman but its true) Watching this film makes me Hate Justice League even more as Aquaman is very Powerful and should have been utilized in that film. In terms of Humor 11 out of 20 jokes are funny is all i will say.<br/><br/>Where does it stand among DCEU films?<br/><br/>Maybe some will disagree, but There is Batman The Dark Night and then AQUAMAN. Yes i said it, it second best.<br/><br/>Conclusion.<br/><br/>You dont need to be a comic book or Super Hero fan to enjoy this movie.

"diegojosmer","3","5","22","14 December 2018"," Probably the only one
","So yesterday I got the chance to see Aquaman, and I truly did not know what to expect. I had only seen the first trailer, but went into the theatre since I really enjoy DC/Marvel/Superheroe movies. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't it for me.
The main driving factor is the screenplay, or mainly the way the plot was taken care of. The beginning of the movie really threw me off since there was almost no exposition of the characters. I'm aware Aquaman and Mera were technically introduced in Justice League, but that doesn't change the fact that I think a couple of minutes to further present the character interactions would've helped.
Then there's the fact that I felt that some of the action sequences just threw too much into the situation. The film is a great achievement of CGI and Visual Effects, but sometimes less is best. And I'm not talking about the Atlantian effects, because those were perfect and stunning, I mostly refer to the last action sequence where the writers mostly knew the studio would give them millions of dollars, so they decided to go all in.
I applaud James Wan for presenting the underwater scenes in such an amazing way but the ""real-world"" scenes needed to showcase the same amount of quality as the underwater ones, which left the movie feeling really unbalanced.
Something that had never happened to me is being irritated by the score/soundtrack. I think the score did not know exactly what it wanted to do with the movie, and there was no real consistency with the way it wanted to musicalize the film. What was truly absurd was how in the middle of the movie after an intense and big action sequence they decided to throw in an upbeat Pitbull song. I started laughing out loud because I couldn't believe they decided to include that.<br/><br/>This movie just didn't work to me as a whole and I got tired in the middle of the movie because of how much was happening. If you're a fan of superheroe movies and love those big budget all in action sequences, then you probably will leave the theatre really satisfied."

Colorful costumes and armor (because the film is a deluge of colors & textures, which I personally love). The construction of the film is coherent and the whole piece is really well thought out visually. Each plan makes an impression ; I would say that it is a production that has confidence in its qualities and that puts each of its assets forward, in a frisky & uninhibited way. And of course, action scenes, fighting & battles = badass ++ big slap of awesomeness.<br/><br/>Then it is clearly also an adventure film in the pure sense.
Jason Momoa (Arthur/Aquaman) and Amber Heard (Mera) have a great complicity. And everything about Arthur's parents brings a great emotion to the story ...<br/><br/>That's it ! 🔱"

","I will say a little but it will describe it all. Over all it was entertaining and no boring momens! I was a bit distracted with the robot type people just felt it was Star Wars in the water . I must give the biggest credit to the director James wan with an amazing job. Fight scenes were not cliche and not too long And overlydone. Great execution to every detail of action scenes and surprise factor. Perfect visuals although the script is a bit cheesy for me. The 2 hour movie never felt so long I was entertained till the end and good flow of movie with the climax very well executed . Some movies don't have climax because everything is in climax and it just is overlydone and felt too much but this movie has a perfect timing . Definitely a Must watch movie !!! and don't believe the negative reviews which are mostly marvel fans . I'm not a marvel or dc loyalist fan . I basically love super hero movies!!! This is one I can say bravo!!!"
"paulclaassen","8","2","6","11 June 2019"," Well done, James Wan!!
","Wow, wow, wow! Trust horror director James Wan to take a superhero movie to an entirely different level. This was so different to the other superhero movies out there.<br/><br/>Firstly, blood hell, the visuals are great. The fighting scenes are brutal and violent. Jason Momao is sensational as Aquaman. It simply wouldn't have been the same without him. He is very natural and does the character justice. I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was also weak at times and vulnerable, and not a super god.<br/><br/>'Aquaman' is visually stunning! Atlantis is portrayed as a bright, colorful, breathtakingly beautiful place. The costumes are incredible, and cleverly incorporates marine elements. The photography is also amazing, and I absolutely loved the score. I enjoyed the inclusion of the Roy Orbison song 'Mystery Girl' in such a modern film.<br/><br/>The film is unpredictable and sometimes action abruptly ends tranquil moments. Unlike most Marvel films, the humor was at the right moments, appropriate and actually funny. For some reason I honestly believed I wouldn't enjoy 'Aquaman', believing it to be just another superhero 'been there done that' movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely LOVED it. I loved the characters. I loved the story. I loved the entire production. This was awesome!"

","Okay, I definitely could have done without the octopus playing the drums, but Aquaman isn't the dud that many claim it to be. It's certainly better than many of DC's dark and dreary superhero movies, a visually impressive treat for the eyes (and I'm not just talking about Amber Heard in her green skintight costume!) and, ignoring a few contrived plot details, a hugely entertaining romp.<br/><br/>Director James Wan has created a DC movie that, for once, looks and feels like a comic-book come to life, with jaw-dropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful. The story is clichÃ©d baddies versus goodies nonsense, but I think that's the point: this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made Nolan's Batman films such a bore. It's got Willem Dafoe riding a shark, for Christ's sake - it's not meant to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa plays Arthur, son of a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman). When he grows up, Arthur is convinced by stunning redhead Atlantean Mera (Heard) to claim his rightful place as king of Atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers. Unfortunately, his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is intent on war...<br/><br/>At almost two and a half hours long, this could have easily run out of steam, but Wan keeps things moving at a lick, introducing more and more bonkers action, building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the shark-riding Atlanteans, with Momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths. Oh, and Nicole Kidman spends twenty years in Jurassic Park at the centre of the Earth! It's all so gloriously daft, and so stunningly rendered that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.<br/><br/>The film does overstep the mark occasionally, with some the humour falling flat, and I struggle to believe that a) Aquaman and Mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to Sicily, and b) the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years, but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses.<br/><br/>7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead Heard."

The visuals were great, story was good and stayed on course throughout the movie. I had some doubts on underwater action scenes, but they did really well. Jason Momoa does a great job portraying Aquaman in this. My only letdown is kind of the ending, personally it felt slightly rushed, but then again the movie was already over 2 hours long. I know people are very skeptical of watching the movie given It's from DC and not Marvel (I had many friends saying this is why they won't watch the movie) however I did, and I didn't regret it."

","The P.H. Metric 60.5/100 The P.H. Metric<br/><br/>In short, Fast and the Furious logic and storytelling in water, but I am sure that is what people are expecting, so enjoy.<br/><br/>*********************************Light spoilers********************************<br/><br/>Directing: 6/10<br/><br/>The directing is decent there is a reason Wan keeps getting big budget jobs, but it is only a little bit more than average as it slams everything in your face. Wan's directing style is more like a comedy that continually keeps firing jokes at you so that you will forget any of the ones that did not work and only focus on the fun stuff.<br/><br/>Acting: 3/10<br/><br/>Not sure if it was the actors or the script, but for the most part, it was very hammy as they say and I am sorry did they read the script and go wow we are recreating a cheesy 1980's action flick let us cast Lundgren in it so that we can show how meta we are. (Also the cheesy 80's style songs as well.)<br/><br/>Cinematography: 6/10<br/><br/>I love cinematography it is probably my favourite aspect of a film, but I cannot entirely agree with the shots in this film. For example, the shot when the two are on the boat with the sun over Aquaman's right shoulder. I would not take a personal photo that has the sun burning out my retinas why would I think to put it in my film. Again the action is used to hide the framing and use of the shots, but ultimately it is far from stellar especially in the undersea war near the end.<br/><br/>Editing 8/10<br/><br/>Editing feels reasonably tight. You can see a few times where it could have been tweaked. A slight pet peeve of mine is when you know the camera just got rocked by a colossal set-piece run amok, which breaks the illusion of the experience and reminds me that I am not immersed.<br/><br/>Score/sound effects: 8/10<br/><br/>Sound effects team. Excellent job, no fault there. Score, not so much it comes off as cheesy and a throwback to a time that mainstream blockbusters have long forgotten.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Visual effects team did a great job and they deserve all the credit in this film. Not writing, not directing, not any other factor. If people love this film in any way it is down to the visual effects. Great job.<br/><br/>Writing: 1/10<br/><br/>Wow! Did someone steal a script from a 1980's Arnold film and say that is good enough because that is what it feels like. Everything is cliche. Everything. Right down to the kiss the two leads share during the war scene, and she does the left leg lift.<br/><br/>Production Design: 7/10<br/><br/>Was decent enough, but the details were not there. I suppose that can be forgiven given what the director was asking of you.<br/><br/>Costume Design 7/10<br/><br/>The people I went to the theatre with literally said ewww, when they saw the costumes, and they loved this film. Again not sure if these designs were forced on the department or not, but they seemed to miss the mark.<br/><br/>Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10<br/><br/>I want to give them a ten for Kidman. They made her appear exceptionally young, but there were little hiccups here or there, and a little bit of age would have been appreciated on her character. Especially toward the end as the comparison when her and her partner hug at the end seemed quite odd."

I fell asleep twice in the theatre but was woken up by some decent action choreography. Overall it was watchable but the story was weak, the underwater scenes cartoon like with poor CGI and poor acting from Amber Heard who just does not have the screen presence to play a Queen. James Wan did an admirable job with a B grade superhero as it could have been much worse. I rate this a notch above Black Panther which wasn't that great either IMO.

The CGI/special effects/costumes are REALLY bad! Some reviewers mentioned that they look like the Power Rangers and I agree, they really do. I also think there should be some physical differences between underwater people and regular people. They didn't have any fins or scales or anything like that. The only thing that was different was their wardrobe which, as mentioned, was really bad!<br/><br/>The script also needed a lot more work in my honest opinion. I wish they'd put more emphasis on the way the two brothers were raised and their claim to the throne instead of on all those stupid wars and fights.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the actors did a great job! I really like Jason Momoa! Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe also did a great job.

","A fun movie and Jason Momoa is good as Aquaman/Arthur Curry. However the movie Aquaman seems to borrow heavily from Thor: Ragnarok, which is a superior and better made movie. The story is simple, but the underwater talking voices can be irritating and there are many underwater Kingdoms to track of. Its a colorful movie, there is plenty of action and some nice locations. As far as comic book movies go, Aquaman is slightly better than average."

The Trench? Wasted. Mera? Screwed. Black Manta? Wasted. Aquaman? Completely screwed. Jason Momoa as an actor for Aquaman? Completely wasted, although I believe
with the right script and production he would have been great.<br/><br/>And please be aware that I write this as a true fan of DC graphic novels and movies.<br/><br/>I think this is a perfect example of what happens when cinema is made to make hundreds of millions and not to be art."

","Was disappointed that this movie was not better as I expected far more than what I saw. As many others have reviewed this movie I will keep mine short. The two biggest issues I had were the casting choices of Kidman and Wilson and the length. I like Kidman as an actress, but feel she is only in here for face recognition due to the many low level poor actors used. A waste of her talent. Patrick Wilson is so far from a believable villain as to be almost a parody of himself. I realize that there are probably a lot of A list actors that don't want anything to do with some of the super hero movies, but there must have been someone that could have been more threatening. My second beef is with the length of the movie. No reason at all for this to run almost 2 1/2 hours. Not enough story to fill that time.<br/><br/>To end on a positive note, some of the special effects are pretty decent."

So, firstly, props to Jason Momoa for bringing the grit and toughness to this superhero. He makes Aquaman cool, if for the first time ever. Also, the movie is beautiful. The fight scenes are well shot and the CGI makes every land a picturesque landscape of color and flash. Also, Amber Heard is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. Her red hair and outfits pop every time she's on the screen. The story, however, is kind of all over the place. How do they stop pollution? Isn't it a bad thing to let someone die? What are these people's motives? The film feels like its a bit too long as well. Did I enjoy the experience of the movie? Yes. Would I watch it again like I would other current superhero films? No. Still, great job making Aquaman a cool and valuable character again in the DC Universe."
"punisherversion1","5","1","2","13 June 2019"," It's so busy
","Aquaman:
Directed by James Wan. Written by Geoff Johns, James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall<br/><br/>Aquaman is a character that many people have long since thought to be an incredibly silly idea. He talks to fish and lives underwater. He will sometimes fight crimes taking place on the high seas. Justice League introduced him to the world as a beer chugging bad ass saving the world from aliens. No one and I mean nobody thought this movie would have been good or even a success for that matter. It was a huge success. Was the movie any good though? Eh somewhat.<br/><br/>This is a very busy film. Something is always happening at a fast pace. They are having a scene on the beach where Willem Dafoe's character Vulko is training Jason Momoa's Aquaman to fight for the throne in the future, the camera is spinning around and around and around. This is just one example. The underwater scenes are filled with so much detail. It is incredible to watch what all these animators are able to accomplish. What those hundreds of thousands of animators working overtime for exposure were able to accomplish is impressive. I am of the mind that when a movie is this full of CGI, it might as well be an animated movie. There is almost nothing in it that's real. It's beautiful and impressive but not real.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is it's not a superhero film. At least not in the traditional sense. It's a prophecy film, a fantasy film. Kingdoms warring over the throne. It's without a doubt a fantasy film. It works in those perimeters. It delivers this world and all the characters work in simplistic terms. The movie is incredibly flashy and won't stop. It tells you what you're supposed at every turn. While all the visuals are filled with details, the script and characters are delivered in the most basic way. They have only character trait and they play it well. I didn't believe a word of it with the exception of Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master.<br/><br/>Man he plays it up. He is acting his ass off. Most of the time he is solemn and barely shows emotion. Not as Ocean Master, he is selling the evil and his bigotry against the surface dwellers and his brother. He was the best part for me. I don't know why but man I laughed at him calling himself Ocean Master but he was going to be the best Ocean Master he could be. He was true to Atlantis and its way of life. He's tired of the pollution and he wants to control all the kingdoms to wage war against the surface for their constant crap.<br/><br/>I didn't feel any suspense because Aquaman is basically invincible unless he's fighting King Orm. This is a trend in recent superhero movies, I know this is not a superhero film generally, where the hero is so powerful that nothing seems to phase them. I hate it. My favorite heroes have flaws and have to work to win or survive. Aquaman is way too powerful to feel like anything won't go his way.<br/><br/>In the end, it's entirely too long. It is entirely too flashy. It could have benefited from slowing down just a bit but the visuals are terrific, Patrick Wilson is stealing the show and it is fun for most of the runtime. I give this movie a C."
"StevieG338","5","1","2","10 June 2019"," Worth a watch but not a great film
","I watched the film with no expectations either way and to some up - it's not garbage but it's not great.<br/><br/>There are some ridiculous elements - every characters entrance requires a slow motion taking a helmet off sequence.... hammy as hell; in the realms of nipples on the Batsuit. There is a lot of stuff thrown in to try force humour into DC that doesn't land or is just awful.<br/><br/>There are some good elements - fight scenes with Aquaman are good, his parents relationship actually means something, Dolf Lundgren being 100% Dolf, etc.,<br/><br/>I would rush to see it but would watch if it was on the TV."
"dereksorensen","6","1","2","2 June 2019"," Did I just watch a super hero movie or a live action animé?
","Let me start off my simply putting, NO- I did not like this movie. I will get into that later. However, there is some impressive work done in this movie that does deserve credit.<br/><br/>The visuals of the whole film are pretty well done. Most of what I am referring to takes place in the under water CGI world. Director James Wan has always liked soft blue's and strong red's in his movies. It is cool to see how that transitioned into an underwater action film. The visual world can SOMEWHAT be compared to the visual world of James Cameron's Avatar.
The action was another crowing jewel in the film. The section of the storyboard which was action did better than any other DCU movie. Everything about it was entertaining and left my attention closely tied to the screen. The fighting choreography was very impressive.
When you combine the amazing visuals with creative action- you really do find something to awe at. If you watch this movie for any reason, watch it for this.<br/><br/>...and I guess Jason Momoa is a pretty fun actor.<br/><br/>Now for why I did not particularly love this move...
Did anybody else feel like they were watching a live action animé? This film had every cliché moment and cheesy line in the book. The whole thing is built much like an animé piece. Corny screen play, corny dialogue between characters, rushed dialogue, rushed story board, and corny movie scores that come on too often and too hard. Not to diss on animé, I just don't think it works well within live action hero movies.
Its tasking for the audience to take any serious moment honestly serious. This film was just written with too many cheese filled lines. It is easy to feel like you are watching a Disney Channel Orignal Movie.
With a cool actor like Jason Momoa, you have the opportunity to have some pretty good comic relief. Though the writers of the film did try to capitalize on this, they failed epically. To make it worse, any funny part of this movie was scored with stupid piano Disney style music.
The movies cheese and corn meter sky-rocketed as the film went down the montage check list. The ""falling in love montage"", the ""training montage"", the ""bad guy gearing up montage"" and enough surprise explosions to make a montage.<br/><br/>Over all, I was pretty disappointed with the film.
If you ever find your self just wanting to watch a popcorn action flick, this one isn't too bad. If you ever find yourself wanting to watch a well written and creative film, avoid this one at all costs."
"Here_2_Review","9","1","2","1 June 2019"," Why is this in the DCEU? Deserves better than that...
","So, I have watched Aquaman and I am ashamed that I almost didn't! I almost decided not to because I really hated Batman vs Superman with a passion.... AQUAMAN WAS PRETTY DANG GOOD!!!! I really hope that Aquaman 2 happens!<br/><br/>A lot of people on a different thread of mine said that Aquaman was crap and all that... WERE WE WATCHING THE SAME MOVIE???!!!! It is the best DCEU movie since Wonder Woman. Officially a fan of Aquaman now! Did not expect the badassery in this! One of the best parts of the movie is Black Manta jumping Arthur and Mera in that small town they were in... My gosh, what an immersion!!!! The camera work, the visuals, the sfx, the fight choreography, JAMES WAN is brilliant!!!! He knows his superhero movies and his horror films XD Good stuff!!!! Black Manta turned out to be a really cool character! I thought he was only the movie opener but I was very wrong.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master... Wow... What a performance! He is not exactly known for these kinds of movies and he really owned his role! Reminded me of Loki. He was not even corny at all! Just right! Dolph Lundgren was also really good in this movie too! He's known for his tough guy brute characters, but I really bought his performance in this.<br/><br/>Amber Heard was also great in this. Thankfully her performance didn't suck in this and she really had some shining moments in this, especially the wine scene..... I say ""thankfully"" because I know about her irl status... At least I think it's true. Cannot picture Depp being a beater. Just cannot do it.<br/><br/>The visual effects were absolutely beautiful..... I mean, they even handled everybody being all floaty underwater VERY well, I mean the hair, clothing, jewelry, the detail is stunning, from big and small! I was happy that I was able to take even actors who are known for brutal edgy roles seriously, like Lundgred, Dafoe, Momoa....yes I remember him very well for Khal Dragon.<br/><br/>Everything was just done VERY well.... Any flaw that I may have noticed was very small. I noticed how in a flashback, Vulko was talking to a teenage Aquaman during pitchfork training about his mother being killed, I could tell Vulko was lying, they never touched back on that later in the film, when Aquaman's mother returns.... I also noticed that the teen's acting was not very wonderful. Wasn't horrible, but he did not put enough emotion into it.<br/><br/>Another thing, as the movie was coming to a close, I was afraid that Black Manta's storyline wasn't gonna be revisited in the movie and was very disappointed when the movie ended, then the credits happened. I take it Manta will be the villain in part 2! That was a neat storyline. I would have preferred Manta's story be revisited during the film, but I guess it would have been too much.<br/><br/>I was VERY impressed with how they handled the plot structure! They handled the Ocean Master storyline and Manta's very well, by having them connect in a particular way, and it was very good!<br/><br/>One more thing, I am happy that I totally bought Aquaman and Mera's relationship in the movie. They played off each other VERY well and it all totally worked. They had wonderful chemistry! Mera's character was great! I really liked her place in the movie.<br/><br/>I seriously hate that this and the WW franchise are part of the DCEU because they are too good for that weak universe.... They should be licensed elsewhere, however that works.<br/><br/>One thing that reminded me of my enjoyment is how fast it went by. By the time I had paused to do something, it was already an hour in and it kinda felt like ten minutes!<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10. A very watery, wonderful ride that really kept everything in check and was brilliantly paced and consistent, minus a couple of small errors that are totally forgettable. The role of Aquaman totally belongs to Momoa and him alone. One of my favorite more lighthearted superhero films. I gotta see more"

","While the DCEU does have its fair share of stinkers, Aquaman is not one of them. It has an interesting story set after Justice League where Arthur Curry, who is now known to the people as The Aquaman, goes on a journey to Atlantis to stop a deadly war between the oceans and the surface by his half-brother Orm, while discovering his true destiny. The characters are good as well. Aquaman is basically a fish out of water who is clueless about his true role while Mera is a great heroine who aids him in his search. Orm is a good main antagonist while Black Manta is brought in as a secondary villain, and has a good fight with Aquaman. And while the movie does have so much special effects, they are put to good use, especially for the underwater segments. This is a good movie and is worth watching."

","How could I possibly encapsulate all this film has to offer better than others before me? This film has what I will call ""Venom Syndrome"" which means it switches genres every 10-20 minutes. It seems to have no clue what it wants to be and it also seems there were several writers tasked with certain types of scenes and it is...glaringly obvious.<br/><br/>Like others have said, there are several scenes where it's like watching a live-action Little Mermaid in which the ""romance"" is more painful to watch than Hayden Christensen harass Natalie Portman into Stockholm syndrome in Attack Of the Clones.<br/><br/>Then it tries to emulate Star Wars in many ways (even underwater space-battles), make a brief statement on man's environmental impact once in a while, turn Aquaman into a freaking water-bending prophecied one, introduce some gadgets that make Spy Kids look practical, Aquaman apparently exists within the Monster verse with kaiju, and can we please talk about the CHEESY armor the soldiers from Atlantis wear? Good god, it looks like they went to the value bin at the studio and took out the rejects for Tron and Super Mario Bros.<br/><br/>The best things I can say about this film is the cinematography is very nicely done, and the special effects/CGI is rather excellent save for some de-aging for flashbacks. The hair effects underwater are noticeably superior to any I've personally seen and the color palate is spectacular.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This film is a visual spectacle, but with a schizophrenic script, subpar writing, and some truly incompetent chemistry/acting it is like experiencing the fever dream of Gary Busey himself and it is not exactly easy."

Wonder woman was great but I could do without Professor Lupin being the villain with his jacked God body and little nerdy head. Still great though.

Why they got criticized so harshly and this is praised I am baffled. From beginning to the very end it was awful. I would not even recommend renting this. It was a waste of a night for me.

"samuelakrom","3","1","2","11 April 2019"," Unfortunate attempt..
","Aquaman is nothing like the other Superheros we have recently seen come from the DC Universe. Traditionally, this mighty king was known as an Aryan-looking Atlantean who wore orange and green spandex. In addition to his striking fashion he wielded an intimidating golden trident, representing power, in defence of his kingdom. However, in the most recent movie, this stalwart image is replaced with a powerful Hawaiian who is covered in tribal tattoos and shaggy hair. This change brought shock to DC fans across the world. They were expecting tradition, similarity to the comic books that they so dearly loved. This is one of the many reasons why Aquaman is receiving questionable reviews. If evaluated solely on entertainment, a story about a forbidden child who returns to claim the throne from a tyrant and saves billions of lives in the process, the movie sounds extremely interesting. However, the plot was weak, the acting was far from perfect and aside from the occasional surprise, the 2 ½ hour movie was fairly predictable.
Just years ago, the mere mention of creating an ""Aquaman"" movie was quite literally laughed upon in HBO's ""Entourage"" series as he was considered relatively useless to the DC family. However, in a year when no fewer than 10 superhero movies were created, ranging from Incredibles 2 to Black Panther, it suddenly seemed logical to give life to such a well known hero. When I initially saw the previews for this movie, I was ecstatic! I loved reading books about Aquaman as a child and I considered him an inspiring hero. However, as the movie began, I better understood why the Entourage series considered him a joke. First and foremost, there were key details and storylines that did not follow the comic books in any way, shape, or form. For example, the true Aquaman from the comics was a broken man when he was first introduced to Atlantis, yet he overcame an internal struggle and became the man we know him as. Jason Momoa on the other hand, is a boistrus lad who enjoys drinking and fighting with little to no care in the world. When we think of the DC heroes, who comes to mind? A man of matchless strength named Superman? A human vigilante known as Batman? Or how about one of the very first female superheros who is generally known as Wonder Woman? The common ground that these three have is their ability to fight for truth and right in a magnificent way due to their extraordinary gifts and talents. Aquaman is considered by many to be the ""butt of pop culture jokes"", as stated by IGN, because he simply is a man who can swim really fast, talk to fish and breathe underwater. Although this is extremely useful while underwater in his kingdom, many of his talents and gifts do not extend beyond the realm of Atlantis. His strength and instincts are quite impressive regardless of where he is, however, in the earthly realm he is not much of a ""superhero."" Because of this, many consider him quite useless, especially if the DC heroes were suddenly needed, for example, to defend the world from an alien invasion as we commonly see in modern films.
As the movie went on, I found myself bored a times and able to predict scenes fairly consistently. The events were great in theory, but there was simply too much plot and it all moved too fast to really get attached to anyone or anything. By the time you begin to appreciate something, another equally important scene happens and you quickly forget what had just taken place. Marvel, in comparison, does a phenomenal job of weaving together scenes full of action, with simple and informative scenes. Through this, we are able to understand and come to love certain characters, rather than just watching them constantly fight throughout the course of the movie.
Finally, a storyline with as much anticipation as Aquaman brings immediate interest and enthusiasm. However, throughout the movie, certain pieces do not fall into place and we begin reminiscing on the comics and the heros that we idolized all those years ago. I would recommend this movie if you are interested in the DC Universe and want to watch a movie that doesn't require much emotional investment. However, not only was the plot extremely weak, the acting was par at best. If you are interested in a memorable movie that will touch your heart or inspire you, this is far from what you would enjoy."
"craigkatzer","3","1","2","10 April 2019"," Disappointed
","Movieland is saturated by superhero movies. Anymore, I shy away from them because the formula has pretty much been exhausted. I rented this one for a diversion on vacation. My expectations are fairly low these days. I just want an interesting story with good actors which carry the film to the degree that the special effects reinforce them, not carry them. I gave it three stars because it is shiny (not unique shininess though). But the film felt forced and rambling. I took my dog out to pee and didn't miss anything important. It is long and boring. I did think the swirly red scene was interesting visually, but that 30 seconds just seemed to fly bu. If gizmos and big stuff and characters ninja-ing each other work for you then this will be acceptable. If you yearn for semi-original, somewhat cohesive content, you may be disappointed. Too long... too ordinary."

","I'm not sure what the hype is here this film is terribly from start to the highly anticipated finish it has to be the lamest superhero movie of all time. I mean Aquaman the protagonist here is even annoying the guy that plays him looks like a wrestler and acts just as badly as one too. The bad guys are so lame some look like they would fit in a GI Joe film and some look like they would fit in a star wars or space scifi world. Just when I thought it couldn't get any lamer than the Thor actor and character they make a full length Aquaman movie with an actor who is possibly the worst protagonist of all time. The lines are lame the humor attempts are cliche and not funny in the least I also felt a bit childish like some executive let their son help with the writing cause its that shallow and the only thing that is funny about it is the costumes and . I also don't know what people are raving over with the visual I think it's horrible it looks so unrealistic you cant even imagine the characters are there and there are many movies that get it right including some of the other super hero films its not that they didn't also use CGI but they certainly didn't abuse it either. Next thing is the actors Dolph Lungren his movie career was over years ago I think maybe even in the same year he started as hes pretty much always been a B action actor and even then he's pure cheese and his movies unbearably lame I cant believe hes still in movies.William Defoe lets get serious here I would buy him as an alcoholic retired cop or dirty senior cop he just look so out of character and place in this movie.Amber heard is terrible as usual I mean every role she gets she either goes too far or the polar opposite she doesn't want to be there or its a simple script reading. I found in this film she even gives off body language like shes nervous and sometimes like I said she doesn't seem to be into it at all. Patrick Wilson looks so out of place in this and to me hes always been nothing but a second rate fill in actor not fit to be one of the main in a movie hes ruined a lot of films for me.I love Nicole Kidman but not even she could keep this film above water. I wouldnt recommend this film to the worst of my enemies as watching this is a cruel punishment. The way people here dont seem to care about content and don't seem to understand the rating system."

Poor poor Jason, he did the best he could with what he had to work with.

My favorite part is when this Italian guy who is struggling to get up after he is crushed by a building gets saved by aquaman, then the man just walks away completely unaffected. Or maybe the part where aquaman freaks out while dangling from the edge of a small building, after he literally just jumped out of an airplane. Speaking of Italy I lived there for three years and the scene in Sicily looks absolutely nothing like Italy. But I mean if you've lived in one town in America your whole life, stereotypically think that all Italians have Pinocchio books lying around, and can sit for almost three hours without using your brain which can obviously see that every scene looks painfully over rehearsed, and don't care that the main villain calls himself ""the ocean master"" you might actually like this movie.

","As I watched the movie, I quickly realized it was going to be a very bad movie. But as the movie went on, I realized it had some interesting potential that could have made it a really good movie. You have a solid foundation with Jason Mamoa and some good supporting actors such as Willem Dafoe so you have some talent to work with but the storyline and scripting were way off. The underwater dichotomy was too simplistic for a super advanced society. They have all that high end tech and are biologically advanced but had the political mindset of a Feudal System? C'mon. Even the primary weapons were medieval-- a trident? Pretty silly plot devises that just made the movie more awkward. The Black Manta, Brine, and Fishermen Kingdoms were too Power Rangerish, especially Black Manta. The fight scene between Black Manta and Aquaman totally took me back to the 90's--the over the top costume and voice over was hilarious rather than threatening or intimidating. Despite all that weirdness, what I thought had potential was the pushback from the Atlanteans due to the over harvesting and damage of sea life and pollution of the oceans. That was a footnote to the stereotypical struggle for who gets to sit on the throne. If they had focused more on the struggle between Man vs Atlantean conflict, I think that would have been a more interesting story. Dont hang this on Jason Mamoa--this is poor writing and bad directing pure and simple."

","I am not what you would call a DC movie fan, but this one has thoroughly impressed me.
First I will point out what kept me from giving this a full-blown 10: the depth of the characters of the main characters could have dived in deeper. Next, though the action was well done and didn't hinder the flow of story, I wouldn't have mind them skipping a couple of the scenes and allow the story to be carried forward with more dialog/depth.
That said, I knew what I was getting into was going to be a full-blown action, and where that is concerned, it did not disappoint. There were no laggy, over-drawn out sequences, it was interesting visuals and effects. I am ever so grateful I did not have to watch some form of a car chase.
NOW, the good stuff, the creativity of Atlantis, was stupendously beautiful and supreme eye candy. I was ever so delighted, and my eyes feasted on the dazzling colors, coupled with architectural imagery. Bravo!
Nicole Kidman, ability to bring emotional depth, thus was perfectly paired with the fun-loving nature of Jason Momoa, and resulted with injecting a lot of heart into the film.
I really enjoyed this movie."
"aidanratesmovies","7","1","2","23 March 2019"," Messy, but certainly a otherworldly experience
","Aquaman has many faults. Between its messy script, bloated stature, and the fact that it is just too freaking long, you think it would be a total miss. However, what Aquaman lacks in all of these categories, it makes up for with trying actors, and jaw dropping action scenes. The film is predictable at time, and has quite a few cliches, but even with a hard to follow setup (or hard to watch, depending on how you look at it) Aquaman leaves you cheering at the end by a pure sense of an underdog story line. The film has flaws, as does its protagonist, but by the end it'll win your heart, even after the struggles it has made you deal with along the way. The first half of the film can seem like a drag at times, but the second half makes up enough for it. It isn't perfect, but it's a decent try for DC studios, and one that will definitely not be forgotten.
My Rating: 7.25/10"
"CrumbsReviews","8","1","2","18 March 2019"," How The Tides Have Turned
","Going into Aquaman I was pretty hyped, not only is he an overlooked superhero but it has James Wan behind it. While many of us know James Wan for horror films he definitely delivered a great movie in Aquaman. It certainly is not a flawless movie by any means but it is one hell of a good time. I still think Wonder Woman is the best DCEU film but this one is without a doubt second. The film is a beauty with great cinematography and visuals. The actions scenes are very well done especially since 90% of them are underwater. The cast is great as well with Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard being the best choices for Aquaman & Mera. Their chemistry is amazing with one another and it definitely makes them more likable. Yahya as Black Manta was also another amazing cast choice. The film is definitely over the top but it's mad so be over the top. The cheesy over the top moments just made this film more entertaining in my opinion.<br/><br/>Like I said this movie is by no means flawless and does come with some weak aspects. The writing in the film could of been improved and some of the one liners were weak. One of the weakest aspects for me was the score. The score was very basic and forgettable. If it had a better score such as Wonder Womans it might push it over the top to be the best DCEU film. All in all this film is beyond entertaining and anyone can have a good time seeing it."

He was kicked around couple of times and that's it.
It would have been so much better if he and that creature fought really hard and he was injured quite a bit and as they take a break cuz of exaustion the start the chit chat and the creature has a change of heart.

It is packed with amazing fights, adventure and a wonderful underwater world and its creatures. There is quite a dynamic in the characters, and it is good to see that some minor characters also get their chance to shine (Without going into spoilers, there's even a scene where nobody-soldiers have a say in the outcome of a major plot decision)<br/><br/>The area where the movie lacks is dialogue. It is sometimes quite cheesy, and it is clear that DC is trying to add a little humour to the movie. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work in this situation. In any case, it is not tooo bad.<br/><br/>Up until now I had considered Man of Steel to be the best movie of the DCEU. But this to me is much better. That means, to me, it is a lot better than most of MCU movies as well. A very high rewatch value and recommended for everyone"

","While this is arguably the second best DCEU film any reviewer giving this over a 6 has very low expectations for cinema. Furthermore I warn anyone with limited entertainment budget to watching future entries in the DCEU at the cinema until you hear from reviewers you usually agree with.<br/><br/>The movie was ""fun"" but I found the developement of the characters lacking. The villian wasn't intriguing in anyway. Some of the visual were jarringly bad also.<br/><br/>Aquaman's mother, father, and Altantian mentor saved the movie from being just a campy kids movie. It also did a great job of delivering the back story of the history of the underwater kingdoms.<br/><br/>For something you are going to fork other cinema money for it is 4. For home watching I would give a 6. Anything 5 and below you should avoid at the cinema in the opening 2 week or altogether at cinema. But for home viewing I would recommend especially if you have hope that future DCEU movies will be better."

I am getting irritated however with overpowered characters such as Antlana in the beginning of the film who manages to take on 20 of Atlantis' elite soldiers without so much as a scratch or bruise to show for her victory. This is so typical of the modern feminist age we live in where men struggle for their victories, women appear untouchable.<br/><br/>Black Manta looked like something straight out of a Power Rangers movie and the actor who played him was rather bland.<br/><br/>The special effects and cast of fantastic creatures was truly a highlight of the film - every few minutes there were new creatures revealed which came into a might clash with each other in the final epic battle of the film. I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>Aurthur's character seemed believable as far as his development went throughout the film save the last line of the film when he said, ""I am Aquaman."" To this I just cringed. He did not need to refer to himself by this name. I thought the film did a great job at improving the character from the comics up until this last stupid line.

","I had very low expectations going in because of DC films track record. Wonder Women was an above average action movie with casting choices working phenomenally but beyond that it fell short of the competition and personal expectations . Aquaman however, really brings many things I love about movies together well. While in my opinion Wonder Women would be a better action hero like movie than Aquaman, Aquaman does a good job job with this still but also bringing elements the other films, including Wonder Women, simply lacked. It has great and cheesy humor, brings the science fiction to the screen more than just a comic book Esq way but with an expanded hint of mythology and tech, and it takes itself less seriously while still bringing the notion that everything is on the line in a more marvel fashion. Huge fan of Jason Momoa too and thought he did a fantastic job portraying the underrated superhero and Amber Heard took my skepticism that she would just be a tacked on side kick and threw that notion pleasantly out the window too. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero films and I personally was happy to pay to see it."

this is not a masterpiece. its a above average movie because story was fully predictable, trailer contains most of movie best parts and the main problem for this Movie was that it contains many comic movies Cliches which it should have some of them but not this much.

","I had such high hopes for this movie and it just fell short. I think mostly this is down to my age. I had hoped the movie would be slightly more adult than it is.<br/><br/>Jason shines in this role and is by far my favourite aquaman. Yahya also did really well in his role as black lantern. Unfortunately I found the cgi used on other actors facial features somewhat distracting. They all looked like they'd had bad plastic surgery at times.<br/><br/>The underwater scenes were fantastical and the movie is visually beautiful. But for me that isn't enough to justify adding stars. I came for the story and to be entertained. In this respect it failed for me. I felt there were a few holes in the story and his abilities seemed inconsistent.<br/><br/>Another failure was in marrying the comedy with the serious. At times I was watching a dramatic action film at other times a cheap comedy sketch. It never quite pulls off either. I think this was to please the younger audience (since the jokes were both childish and predictable)<br/><br/>One aspect I loved was the ocean throwing out its garbage. Pollution was a theme throughout the movie and I loved this. Hopefully some fans will take note of the message being sent.<br/><br/>Overall I think kids, teenagers and young adults will love this movie. But those of us hoping to finally see an aquaman for grown ups will be disappointed."

","Had no expectations whatsoever coming in to this movie- hadn't even seen a trailer. So I was delightfully surprised to be completely entertained for most of the movie.

Enjoyed most of the main character portrayals too. Momoa was charming and smoldering, Heard was gorgeous and acted her part very well- maybe Willem Defoe was a bit of the odd man out but still did his job like a pro, and everyone else was solid as well. Sure the dialogue was spotty in places and some of the scenes ludicrous, but no worse than many if not most of the superhero movies dominating the screens lately. But for the love of mike, would someone please tell them to quit making these movies so lengthy??

","A tedious to watch movie that doesn't deserve it's hype.<br/><br/>It's all about CGI here. It looks gorgeous. Bright colors, fantastic design of Atlantis, Subnautica-esque bioluminescence. But it feels shallow. There are a lot of underwater scenes, but they never feel like underwater, they feel like everything is floating in zero-G. Nothing in the water, no cavitation, no resistance, everything flies around in top speed like in a space opera. Nothing has weight or feels physical. The fight scenes are well done but become repetitive quite fast.<br/><br/>The actors do very well, but are battling with a boring cliché script. The dialogue is wooden. The story is riddled with clumsy exposition and pointless McGuffins. The characters never come alive. You never feel for them. They never make any meaningful choice that is not obvious. The characters are sad fillers for an idiots adaptation of the monomyth used as an excuse to show of CGI. The villains are beyond one-dimensional.<br/><br/>This makes the whole thing a waste of very good production quality for a forgettable boring move that feels like fast-forwarding through a B-tier video game."

","Aquaman feels like one of those movies that's long overdue in its being released to the world. It's a wonder why this fella never got one theatrical release pre-2018, because so many iconic characters out there are just busting to be featured in these kinds of movies. Aquaman feels like it could have been released in 2004 and still would have had a similar response at the box office. It's got water, action, photogenic people populating the world it's set in and pop-music ranging from the 80s to now. It's got all the hallmarks of a blockbuster that's trying to cater to EVERYONE it possibly can. I guess this is something of a course correction for DC Comics Films.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a step in the right direction in that it's more confident in its direction than Justice League or Suicide Squad were, but it's not the near-perfect movie-comic-mythology synthesis Wonder Woman had going for it. However a step in the right direction is better than a gigantic step backwards.

"cappiethadog","5","1","2","12 January 2019"," Becca goes through the rabbit hole
","Becca(Nicole Kidman) fell into a rabbit hole. The young man who ran over her little boy was right about alternate universes. ""If space is infinite,"" he tells the grieving mother, ""anything is possible"". The title of the film derives from a comic book that Jason(Miles Tenner) created. The plot synopsis goes like this: A boy's father dies. He was a scientist who uncovered a system of interconnected holes to alternate universes. The boy goes looking for him. In one of the panels, from behind a tree, he spies on a man who is indistinguishable from his dad, but it's not dad, interacting with duplicates of mom and himself. He is both here and there, an audience of one watching an actor play the story of his life. The tree is a demarcation; a metaphor for a bunched-up curtain pushed to one side, which separates him from the domestic scene playing out in the front yard. It could be a scene based on real life, his life, from the universe he just departed from. As a passive observer, in a sense, it's like almost being able to touch the movie screen, the filmic world that lies beyond it, a double for the world we live in. To the boy, it's an imitation of life, an adaptation, but in this movie, the screen has no negative space, filled with actors, dopplegangers unaware of their multiplicity, who play the same people from other galaxies. He is an extra; he knows not to walk pass the tree and walk into the ""mis-en-scene"".<br/><br/>The more you think about it, every film is like an alternate universe. For Kidman. sitting at the Palais in Cannes, or in this case, Comic-Con, she sees her twin, just like that boy watching life unfold and go on without him, objectively...and subjectively. It's still her; it's just another version, a queen from Atlantis. The boy, confronted with seeing himself being played by ""himself"", an impersonator, he can't be objective. Gestures, delivery of words, comportment; all these actions are second-guessed, as would an actress. Films, being what they are, self-contained worlds where anything can happen, and in theory, interconnected, with the actor in his/her many guises being the linchpin, Kidman, theoretically finds the portal that allows her to be an Irish immigrant(""Far and Away""), a sociopathic broadcast journalist(""To Die For""), a courtesan(""Moulin Rouge""), or a grieving mother(""Rabbit Hole""). In ""Aquaman"", she is a princess who can breathe underwater and kick ass on land.<br/><br/>The lighthouse keeper finds a strange woman splayed out on the rocks. Tom(Tememura Morrison) presumes she washed-up on shore. He is orientated to think horizontally. But for the sake of phantasmagorical thinking, imagine a scenario in which Becca, similar to the waitress from the A-ha music video for ""Take On Me"", finds passage into the comic book? Furthermore, accepting that hypothetical, imagine again, if ""Rabbit Hole"", the comic book, not the film(or the play it was based on) was adapted for the screen and was renamed ""Aquaman"".<br/><br/>She fell from the sky. She landed on her back. She tumbled out of a wormhole. She is on the same mission as Jason's stand-in, the illustrated boy; to be reunited with a loved one. Becca gets her wish. In ""Rabbit Hole"", she muses aloud, ""Somewhere out there, I'm having a good time."" Becca is an atheist. It's science that comforts her. Becca wants to see her child, not in heaven, but in another world because in another world, Danny is alive. Becca despises angels. If you think about it, they're not much different from the undead. Angels are like flying zombies. Becca wants to undo what as a parent she feels is a transgression. As Queen Atlanna, she gets to start a family all over again. This time, mother keeps son safe, making up for the day she forgot to latch the gate. The atonement is all the more impressive, owing to the degree of difficulty. It takes more than locking the door to keep King Orm's soldiers from bringing harm to her son. She kicks, punches, and throws these invaders all over the house. In ""Rabbit Hole"", beyond the white picket fence, beyond the road where Danny was run over, is the ocean. The mother, a transfigured woman, the queen of Atlantis, watches her son emerge from the water. For Becca, it fulfills a wish from her own world; to see Danny walk through the fence door. Redemption, at last. Finally, the long-awaited hug, the clinch from another universe."
"stevemata","8","1","2","11 January 2019"," Amazing camera work, concept art and interesting Atlantian lore makes for a pretty unique Aquaman movie
","The plot is pretty straightforward, nothing wrong with it and actually features a very strong and satisfying ending after over 2 hours of film. Characters play their role and are sufficiently developed. Unfortunately I can't speak a lot about the acting, because I saw the translated version. Scenography is very good and stays true to the nature of the film.<br/><br/>However, as the title says, camera work is one of the things that is absolute astonishing about this movie. Visuals in this film (specially the one sorrounding Atlantian culture) are breathtaking and a delight to see. Fight scenes flow ridiculously smoothly, but I do have to admit there are moments where they overdo it, but I can count those with one hand's fingers. Weakest points of the visuals are Mera's eyes and the water flow effect that ""zooms"" on certain parts of the screen momentarily, it makes serious moments a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>The ancient Atlantian history and folklore shown in the movie is really entertaining and grants a very entertaining trip through ancient Atlantian landmarks.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a pretty well thought-out and executed movie and its flaws, like overly dramatic scenes and terrible use of music, in come across as pretty meaningless in the bigger picture."

"evan-dahms","7","1","2","11 January 2019"," Most memorable DC film yet
","I was initially hesitant about seeing aquaman since most of the other DC movies that have come out recently were just derivative, generic rubbish (with the exception of wonder woman). However I decided to give it a go and must say I quite enjoyed it. It has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe in that it's very colorful and over the top. Action sequences are extremely well done and quite a few scenes are just stunning in terms of lighting and effects. The story is fairly basic but unpredictable enough compared to the standard superhero movie to be a bit more engaging. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but Jason Mamoa was a perfect casting choice and really steals the show. The pacing is ok, I was never bored but some scenes felt a bit rushed and others seemed to go on for a bit longer than was really necessary. I found myself wanting a bit more humor and a little less campiness (the costumes especially were a bit much for me) but overall I found the film to be enjoyable and refreshing compared to the rest of the DC movies. Aquaman is essentially a big 80's cartoon brought to life with truly stunning cinematography and a strong cast. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion"
"skylermoore","7","1","2","11 January 2019"," DC is in the right direction.
","I was worried we were getting the same formula as Wonder Woman when I first saw the trailer but honestly it's not a bad superhero movies. Not the best but as a standalone movie, (now that the movie universe is pretty much dead) is a good film cgi underwater looked above average, acting was great as it should be with this budget, good story. Just nothing that quite stuck out or made it memorable. If you absolutely love Aquaman or there's not much playing in theaters then give it a shot but you might like it a little more on Redbox. 7/10 for me for being an good above average movie"
"brianpua96","9","1","2","11 January 2019"," Amazing

"basketballkelly","8","1","2","11 January 2019"," One of the best DC film
","The originality of the character is super high (expect Aquaman doesn't have blond hair in this film lol). Otherwise all the characters looks almost alike with the comic! The storyline is also great, it is a pretty well done job to squeeze massive stories from the comic into a 2 hours film. However, I think it is better to read some Aquaman comic first before watch this film. It will make you have better understanding and felt the film's originality from the comic.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that DC has finally on the right track on the film making. I hope they keep their good work for long term. Always prefer dc comic than the marvels.<br/><br/>Plus, I found quite interestingly that in this film for some fighting scenes, I felt like I'm watching Drangon Balls character fighting scenes and doing their fatal blow or doing Kong Fu fighting. And, Nicole Kidman is so hot and wicked in the film, her fighting scenes is awesome!"
"ornelas-49254","4","1","2","9 January 2019"," Fun Green Screen PSA
","I do not want sound like I'm bashing the movie because I didn't expect much from a superhero movie; they're meant to be fun and I completely respect that.
Aquaman is proof that studios want to be safe, have fun, and pump out something for the masses.
The amount of green screen kept throwing me out of the experience, not because it was used but because it was consistently noticeable. The overall theme was to be aware of human pollution and how it affects parts of the world we can not see.
The cliche witty dialogue was also expected but it was the amount of dramatic pauses and slow motions that were unbearable.
Breaking bread, I will say that the choice to track the action versus cutting between shot was refreshing and there were certain visual shots that were great - a favorite being the trench dive."

I liked the cast of Jason Momoa as Aquaman very much, he is perfect for this role. But the movie starts rather boring because they need to tell the long story of the underwater peoples. In the middle there is a shallow adventure episode and in the end a battle which makes you feel like watching a computer game which is sadly state-of-the-art nowadays.
A like Marvel movies because of the funny dialogues and often deep characters and conflicts in the story. I hoped for this, but unfortunately this DC movie can not compete with it."
"gremlyn202","3","1","2","6 January 2019"," Predictable and disjointed
","I really wanted to like this movie. I'll list the things I liked first:
Nicole Kidman as a hero....she never plays characters like this and I liked her casting.
Jason Mamoa is cast well for this part.
Visuals are mostly very good.<br/><br/>Now what I didn't like:
Amber Heard is AWFUL. She has no dimension and no chemistry between her and Momoa. She's not believable as an action star. Her line delivery is so bad it makes you cringe.
The plot...predictable and rushed. If you've seen any superhero movie you'll know the plot within the first 10 minutes.
Script. Wow. It's bad. They don't develop any character, including Momoa, and rush every cliche in the book to try and make this work. Jokes fall flat. Everything just feels halfway done. It's disjointed and relies too heavily on battles that you aren't even sure why they are really happening. It was like we have to introduce this whole world in 2.5 hours so here is as thin as we can do it.
It's way too long. I was bored about halfway through.
The visuals, although good, don't give you enough detail to get invested. And the underwater hair bothered me....sometimes it floated, sometimes it didn't.
Too many villains. Just pick one! The brother or Manta (I think that's his name but honestly I'm not even sure).<br/><br/>
I really feel like they should have done the origin story first and only. Tell me how Momoa was taught about his two worlds. How did he decide to become this hero? How does he meet Dafoe's Character? What does he do on a daily basis? How does he find out about all these issues at sea that he needs to fix?<br/><br/>Then next movie is finding his mom and fighting his brother.<br/><br/>Then next movie is fighting Manta.<br/><br/>I'm really giving this 3 stars for Momoa's abs. Other than that, save your $10 and go watch the previews and you'll know what happens."

I enjoyed every single fight although, but then the mood is killed again when Pitbulls awful version of the timeless classic «Africa» by Toto. I was again embarrassed. Not much to spoil in this movie either because it simply contains every superhero cliche ever, and not in a funny way such as in the «Deadpool» movies. Of course the movie works and excites, but not enough for me to get scared of the beloved «aquaman» and his «death».<br/><br/>The movie also tries too make the audience laugh in some of the scenes, which for me I felt falled through. It felt so fake and scripted that i wondered who thought it was a good idea. The only actor who made me laugh at one point of the movie was the aquaman himself Jason Momoa. He handled the cheesy lines of the script okay, and he made the movie easier too watch. I felt ripped of after I left the cinema, and it was not at all worth the money! Bad movie, bad acting and boring and lazy writing, but great visual effects.!"

"MovieSonic","9","1","2","2 January 2019"," Spectacular superhero film
","In a nutshell: if you're looking for an entertaining blockbuster, this is it. The world of Atlantis in particular was beautiful and I hope future films focus on this and expand a lot more on the people and sea creatures.<br/><br/>Surprises: the acting was great from everyone and the storyline made sense (some tropes of course).<br/><br/>The reason the film lost a star for me was that some of the writing was super lame. I understand these hero films don't want to take themselves too seriously but the acting was so good and the story so engaging that some more earnest and sincere responses would have been appreciated instead of lines like 'what a d*ck'. I also didn't like that they made Aquaman come across as a bit of a douche. This is a guy who (thought he) lost his mum as a child and has seen some horrific stuff while saving people's lives but comes across as some carefree surfer dude. I hope the next film shows him exploring Atlantis, taking on his duties and really seeing what it means to be King - perhaps also losing either his mother or wife in some tragic way so that he can grow as a person and change his character's personality in a legitimate way so that the writing can improve as well. As it stands, Aquaman is like a watered-down, less-funny version of Thor and needs his own unique personality.<br/><br/>Minor issues which can be fixed in subsequent films. I'll definitely be watching sequels.<br/><br/>9/10"

"mitchell5954","9","1","2","31 December 2018"," The DCEU As It Always Should've Been
","Aquaman is the latest entry in the DCEU movie list. I was excited, but nit extremely enthused about this film given the track record with the DCEU. However, I can now say I love this movie. This is now my favorite DCEU movie, even over Wonder Woman, and is now my second favorite film of 2018 behind Infinity War. This film hit every mark. It's not an overly deep or complex film, but it isn't trying to be. It set out to be an entertaining and outlandish comic book film, and it goes full throttle with it. It's essentially your average MCU movie, though I enjoyed this more than many of the recent Marvel films.<br/><br/>The story is relatively simple. Arthur Curry/Aquaman is a half breed. His mother was a queen of Atlantis and his father is human. Now, his mother has disappeared and his brother, Orm/Ocean Master, the king of Atlantis is threatening to invade the surface. Now, it is up to him to challenge his brother to become the rightful king.<br/><br/>The best word to describe Aquaman is spectacle. This film is a great visual and action spectacle. This is easily the best, most colorful looking DCEU movie to date. The action is a thrill and it never sops going. The film is almost two and a half hours, but it doesn't feel it like some of the other movies do. There were a couple pacing issues, but overall I was never bored watching this film.<br/><br/>Unlike, Batman, Superman, or even Wonder Woman, I was never that big of a fan of Aquaman growing up. It wasn't until I read Geoff John's brilliant comic run in the DC New 52 that I really appreciated the character. Throne of Atlantis especially is one of my favorite stories in comics. This movie felt very much like an adaptation of that run, which isn't much of a surprise as Geoff Johns was also a writer for this film, and a producer.<br/><br/>The cast is spectacular too. You have a cast of Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren, and Nicole Kidman. Jason Momoa especially did a fantastic job here. He was badass, funny, charming, and even charismatic. I was never sold on his version of Aquaman. His performance in Justice League didn't do much for me, but he killed it in this film. Seeing him the traditional Aquaman costume near the end was great, and it felt earned here, unlike in Man of Steel.<br/><br/>Overall, Aquaman is a great superhero film, and just a fun movie all the way through. I can't really think of much wrong with this. Again, it isn't a masterpiece like the Dark Knight, but not every film needs to be like that. It set out to be an entertaining ride, with just enough heart to it, and it works. Even if you don't think Aquaman is cool, give this a watch anyway. You might change your mind."

","""Aquaman"" is a war movie without strategy or intrigue, a quest story with as little motivation as a Dungeons & Dragons game played by 8-year olds, a love story with no chemistry, and a rip-off of at least 20 other movies, from the Indiana Jones films to ""The Princess Bride.""<br/><br/>There is no character development sufficiently complex to interest anyone old enough to know what character development is. There are holes in the plot so large that the movie repeatedly disappears into them (Where do the ocean's denizens dispose of THEIR waste products and pollution? The Atlanteans are technologically sophisticated, but they are a culture that practices superstition and worships war. What is the source of production, and the power behind the production, of all that tech? What affect is the ocean dwelling civilization having on ocean temperatures? And how come the land dwellers don't know about all those creatures?).

","I'm pretty much over 'super hero' movies anyway, and this one is no exception, for the type of thing it is, it's done well enough, but like most of them, DC, Marvel or otherwise, they've just become rather Ho Hum, and the original comic book fun is long gone. Jason Momoa is good, Nicole Kidman is even better, the CGI is just overblown, and the underwater scenes just don't seem to cut it, not enough bubbles or something? As far as comic book heroes are concerned I think the old Batman and Superman TV series are the only ones who really got it right!"

","Well, like every one I was expecting a great addition to the DC stable. Sadly it doesn't live up to the hype.
While this is a good popcorn superhero movie and Jason Momoa is excellent as Aquaman, I wondered what Nicole Kidman was thinking when she signed on (other than a nice pay cheque). The Black Manta subplot was completely wasted - would have been better to use in the sequel.
The visual effects, while spectacular in places, looked a bit ""more of the same"" (think The Abyss, Thor) - not as original as I would have expected.
Overall, it was good but not great. Certainly better than other entries in the DC universe so far......"

","I don't know why people are raving about this movie. Don't get me wrong it's far from bad, and it certainly isn't great by any means.
The biggest problem I have with this film is Black Mantis is completely and unnecessary forced into the plot. Most of the major plot holes are around this character.
First off his revenge plot is weak, could have been so much better. He and his dad murder innocent people for a living yet the story tries to make you care about his thirst for revenge. The worst though is how he is able to somehow completely (I mean completely) reengineer, reshape, and dramatically enhance technology that the Atlantians gave him and called it state of the art? Also, he must have done it near a black hole because the rest of the story progresses about a couple of days while he does it, oh and he learns how to use it to fight and fly as well. Absurd and unnecessary.
Other things that bothered me were,
That the comedy was forced, though not bad.
Aquaman tries to stop the war by attacking and killing thousands of innocent? The army that is defending their home and don't want war?
And why the ""king"" needs to go to war with the last kingdom before atracking the surface is beyond me, it's not like he follows the rules anyway.
Finally humans are in disbelief about a possible Atlantis, yet they live in a universe where superman, wonderwoman and batman are front Page News. Stupid."

","Aquaman is the second DCU movie to hit it out of the park. Though, I concede that Wonder Woman still had the stronger story.<br/><br/>The whole thing looks great. The film goes full balls-to-the wall in creating the entire fictional kingdom of Atlantis and several other underwater kingdoms and locations. The whole thing has an 80's fantasy/sci-fi/adventure feel to it. A lot of work went into the details on this. The movie includes one dress and one visual sequence (you'll know it when you see it) that really catch your eye. The fight sequences, including a full-scale battle, really nail it. I also applaud the movie's effort to bring Black Manta and Ocean Master's outfits to life without majorly reworking the designs.<br/><br/>The script does a fair job of balancing drama and comedy. Jason Momoa remains utterly cool and charming as the lead. He and Amber Heard as Mera have good chemistry. Credit should also be given to Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master. He is a complete jerk in this, but you always understand where he is coming from and why he feels justified in what he is doing.<br/><br/>The movie does try to cram in a little too much. We get Aquaman's backstory, Atlantis' surprisingly in-depth backstory, all three of Aquaman's best known villains, and practically every major supporting character except Aqualad. You do tend to get thrown from one scene to the next, and I wished Mera and Aquaman had a little more time to build their relationship. Still, I do give director James Wan credit for trying to get in as much of the Aquaman mythos as possible. There is a lot of thought put into this world. The script is busy, but it isn't confusing or particularly jerky. You are given all the info. needed, and the flashbacks about Aquaman's origin are really well integrated and don't overstay their welcome."

","Sure, Aquaman has its flaws, being full of cliches and predictability. What else do you expect with a story about a man who is caught between worlds, and has to face his family, in order to unite the worlds? (LOL)<br/><br/>Other than that, Aquaman is a brilliant superhero movie, playing in a newly created world, which is a wonderful combination of Lord of the Rings, Abyss and Avatar, and perfectly matching sound effects. Despite the story being predictable, and being loaded with effects, Aquaman never becomes superficial. It offers enough background and soft moments, to make almost every character, even those with little screen time, interesting, believable and likable. On the other hand it offers enough action and speed, not suffering under special effects, to be continuously entertaining.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it the best superhero movie? No. But it's a movie that never feels rushed, contains all necessary elements including some well timed comedy, and is perfectly balanced. This makes this movie incredibly entertaining, and the first movie that can actually compete with Marvel, and is hopefully a promise of more to come. Having said that, the only real bad parts were Amber Heard who is little more than eye candy and may remind you of Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire. Dolph Lundgren may thank his lucky stars for being in this flick, but should focus on Expendable sequels.<br/><br/>Aquaman is an epic and fun visual spectacle.

","Personally gave this 9/10 stars as I loved Jason's take on Aquaman & the visual effects of the movie. Sure there were a few scenes that were a little cheesy but that didn't bother me compared to the action of the movie, Jason's acting & visual effects as I mentioned. Amber Heard's character was a good match to Aquaman & thought Patrick Wilson pulled off being the villain! I couldn't think of another actor who could have played Aquaman any better than Jason Momoa! He definitely pulls off the fight scenes & shows the right amount of emotion during his talking parts. Of course he has the perfect body to wear those tight suits! The visual effects created beautiful colors of the sea life & makeup people did great job doing their thing on the actors who weren't human. Overall DC is back & I cant wait to see an Aquaman sequel! So people you need to stay when the credits start to roll as halfway thru them there is a post-credit scene which sets the tone for a sequel."

","The second I watched the trailer I immediately was like 'this is ONE movie?'.

But the main storyline gets clouded with unnecessary side-plots, which aren't thought out very well. This wouldn't have been a problem, hadn't there been as man plot-holes.
I get that DCEU wanted to make it about pollution of the Earth's oceans, but it felt forced. The wannabe Ocean-master just seems like he wants to rule.<br/><br/>The movie was very one-dimensional. The dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in a fiction-flick. Too much CGI. The soundtrack was beautiful though, sometimes a bit misplaced maybe.<br/><br/>Momoa's performance was great, he is very well suited for this role. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well, true eye-candy.<br/><br/>It isn't a superb movie, but it's a lot better than Justice League, and it's certainly a step into the right direction for the DCEU.

"leobbiagi","6","1","2","28 December 2018"," Hilarious
","This movie is so ridiculous and dumb that it actual makes for a fun time. However, Aquaman contains three major flaws.
1) This movie falls victim to the common virus in every day movies and that is the over use of CGI. This film is layered with CGI to the point were every single scene in this movie contains large amounts CGI. The filims over the top graphics makes everything look fake, making it hard for you connect to the characters or story. The battle scenes are just CGI monsters crashing into each other and turning the intense scenes into something out of a Michael Bay film. Ever fight or intense scene I was laughing my head off because of the fake and chessy CGI.
2) In the comics Aquaman is a ridiculous character and I respect how hard they tried to make this movie not as dumb and corny. However, the movies plot is unoriginal and the script is laughable. The plot of Aruther try to stop the war of two different worlds by claiming his right to the throne has been seen many times in movies, most recently Black Panther which came out earlier in 2018. They tried their best to make a good script but everything they said was laughable and corny. For example their is a scene in which the villain is confronting a CGI crab, the crab says that he will not call the villain ""your Highness"" the villain responds that he does not want to be called Highness but Oceanmaster. This is supposed to be an intense and chilling speech but I found my self once again laughing out loud.
3) Aquaman is play very well as Jason Momoa, he brings a charming and charismatic personality that is fun and enjoyable to watch. However all the characters are god like people with super human strength and stamina. While this provides the characters with awesome moments it also adds very little stakes Aquaman is constantly stabed, shot or falling from great heights. Every time he comes out without a scratch providing little to no stakes because the characters are nearly invincible.
Even though Aquaman has many flaws it still is a fun and enjoyable movie."
"dokrauss","3","1","2","28 December 2018"," Fish Story
","I am not a DC guy, so I went into Aquaman with a bit of dubiousness. We Boomers chose sides in the DC/Marvel rivalry decades ago and you either were fer or agin one or the other with a fanaticism bordering on Cold War intensity. There were some outliers who claimed to like both equally, but they were viewed with suspicion, like pacifists who insisted the Commies weren't all that bad. Adding to the dubiousness, it's Aquaman, a blond spandex/fish scale armor-wearing guy who rides a seahorse and pals around with spandex wearing Aquakid, a la Batman and Robin, evoking the same uncomfortableness regarding their relationship. And he talked to fish. Fish.<br/><br/>Not that I felt any particular animus to the character. I watched the cartoon
back in the 60s with some satisfaction, thrilled that TV had finally come to its senses and was showing comic book characters, even if it was DC. Cartoon Aquaman remained in his wheelhouse, the ocean, and did ocean things so was not to be taken seriously. This movie Aquaman, though, is deadly serious, done up in the person of badass cool guy Jason Momoa who did quite a good job in Justice League...which I liked.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, that places me in a very small minority and lends suspicion that I might be one of those aforementioned pacifists going soft on the Reds, but it was pretty good. As was Batman vs Superman. See? I can be persuaded. Aquaman might turn out to be this year's Dark Knight.<br/><br/>It's not.<br/><br/>Instead, it turned into a mash-up of Lord of the Rings, Excalibur, Starship Troopers, the Cthullu mythos, Gladiator, the Little Mermaid, the Hunt for Red October, the Avengers, oh, just about every movie of the last twenty years or so. I swear some computer geeks got together and said, ""Man, we gotta make some money, so let's CGI every trope from every movie because you know people like that stuff."" There's even a Skywalker finding his mother. I swear.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes or so was great. Nicole Kidman...or her stunt double... kicked royal butt and butt royally, depending with whom she crossed tridents. Gotta say, all the movie fights were stellar. But, danger, Will Robinson: a copy of ""Dunwich Horror"" lies on a tabletop. Now, why would that be? 'Cause, you know, if you show a gun in the first act you gotta use it in the third and, yep, Cthulhu shows up later. Along with his/her fish monsters. WTF? Did one of the computer geeks note ""Arkham Asylum"" in Dark Knight and figured there was a Lovecraft connection?<br/><br/>I blame public education.<br/><br/>Minutes later, the scene that killed the movie: a line of armoured seahorses facing off a line of armoured sharks. With lasers. And all roaring at each other. I laughed out loud, then asked, ""Is this a joke?""<br/><br/>No, apparently not. Even when the timpani playing octopus was beating out the Planet Hulk combat rhythm in the arena, when the Green Goblin CGI-floated around pretending he's still loyal to the Master Race, and Aryan God Boy Ocean Master screams like Howard Dean on the campaign trail, you're supposed to regard all this as serious and intense.<br/><br/>It's like Springtime for Hitler.<br/><br/>I can go on and on and on but I'll just hit the lowlights. F'rinstance, the entire Russian Navy knows Aquaman exists. Aquaman even speaks Russian. Fluently. Everyone on the East Coast knows Aquaman exists. They party with the dude. Yet, the news media pish-poshes the idea of Atlanteans among us.<br/><br/>Must be CNN.<br/><br/>There is an eeeevil villain who simply can't get over that Aquaman didn't save eeevil villain's Dad from a watery death. Dude, your dad was a pirate. Sort of goes with the territory so lighten up. But noooo, evil villain constructs an eeevil costume replete with a dirigible helmet that fires plasma. You'd think a guy who knows he's going to be maneuvering around submarine interiors would select something a little less unwieldy. But, it's DC. Simple physics never bothered them. Like the Batcopter.<br/><br/>And for all their high tech, the Atlanteans are not the brightest. Aryan God Boy knew for decades where his hated half-brother lived and waits, of course, until Aquaboy is full on badass Aquaman before deciding to take him on. For that matter, the plasma firing laser shark Atlanteans have had a beef with the surface world for nigh-on millenia, but, of course, wait until we've got badass Aquaman on our side before making a move. No wonder the gods drowned them.<br/><br/>But Nicole Kidman showing up in a lobster suit...that's it. Done.<br/><br/>Make mine Marvel."

However, more could have been done on the character development with the time that was put in.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS/CASTS: we have a hero that offers very little apart from his seductive charm.

Aquaman is an incredible film with awesome visuals and really good acting. The plot is good but it felt like a origin story and I feel like I've seen a 1000 of these and I just want more (which isn't bad cause a sequel is very likely and I definitely want one too) I really enjoyed Jason Monoa's performance in this film. I'm glad they didn't cast a Blond type muscular dude that was kinda good at acting (what the OG Aquaman character looked like) and it felt like the Thor of the sea movie, instead Jason's look and his awesome acting skills make just him as a character way better than the OG comic books of the way Aquaman looked. One the other hand, they did the OG looking Aquaman Suit on Jason and it look AWESOME!!! This was not only comic book accurate but I was just overall a good looks for the movies tone.<br/><br/>***Villains***
OceanMaster was a great villain and what was nice about him was that he had a good motive for his actions which is very unfamiliar for a DCEU movie. Often DCEU movie's villains have stupid motives and so they always aren't great. This is the opposite for OceanMaster, and let's not forget his awesome Helmet. BUT! Black Manta is the M.V.P. of this movie! Him as a villain was AWESOME! I just want more of him in the sick suit. The helmet was Crazy comic book accurate.<br/><br/>**Visuals***

The jokes often seemed a little out of place however, which throws off the viewer slightly. Jason Moamoa does action and drama much better than he does comedy.

","Thought it was awesome story outside of black manta and the music score. I'm black so I don't know if the over all origin of black manta was forced for sake of the comics 20 years ago or if he was thrown in at last minute for this movies sake, but regardless it didn't fit in at all. The animated dc movie aquaman vs Wonder Woman and otter versions of black manta have been better in my opinion.<br/><br/>The score was garbage. I'm one of those ppl who will literally go out and buy music based on the movie. I at no time enjoyed any of the music (classical type was fine).<br/><br/>All that being said, it was awesome. Aquamans half bro was nicely cast. The red heads father was great. Jason mamoa awesome. Great movie which seasoned with mythology.<br/><br/>Other than black guy and music great movie."
"elliot-75668","6","1","2","24 December 2018"," Stays afloat despite time lost at sea
","Slowly the DC Cinematic Universe (DCCU) is building its own world to match the colossus built by the MCU. The next Justice Legend to get his own origins story is Aquaman, but quite when this origins story is set is massively unclear apart from a line of throw away dialogue. However, a quick search online informs me that events in Aquaman take place after the events of Justice League but it would be difficult to tell because events of Justice League seemed to have very little bearing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the underwater realm of Atlantis is being pushed to its limits by the surface world's endless polluting of Earth's oceans. This leads to a political discourse where Atlantians decide whether to launch an assault on the surface world. When the surface world (debatable) attacks both Om/Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Doplh Lundgren) the tribes of Xebel and Om join forces to destroy the surface world.<br/><br/>The only man who can stop them is Arthur Curry, half man, half Atlantian who harbors a strong resentment towards Atlantis for the execution of his mother as punishment falling in love and having a child with a human. The only way for Arthur to stop Om's destruction of the surface world is to find the Trident of Atlan which is will give command over all ocean life.<br/><br/>Such is the legendary and mythological status of these superhero characters in their own universes it is not perhaps surprising that the story is Aquaman is inspired by some of the most famous mythological tales in literature. The most notable being the Legend of King Arthur (the two even share names) where King Arthur is the only one who can pull the sword of Excalibur from the rock much like how only Arthur Curry can wield the trident of Atlan.<br/><br/>Other inspirations include Jason and the Argonauts as our heroes face deadly monsters in their quest to retrieve the legendary item - be it the Golden Fleece or the Trident of Atlan. It's here that fault in the movie can be found as the various epic set pieces don't feel tired together by a strong script which, in fact, is as weak as soggy paper. It feels too unconnected as the movie bounds to from epic set piece to epic set piece with the only breaks from the action used as exposition so that we can keep up with everything going on (even if some of it was painfully obvious).<br/><br/>The script's jumpy narrative makes the film the bloated mess that it is. However, helping us through it is director James Wan whose experience at helming massive franchises has been of great benefit to him. Working with a massive $200,000,000 budget, Wan has helped create some stunning underworld citadels that retain an element of awe even in his GCI dominated movie universe.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa (less said his teenage counterpart the better) is charming and engaging enough in the lead role, but much of the actors' performances are lost in the tidal wave of GCI which, whilst impressive, just leads the actors (and some great ones too) to be swallowed up by the oceans of GCI. With nothing to anchor the film with a strong identity it just gets cast adrift in the vast ocean of superhero movies"

Cinematography, Visuals are in top notch. for 2 hours 23 minutes it was never a boring movie..and MERA ohhh she nailed the audience. personally a great movie to watch more than once.

"jawadmohaiuddin","6","1","2","23 December 2018"," Ps Aquaman was already cool.
","Under water world was great, acting was fine. All the best jokes were in trailers rest of it was cringe. Movie was a drag at times but my main problem is that they misused Black Manta. Either use him properly or don't have him in the movie. Because we spent alot of time in the beginning to see Black Manta's story to only have a half arsed end(but his suit was awesome ). People are saying that Aquaman didn't focus on setting up sequels or anything, all the scenes with Black Manta were shit and a setup. Movie could have been great If you cut Black Manta out, make Ocean Master's intentions true to his cause, the only way to survive is to finish surface dwellers instead of using the fu**ing inside job villian again.
Best fight sequence was the first fight in the light house. It was the best directed sequence of the movie along with Trench dive scene.
Sound track was awful.
And don't say Aquaman is cool now. Geoff Jhones had already done that."

","Some fighting scenes were truly amazing, the great imagery and choreography made you feel like you were in some fights yourself, however a lot of other scenes were the opposite. The first few scenes ALWAYS ended in some sort of explosion or chaos and it to me was pretty tiring and it was just so clear that they didn't rly dare to just end a scene ordinarily. Apart from that, the input of music was in some scenes almost laughable to me (I say that as a film student) but I guess it was nothing you'd think of that much if you don't focus on how they edited it all. I all so think the start was way to hard edited, maybe that was the point or maybe it's cause they spent a lot of time editing it down as DC seems to have to do to all of their movies nowadays, either way they should have just added some environmental shots and just shown where exactly we were at rather than just jumping into a scene.
Overall, it was a good movie, especially considering the previous ones in the DCEU, but neither cinematically nor story wise was it anything amazing. Good movie though and you should watch it :)"
"flicklover","8","1","2","23 December 2018"," Please let James Wan reboot Superman!!!!
","Aquaman has never been one of my favorite superheroes but I was looking forward to this film because I like James Wan as a director. DC has mostly failed miserably over the years trying to create a universe to compete with Marvel. They do have what I think is the best superhero trilogy in the Dark Knight films but since then they gave the keys to Zack Snyder to start their universe with Man of Steel. Even though I kind of liked it, I never really agreed with his take on Superman. My fears were confirmed when Batman vs Superman came out. That film was embarrassingly bad. Snyder had taken two of the greatest comic book heroes and stripped just about everything we love about them. The only good thing I can say about that film is that it is only slightly better than Batman and Robin directed by Joel Schumacher. But that film was just horrible in every way. Justice League was ok, but not near as good as the Avengers series. Then finally DC got it right with Wonder Woman. That film was great. It presented an origin story but it also made the main character something that Mr. Snyder didn't do. Wonder Woman was a HEROIN!!! She wasn't the brooding bores that Batman and Superman were in his films. The film was fun and rousing, as I think these type of films should be.<br/><br/>Well DC has finally got has gotten it right again with Aquaman!!! I hadn't really thought much about Jason Momoa as Aquaman in Justice League, but here he makes the character his own. The setup is relatively quick with Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, an princess that had escaped Atlantis to avoid marrying a man she didn't love.
Temuera Morrison plays Thonas Curry, a lighthouse keeper that notices Atlanna on the shore and rescues her. They fall in love and have a baby named Arthur. Shortly after he is born, they are attacked by Atlantian soldiers and she goes back to Atlantis to protect Arthur and Thomas. Then the film moves forward to Aquaman rescuing a submarine from pirates in a great action scene. In that scene Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is introduced as David Kane, a villain that would later become Black Manta. Then the film goes to Atlantis where we see that Orm, played by Patrick Wilson. He is Arthur's half brother and wants to wage war with the surface world. Arthur is almost killed with his father in an attack with a tidal wave but is saved by Mera, played by Amber Heard. She is an Atlantean that has been chosen to marry Orm but tries to convince Arthur to come to Atlantis to claim his birthright as King. He refuses, he had been rejected by Atlantis as a half breed. Mera convinces Arthur to go with her to help prevent Orm's attack on the surface. Once in Atlantis, they meet Vulko played by Willem Dafoe. Vulco had trained Arther in his youth to fight at the request of Arthur's mother. He tells Arthur and Mera that they should find the Trident of Atlan, a weapon that had been wielded by the first king of Atlantis. If Arthur would get this magic artifact, he would he accepted as King of Atlantis. Suddenly they are ambushed and Arthur is captured, but Vulko and Mera escape. Once captured, Orm confronts Arthur and tells him thT their mother had been executed for the crime of having a half breed son. Arthur challenges Orn to a duel in front of all of Atlantis do determine the rightful king. Orn defeats Arthur, but Mera rescues him. They both travel to find the Trident of Atlan. They go to the Sahara Desert to find where the weapon was forged. There, they unlock a holographic message that leads them to Sicily. They find the coordinates to the location of the trident. Orm had given David Kane weapons to kill Arthur, he used that technology to built the Black Manta suit. When Arthur and Mera are in Sicily, Black Manta attacks them, almost killing Arthur before being thrown from a cliff to his apparent death. Mera helps Arthur heal and tells him to embrace his destiny as a hero as they go find the trident. They arrive to their destination but are attacked by some monsters called The Trench but are able to escape. They find a wormhole and are transported to a ocean at the center of the earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna. She had been sacrificed to The Trench but was able to survive. Arthur goes to retrieve the trident, facing Karathen, the creature that guards the trident. Arthur is able to prove his worth and reclaims the trident. Arthur emerges with the traditional Aquaman suit. Along with Atlanna and Mera, he goes to confront Orm. Orm had already started the war that would eventually go to the surface. Once Orm's followers see that Arthur has the Trident if Atlan they embrace him as King. Arthur then confronts Orm and demands that he renounce the thrown. After they fight, Orm is deafeated. Orm then discovers Atlanna is alive and accepts his fate. Atlanna finally returns to the surface and reunites with Thomas as Arthur ascends to the throne in Atlantis.<br/><br/>Aquaman succeeds at being an epic superhero story. James Wan and company have created a very entertaining and I evolving film. And as in the case of Wonder Woman made Aquaman what he should be, a hero to root for. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur with a lot of humor but also with heroic conviction. All of the cast is good, especially Amber Heard as Mera. She and Mamoa have good chemistry. The look of the film is predictably spectacular. The world of Atlantis is really great to look at. Even though it is obvious that the characters are not underwater the effects make it as believable as it could be. But the characters and story make the film enjoyable. I'm glad that DC has finally found the way to do justice to their heroic characters. I hope with the success of this film, Jane's Wan is given the chance to reboot Superman the right way. I really enjoyed Aquaman!"
"Gresh854","4","1","2","23 December 2018"," A 50/50 Superhero Flick
","James Wan's Directing: YAY!
Beall and McGoldrick's Writing: NAY!<br/><br/>I don't believe it's materially doable for me to scheme into words how carelessly ludicrous Aquaman is. I can't declare if I positively cherished the campiness and nuttiness of this movie, or if I positively despised it. Warner Bros have blown their 200-million-dollar budget on something ferociously miraculous, but also, something terribly disposable.<br/><br/>In simple terms, Aquaman was acutely run-of-the-mill for me because, all though, Wan's supervision of the action (yes to those one-take shots!) and furthermore, the numerous of filmmakers' tackling of the graphics flowed lavishly, the writing and dialogue, nonetheless, ignominiously sinks to the bottom-ground. Soooo, I suppose I'll meet in the middle with this encapsulation and proclaim that this lunacy of a production-that is Aquaman-is, all in all, mediocre?<br/><br/>Aquaman is testosterone fueled mania suffocated with oceans of shirtless men shrieking their heads off while mounting gigantic fishes. If that's what you like in your movies, I recommend trekking alongside this motion picture, but if you're seeking out a superhero flick with sagacity and dandy quality, turn the other way. I'll grant it this though, it's rigorously an improvement from Justice Leauge and Suicide Squad. And, hey, I'll even tally extra points for the Halo jumpsuits and the hardcore, drumming Octopus. (Verdict: C)"

"cruise01","10","1","2","23 December 2018"," Amazing film that delivered an epic adventure story, stunning visual effects, and action.
","Aquaman (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Aquaman is an awesome bada** superhero film that delivers on an epic adventure scale with action sequences, visual effects, and a great story. I will consider this to be the best DC movie beating out Wonder Woman. The character Aquaman seems like a cheesy character to even be adapted onto the big screen. With Jason Momoa performance as the character. He makes the character bada** and even when he achieves his golden outfit.<br/><br/>The plot is a great adventure story. It was not rushed nor overstuffed with sub plots. It follows Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the queen of Atlantis being rescued by a lighthouse keeper Thomas (Temuera Morrison). They both fall in love with each other and have a son named Arthur (Jason Momoa) who will soon become Aquaman. As decades fly by, Aquaman is found by Mera (Amber Heard) who informs him that his step brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to wage war against the surface people. And he is trying to unite the seven kingdoms underwater to create havoc to the surface people. With Mera and Nuidis (Willem Dafoe) help and needing to find the true trident of Atlantis in order for Aquaman to claim his rightful place in the throne. He will fight against Orm's army and hired pirates led by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).<br/><br/>The plot delivered an epic scale adventure. Aquaman travelling to Atlantis that looked like a beautiful colorful city underwater. Was more astonishing than the Avatar film. The action sequences are big and well directed. There is a lot of action throughout. Aquaman fighting against pirates in a submarine. From the epic lifting the sub out of the water. The fight scene with Atlanna fighting against Atlantis soldiers in the opening scene with one long camera take was well choreographed. James Wan direction of having the camera rotate around the action sequences worked so well. He is known for his small budget horror movies like Saw and Insidious. His action style from Furious Seven and this film was just awesome. He delivered a great underwater chase scene that almost felt like Tron Legacy with the beautiful lighting vehicles and Atlantis lighting. And the chase scene in Italy when Aquaman and Mera are facing against Black Manta and his soldiers was thrilling. The climax battle sequence is breathtaking. With Aquaman and Orm/ Ocean Master fighting each other was the best choreographed fight scene with the cinematography work.<br/><br/>The visual effects are breathtaking when the action is underwater or on land. It was great on an epic scale. The cinematography work was well done that captured the action and choreography. The music score Rupert Gregon-Williams was great. And had a good score that made the movie feel like an adventure. Also, the soundtrack with a few songs in it was great and fun. Jason Momoa was great. Amber Heard is beautiful and great as Mera. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Nicole Kidman were all great with their characters. James Wan's direction was brilliant with making an adventure story and epic action.<br/><br/>Overall, Aquaman is a great film. I say it is the best DC movie out there. I definitely recommend seeing this in the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for an adventure story and exciting epic action sequences with beautiful stunning visual effects. This is the film worth seeing."

","I saw ""Aquaman"", starring Jason Momoa-Game of Thrones_tv, Stargate:Atlantis_tv; Amber Heard_Magic Mike XXL: Machete Kills; Patrick Wilson-The Nun, The Watchmen and Nicole Kidman-Paddington, Batman Forever.
This movie is based on a comic book character that was created in 1941. Thank goodness their inspiration is based specifically on a more updated story line from 2011, and not the 40's, 50's and 60's incarnation. Aquaman was not a real popular hero back in those days. In fact, lots of people would often make fun of his powers-he talked to fish. Although their are several nods to those more silly years-remember Topo the octopus? Well, he makes a cameo. The movie is directed by James Wan, who is more known for his horror films-such as the Conjuring , Insidious & Saw. Jason plays Arthur Curry-aka Aquaman-the half breed created by a human father and an Atlantean mother, who learns he is an heir to the throne of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. However, he has no interest in the title and just wants to stay on the surface world. Nicole plays his mother. Jason's half brother Patrick, believes that he should rule-since he is a full blooded Atlantean. For the comic book crowd, Patrick's name is Orm, aka the Ocean Master. Amber-aka Mera-shows up to the surface world to try and change Jason's mind and come rule as the king. Otherwise, Patrick will declare war on the surface dwellers. Battles insue and it's an action packed CGI extravaganza, especially after another villain named Black Manta shows up. There are a few cameo actors that pop up-I liked the Dolph Lundgren one-and there is a scene just as the end credits start that hints at the next movie, but nothing at the very end.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes.
I must admit, Aquaman is not one of my favorite heroes but I like Jason and I really enjoyed this movie. I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

"henry_yan","10","1","2","22 December 2018"," ""I am....Aquaman""
","Seems like DC and WB has got a winner here. This is by far the best comic book movie DC/WB has come out with, even better than Wonder Woman. The story doesn't meander too much, and everything stays on point. All the flashbacks are done with great effectiveness, especially when Aquaman speaks to the big bad ass Kraken guarding the trident of all tridents. And how could you miss with a unbelievable supporting cast comprising Dolph Lundgren , Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe. Also, I didn't know the Kraken's voice belonged to, of all people, Mary Poppins herself, Julie Andrews. The visuals were amazing, but did not overload the senses, unlike Batman v Superman or Justice League. I hope the people at DC/WB now realise you can't replace good storytelling (and good acting) with outrageous and overwhelming special effects. It doesn't work that way. It was indeed appropriate that our hero announced his arrival in our superhero consciousness with a commanding tone at the end of the show with ""I am....Aquaman"".<br/><br/>p/s With all this momentum going for Aquaman, Wonder Woman 1984 has a lot to live up to. Hope it does make it."
"FallenEye","7","1","2","21 December 2018"," Worth a ""Sea"", But Did it Land?
","""Where I come from, the water washes away our tears"".<br/><br/>The absolute best part about Aquaman, is undoubtedly and unequivocally, Nicole Kidman. She had the best lines, the best story, the best performance and truthfully, she had the best fight sequence (which sadly, is at the beginning of the movie). Nicole Kidman will regrettably be, the unsung hero of this film.<br/><br/>The interjections of Vulko and Arthur's growing past was a lovely touch, however, Zack Snyder did a far superior job of that technique, in Man of Steel. James Wan's horror addiction was impossible to ignore, especially given how literally, the very first shot was a type of jump scare, and I appreciated that trademark inclusion. The kiss between Arthur and Mera was also a visual treat.<br/><br/>But, that's the thing with Aqauman. It suffers from too many cliches blended together, cliches I do and did enjoy even in this film, except for them being cliches done better before in other films, except perhaps for Arthur and Mera's first kiss.<br/><br/>The score was, a bit scattered and uncomposed, while still being satisfying at some parts. It was like Suicide Squad meets Green Lantern. The composition had this tendency of pulling you out of the movie, and throwing you back in, instead of completely immersing you.<br/><br/>Aquaman's suit was not great at all, and the Atlantean warriors looked quite silly, while the Atlantean weapon Orm gave Black Manta, looked like it came straight out of Power Rangers. And speaking of Black Manta, I wasn't really excited by him, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is an awesome Aquaman, albeit an unrecognizable one, and Amber Heard's beauty more than qualifies her for the role of Mera, however, her acting prowess felt a little out of its depth. I'm a fan of Patrick Wilson, and he did a satisfactory job, as did Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>Aquaman is a fantastic attempt. It's worth it to see, but, I'm not certain it stuck the landing, much like Arthur's landings in the actual film, or the humor. Except for 2 extremely distinct parts in the film, the humor was Sahara desert dry. 6.7/10."

","Aquaman is good. Not brilliant, not fantastic, it's good. It might not be the grade it wanted to get nor was it the top it could have gotten, but Aquaman is in its core a good movie. It achieves what it set out to achieve: entertain and dazzle with stunning visuals and great performances.<br/><br/>1) The story. Aquaman is the first movie after the Justice League debacle (in all fairness to the cast and crew, JL was not what it should have been). So, Aquaman had to come up with a story that was not an origin story (yet needed to be one), be a sequel to a movie that disappointed hardcore DC fans and restore their faith, and tell a unique and entertaining story worthy of the first ever live action Aquaman movie. Strangely, it succeeded in all of those fields. The story is multilayered with a more than a few plots intertwining and moving forward simultaneously (as well as the origin story/flashbacks alongside the Atlantis origin/history). This might sound convoluted, but the way the story is told actually doesn't hurt the storytelling. There are almost no plot holes and all characters (with the slight exception of Black Mantis) are given enough time to provide us with their background, philosophy and motivations. Unfortunately, the downside of this is the overall duration of the movie (143 minutes). Even though the movie doesn't feel very long and there are just enough action sequences to keep the dynamic going, there were certain segments that could have been cut a bit short (maybe for an uncut edition later on). It would be unfair to judge the movie by its length, especially because there were many points that needed concluding, but a few more riskier editing choices would have made this movie and its story far superior. Also, because of this, the final battle that is spectacular in all fairness, didn't have that necessary final epic kick this type of movie is known for. Everything blows up and all hell breaks loose, but I found the one-on-one battle afterwards to be much more satisfying and epic (mainly due to Momoa's and Wilson's stellar action performances).<br/><br/>2) The acting. This movie rounds up much of the old school masters (Dafoe, Kidman, Lundgren, Wilson) and a few very promising newcomers (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Heard). Dafoe was given a beautiful little supporting role that he embraced with such joy that it was a delight to watch him. Lundgren, regardless of him being best known for B-movie action roles, executed all of his lines and expressions with such ease and fluidity, in such scholar like style that he actually awed me most of all. Even though erased almost halfway though, Abdul-Mateen II did a decent job. Nothing spectacular, but he set up a good character for the sequel(s). Also, the Sicily fight is one of the highlights of the movie. Kidman was, unfortunately, very bland and unceremonious. Her God-like posture and wooden acting took me away from her character most of all. She also had no chemistry with Momoa or Wilson and her storyline was the one that could have been written and finished better. The almost Deus ex machina ending with her feels way to happy endish and took much from the dark and gritty fight between Momoa and Wilson. On the other hand, another performance for the acting school books is the one executed by Patrick Wilson. His understanding of the character is phenomenal, and his execution spot on. No line is overacted, no expression is unneeded. All of his gestures, the tone of his voice in every scene is perfect to the point of perfection. He, alongside Dafoe, gave the best performance in the movie. Heard was a bit underwhelming. She has a beautiful character to play with but never actually takes her to new levels. She took no risks in depicting Mera and that is a little sad. As she and Momoa lead the movie, and taking into account that his presence simply dominates every scene he is in, Heard should have done more. Like this she is just good. Momoa however had a dual quality. His presence in the movie is breathtaking. He lives and breathes Aquaman with every cell in his body. He has fun while doing it, but he just does not have the same quality of acting as the others (which is quite understandable given he is still a sort of a newcomer compared to the others). Every scene he is having fun and is telling jokes or is fighting or threatening others is a blast (especially when he yells parts of Haka), but when he has to execute high drama like scenes, he simply vaporizes. Put up against Wilson or even Heard, he looses his intimidation as the acting of the other party outdoes Momoa's. But, as all of the DCEU characters, he is the best live action incarnation of Aquaman. Put plainly, he is awesome.<br/><br/>3)The directing. Wan is a superhero! He is a god, a legend, a titan, a master. Even though his specialty is horror, his masterful skill at keeping a movie like this so compact and solid is astounding. He never looses his grip at what this movie is supposed to be. Every scene is fixed, no improvisation, with scalpel-like precision. Certain scenes that seemed to be one take shots were so perfectly developed and performed they literally take ones breath away. Beautifully orchestrated (in every sense of the word) directing makes Aquaman a movie worth seeing over and over again.<br/><br/>4) The music. R. Gregson-WIlliams does a great job. He really got certain characters and their themes, but it is noticeable that he had much more fun and much stronger ideas in creating the villain tunes than the hero ones. Simply put, Aquaman needs a better theme. But a solid job was done altogether.<br/><br/>All in all, Aquaman fixed most of the problems Justice League created. It also created a path the DCEU should follow in a very VERY straight line and not deter at all. This was a correction exam for the DCEU and it passed. Aquaman is fun, entertaining, with SPECTACULAR visuals (even though most of it is pure CGI) and is a pure delight to watch. Certain characters could have had better execution, some story lines could have been omitted or shortened, and the music could have been a bit more innovative. But all in all, Aquaman is simply a good movie that deserves to be watched over and over again in the highest possible quality and it will always deliver exactly what it sets out to deliver - a good time."
"saraswat-dhoom2","8","1","2","16 December 2018"," Best of DC Comics till date .
","AQUAMAN :<br/><br/>Aquaman is the best of the DC movies after Christopher Nolan has left us with amazing The Dark Knight series. DC has always tried to copy Marvel and this fight will always continue between DC & Marvel fans that who is the best among two. Talking about this movie it is a visual treat to the audiences in 3D (specially recommended) as one starts feeling itself to be a part of sea.For those who has done scuba diving and for those who hasn't its a must watch in 3D .<br/><br/>Talking about the story Atlanna( Nicole Kidman) is from Atlantis an empire under the sea gets married to a man on earth & gives birth to Arthur( Jason Momoa) whose becomes Aquaman and is destined to be the Ocean Master. Now army from Atlantis empire comes to arrest Atlanna as she has gone against rules of sea world. Later on the story is about ending the war between sea world & earth by Aquaman by acquiring Trident of Atlan which was owned by the first king of Atlantis and now who will acquire this will be the master of ocean. Movie proceeds with run and chase on earth and sea and then war of sea world empires .<br/><br/>The movie gives us a visual treat which we will love to watch on big screen . It is a must watch for evry Super hero lover. But one thing is definitely there that every Marvel fan will compare it with marvel movies as the fight between brothers for kingdom with a lot of audience around may be compared between fight shown in Black Panther. The search for Atlan in various empires and the sea world with gadgets may be compared to Guardians of Galaxy and a lot more. For all this winding up all in one word is Must Watch .<br/><br/>Rating :4/5"
"onetruesancho","9","1","2","16 December 2018"," Aquaman
","Warner Bros and the DCU are no longer a one hit wonder and it's about time. Aquaman did what Wonder Woman was able to do for Warner Brothers except bigger and better and with this movie under their belt, the DC cinematic universe finally feels like it's found it's footing.<br/><br/>Aquaman was a trip. The story took us on an adventure unlike anything I've seen since Indiana Jones or The Goonies. While a big part of the aesthetic and story in Aquaman felt very Flash Gordon or even Star Wars in its presentation, the other half was an exciting treasure hunt reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie. The character design and world building are brilliant,<br/><br/>The few negative criticisms I have are nit picks."

","Aquaman was good ,ok great .but the movie didn't have any great superhero moments .too be honest aquaman must have done moments with the people of Atlantis .either kind of saving them.tho better than other Zack Snyder films I guess.Not a near film to Batman triology sorry guys"

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","7","1","2","16 December 2018"," It's an awkward transition from the Snyderverse to the future of DC
","So I saw Aquaman anddddddddd ehhh? It's not bad but it's not goood? Let me just give you the bad first. This movie is too long. I kinda felt the same about Wonder Woman as well, but I really felt it here. You could've easily cut down a half hour of this movie and nothing about it would've changed. The story is serviceable but not new. It bears similar resemblance to a Marvel Phase 1 movie so like: Thor 1, Captain America 1, but it lacks the performances and charisma of either of those. I like Patrick Wilson as an actor but King Orm is no Loki. He's pretty one note and cliched as the movie's villain. The visuals were a double edged sword so for the bad I would say it just got way too distracting for me. Infinity War had tons of cgi too but I was invested enough to ignore what wasn't actually real. And lastly, I'm just gonna say it, Aquaman's story is NOT interesting. Call me a hater but I've never liked Aquaman I'm sorry! There's a reason Family Guy keeps making fun of him all the time. Ok but what's good about this movie? Actually there's a lot of good things. The movie's visuals while distracting were colorful. The DC cinematic universe has stumbled with the Zack Snyder look that's just gloomy, lifeless, and boring. Aquaman actually tries to course correct the ship by creating a really bright and well animated world through Atlantis. The action is epic and ambitious because I can tell James Wan is a confident director. He definitely gave this movie a nice look so kudos to him on that. And lastly Jason Momoa, I can't deny how much I love him in the role. His character isn't written as well as it could be, but he does what he can, and he's so goofy I love it. It sounds like I hate this movie but I actually don't. It just feels like it's trying to get out of their past mistakes by making a safe and marketable movie. Which is fine. But I wanted something new and different. Here's hoping Shazam can give me what I'm looking for from DC. Should you go see it? Well.. If you're not into superhero movies you're probably not gonna care for this one either. If you want to see some good action and Jason Momoa doin his thing then I'd say it's alright. 7/10."
"beware_of_the_werewolf15","9","1","2","16 December 2018"," Spectacular - Like Nothing Before
","This film has got to be one of the most unique superhero films ever created. I loved every minute. A quarter of the way through and I was already in love. The visuals, the performances, the story, and all of the heroic moments in this film makes it a must see. The underwater scenes, especially the fight scenes, are just beautiful. If you were looking for an amazing superhero film to see this year, this is definitely the one."
"jelaniwilliams305","9","1","2","16 December 2018"," Aquaman was amazing!!! Great job, James Wan
","James Wan did an excellent job with Aquaman. He he adapted the story from Geoff Johns' Throne of Atlantis and used Aquaman's bad a**ery from the New 52 run and I liken Jason's Aquaman look to Peter David's 1994 run (long hair and beard) and they didn't shy away from the ""silliness"" of the golden age Aquaman (if you can't tell, I've been reading Aquaman comics for years).<br/><br/>At it's core, Aquaman is a love story of two people who had no business being together but through their union came a product that would bring unity between 2 worlds. Nicole Kidman absolutely kills it; she needs more action roles. I loved the dynamic of Arthur and Mera; Jason and Amber have great chemistry on screen. I love that Mera is pushing Arthur to become the King even if he doesn't take the task seriously at first. Along it with being a love story, Aquaman is also a globe trotting adventure movie, think Indiana Jones/Romancing the Stone. They go around the world trying to retrieve King Atlan's trident andalong the way, their bond grows stronger and I loved seeing it play out on screen.<br/><br/>One thing I'm a sucker for is an empathetic villain...this film has 2. Orm's motivation was understandable. This film actually had an environmentalist's message about how we treat our oceans and Orm was not having it. Patrick Wilson did an amazing job as always but, to me, Black Manta was more compelling. It's ironic that even though he's a villain, I totally understand his motivation for wanting to kill Aquaman; when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm mad that his role was so small but it was definitely effective; Yahya's Black Manta was a straight savage. Black Manta and Aquaman had some SERIOUS battles over the years in the comics and this film laid some real ground work for that rivalry on the big screen in the first act of the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this film is incredible; Queen Atlanna fighting off the soldiers, Aquaman lifting a freaking sub out of the water and taking down the pirates, Orm vs Arthur's gladiator match in the ring of fire, the chase through Italy, the final battle, OMG THE FINAL BATTLE!!! James' use of the camera during these scenes is second to none. Also, the scene transitions are great.<br/><br/>Visually, this is possible the best I've ever seen in a comic book movie; this movie should really be considered for an Oscar for VFX as well as SFX. Atlantis was BEAUTIFUL, the final battle was Star Wars-esque but underwater, men riding sharks with lasers, sea dragons, giant crustaceans and Arthur's entrance in the final battle is my favorite superhero entrance of the year along with Thor's entrance to Wakanda in Infinity War. James Wan leaned heavily toward his horror roots during the Trench sequence; the creatures were truly terrifying as was the depth from where they came. I love the underwater sound FX as well, they put a really cool effect on their voice when they spoke and the ""wooshing"" sound it made when during the gladiator match.<br/><br/>This film has a little bit of everything; it has heart (I had goosebumps at some parts), the humor was handled well (it didn't overshadow the serious moments), great action. James Wan and company did an excellent job with this one. I'm definitely gonna watch it in IMAX on my next viewing."
"kumarguptamaurya","7","1","2","16 December 2018"," Good but sucks in editing
","The movie was fun, enjoyed it very much.The CGI was great,the action scenes were good but some of them unnecessary,the kingdom of fisherman should have been left out coz they don't have any value in the movie as we are told that they are good people who respect knowledge and avoid conflict ,it would be great if they saved them for the sequel .Overall it feels a little tiring at the end.It stands at roughly 145 minutes which could be trimmed down to 2 hours.Momoa plays Aquaman like a goofy guy but he has lot of charisma because he has a lot of chemistry with all the cast including Dafoe,heard,Nicole Kidman and his father too.The moment in which he appears with the classic suit and the golden trident,that scene is epic,pure magic.The jokes were fine, could've worked with some little of them.The movie starts very fast but it slows a little bit in the middle.The villains were proper characters with a sense of personality.Both of them were distinct.One's motivation is ambition and the others is rage."

"BecauseIAmBATMAN","8","1","2","15 December 2018"," It may be flawed but its Damn Fun
","There is no denying that Aquaman is a damn fun visual spectacle of a superhero action adventure film even if its a flawed one. Its worth watching on IMAX for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone. A lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of Atlantis. The action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen.<br/><br/>Aquaman is an ambitiously large scale film, that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time. The large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple. The age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times. This one done in a reverse of the way Black Panther did. Jason Momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film. Amber Heard as Mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the hero.<br/><br/>The climatic final battle is pretty epic. Comparisons to Avatar are warranted in regards to its CGI and world building. Its kinda sad and ironic that the Aquaman movie in DCEU feels the more grander and epic than Justice League."

The story is very good, the action scenes are great, mainly Aquaman vs Orm and the scene that Aquaman Takes Atlan's trident.
James Wan directs very well the movie, being one of the best movie in your career.
In this Movie a Dc uses the same formula that marvel uses, crianting a funny movie.
The actors work very Well Mainly Jason Momoa, he was the right chose for the role, Amber Heard also works very well she was the right chose for the role of Princess Mera.
I liked a lot of the movie, I recommend."
"Wisesoldierthe6","2","3","12","21 December 2018"," Another snooze fest for dc.
","The movie starts off so well only because of Black Manta. Actually the only great parts were when Black Manta was on screen.<br/><br/>However, this is just another dud for dc. So meh and predictable.<br/><br/>Aquaman is no Thor because he lacks the charisma and dominance like Thor has. The ""bad boy"" Aquaman of The justice League movie is absent. In this movie he is a almost a beta but still a tough guy.<br/><br/>I could barley hear some of the under water dialogue. The scene with Atlantis on land I didn't get why it was destroyed. Most of the lines were just lame and generic.<br/><br/>The Costumes were good. CGI and green screen were so obvious.<br/><br/>Between Justice League movie and Aquaman movie I believe there were contradictions. But who knows or has time to list them since both movies were boring.<br/><br/>The brotherly rivalry sucks. It's no where near Thor and Loki.<br/><br/>Only positives are Black Manta and the giant lobster at the end. I wasn't sure why there was a big fight at the end probably because the dialogue throughout the movie was greatly bad.<br/><br/>Aquaman tries to be Thor (at the end) and fun yet fails. Ocean Master is more fit to be king despite his actions.<br/><br/>DC is 1 and 5 within the dceu. It's best to skip Shazam because it will likely repeat its predecessors formula.<br/><br/>2 out of 10. Only watch if you like boring movies and want to sleep."

","Jason and amber are actually quiet good just wish that the story wasn't so utterly stupid lol The scenes are disjointed jumping around from plot points, black mantis was forgettable and unneeded.

"fernandoschiavi","7","2","7","3 May 2020"," James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule... The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level
","For many years, Aquaman was considered a minor hero in the DC portfolio and thinking about a film adaptation would have been seen as a reverie a few years ago. The character has always been treated with disdain and has even been the target of jokes in several TV series and even films over the last few decades, always in a pejorative way. The character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 (November 1941, despite appearing on the cover ""November"", More Fun Comics # 73 hit the US newsstands on September 25, 1941.). Initially a secondary hero in DC anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes as the main hero.
With the expansion of the DC universe in theaters and the advancement of technology, it was possible to bring to the screen through the hands of one of the most daring and talented directors that have emerged in recent years, James Wan. The Malaysian / Australian director emerged in the mid-2000s when he impressed the world with the iconic horror Mortal Games (2004). Responsible for producing the following chapters of the franchise and for being ahead of other contemporary horror classics, such as the 'Invocation of Evil', 'Supernatural' and 'Annabelle' franchises, the director had already proved himself capable of venturing into other genres typical of blockbuster cinema in the acclaimed 'Fast and Furious 7 (2015)' and now arrives with all the merits to adapt Aquaman's comics for Warner / DC Comics. And in the hands of the director, the final product achieves an unexpected and surprising result.<br/><br/>Being the sixth film in the Extended Universe DC and with a screenplay by Will Beall and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the plot features Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), half-human and half-Atlantean, will have to stop his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who with a vast army at his disposal, plans to conquer both the other kingdoms of the ocean and the world on the surface, becoming the Master of the Oceans to attack the surface. Along with Mera (Amber Heard) he will have to recover Atlan's lost trident and accept his destiny as protector of the depths.
One of the great successes of this film was in the construction of the characters. After having previously appeared in 'Justice League (2017)', Aquaman has its story told in greater detail, since when his parents met, and why Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) had to abandon her young son and husband and return to Atlantis. Soon after, we saw Arthur grow up as a great partner of his father who raised him and being trained by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) both at sea and on the surface, until one day he could take over the kingdom of Atlantis. At the same time in which he presents the character's past and present, he already inserts the hero into the action, in an excellent sequence in a submarine, which even nurtures a feeling of an enemy's rematch for Aquaman.
One of the great successes of the film and that could have a totally opposite effect is the visual and visual effects. Just as James Gunn can create and dare with the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' look on a risky endeavor, so does this DC adventure. One of James Wan's great merits was taking on the fanciful tone and fantastic elements that are inherent in the character's story. The mission is not only to present Aquaman, but the entire mythology of the Seven Seas, including the history of their largest kingdom: Atlantis.
Building an entire universe in the underwater world was not one of the easiest tasks and the transposition of Atlantis from the comic books to the cinema is impeccable, showing all the financial power of the time when the city sank in the sea. They are a symbol of their time with voluptuous monuments and, at the same time, rich and highly technological of a society that was destroyed by their greed, but that also gave them the skills to breathe underwater and to evolve. The city, practically all built in computer graphics, is a delight in the eyes of those who watch. In addition to the city's architecture, the human costumes and the representation of dozens of marine lives are also perfectly done. The fact that the poetic license regarding the ability of the people of Atlantis to breathe and speak under the water at the same time that we see hair and clothes reacting to contact with water does not bother us at all. In addition to visual excellence, Aquaman's greatest asset is being bold enough to bet on a tacky yet mesmerizing aesthetic. Below the water, we see a parade of colors in the costumes and lighting. Feeling in Atlantis is a duty more than fulfilled, as well as the credibility achieved in the diversity of species in that world. The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level thanks to the urgent and exciting direction of James Wan.
Jason Momoa has a natural charisma and clearly has fun playing Aquaman. If, during the casting, your choice was even criticized for not physically looking like the hero of the comics, when we see Momoa in 'Justice League' and now starring in your film, we can no longer disengage from the character's actor. Momoa forms a good pair with Amber Heard, sharing good romantic moments, which is not repeated so much in the most comical part. The actress is bestowed with the best and most relevant female character within the superhero films, with the obvious exception of Wonder Woman within her own film. Mera is the conductor of Arthur's journey to the throne, and although he is his romantic partner, he escapes the common helpless maiden clichÃ©s. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman, even in minor roles, prove to be extremely efficient, including a super action sequence from the character of Kidman right at the beginning of the film.
The villains are other good hits of the feature. Patrick Wilson denotes the exaggerated tone of the film with his great Orm. The Master of the Seas next to the Arraia Negra lived by Yayha Abdul Mateen II. The first incorporates the megalomania of a son who was denied the throne, while the other is the embodiment of simple and pure revenge. Both work well and represent major threats to Aquaman, from the waters and land. Both are so well constructed, so that one is shown to be responsible for the hero's inability to refuse the call for his journey. Aided by the impeccable look, built from the comics of Ivan Reis and Geoff Johns - a good part of the people, in fact, are inspired by the duo's arc.
Some themes are discussed throughout the plot, citing the interference of man in the environment, in an inspired observation that the first act of the sea war against the land was to return decades of garbage thrown into the ocean. Xenophobia is also addressed in this same tone, with the superior underwater races seeing humans as minors.<br/><br/>James Wan shows all his ability by merging scenes shot on a green background, combining all his ability to direct actors and create ingenious action scenes, which was already evident in the seventh adventure in the cinemas of the franchise 'Fast and Furious'. There are several scenes with interesting elements of transition, continuity, flat action sequences (highlighting one involving the character Atlanna, the duel to the candidates for the throne of Atlantis, the incredible sequences in Sicily, Italy and the entire final stretch after Aquaman took over the post of the true heir of Atlantis capable of wielding the trident of the former King Atlan).
'Aquaman' has an excellent look, action with scale, impact and tension, but it sins when it comes to creating true relationships between the characters. One observation is that the film makes it clear that Warner has freed itself from the shadowy bonds in which its extended universe was established from Man of Steel. The created world is well structured and has such a particular identity that such defects are superimposed. The work is full of references, the passage of Arthur and Mera on the surface includes a sequence that refers to the games, not only by the scenery, but also by the color table, by the conduct of the action and the temple, which resembles 'Indiana Jones', while the hero's first foray into Atlantis refers to 'Star Wars', when Jar Jar Binks takes Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to Gunga in 'The Phantom Menace'. James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule, putting the hero to talk to fish or riding a seahorse and, aware of the fantasy he proposes, the film of the King of the Seas has fun like no other DC hero has had in years."

","Looking forward to this DC movie, absolutely rubbish , cley shayed rubbish , stoped watching after about 20 minutes , also bad graphics"
"digitalbeachbum","1","2","7","7 April 2019"," Everything shiny but no substance
","People who write screen plays know one thing, how to make a boring movie. They use one formula to create a movie which people will go to watch but then never want to see it again because the replay value is ZERO.<br/><br/>Movies with substance have replay value. A movie such as Citizen Cane, Glory, Lincoln, Clockwork Orange, Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, Dr. Strangelove or To Kill a Mockingbird. All great movies which you can watch again to see a lesson in life about real people with real problems, played by great actors and great directors and great screen writers.<br/><br/>Yes, Aquaman is fantasy, but it lacks a connection to being a person. There is no desire to know the main character or cheer for them. You already know they are going to win. You already know they will succeed. The writing is so bad, that they show you the ""finishing move"" for the final battle which is never used at any other time in the movie. It's a copy cat script of several dozen other movies in the last fifty years where the hero is predicted to win while in the same breath told he can't win.<br/><br/>Gee, I wonder what is going to happen at the end?<br/><br/>YAWN!<br/><br/>Sure the action is good, there are some good fight scenes, but most of it was just a bunch of CGI thrown in for the big summer block buster formula. It lacked any fight scenes which I would want to see more than once.<br/><br/>Another thing which bothered me is the choice of casting. Aquaman is supposed to be from Atlantis. He isn't a half breed. He isn't from the South Pacific. The story of the people from Atlantis is from the Mediterranean. Why do you think the Atlantic Ocean is called that? Its because of Atlantis!!<br/><br/>So in closing. BARF. The movie sucks. Just another crappy movie pumped out by crappy Hollywood."
"phd_travel","10","2","7","7 January 2019"," Simply the best, better than all the rest
","A more perfect cast couldn't have been put together for this movie. Amber Heard is the most beautiful creature on land or in the sea. Even with orange hair or wet hair she is so stunning that she eclipses all the action going on around her. Her character Mera is no damsel in distress either. So happy she finally has a worldwide audience for her legendary beauty. Jason Momoa is has the build and the hybrid looking eyes that comic book creators could only have dreamt of. Who else could be more suited to the role of Aquaman? There something a little tongue in cheek in his personality that helps too. The multi talented Patrick Wilson as evil brother shows how versatile he is jumping from other Wan movies like Conjuring to this superhero movie effortlessly. Nicole Kidman's towering height has finally been put to good use as queen of Atlantis.<br/><br/>The visuals are also beautiful beyond expectations. When there is too much in the sea there is some interesting surface action too. The satisfying and epic story has remains easy to follow from start to finish - Marvel movies could learn from DC here.<br/><br/>A standard bearer for the future of action hero movies."

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","10","2","7","22 December 2018"," Surpasses Marvel's Bloated Pretentiousness
","Judged upon the comic books and, for this pop culture fanatic, the Ted Knight narrated cartoon of the 1960's, the original Aquaman resembled this movie's blond-haired, war-mongering villain...<br/><br/>Half-brother to the ""new"" JUSTICE LEAGUE established, dark-haired, Hawaiian-looking Jason Momoa, whose power-hungry, utterly Caucasian little brother wants complete control of Atlantis to, of course, destroy the world...<br/><br/>Having been born down there, the white boy's not a ""half breed,"" and it's very similar to the sibling rivalry between Marvel's perfect THOR verses the inferior, frustrated runt, Loki: But AQUAMAN is more precise and straightforward than Marvel's more episodic movies, also borrowing from - and taking the first name of - King Arthur's Sword in the Stone legend, and is arguably the best comic book outing since the first IRON MAN and X-MEN...<br/><br/>Although, with all the CGI needed to make an underwater kingdom exist, it's funny that a movie mostly taking place in the ocean probably didn't get a single drop of water on the cast and crew. But all the hidden green screen in the world can't stop this energetic AQUAMAN from hitting the right marks since it takes the viewer from one location to another (a bit like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL), and with each step there's a new literal clue to get to the next strategic level...<br/><br/>All the while catching sporadic glimpses of, without being tethered to or having to tell half the story with, the Origin involving ""Aquaboy"" being trained by a wise mentor (Willem Defoe) that coincides while moving right alongside the present-time obstacles...<br/><br/>And the ocean isn't all we dive into. From beneath the Sahara desert all the way to the middle of the Earth, director James Wan keeps the viewer's gravity in check as the camera establishes where our reality begins and this movie's fantastical regions begin, remaining simple yet involving as Momoa's Aquaman, with his own pretty Scarlet Johanson type in Amber Heard's Mera, go on what's basically a scavenger hunt to find King Neptune's all-powerful Trident-pitchfork that will allow Arthur aka Aquaman to... you know... do what he was born to do.<br/><br/>The Spy Who Loved Me underwater Lotus... where they see the sea
The second coolest action scene occurs when our initially reluctant hero learns the importance of the mission's goal by failing without it - while the best fight plays out on an island's edge between Aquaman and Manta, who will be the sequel's lead villain, more or less a henchman here...<br/><br/>And in the fun and frolicking Roger Moore James Bond flicks, which is another likely inspiration... especially the underwater vehicle that zips around ""down town"" in this unapologetic, non-stop rollercoaster ride... the worker bees make the best villains, and tend not to... drone on like the primary ones...<br/><br/>Not that it's a perfect movie. Momoa and Heard's banter has a predictable ""He Said/She Said"" cadence, usually leading to She outwitting the physically superior He, or He surprising She with having an actual brain along with the brawn, and you might scream out ""Just kiss already"" after a few forced-heated moments...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Atlantis resembles a bright, shiny, neon arcade cartoon (albeit nicely scored with a fitting old-school techno score) and the puffy-buff sharks look right out of SHARK TALE...<br/><br/>But there's always a good enough reason for our heroes to be wherever the hell they're at, and, unlike the last decade of Marvel, this is a tight action/adventure yarn for people sick of overlong, overly complicated and painfully melodramatic comic book epics. And yes, there will be a sequel. Sequels, actually. But this AQUAMAN proudly stands, and swims, by itself."

Overall the script and the storyline were so cliched that it was cringeworthy at times. Every plot twist was predictable and obvious from the outset which made the film boring.<br/><br/>The lack of character development meant I wasn't invested and didn't care how things turned out - I was just waiting for it to end for the last 45 minutes of the movie. The main villains - Black Manta and Orm were one-dimensional cliches and lacked any depth or personality.<br/><br/>The CGI was overused and at times the fight scenes got a bit silly - a few fish swimming through and destroying metal craft . . . erm, sure, that's totally believable. Ditto a man gets trapped under rubble (which would have crushed his legs) but when it's moved he gets up and walks away.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa was the best thing about this film - he played his role well, but didn't have much to work with, script/plot wise."

It made aquaman to become a coward because when he lost the battle, but he was saved by his brother's fiancée (??) i mean, its so damn weird!! The circuit kept jumping. And the man who lost his father, i thought he would play a big role in making Aquaman trouble in saving the Alantis. And he was defeated easily in spite of having a super armor... And King Orm (is that right) was much stronger than Aquaman. Just because aquaman had a trident, and he is the lead male so he won. That made me unable to submit this result and the power of Aquaman.

Yes it's great going to my weekly CINEMA FIX and coming out feeling happy and fulfilled, many times of which are rare these days, especially with the well over 50 Flicks I see YEARLY in CINEWORLD. From the very beginning till the end I was glued to those OUT OF THIS WORLD FX. I said to my pal Tam "" How the hell do they do it "", well actually I kinda know the effects are created using back engineering from the crashed UFO in ROSSWELL in 1947. ONLY KIDDIN, a great hand to all envolved in creating those mind blowing FX.
At many times throughout the film ,I was reminded of many moments from and including great films I grew up watching, namely that romantic boxing from IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT 1934 with Claudette Colbert & Clark Gable, Sean Connery's wittly comedic one liners from the 60's BOND movies and all those exciting moments from Indiana Jones.
I like to think of myself as a wannnabee casting agent and after seeing the brilliant inventive SAW 2004 I knew there and then we had a maestro of a movie maker by the name of JAMES WAN on our hands. More from this Terrific Director please. I loved everything about this movie, the wonderful narrative, powerhouse acting, FX, and so on. It was also nice seeing the New Zealand actor Temura Morrison who you may or not remember gave a powerhouse performance in ONCE WERE WARRIORS 1994. Patrick Wilson who was in the unsettling Superb movie LITTLE CHILDREN 2006 and HARD CANDY 2005, more than most plays the charismatic good guy, so it's interesting seeing playing the Not So Bad Guy. I wasn't that keen on WODERWOMAN which I thought was kinda boring and a little dissapointing , AQUAMAN on the other hand didn't disappoint it was a PURE BLAST!"

","This movie falls on the tier of the better half of all DC movies and can be called the second best DCEU movie. The movie has one of the best cinematography of all time, probably falling just shortly behind Avatar. The visuals are stunning. Cinematography aside, this movie is quite dull in terms of plot. It has an extremely thin plot and story buildup. You will be left scratching your head at the sequence. One moment a character appears another moment another character appears. And the worst part is that it is highly predictable. Also character buildup is weak. The villain is a villain for the sake of being a villain. There isn't an extra motivation for why he chose the path of the aggressive. But Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were amazing, and their chemistry was magnificent. The latter will especially be benefited for that. Jason Momoa with his charm steals the show. But we can't say the same for the villain and the plot.
Not a bad movie at all, but not a movie to blow your minds either"

","If you want a movie that is full of fight scenes (with actual people as well as animated creatures), action and animated villains, Aquaman is the movie for you. However, if you happen to desire a movie with a script, a storyline and actual acting, then you will pass Aquaman by. This is one of the worst movies that I have seen in years. I cannot tell you the number of bad movies which I have watched hoping that they will improve before the movie ended. However, I knew that that would never happen with Aquaman, so I actually left with about 30 minutes to go so that my entire evening would not be a total waste of time!!! It is, therefore, my recommendation that you save 143 minutes of your life that you will never get back and go to the movies to see something else other than Aquaman."

"fciocca","5","1","3","19 November 2019"," Seems more a videogame than a movie
","When it comes to ""Aquaman"" it is hard to write an opinion. The CGI is amazing, visually speaking, is stunning, I liked the representation of Atlantis and its creatures, it seems a scifi city, but underwater, being a fan of futuristic stuff. I simply loved it and I think that is one of the best SFX that I've watched recently. The problem is that, exactly like in ""Man of Steel"", the movie is overloaded of computer generated images. In fact you there are more CGI, than filmed scenes. You really wonder why they didn't just made an animation movie in motion capture. I can understand that the underwater location is actually very difficult to create stunt scenes, but with a budget of 160 million dollars (source: IMDb movie page), they could have come up with something.<br/><br/>Costumes are simply horrible. I don't even know who approved them. Soldier costumes are a mix between a space suit and a diver suit. Without any doubt, the lowest point is Black Manta. It seems a bug, that you can easily crush. I laughed when I saw it. The actor that played him was really bad, not credible as a villain. They should definitely make better casting decision in Warner Bros. Speaking of which, I was really disappointed by Patrick Wilson, I think that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood and I watched many movies starring him, such as the entire saga of ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious"" and I loved his interpretation in ""Watchmen"", so he even has already experience with superhero movies. In ""Aquaman"" was underwhelming and not credible at all as a villain, even less than Black Manta. He didn't even tried to create a credible character: no personality and no charisma. Jason Momoa is the usual supermacho guy that will always be stuck in this kind of roles, exactly like Vin Diesel, but at least this was a good choice, and actually I liked him playing Arthur.<br/><br/>The DC Extended Universe has a lot of potentialities, but they are simply wasting it. Stop doing movies drugged of CGI like this one or ""Justice League"", give us some real actions, more stunts scenes like in ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Shazam!"" Stop creating this mindless movies with always the same story, try at least something different, as in ""Batman V. Superman"". DC is capable to create good movies if it wants to, and I have reported three valid examples. Let's only hope that the second Wonder Woman and ""Birds of Prey"" movies, will be good."

Thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously and has a pretty charismatic leading man who takes the film through a few silly scenes too.

Aquaman is like a teenager who's being forced to clean his room. Nothing he does is because he feels he wants to, or because he should do, or because he cares about something. That may be a little unfair, I think his motivation is wanting to look cool.<br/><br/>The script is terrible. The acting is sub par. The plot doesn't make sense.

","Clearly DC has no chance because either the executives of the movie companies or the chosen directors have no clue how to follow the comics. I don't know who is to blame but Aqua Man starts out like a rushed product by those who got into the movie producing business by their parents. Because clearly the DC movies including this crap could not have been orchestrated by people with merits. The opening scenes in the submarine just sunk this movie from the get go. A mercenary that vows revenge on the main character because his father traps himself. They try to start a plot and it fails from the start. Then the eventual war within the fish ranks. Oh and the acting is horrible but not as bad as the corny lines. Just a simple movie for simple minded people."
"Easygoer10","6","1","3","11 August 2019"," Not Bad
","Its funny seeing the characters played Patrick Wilson & others who are the nemesis of Arthur/Aquaman, played by Jason Momo. I have been a fan of Jason Momoa ever since the 2nd season of Stargate Atlantis. Unlime Wilson & the other actors, Jason has real muscles, & tgey are not from lifting weights. He is also a very bright individual, who has oroduced & directed seceral shorts & a couple of feature length independent films aswell. He doesnt beed a ouffed up muscle bound suit, which is why you see him shirtless. Trust me, he is more like actirs similar to Gerard Butler & Chris Hemsworth. They all posess that rare combination of talent and beauty; nit just oretty hunks with no brains (who are a dime a dozen). One coincidence is Michael Beach plays the father of ""Black Manta"" (pirates), who Aquaman allows to drown, whuch Nanta seejs revenge for; which in itself is actually quite stupid. He & his father were murderers & pirates: they chose the life. Regardless, my point is Jason Momia & Michael Beach both were on Stargate Atlantis (as allies). Momoa was cast in over 75 epusodes; Beach was on about 6 episides. Even though Momia was on Game of Thrones & seceral other series, Stargate Atlantis is the one which made him a star with a huge fanbase. He deserves it, & I am happy for him. This film is all about CGI special effects, which (for me) are quite boring. Lastly, it is a comuc book film, whose fanbase is mostly preteens: they are all about the mighty dollar. At least Jason gets to make much more money plus move him up into the ""A-List"" of action film stars. This will allow him to make many more films of his own; which is much better than pablum like this."
"heatsink98","2","1","3","11 August 2019"," This movie's heading changes with the breeze
","Inconsistent. That's a problem that plagues this film from start to end. As a prime example, some CGI effects are spectacular, some not so much. Compositing is atrocious. Amber Heard's red hair frequently has a white glow around it because the composite work looks like it was done in minutes on a $5 budget. And what's with the horrific anti-aging effects at the start of the movie? The actors looked like they had rubber masks glued to their faces.<br/><br/>The direction is just as up and down as the script. Tone is all over the place. Goofy one moment, serious the next, and then back to complaining about missing happy hour at one point by our hero. WONDER WOMAN'S excellent story provided some hope for DC's film universe, but AQUAMAN didn't carry on with the work."

","Easily the most likeable and relatable character in the DCU, Aquaman seemed like a sure bet as a great movie and origin story. He stole the show in Justice League, so I was so excited at the chance for his character to be given the justice of an entire movie.
That lasted about 20 mins.
That plot for this movie is about as watertight as a pasta strainer, despite the generous liberties we take with regards to plausibility in superhero movies. From the distracting and unnecessary ""underwater"" vocal effects to the complete and utter assault on your senses due to the visual overkill with the final big battle, this movie quickly became a gigantic parody of itself. The plot ""twists"" of the creature protecting the trident and ending up being ridden by Aquaman into the final battle and his mother still being alive were things even my young children called out way before it happened.
All in all, this was just a jumbled, forgetable and garbled mess, yet somehow it filled seats. I'm still looking forward to the sequel though."
"tommy5677","2","1","3","29 June 2019"," Yawn.. worst superhero movie ever.
","Watching this movie was nothing short of painful and it wasn't long in until I was asking myself if I've ever actually got up and walked out of a movie. It was tempting. I decided to stay to see if it would actually go anywhere. Turns out it's one of the worst ever. The only barely redeeming value was the fact that they had a couple of major stars in Nicole Kidman and Willam Defoe. I have no idea why either would take part in such a ridiculous venture. Perhaps it was flattering to have any evidence of aging removed and it was a digital facelift for both.
Like many of its superhero predecessors it is so over done on constant unrelenting action, violence, and CGI that it rapidly became a real snoozer though impossible to actually fall asleep.
This movie is also not for children. If you don't want your child exposed to this sort of thing then leave them home. There was one 7 year old seen covering his ears and ended up on his fathers lap. Please do your children and yourself a favor.
Many here cite the fact that it was a ripoff from so many other stories but the silliest reference of them all was that to King Arthur as he pulled the Trident from its impossible-to-remove resting place. Oh brother. Please don't insult such wonderful fictional legends.
If you need someone with a killer body in your hero, please do so with an actual actor. Someone who can run with the big boys.
This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. Isn't that what we're looking for in the genre?"

","It really isn't surprising that Aquaman is one of the most successful DC movies. They figured out Marvel movies are much better accepted by the audience, they tried to make one Marvel style film and they failed miserably. Honestly this story needs at least 1 more hour to be told without rushing. Half of the scenes that are performed by Jason, Amber, Nicole and almost every other actor are extremly cringey. And I don't even want to talk about graphics that look like video game, it's beautiful but it's unreal, and I know it's not supposed to be quite realistic but at several moments I was very disturbed by graphics. The whole story is just bad and cheap and honestly if it wasn't DC movie and if it was done with less money everyone would see that it isn't that good. Is it the worst superhero movie, nope. Is it the best superhero movie, definitely 100% no. Is it good, that's debatable. In my opinion, no, but hey people seem to love it. It's just very disappointing..."

"CubsandCulture","4","1","3","4 June 2019"," An improvement for DC. It is still a garish, ugly mess.
","My biggest problem with the film is the overall design is, to be blunt, a psychedelic blur with no proper sense of scope. Each section of the film has its own fundamentally incompatible aesthetic. On their own each of the Kingdoms can be quite beautiful but there was no thought of how they fit together. More problematic, the various sections are all, by narrative, descended from a single source but don't actually look they do. (I just don't see the connection between say the Fishmen and the Kingdom of the Brine). This gives the film a very episodic feel and the tone never quite settles into a coherent film. The film is very ugly as a result.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the storyline is overly complicated. A bit like Black Panther the film is rooted in Hamlet and when it sticks to its royal drama structure it is compelling. Yet the film feels the need to inject the MacGruffin questline and an (rushed) origin story for Manta to pad its run time. The characters are too often going from point A to point B with no time to breath. I still am not sure what the extent of Aquaman's, and others', abilities are. No one seemed to suffer from any flaws. The story is a jumble of ideas. And when such concepts as ""ocean master!"" is part of the story it becomes laughable quite quickly.<br/><br/>Unlike most DC films this one doesn't suffer from the brooding, humorless tone. Aquaman, the character, is at least engaging and charming. He isn't saddled with just tragic backstory to be oh so dark. Now the film is still quite bad but at least DC seems to be aware of the problems. Hopefully they will one day make a good film.<br/><br/>But we are still waiting that day."

He can act, he has done a good job, but there are way too many scenes where he fails miserably to transport emotions. Just playing the badass is not enough.</li><li>What is up with the extremely colourful, over the top CGI? If I want to watch a big war like this, I will watch a space opera. Not a single time I thought ""cool"", all the time I thought ""hey this is like shooting scenes in the 70s: long, drawn out, completely meaningless without anything really happening for minutes"".</li><li>The story was completely predictable from minute one. The only ""twist"" was for me that Aquaman was not betrayed by the character of Willem Dafoe</li><li>the costumes look so plastic, the weaponry, the armor, here was a possibility to show creativity: How would weapon and armor look like of an army from the deep sea? The movies answer: Just like on land, only colourful and plastique looking</li><li>again 0 chemistry between Momoa and Heard..... why would they love each other? Because the script says so?</li><li>really, why is Aquaman ""worthy""? Because the script says so? Why should a creature that protects a weapon for 1000s of years (without eating anything, biology anyone?) hand that weapon over to Aquaman? Because he is like King Arthur and pulls Excalibur from King Atlan? That was so cheesy and stolen, it made me cringe in the inside.</li><li>I nearly forgot about the ""Black Manta"".... when he was on screen with his ridiculously big helmet for the first time, I had to laugh. Is there a more laughable, ridiculous villain in any movie?</li></ul><br/><br/>I am actually really sorry for the DC fans.

","Pure Trash by James Wan. Embarassing to watch, but hey, the VFX were kinda good. Amber Heard is just so bad at acting, wow. Jason Momoa can only act as himself doing another character. The directing is lazy and the actors don't even care. The script? More like scribbles... cheesy af. Garbage."

"stevenrotherforth","9","1","3","11 April 2019"," With Aquaman DC are now a genuine rival for Marvel
","Aquaman<br/><br/>Hiring James Wan to direct Aquaman has thankfully injected some spirit into the DC universe.
With the dark and depressing first instalments coming from Zack Snyder and then a more upbeat effort in the form of Wonder-woman, Wans film has elevated DC to be a genuine rival for Marvel in terms of a cinematic offering.
If you have the opportunity to watch Aquaman on a 4K display with HDR then this is a must see movie. More on that later!<br/><br/>Aquaman tells the story of Arthur Curry played with relish by the charismatic Jason Momoa. A film that my better half wasn't interested in seeing until she clapped eyes on a shirtless Momoa.
He may not be the greatest actor in the world but he surely owns every scene he's in.
His character is half human, half from Atlantis and his quest is to prevent his brother King Orm from waging war on the surface dwellers.
It's all a bit silly but still immensely entertaining and rather inventive.
Made so by some impressive visuals and direction by James Wan.
Set design and cinematography are reminiscent of James Cameron's Avatar.
From underwater cities to breathtaking landscapes this is one spectacular looking movie.
Every scene is a visual feast and as I mentioned this is a must see movie in 4K HDR.
The higher resolution will allow colours to burst
from your TV and the added layer of detail help bring underwater kingdoms and creatures to life.
High Dynamic Range is utilised here to reference quality. A must have purchase on Ultra High Definition Blu-ray if like I you are into Home Cinema.
Colours are so superb that this will be your new go to disc to impress friends with your set up.
Particular scenes such as the end battle show HDR to its full potential.
Depth is pretty decent too which helps the underwater environments have a sense of realism.
Subtle details are finely rendered.
Take Princess Mera's long flowing red hair for example.
HDR allows her hair to be very vibrant whilst a grain free digital image shows every strand of hair on the princesses head.
Costumes are also superbly presented.
Every scale on Aquaman's gold suit is distinctive and King Orms purple chest armour is so bright it almost looks three dimensional.
There are some soft shots particularly when CGI is at its heaviest but you'd be hard pushed to notice. I found the scene on the cargo plane to be flawless. A true 4K crispy image.<br/><br/>If the picture quality is excellent then the Dolby Atmos sound mix is equally impressive.
On Ultra High Def Blu-ray this is reference quality too.
The LFE channel gets deep down and dirty with some floor shaking bass.
The scene in the Trench will have your subwoofer working overtime.
The Atmos mix utilises height channels superbly allowing atmospherics to blend in seamlessly.
Sound stage is wide and energetic making for a truly exciting surround sound experience.
A good sound mix is one that envelops the listener without them being aware and this one achieves this impressively.<br/><br/>With a stellar supporting cast this film has a further ingredient to be a success.
At 2hrs 23mins James Wan has sculpted a movie that flows just like water.
Enough time is devoted in fleshing out the characters.
Sure more could have been done with the two lead villains. Patrick Wilson's King Orm and Yaha Abdul-Mateen II as Manta are possibly the most underdeveloped of all the cast but this barely hinders the sheer enjoyment of the movie.
Jason Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera have a believable chemistry and Hollywood superstars Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe bring the gravitas.
Dolph Lundgren puts in a second great performance of 2018 after his welcome return in Creed II.
The script and delivery of dialogue is punchy and jokes land with precision.
Aquaman is well made in all aspects and takes the DC universe out of the gloom.
I have no problem with the darkness of Batman Vs Superman. I just believe that Aquaman will appeal to a larger audience because it's more colourful and fun.
If it's spectacle you're after then Aquaman delivers big time.
It may not be as deep as say 'Logan' or 'The Dark Knight'
It may not have the years of backstory that was dedicated to 'The Avengers' but Aquaman is a vibrant treat that so far the DC universe has been missing.
Long live King Arthur!"
"damon158","8","1","3","11 April 2019"," Nicely done DC!
","I gotta say, I really enjoyed this film. It was by no means perfect, but I really appreciate the direction they took Arthur Curry's character. I wasn't really a fan of the character in justice League so I was a little apprehenisve about this film at first by Jason Momoa's portrayal in this completely won me over. Hats off to James Wan and everyone involved. This along with Wonder Woman have really shown that DC movies and characters can be great. I've always been a DC fan, so it's nice to finally have a couple films out there that show just how amazing these characters can be and how amazing the stories surrounding them can be. It's not a matter of choosing between Marvel or DC, both are awesome in their own rights so it's nice to see DC making the movies that the fans and characters deserve."

","First time in a long time I didn't get lost in fight scenes I was very surprised in a good way"
"JakeBrinkman","5","1","3","6 April 2019"," Bad for a superhero movie
","I love superhero movies and shows, and this is the lowest I've ever rated one since the Iron Fist series. Don't get me wrong, 5 stars still means it was worth the watch, but I probably won't be rewatching this movie. There were two positives about the film. The first is the action, which is unquestionably amazing. It's very well-coordinated that I couldn't help but feel awed by some of the scenes, even while I wasn't emotionally invested in the scene.<br/><br/>The second good aspect was Momoa. His devil-may-care attitude and raw prowess translate well to the big screen. This new take on Aquaman is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre... except that it was already fresh in Justice League and he isn't ever given anything better than we've already seen, even in his own movie. Momoa does well in spite of it, but the character was not written as well as he should have been. In fact, even the emotional scenes where Momoa could have flexed his acting talents were given to a different actor by only occurring in flashbacks with a younger actor. It's difficult to get emotionally invested in a movie when it seems like the main character doesn't feel strongly about anything.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, Wilson and Mateen both perform decently. Not outstanding since their one-dimensional characters had no depth, but also having enough potential to keep the viewer engaged if not satisfied. The story occasionally tries to touch on the villain's emotions, but the limited screen time never allows them to dive in. I truly believe the movie should have toned down the epic war scenes and focused on establishing Aquaman as a character along with introducing an intimidating low-threat villain with a little depth, like was done in Spider-Man: Homecoming. They could have easily done this by keeping Black Manta as the sole villain. Then they could saving the jaw-dropping spectacles for Aquaman 2, where Oceanmaster would be the main villain and they could have more screen time to explore Oceanmaster's ruthlessness and dynamic with Aquaman. Combining them into one film made for a movie so rushed that neither villain's story had any emotional weight.<br/><br/>As for other actors, this is where we start getting from bad to worse. Not that any performances were outright bad, but they were certainly given horrible dialogue. Nearly all of the dialogue for Mera and occasional lines for everyone else were so cliched and/or cringe-worthy that it honestly makes you think the movie would have been better if the character didn't say anything at all at that moment. The worst moment was the Pinocchio joke; the joke itself was great, but the minute-long explanation of the joke actually had me squirming out of my seat with embarrassment for the entire superhero genre. Some of the other jokes were fine, but all of the subversive humor was awful. Subversive humor has already been overused in the Marvel series, so even though it was new for the DC series, it still felt contrived and unoriginal. In a movie with an entire franchise riding on it, screenwriting is not where you should start making budget cuts.<br/><br/>On the subject of budget cuts, the budget could have been significantly smaller if a less-known actor was cast in the place of Defoe. Defoe is a great actor whose talents were absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional emotionless character (though he would have been good spread out with more screen time in my 2 movie idea). Again, no fault of the actor, but definitely a fault of the screenwriter.<br/><br/>If it seems like my review is overly harsh, its because the superhero genre has given us a high standard to expect. This movie fell short in every single aspect, and it is definitely the fault of the poor screenwriting. Warner Brothers shouldn't have hired two relatively inexperienced low-budget writers for such a high-budget film."

","I wasn't a great fan back in the sixties. Not like I was for the rest of DC pantheon. The TV cartoon was part of the Superman Hour (with that guitar dahh-ranggg! sound effect). On the Big Bang Theory, poor Raj was left being Aquaman because everyone else had their hero choice first. The character was a real #luser when it came to popularity. Then came Justice League.<br/><br/>""I hear you can talk to fish.""<br/><br/>Everything changed. HOLEY UNDERWEAR! It turns out that Aquaman is a BAD ASS!<br/><br/>This movie delivers on all points. Aquaman is human, not just some strange Prince Namor Submariner. He likes drinking beer, partying with tough guys, getting tattoos and hangs with his dad. He cracks wise while he cracks heads. He's intensely loyal. And he's very powerful.<br/><br/>Visually, it's brilliant with incredible action scenes. Patrick Wilson plays an arrogant leader who rules the Kingdom of Atlantis and has a plan to unite the Undersea against the surface dwellers. Amber Heard is the beautiful daughter of an allied Kingdom. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman play Arthur Curry's parents. Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren round out a name cast lead by Jason Momoa. And yes, CGI is used. And the CGI is extremely effective. It gives a dreamlike appearance to underwater sequences which would be impossible to do as practical effects.<br/><br/>The story is top notch: it follows a path that at times makes effective use of flashbacks while advancing the plot. It's very satisfying and concludes heroically. Yes, it's a fairy tale ending, but what did you expect? IT'S A COMIC BOOK-SUPERHERO MOVIE!"
"cherold","5","1","3","26 March 2019"," Terrible script, looks like it might be fun to watch in 3D
","I was in the minority of IMDB reviewers who liked the underrated Justice League, and now, with the latest movie featuring Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I am in the minority again, this time having a far more negative reaction than most people.<br/><br/>While the CGI action is *sometimes* fun, the dialogue is excruciatingly bad. Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.<br/><br/>People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.<br/><br/>The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.<br/><br/>I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue."

Nothing makes sense, in a bad way, nothing is properly explained although the dialogue is 90% exposition... There is no reason to be invested in any of the characters. Who are these people even? It's just meaningless cool scene after meaningless cool scene with no coherence. Also the costumes are atrocious. Who even made all these fake wigs? Blah, expected better."

","Aquaman is an amazingly entertaining movie with breathtaking underwater battles and great visual effects. My score of the movie on IMDB is deliberately set to 10 with the hopes to increase the overall rating of the movie. Certainly, the film is not perfect having some plot holes, and some other inconsistencies with the characters. This film focuses only on showing Aquaman origin story combined with amazing battles - and it accomplished its task on a high note. Some of the other reviewers on IMDB mentioned negative aspects such as weak dialogs or rushed character development. I believe these aspects are not important for this kind of film, one of the main goals is to be entertained. And we all are highly entertained! Aquaman is definitely not a character-focused drama, it is instead a fantasy adventure based on the characters from a comic book.

","Aquaman is such a blast from start to finish, and an epic ride that feels like its on the same level of ambition and scale as 'Avatar'. I am so happy that James Wan got to direct this film, because if you've seen Furious 7 where the action sequences in that film were extremely well-shot and impressive, you won't be disappointed by the fight scenes here.<br/><br/>
Yes, the CGI is impressive, especially towards the end of the film. But I feel that special praise should be given to the in-camera fight scenes i.e. the hand-to-hand combat sequences that involved very minimal to no CGI. This is some of the best action in the DC Universe, on par with Zack Snyder's Batman fight and Patty Jenkins' No Man Land sequence.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is absolutely fantastic and is a lot reserved and sincere in his performance, contrary to his real-life persona where he's always wacky and energetic and a bit crazy. But here he's fantastic. Patrick Wilson is also great as the villain, Ocean Master and he has a very thrilling and menacing presence in a lot of the film's scenes. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were amazing as well in their performances, as well as Dolph Lundgren, for heaven's sake! He's not in it much, but he gave a surprisingly good performance. And the same can be said for Willem Dafoe who, ever since 'Spiderman' I've been a big fan of him as an actor.<br/><br/>This feels like an epic fantasy picture and should definitely not be missed. If anything, it just goes on to show what a talented director James Wan is."

","I can not really understand those people who -from my point of view- very easily threw around those 2s and 3s around.<br/><br/>First things first; my reasons or expectations when I choose to go along with DC or Marvel movies are never about the narrative or the story-line. Having laid my hands upon a few of these comics in my time, I mostly know what they are about. They are about those alter hero egos that we have and thanks to ever evolving technology, visual effects and to see how the movie team envisioned the setting.
Because;
Well, helloooo! The stories, the character backgrounds, arch-villians were delivered long time ago, aaaand plots over plots have been worked upon already in the comic series. This is not a political thriller or mystery movie where you will find stomach churning twists around every corner that will dazzle you in ways you would not expect.
So what I liked;
I found Aquaman to deliver a good job when it is about visuals. I very much liked the technological gadgets&vehicles of the Atlanteans and specifically enjoyed the underwater scenes&visuals and the Daft Punk like music that accompanied it (which kind of pleasantly reminded me Tron).<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that Jason Momoa was chosen to be the lead actor, him being from Hawai ascend and a few times in the movie throwing in gestures coming from his culture was neat.<br/><br/>I also liked the scenes with the Kraken and how he gets the trident like Arthur gets the Excalibur or Conan his sword. It had similar flavours but in a pleasing way.<br/><br/>As the villains go I have to say Patrick Wilson also does a good job as King Orm.<br/><br/>So if you have no prejudice on DC, and realistic about what to expect from these movies I say; Aquaman nails it in a rather good way. I have to admit one of the best I have seen recently, and yes including Deadpool 2 or Avengers Infinity War 1!"
"rick-21727","4","1","3","7 January 2019"," Predictable plot
","This movie at times was cringeworthy. The dialog between actor seems to be written with 5 year olds in mind. The CGI was good but at times overdone leaving one to think,yeah right. Going into this movie one has to turn off your brain and accept it for what it is to get through it."
"jayadeepjoshy","9","1","3","7 January 2019"," If your don't watch it in theatres, well it's your Loss !
","It's funny the first review I saw after coming to Aquaman IMDb page was of a guy who says"" he was so annoyed for people reviewing the movie they watched before he could watch"" I'll never know what he meant by that. He repeatedly days he loves DC in his review. But any sane person can read through his review he hates on DC. I'm just citing this to tell you people please don't listen to people like him. They just want to degrade every other comic book movie that's not part of MCU. They even did that that Venom (which is a Marvel character, but not in MCU) which wasn't tied to MCU, which by the way was hugely successful despite these miscreants badmouthing the movie. People are getting the fact that even so called critics are useless, they also have a bias, that they can't just take their word for it. If you want to know how good a movie is ask around the people you know who have watched it. My honest opinion on film is I went to Aquaman without a lot of hope, because James Wan's any of previous films weren't CBMs. I wasn't sure well he be able to pull it. I wasn't much excited too. I only went and watched it because it was a DC movie. (yep I love DC more, I'm not gonna lie) . But I was really surprised by what James wan had to offer with Aquaman. It had an amazing pacing to the story. No lag or what so ever. What we saw it trailers is nothing compared to actual movie. Visuals were amazing. It's something that's unique. It's made in a grand scale. If you're gonna watch it , it better be on the biggest screen you can find. If you don't it's your LOSS. You'll know when you watch it on DVD or Blu-ray that ""Damn I should've watched it in theatres"".
My review is applicable only to general audiences who enjoys movies for their quality but their Brand.
Certain fanboys will disagree with it, because they don't like good competition."

I will be very careful before I take my grandchildren to see a DC movie."

However something about this movie and especially Jason Momoa's character just makes me wanna watch this movie again and I just left the theater. He brings a real and authentic feel to this hero that you can relate to. I hands down fully feel this is without a doubt one of if not the best film I've seen all year. Go see it now!!!!"

","I mean, it's fun. I'm glad they made it fun, but Christ the genre changes with every new scene. I think people like this movie because it does everything - every cliche, every movie genre, every visual and audio choice possible. I'm pretty sure people are just so overwhelmed and they remember snippets of the things they like and are immediately concussed by everything else (cause there's so god damn much), so they just walk out of the cinema in a daze cause it isn't humanly possible to accept this movie in one sitting. The biggest thing was the cringey dialogue, really put me off the character development cause I couldn't accept a real human being would talk like they did in this movie. It's jarring to say the least. But Jason as Aquaman was a really great choice and I'm glad he was in it. I'm numb to everyone else. It's worth seeing if you like fun and if you can stand the romantic comedy movie genre. If not, this movie will just be cringey. I liked it, but won't be seeing it again."

"No-ideas-for-my-ID","4","1","3","2 January 2019"," One word sums it up: Wack.
","To be honest, I have never read the comics for Aquaman, but honestly this is what us French Canadians call a ""croûte"", which pretty much means mediocre. After seeing so many super hero movies (btw I really don't care if it's DC or Marvel, I don't know what the fanboyism is about, I just want a good movie) and actually movies in general, I had some (pretty low though) expectations. But this, this was horrible. The plot was extremely flawed (I won't spoil it but if you watch it you might know what I mean from the very beginning of the movie), and some elements just not making any form of sense with previous events. Also, the acting was at its worse (seriously, I've seen better acting from secondary school students doing a forced movie project by an english teacher). Everything the characters said was so emotionless and directly recited that it was cheesy and outright seemed unprofessional (which stunned me coming from such a large studio with some usually very good actors). The most ""dramatic"" moments were so badly interpreted that they were funny. Even if you do like the story assuming you have read the comics you probably will be shocked by the low quality of the acting and the CGI. Oh boy the CGI. When I watched it, I had the constant feeling that I was watching some cheesy Mr. Clean commercial from the mid-2000's. The movie revolves around CGI (pretty much half the movie happens underwater so obviously) and does a very poor job at it. However, even if pretty much 90% if the movie was terrible, the fight choreographies are decent, and if you like very classic movies or are with a kid, you might end up enjoying it. I was with my father who was a huge fan of the comics when I watched the movie, and even though Aquaman was one of his favorite super heroes, he thought the same as me. To sum it up, I absolutely do not recommend going to the theater to watch it, but I suggest to consider watching it when it's going to be available on streaming platforms if you want to laugh at the movie a bit or to watch some underwater fights."
"supaguyu","9","1","3","2 January 2019"," Finally DC has stepped up

"larauk","5","1","3","1 January 2019"," Definitely not anything above a 5/10

The music is repetitive and it is ridiculously cliched. The graphics weren't amazing. It is now where near as good as woman woman. I just can't believe it is scores so high on here when there are so many other quality comic book films out there to compare it to."
"alejandrokilei","7","1","3","1 January 2019"," Slightly better than MCU but still cliche
","The new aquaman comics have been fantastic and this movie plays off of the new line of comics. That is also the downside to this movie - it feels like a string of comics smashed together; it was missing a solid overarching thread to keep everything pieced together. It also felt like they missed out on some scenes that really would have added some depth if they lingered on them a bit more, but instead they raced to the next action scene. I think they wanted to keep things moving, but they missed out on some major scenes to connect with the characters. There was a heavy use of CGI in this movie (as is common with DC movies...), but it was definitely blended better and not as much was used as has been the case in previous DC movies. It was better put together than many recent marvel movies which are beginning to just feel like cliche michael bay films (I'd rate all recent marvel movies between 4-7 out of 10 stars for perspective)."

"tslipais","7","1","3","1 January 2019"," Nice to look at
","I've always had a soft spot for Aquaman and this movie was pretty much what I expected it to be, stunning visuals with a mediocre script.
A lot of the dialogue between Arthur and Mera was so disconnected which made it hard to believe there was any sort of genuine connection between them. As cheesy as the rest of it was, it strangely worked and felt consistent.
The soundtrack was decent except for the random Pittbull track.. yes that's right... Pitbull, which set up the following scene to be more jovial than it should have been.
Black Manta was a great concept but Yahya's performance left me wanting more dialogue and less soap opera dramatization.
Overall the film was fun, full of stunning battle scenes and seeing Jason Momoa in the old school Aquaman getup was well worth every second."
"derk144","Null","1","3","31 December 2018"," He's always been more than the guy who talks to fish.
","While not perfect, I would put this one at the top of the DCEU alongside Wonder Woman (2017). An underwater story of King Arthur, borrowing elements from Thor (2011) & Black Panther (2018), that brings us an entertaining adaptation of the New 52 Aquaman storyline by Geoff Johns & Ivan Reis. It's impressive how much Atlantean history they were able to include without bogging down the narrative. The underwater sequences are really impressive with the scale of this aquatic world brought to life, with nearly every bit of the film shot in IMAX. The acting was fine, although the stiff & expository dialogue made it obvious how much they are banking on the foreign market for this film. The CGI is well done, but it still suffers from some shoddy green screen work that seem to plague the DCEU. The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams stands shoulder to shoulder with his work on Wonder Woman, but some of the soundtrack choices are distracting. All in all, an impressive entry from DC Films & a fun super hero flick."
"coolcleangreen","7","1","3","31 December 2018"," Fun, Spectacular, but Horrible Script Though
","I loved the movie! Don't get me wrong. It was a thrill ride! However, the lack of script development was unfortunate. I also have to note that some of the musical selections were glaringly out of place. Bright spots were scenes between Aquaman and his father, because I actually felt history and deep connection between the characters that resonated in me. Momoa has a way with improvisational speech that works to anchor the bad script but everyone else seemed to be reading sparsely populated cue cards. Lots of eye-rolling cliches all over the place. Meanwhile, the action and visuals were spectacular, including one breath-taking scene of extreme peril near the end of the second act of the film. There was plenty of fun and funny moments and even the cartoony stuff was on the good side of ridiculous. So yeah, 7/10 because the movie does its job in the superhero sphere, bringing some camp, some heart, and some awesome visuals. But can we sprinkle some ""Whedon dust"" on the next installment please?!? I have a feeling he can craft the more complicated dialogue that should have been explored in this origin story.<br/><br/>I saw this on IMAX. I highly recommend watching this film on IMAX."

Gorgeous colors and interesting use of sea creatures. Cool CGI effects. Kids will love that!<br/><br/>The not so good? Lazy dialogue, uninspired score, and most melodramatic villain we've seen, well since Justice League. Patrick Wilson is a stellar actor and even he couldn't quite elevate the character of King Orm beyond a ""dun-dun-duh"" villain. I had really hoped for some great smart aleck comedy from Arthur/Aquaman, but his character seemed too overwhelmed to deliver on that.<br/><br/>At first, I thought it was just me, but my teen son, i.e., the fan base, was bored.

"DKosty123","8","1","3","28 December 2018"," Nicely Done -Straight Forward & Effective
","James Wan, Director extrodinare of the Saw movies goes beyond cutting up here in an adaption of AquaMan which would make it's creators proud if they can see it (RIP). A lot of people worked on this film done in 12 filming locations and that shows very much in the finished product. It sticks with Aquamans original themes and characters and manages to get some humor into the film. This is the best Warner/DC effort in a while.<br/><br/>It works well because the script is better than a lot of DC films have been recently. It is predictable, all the way to the sequel sequence during the credits, but it is going to take some extra effort to make a better film than this one. It does have the one drawback many cgi movies have, no matter how much dirt there is in a sequence, the stars always come out squeaky clean with even a hair out of place.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman (age 51, are you kidding?) is very good as the Queen of Atlantis. Amber Heard is the Red Haired Princess who helps the light house keepers son become the hero Aquaman we are all in need of. The thing good about this film is that there are no wrinkles or curves thrown at the viewer. The flashbacks make sense (for once), and all the script makes sense too.<br/><br/>Major Spoiler-
We all expect the Queen to still be alive even after we are told she is not. Aquaman finally finds his mom and it is a satisfying moment in this one. After all, moms treat their hero sons the best."

","Well done DC! I really enjoyed this one. My daughter bought us tickets to see Aquaman (she knew I was curious and wanted to see it). From beginning to end, I can say I was completely immersed in the story. Good story, too. Never a dull moment. This movie is really about family. It's about doing the right thing, for the right reasons. Aquaman (Arthur) doesn't really want to get involved with the problems of the world (on land or in the ocean), especially at first. And that's what makes it more interesting. The lead actor does a great job at portraying Aquaman. Mera is fantastic, as is Orm, and also Atlanna. All the cast does a great job in my opinion - they seem to be enjoying themselves, and that shows through the screen. The underwater world is AMAZING. They did a lot of good stuff with the story development there - and I want to know more about it!

"dylanburgin","9","1","3","27 December 2018"," Lover of all things nerdy...OF COURSE IT'S GREAT!
","This review might be a little biased since I love all things nerdy, however I can say for sure that this movie was surprisingly great. I prefer DC to Marvel in terms of characters and comics, but it's obvious that Marvel is the king of superhero movies (I actually hated Justice League even though it's my favorite team of heroes comic-wise). I enjoyed Wonder Woman a lot despite it's pretty awful 3rd act and I think it is the best DCEU movie yet...until aquaman.
Aquaman is a goofy movie theres no denying. Don't go in expecting a movie like the great Infinity War that is mostly serious and dire. No, Aquaman knows that it is pretty silly and that's what makes it excel. The over-the-top visuals, fights, and overall scenes make the movie seem straight out of a comic book at times and I loved it, though I could see how hardcore MCU fans won't.
The fight scenes with the amazing directing by James Wan are the best I've seen in a superhero movie so far. They are well choreographed and have a good use of slowmo shots that make it seen very theatrical and utterly badass.
The plot is pretty straightforward but had some spots where it's not super clear what's supposed to be happening. Also, it was a little too cliche. ""The chosen one going to find an ancient artifact in order to take his place as king to unite the people"". Pretty sure we've seen or read it a thousand times, but that's why...it works.
The only flaw in my opinion is the dialogue. The acting was pretty top notch. I've never been too much of a Jason Mamoa fan bc I always thought he acted through gruff an brute strength instead of emotion but this movie proved me wrong. He did really great with this role, and it helps that it seems the role was fit around him. The beautiful Amber Heard did really great as well and I really loved her character!! I thought Orm was going to be cringy and awful going in, but I was actually convinced of his acting and motivations in the movie. Tamuera Morrison will always be Jango Fett in my book so no real complaints there. So, even though most actors did a great job delivering their lines, the dialogue could be pretty weak and VERY cheesey at times. Some were bad enough to break the immersion and make me look at my girlfriend and laugh.
Even with all of these flaws, I had more fun watching Aquaman than I have in a Suprhero movie and a long long time. CA: Civil War and Infinity War are definantly my favorite superhero movies, but they're not necessarily fun to watch...more engaging and emotional than anything (kind of like Solo being compared to Revenge of the Sith). I was never bored watching Aquaman bc there was always some action taking place.
End Notes: Black Manta was awesome and I can't wait to see him again in the next movie! And when Aquaman came out with his new suit, that scene not only gave me huge goosebumps but ranked up to the top 10 moments in cinematic history for me."

It's a beautiful movie ( I mean literally) the cinamatography is fantastic , beautifully shot background score is good and the action scenes are really well made. james wan as always brings something new to the action scenes interesting camera moves and angles, the only flaw is that the emotional aspect is a hit or miss at times and felt a bit rushed, Early scenes does not give an emotional connection to the love of aquaman s parents and the love between aquaman and meera also seems a bit rushed, but those are the minor flaws.jason mamoa is great as aquaman, overall a decent movie and a real fun time in this festive season"
"MrDHWong","8","1","3","26 December 2018"," Gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time
","Aquaman is the sixth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Jason Momoa in the title role, it proves that DC films are experiencing a resurgence and will likely prove to be healthy competition with Marvel.<br/><br/>One year after the events of Justice League, Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) learns he is heir to the throne of Atlantis, an underwater kingdom populated by sea life and humanoid lifeforms known as the Atlanteans. However, Arthur's place as king is challenged by his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who intends to invade the surface world and reclaim it back for the ocean. Being half-human and half-Atlantean, Arthur must try to stop Orm from succeeding in his genocidal plan and give Atlantis the ruler it deserves.<br/><br/>High spirited and likeable, Aquaman thankfully gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time, similar to how Wonder Woman did in 2017. There is a comfortable balance between comic relief and serious drama, but never so much that it feels like it is ripping off or downright plagiarising its style from Marvel. In terms of plot, the film feels like a hybrid of Thor and Black Panther, and its only major issue is that the story occasionally becomes muddled in its exposition scenes which does affect the pacing at times. Jason Momoa is without a doubt the perfect actor to play the titular hero, as he effectively elevates the character beyond being the laughing stock he has been among comic book fans for many decades. His scenes with Mera (Amber Heard) were great fun to watch and were the source of some of the film's more lighthearted moments. Willem Dafoe was also used well and wasn't merely reduced to being a cameo, and in addition to this, it was quite unusual to see him play a good guy in a comic book film. Be sure to stay back for an important mid-credits bonus scene.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10"
"pravsathi","8","1","3","26 December 2018"," Could be the movie which lifts DC up.
","The movie is a visual spactale. It is definitely better than the other DC movies barring Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa is very good and lives up to the stature of being the blunt instrument. The movie takes some time to build and then hurriedly sprints towards the end. The action sequences are amazing and James Wan did a good job in the director's chair. Overall it doesn't suck and it is a fun movie to watch."

","I was always a DCEU fan and actually enjoyed Batman V Superman, and Justice League, so I had high expectations for Aquaman. After watching it, I can say I was fully entertained. DC movies were always great on spectacle, and this was no exception. In even managed to create a new world that could be enough to make Aquaman a franchise in its own right. With James Wan at the helm, this movie does not feel like a DC movie. It is not moody, nor mopey and had lots of fun. The sea creatures were great, and the underwater world was breathtaking. Jason Momoa proved he could carry a movie. Despite his hulking presence, and badass look, Momoa's Aquaman is a quite a character. He is charming, witty, and persevering. But he is not broody like Batman or Superman, nor is he a doe-eyed idealist as Wonder Woman during WWI. He is a relatable character who just happens to have superpowers. Besides Momoa, Patrick Wilson was excellent as a villain. Unlike previous DC villains, he is interesting, and proves a worthy nemesis to Momoa's Aquaman. Though his performance is not as compelling as Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, we can still see understand his character's motive. As for other supporting casts, Dolph Lundgren stole the show. He chews every scenery he is in. That is not to say Amber Heard, and Willem Defoe were terrible, but I just enjoyed Lundgren more. In the end, Aquaman is a superhero movie done right, and does not aim to be Oscar material. A great piece of fun entertainment!"

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","23 December 2018"," Spectacular
","I usually don't compare films but with Aquaman, comparison with both Wonder Woman and Thor yields interesting thoughts. First, however, is a recap of the plotline.<br/><br/>The story of our half-human, half-Atlantean protagonist is introduced through first-person VO, starting with the story of his parents, and bookended in the same way for full closure. The tale is familiar. Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), to-be queen of one of the seven kingdoms of Atlantis, fell in love with lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) and gave birth to Arthur (Jason Momoa, when grown up). Domesticity bliss, alas, was short-lived as she was soon found and commanded to return to consummate the marriage. To save the life of her husband and son, she did, and bore the king a son Orm (Patrick Wilson, when grown up). Atlanna, the audience is made to understand, was put to death after fulfilling her mission of bringing an heir to the kingdom. In the meantime, good guy the councilor Vulko (Willem Dafoe), with first loyalty to the queen, secretly mentored Arthur, developing everything he needed to be an Atlantis royalty.<br/><br/>Brought up on land (but with the other half of his identity secretly nurtured by Vulko), Arthur has a personality that is nowhere near to royalty. As ""Aquaman"", he occasionally performs some heroic deeds such as rescuing the crew of a pirated Soviet submarine. But on the whole, he is just an average fun-loving muscular guy, until a dazzling redhead appears in his life. She is Mera (Amber Heard), a princess in one of the Atlantis kingdoms. A crisis is brewing underwater as the various monarchs and leaders vie for control of all the kingdoms, as a prelude to taking on the world on the land surface. It seems that Arthur, similar to his namesake in Camelot, is the one who is truly capable of this supreme leadership, for peace, not war. There is even an Excalibur-look-alike scene towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Arthur, needless to say, wants nothing to do with this nonsense. But when circumstances make him owe Mera for saving his father's life, he has to humor her. Then, meeting Vulko upon arriving at Atlantis, he begins to see the situation more clearly. Following tradition, he challenges his younger half-brother, now King Orm, and losses. Wielding their father's (the deceased king) trident, Orm break's Arthur's trident inherited from their mother Atlanna. Mera saves Arthur's life, but at a cost of losing everything herself, because she is in fact betrothed to Orm.<br/><br/>The next sequence is also very familiar: hero and heroine on a quest in search of the legendary Trident that only a true king can lay claim on. The parallel trajectory is also familiar - consistent bickering blossoms into romance. The rest is paint by number, with a twist that you will not see coming only if you have watch less than five movies your entire life.<br/><br/>There is a sub-plot. In the aforementioned rescue mission, Aquaman leaves a father-and-son pair of pirates to die in a sinking submarine. The father's self-sacrifice saves the son, who becomes ""Black Manta"" (Yahya Abdul-mateen II), the secondary villain in this movie. He is vanquished by Aquaman midway through the movie but survives and appears again in the post-credit teaser, likely to become one of the villains, maybe even the lead villain, in the sequel.<br/><br/>Now, to the comparisons. While Atlantis is underwater and the islands of Themyscira are not, both Aquaman and Wonder Woman have a heritage of an ""alien"" world that is, however, still on Earth. The marked difference is that while Aquaman is brought up on ""our"" world, Wonder Woman is not. Cultural difference, whether in real world or in fantasies, has always been good fodder for levity in movies. In Wonder Woman's case, she is herself the direct object, as in her shopping scenes when she first set foot on London. With Aquaman, this role of being the subject of levity is given to Mera, while he has the role of an Earthman enlightening her. Good examples are aplenty, such as using ""6 o'clock"" to indicate direction, a concept which is entirely alien to Mera. Another example is the reference to Pinocchio when they hide in the belly of a whale. The significance only comes to light to Mera in a later scene when she stumbles across a copy the children's novel.<br/><br/>With Thor, the comparison is obviously sibling rivalry but with marked differences. Thor is true blue royalty while Loki is not even blood sibling. Aquaman, on the other hand, is only half Atlantis. Purely from a logical angle, Orm has a more legitimate claim. Another interesting thing is that the persona of the two younger brothers are widely different. Loki is the God of Mischief and that says it all. Orm, on the other hand, is not only all seriousness, but also projects a classic and composed image. Neither, of course, is the stereotype villain we usually encounter in this genre.<br/><br/>""Aquaman"" is arguably the most spectacular rendition of a superhero story on screen. The set pieces take full advantage of unique underwater environ. But then, one scene may make you for a second think that you are watching planet Tatooine (Star Wars) or the trailer of ""Dune"" (filming, as a matter of fact, wouldn't be started until 2019). The best set piece, however, is on land, in a picturesque Sicilian seaside village: marriage of best action and best scenery.<br/><br/>Momoa, with cool posing and jaw-dropping moves, is a credit to the comic character he is recreating (""recreating"" because the original DC Aquaman in the comic book looks very different). Heard complements him well. Kidman elevates the otherwise run-of-the-mill scenes to fitting emotional levels. Defoe handles with professional ease his ""paycheck role"" (as opposed to his role in ""Florida Project"" last year that was Oscar caliber)."

"charityamankwah","10","1","3","23 December 2018"," The Best Superhero Movie Ever
","I went to support, and watch Jason Momoa. I ended up enjoying a movie. For a big fan of Momoa, I barely noticed him, caught up in the glory and lights of this movie. The emotion caught me, and got me involved, and as a writer for once, it didn't feel like I knew where it was going. After having watched many superhero movies, with basically the same storyline. This one felt fresh, and attention keeping. I loved how they took time to build all the characters, and didn't just give them minuscule reason for fighting. Also that the main antagonists shared moments of grat emotion, being half brothers. I was heavily entertained, and believe Jason Momoa's take on Aquaman, will forever remain, the one to beat, and the one to reach. He did a fantastic job, and I've never seen such perfect acting. He managed the impossible, drew me away from his visage, into a story."

The intro to Manta could have been more compelling, but it fit within the pacing of the movie. For you ladies, you have plent of shirtless scenes with Mr. Aquaman to fantasize about.

"aneley-52954","10","1","3","18 December 2018"," Favorite Super Hero Movie
","I've been waiting for this film ever since it was announced, because I originally like Aquaman and because I was curious about what was expected to be an interesting version of him. And the film didn't let me down.
For context: my favorite modern super hero movies so far were Wonder Woman, Thor -Ragnarok and Black Panther, if that illustrates my tastes.<br/><br/>Visually it's a treat, in every way, the cinematography, the underwater world, the action, the striking beauty of Jason and Amber, this movie is absolute eye candy.
I liked the acting, Manta was on point even if he was a bit underutilized, but I can understand because he'd be well set up for a sequel, and it doesn't get too crammed since you have Orm as the main antagonist, rather than trying to showcase both Manta and Orm and falling short or getting bogged down, Manta becomes an anticipated part of the sequel we're surely getting. Orm also was well played, although I have to disclose bias, I've had a crush on Patrick Wilson for years. That said, I think he did a good job, he had a couple lines that were kinda iffy but he pulls them off, and his scene after the final fight with Arthur is very moving.
Mera does not disappoint, she's an awesome character and she's well serviced by this film, and as a fan of the Arthur/Mera ship, I'm happy she's not sidelined in the plot and action, but also the romantic aspect is not shoved in your face.
Arthur is trapped between wanting to help people and refusing fo be king, he just wants to save he world, that's all. He's understandably reluctant to go for the crown. But his journey, being pressured by dangerous circumstances, and accepting his responsibility, was beautiful to witness.<br/><br/>Plot wise, I was expecting the impending threat of an attack on the surface. the dead father revenge, the brothers showdown, because as much as I avoid trailers, it was kinda hard to miss completely. But I was SHOCKED when the Trench dwellers appeared, I was on the edge of my seat, because I'm a scaredy cat and the trench gives me the creeps.<br/><br/>Is this the exact Arthur from the comics? No. But it's a damn good one, and there's room in my heart for all."
"calderonleo","8","1","3","18 December 2018"," The new hope awakens.

"saptesh786","8","1","3","18 December 2018"," Underwater super hero from DC
","Now-a-days super heros are being popular than real heros. 'Aquaman' is another instalment from the line. This is from DC house and seems to be popular like Marvel Studio's characters. It is a good movie for adventure lovers. Jason Momoa is perfect casting for Aquaman. His towering height (6.4) and muscled body gave a real look to this new under water super hero. Other casting like of Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren is okay. Amber Heard looks slim and a little dull than previous and having dimmer charm. Dolph Lundren is lost in his makeup. I actually did not recognize him for a while. Story is as required by an adventurous plot for comics. However photography is super. Various kingdoms like desert kingdom, Atlantis kingdom and other are amazing. Their sets are fantastic and filling real good. You will definitely enjoy from watching brilliantly portrayed those kingdoms. Though this is comical story for children, it is also watchable for parents also with their kids.<br/><br/>I impressed to see a scene where an octopus is drumming with his all hands! How a unique idea! it surely will take you to notice this highlighted part of the move.<br/><br/>My recommendation is just go and watch, no read any review further. It is full of enjoyment."
"levinsonianj","8","1","3","18 December 2018"," Better than every mcu movie except for iron man and winter soldier
","Before you call me a dceu fanboy you should know that I hate suicide squad and found justice league incredibly disappointing. A dceu fanboy would think that all six dceu movies are masterpieces. That being said I have loved the other dceu movies and I am not a fan of the mcu. I find most of their movies bland, obnoxious, superficial and soulless. On the other hand, aquaman is none of those things. It has heart, a good arc for the main character, its villains have a little more depth than most mcu villains, its vfx/music and cinematography are easily superior to every mcu movie. The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year. Amber Heard and Jason Momoa have great chemistry and the supporting cast are all memorable. The best part about this movie is that while it does have humor, it never cuts into the emotional moments. Aquaman like wonder woman before it is sincere and allows its drama and action scenes to play out without every character cracking jokes every five seconds. Another thing aquaman does well is that it gives its villains plenty of screen time. The movie isn't perfect, its pacing is a little messy and its story is predictable, but it commits to its tone and because of that it works. I think that the anti dceu bias is obvious considering that it has far worse reviews than most mcu movies. The vfx alone would make this a better movie than black panther but the likable characters, good acting,production design, music, directing, and tone make this the second best live action superhero movie of 2018 behind deadpool 2. In a fair world aquaman would receive oscar nominations for vfx, score, production design, sound mixing and sound editing. In reality it will receive none of these things while black panther which had horrible vfx and sound design will receive tons of technical nominations and even a best picture nomination. Oh and my review will receive tons of down votes because mcu fanboys can;t handle the idea of dc even trying to compete"

It's well-shot, perhaps the biggest scope of scenes and locations I've seen in a superhero film lately. It's lively tone and layered action scenes won't leave you bored with its swift pacing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's by no means perfect. The film is your standard superhero narrative with not much changes to the formula other than some ties to adventure genre. It's mood is quirky, and character motivations seem one-dimensional.

"RomulusAurelius","8","1","3","17 December 2018"," A redeeming film after a series of dissapointments from the DCEU.
","Redemption, that's how to describe this film, Aquaman doesn't follow down the dark path that films like Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad did (and failed miserably) and goes on to deliver what films are supposed to be in the first place: Entertainament.<br/><br/>Aquaman has all the ingredients to be not just the best DCEU film in the lot, but to be one of the best Superhero films in the genre.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa plays Aquaman wonderfully, even if the script can get spicy at times with his lines, he dominates the screen and is a joy to watch.
His sidekick, Mera, played by Amber Heard, is a memorable and gracious character to go along with Aquaman, not only does Heard play as the character in such a rich and tasteful manner, making it all look natural, but Mera herself is a well written character in this film.
I can't say much for the villains, they were mostly alright, and did their part in the film, it's also nice to see Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe in a Superhero Flick, being a fan of the original Spider-Man trilogy, it's great to see Willem Dafoe in this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is one of the highlights of Aquaman, shot in beautiful locations including Newfoundland, Canada, Sicily, Morocco and underwater itself, it's usually difficult for films to have underwater sequences and make them entertaining, one of which include James Bond's Thunderball (1965), which dragged the film, but this is Aquaman we're talking about, and he has no problem handling the waters.<br/><br/>The script itself is good, and the cast dominates it, but it can get spicy at times, there can be scenes where they're supposed to be serious, but then Aquaman breaks a curse word or an insulting remark, something that while it might go with half-human personality, it sort of underminds many scenes, it's not enough however to become a serious problem.<br/><br/>The music is not very memorable, while it does its job, none of it seems catchy, at least to myself, it's usually a long road when it comes to making a hell of a theme for a Superhero film, such as John William's Superman theme or Danny Elfman's Spider-Man, the score fits the film, but it's not much to brag about.<br/><br/>The use of CGI blends in well with the film, the only times I noticed obvious CGI was at the beginning with Atlanna, the fight's stunts and such are obvious, but other than that, the CGI ushers in beautiful visuals of underwater action and scenery, which fit in well with the world and plot.<br/><br/>All in all: Aquaman succeeds as a Superhero film, it's a great action adventure flick, and an entry you just can't miss, if the DCEU continues to produce such great films, it will be in good terms with its audience after numerous bad entries."

","For me, Aquaman is a character which I thought was made for a feature release ever since I first heard his story (8 years ago). There was something about him that made me gravitate towards him by being born from two different worlds, but comes to be rejected by both is a brilliant starting point. And his ties to Atlantis and the various stories are intriguing. His film might not have been what I had thought it would be, but it was still excellent regardless of my initial thoughts on what an ""Aquaman"" film should be.<br/><br/>The film does a great job setting up Arthur's worlds and the perils that he faces below and above. Blank Manta was slightly stronger for me, only because this is also his origin film. We see how he comes to hate Aquaman and why he want to make him suffer, and it comes from a natural place, neglecting to save someone. Once that happens in the opening, I was on board and could completely see why this pirate would trade in the possibility of riches, and take the revenge plot instead. Ocean Master is fine, he just comes off a little bit sillier from the whole pollution idea. I know it ties into social and environmental issues at this time, but it just didn't feel the same for me. Nothing against Patrick Wilson, who was great at conveying the unyielding want-to-be ruler.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were just great at their respective characters. Jason was a standout to me in ""Justice League"", so to see him getting his own film was great and well deserved. While I was worried at first casting, he combines is physical presence with his fun loving side to make the character his own. Amber is a big surprise for me, I knew she would be good as Mera, but she exceeded my expectations. Her curiosity and relationship with Arthur was great and whenever she used her powers I kept wondering when her film comes out.<br/><br/>The cinematography and visual effects are out of this world. It reminded me of ""Avatar"", seeing this world brought to life that looks like it was straight off of Pandora. All the credit goes to James Wan for putting together a film which is satisfying to enjoy as well as look at. The only nitpick I can really think off is with the quest for the Trident. While fun and giving us those fun iterations between Arthur and Mera, it does drag and feels like it belongs to a film like ""National Treasure"". I don't know if it was a leftover from a previous script, but it just felt that way to me. (That's from the plane ride to the beginning of the Blank Manta fight)<br/><br/>Overall this film was amazing, good performances, stunning visuals and a mostly great story. For me as a fan of the character, this film was well worth the wait."
"rahulmarketer","10","1","3","17 December 2018"," A mad dope!
","The movie is hell of a ride. To begin, Aquaman may be the best visually appealing Comic book movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is already a big hit and the reasons are:
1. Wan's take on the character/direction.
2. Momoa as Aquaman. Mera(Amber) as well.
3. Visuals better than LOTR and Infinity war. It could win the most coveted oscar award.
4. Set on the premise of Star Wars/LOTR universe; a world/universe in making.<br/><br/>The story is also good. There are a few great actors in the movie; Dafoe and Kidman are awesome. A triology is in the line(they all love number 3:)).<br/><br/>The world wants to see more of so called B list comic characters. That's why WB is working on all the characters but Batman and Superman.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see Aquaman 2 and 3."
"Reelnerd","8","1","3","17 December 2018"," Aquaman Makes Waves in the DCEU
","Reel Nerd Review: Aquaman
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by James Wan
Starring: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison
Being an Amazon prime member I was one of the lucky viewers who had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of the film Aquaman from The Conjuring director James Wan. Aquaman is a jam packed high fantasy adventure that has call backs to films like Indiana Jones, Clash of the Titans, 80's/90's action flicks and the Harryhausen films of old except substitute claymation with CGI.
James Wan had a lot of heavy lifting to do with this film due to the fact that the DCEU or whatever they're calling themselves these days is in pretty dire straits after the box office and critical disaster that was Justice League. In my humble opinion James Wan did exactly what he needed to do in giving the audience an entertaining thrillride of a comic book film that looks and feels different than most comic book movies out there. Wan infused a lot of color and humor and action in his film which is something critics have complained was missing in previous installments in this shared cinematic universe.
You can tell Momoa is having a good time on screen and because of it we as the audience have a great time along with him. Mera (Heard) tracks down Arthur aka Aquaman to help her take down his half brother Orm as he wants to launch a full scale war against the surface world for the atrocities they have committed upon the sea dwelling populace via pollution and war and only Arthur can stop him as he by birthright should be the true King of Atlantis. Think of Orm as an environmental extremist if you will who will at any cost exact his revenge upon the world.
Of course it's not as easy as all that and Arthur must go on a quest to find an object that will help him in his bid to become the new King of Atlantis. Momoa is a force of nature who brings charm, wit and vulnerability to his role as Arthur Curry. Amber Heard is enchanting as Mera the daughter of King Nereus (Lundgren) one of the heads of the seven kingdoms of Atlantis who joins Orm in his bid to take on the surface world.
Let me say how happy I am to see a renaissance in Lundgren's career giving stellar performances in two back to back films this year Creed II and now Aquaman. The whole cast was just stellar form Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry Arthur's dad and Nicole Kidman as his mother Queen Atlanna. It's this love story that helps drive the film forward and I like how they bring everything back full circle by film's end I won't spoil it as officially the film doesn't open until next week and many of you have yet to see it.
Yahya was so awesome as Black Manta and from certain events that take place very early on in the film you can at least partially empathize with why he has such a searing hatred for Arthur and he is hot on the heels of Arthur and Mera as they are out and about on the surface world. The action sequences that many of us saw in the trailers where Manta and his men are chasing down Aquaman and Mera throughout Italy was even more amazing to behold on the big screen.
I attended the Hall H panel for Aquaman at San Diego Comic-Con and the excitement and enthusiasm from the cast about the making of this film was contagious. Wan jam packed this film with iconic Aquaman villains, friends and lore and some may even find the film overstuffed and to a degree it is with varying tones and sub plots and stories but I feel Wan successfully merged everything together for the most part. Some of the character arcs could have used some fine tuning but that's what future films in this potential franchise are for.
I loved the action sequences in the film and the epic battle that takes place in the third act was a spectacle to behold. I think this is the film that the DCEU has been desperately needing that will help solidify this universe as a worthy competitor to the Disney/Marvel universe. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to see this film early. I absolutely loved it and I highly recommend it to all of you reading this blog."
"MarkyLouiG","8","1","3","17 December 2018"," DC is coming back with a vengeance.
","I can't believe that DC took so long to try this kind of writing instead of their usual dark stuff. With that being said this is an enjoyable film, i had fun with it. The best part of it would definitely be Jason Mamoa. He steals the show every single time and he is very charismatic. The rest of the cast should also be praised, they did their roles well. The plot basically follows the story in the comics and I applaud them for not going overboard with the plot. James Wan's direction really impressed me because this could could've gone really really wrong but it played out well. The thing that kinda bugged me was the visuals. It's not necessarily bad; it's just very heavy. Majority of the scenes here rely on CGI and sometimes it doesn't work. They sometimes come across as cartoony. The pacing here is also weird; it's way too fast. It just keeps transferring from one scene to the next without us getting a breather to soak in the scenes. And the characters look like an hour passed even though it supposed to be days.
All in all I thought Aquaman was a great film. It was run and is certainly not boring. It is a film that I don't mind watching again and again. A little too much CGI but still passed to be a good film."
"agustinacoppe","Null","1","3","17 December 2018"," Jason Momoa was the only interesting thing about this movie
","I felt like this movie didn't have much plot in it and the jokes were kinda unfunny. However, Jason Momoa was right there, wet and half-naked during half of the movie, which kept me extremely entertained. Giving this an 8 because of those abs only."

"kevinjloria","9","1","3","16 December 2018"," Damn entertaining movie! (feat. Wet beautiful people)
","Based on a True Story! 🔱 Ok, maybe not, but it is TRULY Visually stunning, obviously, loads of fun, perfectly cast hot wet people ( ok maybe not Willem Dafoe and his Atlantian French Twist! & Mera's hair is more distracting than Black Manta's canonical helmet ). Jason Mamoa is the embodiment of the best spin on this character and entertaining in every scene. Unnecessary to be familiar with DC Universe or to have picked up a comicbook to be (pun intended) ""immersed"" in the story. But director James Wan takes many comic tropes and turns them on end. Well done Aquaman!"
"jbswift9","8","1","3","16 December 2018"," Aquaman done justice! DC on the right path
","This movie has everything you want and need in a blockbuster film. Comedy, Romance, Story, and last but certainly not least Action! Jason Momoa IS the perfect man for the job. He and all the characters worked out so well on the screen and I think that was one of the most important things to make it such an enjoyable film. Black Manta was my 2nd favorite character behind Aquaman in the film..he did such a good job and was a perfect co-villain behind Orm. I think I'm going to watch it again but on IMAX to really get the full effect of the beautiful cinematography. Only thing I would change (and I'm nitpicking right now) is the score..I feel some of the songs didn't fit. But other than that I really enjoyed the film and can't wait for part 2!"

","Aquaman(2018) Review
My Rating -8.3/10<br/><br/>The movie is the far different from its predecessor DCEU movies.It seems that DCEU have learned from their mistakes and understood the taste of the common audience, the movie follows a medium tone which is a heartwarming visual treat.<br/><br/>Aquaman makes a slow progress in the first half where we get to understand Altantis and its people but it is not at all boring due to the beauty of Altantis which is a major highlight in the movie.The second half is the heart of this movie filled with action sequences which have the potential to provide goosebumps especially the classic suit scene and climax fight is one hell of a fight.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa has brought Aquaman to life. His performance as Aquaman cannot be defined in words. William Dafoe And Dolph Lundgren have served their purpose of portraying two strong supporting characters of Atlantis. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard succeds in enhancing the beauty of the movie and proves their might as Atlanna and Mera. Patrick Wilson(King Orm) and Yahya Abdul -Mateen II(Black Manta) provides the seriouness that the movie deserves at some point. They are excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>On the whole the movie is a must watch in 3D for its visual effects and strong acting performances. James Wan have provided us with a visual feast which is filled with action sequences, comedy and Wan also adds his special touch by adding some horror element using the Trench Monsters. The movie has a mid credit scene please don't forget to see it."

"paulijcalderon","7","1","3","16 December 2018"," Giant sea battles, parkour with laser blasts and one ""fish-man"" caught in the middle
","Is Aquaman the savior of DC or merely that fish-boy from the TV? Well, it's not perfect but it's actually better than expected. It seems the character has gotten some justice now with a grand scale movie that's solely about his story. Jason Momoa still goes around with his ""surf"" attitude but he ends up growing by regretting some mistakes and assuming responsibility. However, there are cliches and storytelling tropes which can't be escaped. Luckily it doesn't bring everything down as the action is fun and the visuals are a feast to the eye. It's a movie that will entertain to the max. An element I was happy to see was the usage of mythology (especially Greek mythology in this case). I've always been endlessly fascinated by what legendary mystic stories could be explored in the profoundness of the sea. And that tone was transmitted nicely to the screen. I loved the depth in the cinematography. You'll see the sunlight reach the corals while the characters swim across. It's vibrant, warm and full of life. So the visuals were big standouts. The story was decent yet formulaic. I could have gone with less explaining and skipped of some of the obvious jokes. But most surprisingly it finds moments where clear human purity is brought out. The tale about Arthur's parents, his training with Willem Dafoe's Vulko, even his relationship with Mera doesn't come across as annoying (considering it's super obvious that they're gonna be together). It somehow works on plain simplicity. It's nothing too much, just clear and simple enough that you can see the sincerity there.<br/><br/>It's bloated given how grand James Wan wants to go with the story. You better stay awake for two hours because this thing moves like sharks chasing their pray. The action is always energetic, except for when they decide to throw a character into a wall. The parkour set-piece was a lot of fun. Partly with how well thought out the shots were and where the next part of the sequence would lead to. And this is coming from someone who thought it looked stupid in the trailers. Loved the look of the bad guys. Manta has been one of my favorites and it's amazing to see him adapted properly on the big screen. I wanted his part in the plot to be even more integral. Ocean Master is OK at best. His costume and helmet are great but the guy's a bit of a Shakespearean villain cliche. I will give him credit for at least having a motivation I understood and agreed with. His solution to his problem however... That's where the villain aspect comes to play. I would also have trimmed out some levity that felt pandering. Some of the characters didn't get enough development to make you undertand their place in the story. I was kind of confused as to who Mera was and what she was up to during the first act. But to be fair, that may have been because she looks so otherworldly it drew me away. Anyway, it is a fun movie and a lot more decent than I thought it would be. Just be ready for some stupid bits here and there, or very convenient plot points. But the visual spectacle delivers with some imaginative underwater worlds and creatures. Better than ""Justice League"" which doesn't say too much, but I see this being very enjoyable on repeat viewings."
"arro26","10","1","3","16 December 2018"," A complete movie
","The movie starts off with action scenes which balance crazy camera angles ith on-point physics. It's immersive from the beginning.<br/><br/>The character devolopment is wonderful -- we see Black Mantis devolop as Aquaman does through the movie. The chemistry between Jason Momoa and Amber Heard is endearing.<br/><br/>This is an adventure movie at heart. The feeling of exploration never leaves. The world building is masterful and every place Momoa goes to is elaborately constructed. It's like playing an RPG.<br/><br/>The story builds. Do not expect a movie along the lines of justice league.<br/><br/>10/10."

Pretty strong character development even on a movie where there is little time to develop characters. Yeahh there are few medium rare charectors . But we can forget that all just for the sheer fun the whole movie gives us. Jason Mamoa as Aquaman is my favorite super hero period. What a flawless performance my him , grace and command is just oozing from him on all frames. And MCU has to step up their game on female leads.

But Aquaman...wow! What a great film! The visuals are amazing, the action scenes are mindblowing and Jason Momoa is superb as Aquaman. Sure, the plot is a little thin/predictable, but that doesn't take away the fact that this movie is a bold and very enjoyable step forward for the DCEU.<br/><br/>James Wan did an amazing job in visualizing Atlantis and finally embracing the sillier side of the DC superheroes rather that trying to cover it up with a ton of rain and broodiness.<br/><br/>9/10"

","After 2 Epic Debacles like Thugs & Beasts, I think I was careful enough to choose which movie should be my next & It Has Been Answered.. Wisely, I hope ;)
So, Here comes the Most Anticipated DCEU movie of the year, Aquaman *ta dum dhsss*
Don't worry about the story because you'll be entertained enough to at least not concentrate much on it. Cast has been chosen very carefully. Director James Wan has a Huge fan following by his previous works like The Conjuring, Saw, Insidious & Furious 7. SO, the movie will have no problem gaining first-comers like Yours Truly ;)
Now, if you insist on story, I can say you'll find some pieces of Aquaman from Black Panther, some of them from an Indian movie, came out in 90s, Ajooba. In some scenes, I literally SOL (Said Out Loud) to myself that, Shashi Kapoor has done it first.. :P AJOOBA SHEHZADA :D
Let's talk tech.. The Action sequences are choreographed very well. CGI is also very good, though you can spot studio lighting here & there which is completely forgivable. I'll give you One Solid Reason to forgive all that later ;)
On the Acting front, you'll have issues if you're a Stage Artist, a Method Actor. Because basically these are the movies based on Comic books' characters so Don't expect Meryl Streep here. *You've been warned*
~ Jason Momoa, Khal Drogo :D, yeah you all know Aquaman coz this isn't his first appearance, has performed his part very well. Well, if you've read my Justice League Review, I've hammered him, now it's his turn I guess. KARMA.. :P
~ Now, here's ONE of the Many REASONS you can forgive almost any mistake I've talked (typed, literally) about above :* <3
I mean, seriously.. HOW CAN ONE BE SO BEAUTIFUL that even these words lack to define her gorgeousness.. I'm in Love :) <3
Amber Heard.. You probably have googled her before but I'm telling you, Man, She's Something Else in this particular movie.. Job Well Done, everybody, hair & makeup artists, costume designers etc..
If only Mr.Depp could've understood.. Well, now Elon 'Tesla' Musk is driving her crazy or the other way around.. gossipians go ahead..
~ Patrick Wilson, Wan's favorite.. has done good job.. but can't say any other actor couldn't have done it the same..
~ Willem Dafoe, Our favorite Green Goblin :D He's Clever version of Katappa in this movie.. :D
~ Nicole Kidman, Beautiful <3
On the whole, You should watch this movie.(Period) Fans will definitely watch it but I'm asking the anti-fans :D Yeah, I also have those in Ma Grup of Frendz.. whether Marvel or DC, we'll we'll Watch it..
On that note, May your soul Rest in Peace, Stan Lee.. We'll surely miss your Guest Appearances in MCU movies.. And I'll surely enjoy your cameos in Captain Marvel & Avengers Endgame.. Excelsior..

","As a die hard MCU fan, I must say: YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! And you need to find your local theater that has the best IMAX system to watch this movie.<br/><br/>I watched every single MCU movie within the opening weekend, and I never found such enthusiasm for DC movies, hence why I only watched Aquaman now almost a week later, the last comic book movie that made me feel this good after first time viewing was The Avengers, that was the moment I realized my beloved Marvel characters had finally come to life, Aquaman just gave me the same feelings for DC characters since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>10 years ago I watched Avatar in IMAX 3 times, sure the plotline wasn't anywhere near special, but it was visually groundbreaking, since then I never truly found a movie to be its worthy visual successor, and now, such a movie finally arrived.<br/><br/>The third act of Aquaman is beyond anything I have ever seen, the battle scale makes Infinity War looks like playing house (Yes Im kinda salty about it, Endgame better up its game), I don't know what they did to the sound system, at one point I felt like the theater was about to take off, the ground was shaking like a leaf like I was sitting on top of a Dualshock controller, stuff like this reminds me why I love going to the theater so much: it completely immerses me into another world full of imaginations.<br/><br/>Im going to watch it again the next Tuesday morning when nobody is in the theater, Ill sneak in some homebrew Latte and enjoy the movie all by myself."

","Essentially, 'Aquaman (2018)' is an adaptation of the animated 'Justice League: Throne Of Atlantis (2015)', except it's twice as long, twice as sloppy and, generally, just twice as bad, doing less in its one-hundred and forty-three minutes than that film does in its brisk seventy-two and only making changes for the worse (some of which have to do with the fact that this film, somehow, comes after 'Justice League (2017)'). Funnily enough, it's around the time that Pitbull's new 'Africa' cover starts playing that the film really takes a dive as it's here that its 'macguffin' treasure hunt really sinks in, leading straight into a conventional and old-fashioned feeling 'superhero' story that, even at its best (which is a decent Sicily-based action-scene), floats along providing nothing more than a shallow level of engagement.

","""Aquaman"" can't be a more generic hero movie than it is. It feels like a mish mash of everything. It's a nice fun for popcorn eaters, but not more than that. Jason Momoa, while somewhat likable, got the role only because of his looks and not because of the acting (I can never forgive, never forget, how he raped the character of Conan... Whose idea was to give a Samoan chance to play a barbarian clearly inspired by the people of the north?! And don't even get me started on Khal Drogo...), so he can be eye candy. And I'm OK with that, but let's just please not commend him for acting, at least not yet, until he hasn't acted in something demanding. Movie was fun to watch, but it fails to be anything more than a fun blockbuster you watch and then forget about it, until you see it on TV 10 years later. It's a shame, after memorable Suicide Squad, that we had to come to this. Do I recommend the movie? Yes, for fun, it can serve it's purpose. Is it a masterpiece or worthy to be talked about or even remembered? Most definitely not. 7/10!"

Bummer his mean half-brother Orm is currently ruling. So you guessed it, Arthur must discover his true purpose and ability while securing the throne. This was fun Hollywood action fluff with a decent story and oodles of 'mammouthly' majestic and spectacularly clichÃ© shots that came with such frequency it was a little bit corny and silly while mixing in intended dashes of humor. The water effects and accurate water physics were very well-done and spectacular yet a bit too glossy looking. Whatever, this is a popcorn movie so sit back and relax."

The worst dialogue, every movie trope evar, feeble acting and massive plot holes.<br/><br/>Yeah yeah, the visuals are amazing but the story requires a bigger suspension of disbelief than we should be asked to provide. Everyone wears bulky, metal armor - underwater. Atlantis is near enough the surface to get sunlight AND emits crazy tons of self-generated light & energy but human scientists haven't found them and every big-to-little thing the movie doesn't want to explain is chalked up to being caused by the Atlanteans' secret also-not-explained proprietary energy source... but seriously, most of all, it's the lines.

GAH.<br/><br/>I haven't read the comic books but I trust those guys wrote a more plausible story, right?<br/><br/>Still Jason Momoa grunts, leers, smirks and fights his way through scenes to seem realistic as a superhero and he has some unpolished qualities that work in his favor, even on the bad dialogue. He's obviously been practicing since GOT.<br/><br/>I submit that his level of hotness and his hard work deserve better. For the love of all that is good in the universe, someone please write him a better movie.

","Director James Wan and actor Jason Mamoa have done what many considered impossible. They've taken the comic book character of Aquaman, long considered to be the lamest of comic book heroes, and turned him into one of the coolest action stars on film. Not an easy task and yet together they make it appear easy.<br/><br/>The film opens in the past when a wounded Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washes ashore near a lighthouse in Maine in 1985. Thomas Curry (Temuera Morrison), the lighthouse keeper, finds her and takes her to his home, nursing her back to health. The pair fall in love and soon have a child together they name Arthur. But the forces of Atlantis, searching for Atlanna, have found her and come to take her back failing to do so when she battles them off. Realizing the only way to keep Arthur safe is to return she does so.<br/><br/>Years later a group of tech pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) along with his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) attempt to steal a Russian sub killing those on board they encounter. But their plans are foiled when the now grown Arthur (Mamoa) lifts the sub to the surface, boards it and takes out the pirates. When a hand to hand battle finds David fall Arthur is shot by Jesse only to rise again. As he attempts to leave, Jesse shoots at him dislodging a missile that pins him. Unable to lift the missile David pleads for help and Arthur refuses leaving them behind. David is forced to leave his father behind to die and swears revenge.<br/><br/>Once more time passes and now we move on to the undersea world of Atlantis where King Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to unite the undersea kingdoms to attack the surface world in retaliation for the constant damage they do to the seas. By his side is advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Defoe) who has secretly been training Arthur at the request of the now dead queen. Before Orm can unite the various underwater tribes Mera (Amber Heard), the daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) king of one of these tribes, seeks Arthur for his help in stopping Orm.<br/><br/>Arthur refuses saying he wants nothing to do with the undersea kingdom. Mera warns him that this won't stop Orm from attacking the surface world. As Arthur drives his father home a tidal wave hits the shore and only the assistance of Mera can help him save him. This is the first launch of Orm's attack and causes Arthur to reconsider.<br/><br/>Traveling to Atlantis he learns about a long lost trident that only someone worthy is supposed to be able to wield. He just needs to find it. Before he and Mera can set about their quest they are found by Orm's men and a face-off between the two step-brothers must take place. All of this and we're not even half way through the movie! But it sets in motion the search for the trident, Arthur's change from super-powered mortal to potential ruler of the sea and the possible salvation of Atlantis and the world. Not bad for a first solo outing for the character.<br/><br/>So what makes it exceptional? I'm slowly becoming a movie goer who is tired of the overuse of special effects in films. But at the same time I'm aware that movies about superheroes lend themselves to special effects just to present them properly. And this film does exactly that, using them to surround the action and not take over. The undersea world of Atlantis is a view to behold, a combination of light and texture fueled by color that delights the eyes. Wan's experience with effects in previous films lends itself well on that count. The entire team behind the film has done an amazing job.<br/><br/>But if the character comes off too corny or too serious the film would fall flat as well. Mamoa does a fantastic job here combining the right amount of humor with the muscle bound super heroics needed to bring the character to life. He does so with ease making the character not only believable but actually cool in the process. He even makes the much mocked orange and green outfit associated with Aquaman look great.<br/><br/>DC films haven't fared as well as the Marvel films in the past and the main reason I've always felt was their compulsion to portray their comic universe as dark and gritty. Even the bright colored costume of Superman somehow turned dark. With WONDER WOMAN and now this film they're taking a new direction and the box office has shown it's working. Hopefully they'll continue down this path. AQUAMAN is an adventure, a love story, a comic book hero tale and a movie that doesn't overdo the message about pollution so much that it damages the rest of the film. Kids will love the character, moms will drool over Mamoa and dads will enjoy the action. It's a movie that the entire family can and should enjoy more than once. I know it will take a place on my shelf."
"Ed-Shullivan","7","1","4","2 April 2019"," Is it a good movie? Yes it is...... Is it a great movie? No, far from it.
","Mrs. Shullivan and I spent our Sunday afternoon waiting to relax in front of our TV while watching Aquaman and when I plopped the disc in and started to get involved with the characters we were both quite impressed. Nicole Kidman's performance as Queen Atlanna who falls in love with the lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) was a great start. The birth of their son Arthur and his eventual maturity into our land and sea hero Aquaman (Jason Momoa) was very entertaining as well.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe who plays Vulko, as both the principle advisor and conscience of the self-annointed King Orm (PatrickWilson) as well as the battle weary instructor to King Orm's half brother Aquaman is also a key role in the storyline.<br/><br/>My interest started waning when we were introduced to the cartoonish raven haired sea queen Mera (Amber Heard) who although she was promised to wed King Orm, is obviously smitten by Aquaman and his constant grunting. It is about at this juncture when Mera and Aquaman are teamed up with Vulko in an effort to stop King Orm from proceeding with his diabolical plan to join all the sea kings under his leadership against the earth's surface humans to wipe us off the face of the world when we realize a battle is brewing. Up until this juncture the use of CGI was utilized sparingly and with good taste. As the two half brothers King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa) are pitted against each other both feeling the presence of their missing mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the film takes a sharp turn to the left and the writer/producer/director's take the cheap way out and rely mainly on CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) to complete their epic story line. So much of the same crash and burn CGI as in many other prior Marvel films it is quite frankly a bore.<br/><br/>As the last ten (10) minutes of the film ending kind of redeems the preceding 45 minutes of far too much CGI, if a sequel is to be made Jasom Momoa as Aquaman, Patrick Wilson as King Orm and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna are worthy of a repeat, but I strongly urge the producers to forget about Mera (Amber Heard) and replace her with a more energized and realistic female lead that can act (boy was she baaaaad).<br/><br/>I have assessed the overall film with a decent 7 out of 10 rating. The first half is exciting - the second half is mostly CGI and a bit of a let down, not like in the ocean but similar to a stinky toilet flushing."

Basic plot, basic characters. The only thing interesting is the amount of computer work they put into this. I can't see why people really enjoyed this, other than the fact the culture (mind you who're fighting for the METOO movement) are salivating over Jason Mamoa, who really couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Anyone know who the grunter in film is? Well he's the perfect example. The star whose built, so you take their shirts off and make grunts. I think the message behind the film should have been more prominent. Keep our oceans clean folks, it's another world in it's self. One last thing, why was Harry Osborne even in this movie? None the less, actually a core actor. The guy has the opportunity to do anything he wants now, from ANTICHRIST to AQUAMAN, making great career choices. If Warner's had him under a magical spell, why would they choose this movie? Make him the villian of SUICIDE SQUIRTS 2 and replace Jarred Letgo."

","After a cameo in Zack Snyder's 2016 car crash Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and a team-up appearance in 2017's equally disastrous Justice League, the time feels right for one of comic-book lore's goofiest superheroes, Aquaman, to receive his own standalone origin story. After all, Jason Momoa's hulking, tattooed fish-whisperer was one of the surprising standouts of DC's flop team-up event, and with the campy orange-and-green costume replaced by a long-hared and shirtless Kiwi Adonis, the character can now be played straight-faced. Wonder Woman proved that DC could produce quality with the right director pulling the strings, and they pulled off a coup with James Wan, a filmmaker whose talents I have long admired despite many of his films missing the mark for me. So it pains me to say that Aquaman is yet another tonally uneven and bloated effort from Warner Bros. that never quite knows if it wants to make you laugh or feel, with a marathon running time which, by the time is gets round to its umpteenth climax, is about as welcome as a fart in a wetsuit.<br/><br/>In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) comes across a beautiful woman washed up on the shores of Maine. The woman is Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), a princess from the underwater nation of Atlantis who has escaped an arranged marriage and a gang of Atalantian stormtroopers. Tom takes her in and the two naturally fall in love, resulting in the birth of the half-Atlantian, half-human Arthur. When her enemies come calling, Atlanna must return to the ocean, leaving Tom to bring up young Arthur on his own. The baby grows up to be the beer-swilling gym-devotee we saw in Justice League, but there is trouble a-brewin' down in the depths. Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) wants to unite the kingdoms of Atlantis and wage war on the surface, who have been polluting their home for decades. But Orm knows that he will never be accepted as the true leader while Arthur, who has no desire to take the throne, is still alive. Mera (Amber Heard), the daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), comes to warn Arthur, but they don't stand a chance against the might of Atlantis without the Trident of Atlan, a magical weapon buried somewhere in the Sahara desert.<br/><br/>Aquaman certainly isn't short of ideas; the problem is that Wan doesn't quite know how to cram them all in. We are taken across continents on land and to multiple kingdoms under the water. With a desire to capture the adventurous magic of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones, the film actually trips over its own ambition, squeezing in side characters such as Atlantean Mr. Miyagi Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the fearsome pirate Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), as well as a variety of underwater races we are expected to remember and littering the story with clunky CGI smackdowns. Wan crafts a colourful, vivid world, full of giant sea-horses and advanced technology, but it shares more in common with the weightless. computer-generated locations of The Phantom Menace than the tangible flamboyance of Black Panther's Wakanda. Yet all of this could be considered a mere niggle had the leads been up to the task, but Momoa and Heard have all the chemistry of two strangers making awkward small-talk in a lift. Momoa is an impressive specimen and possesses the charisma to bring this character to life (see Justice League), but here he is denied a moment to have that quiet moment of reflection or to reveal the flaws to his character that would help make him interesting. A wheezing, confused and sickly bore.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"toolboxcomplete2020","9","1","4","28 February 2019"," Aquaman 2019 - Half Breed Abomination ... and King
","Today I will be talking about the movie Aquaman (2019)and give you my impressions about it. How Arthur Curry (Aquaman) goes on a mission to find the Trident from the first Atlantean King, Atlan; how he falls in love with Mera (Amber Heard); how he faces both Black Manta and his half-brother, Orm Marius, the Ocean Master.<br/><br/>Before watching it, I didn't have a good impression about the movie judging by the Justice Leagues' movie that I didn't like and also because they've chosen Jason Momoa to be Aquaman. I was like ""Drogo will be Aquaman? That will never work!"". Every time an actor is cast to interpret a character that he doesn't resemble, I get bad vibes. At least in my mind, he wasn't a good choice. The movie proved me wrong.<br/><br/>I still can't get over the fact that they chose to change Aquaman's personality dramatically. I think I have to grow used to it. Aquaman in the comic books is a very formal, serious, knowledgeable character and that's the exact opposite of how the character is portrayed in the movie. In the big screen, the character is immature, dumb, show-off.<br/><br/>The characters felt like real people with real motivations. I didn't feel forced to swallow anything in it regarding they being who they were. Both heroes and villains were really well put together. The two main antagonists have in common the hate they feel towards Arthur. Orm Marius, the Ocean Master, Aquaman's brother who sees him as an inferior half breed and David Kane (later Black Manta) who blames Arthur for his father's death.<br/><br/>The female heroine in this film, Mera, has all the features female characters nowadays showcase in movies. They know everything, they are extremely strong and super powerful, they have an answer for every situation. We don't get to see flashbacks of her training or anything about her growing up. This narrative, dumb, impulsive male character plus know-it-all female character is getting really old. It's the biggest cliché in the 21st century.<br/><br/>The last scene will leave you without breath. The action sequence is just too eye candy and hypnotizing. The movie was a whole lot of fun and beautiful experience. The ticket to watch it was a good investment. I believe the movie is a complete package with all the elements you might like in a movie such as romance that seems real, the characters really look like they love one another, both couples Mera and Aquaman and Arthur's parents. The fight scenes were flawless, visual effects are amazing, everything looks so exotic and attractive. The villains were also great. The whole plot regarding Aquaman's and Ocean Master's mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), was really moving.<br/><br/>I would like also to point out the relationship between Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Arthur. He taught young Aquaman martial arts (including how to handle the Trident he was supposed to go after to claim his throne one day) and all the history of the Atlantean people.<br/><br/>Hopefully, we can see Aquaman in a new Justice League movie, this time with a better script and I also have my fingers crossed so they cast somebody to be the Green Lantern so we finally have a real Justice League movie, because in my humble opinion, without Green Lantern the League is not the League. It feels more like 6 characters joined together but not the real JLA.<br/><br/>The movie does a fantastic job both giving new life to the character's legacy and being respectful to the original source material. Do not miss the chance and go watch it if you haven't yet. I didn't feel the time passing when I was watching it."

The Atlantians enslave creatures of the beloved realm and use them for war. The carnage is ridiculous. This is like Thor without plot, humor. The romance is predictable and contrived, but was the most interesting part. When the romance is the most interesting to me, you know it is bad. GACK!!! DC GACK!!!!"

","Aquaman sucked. So much I couldn't get passed half the movie.<br/><br/>Aquaman himself is a cool character. At time, I felt the movie did not do justice to the actor, like it set itself up to fail. It also did not give him much airtime, and set him up with silly little one liners. Some of the action was very good, and I enjoyed watching Nicole Kidman kicking a**.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching it. It had potential to be one of my favorite superhero movies. I am excited to see the main actor in future movies, as he definitely has potential to be something.<br/><br/>3 stars"

","I've already dogged the entire DC Universe multiple times & now I'm going to do it again. I will admit I was hopeful this film might be fun, but then I saw the trailer.... & then I saw the later / longer extended trailer... & one thing I can confirm, if you've seen the last extended trailer, you've seen the film. Jason Mimosa's snarky take and one liners were not born for this character, Amber Heard still can't act & throwing Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson & Willem Defoe into this heap of garbage is frankly disrespectful to their skill set. I'm honestly at a complete loss of how to save DC? I will note I am huge Wonder Woman / DC fan & had great hopes this universe could be salvaged somehow, but honestly, I don't think it's possible anymore. I'll hold out that WW1984 & Joaquin's Joker will be of interest, but 1 Billion dollars does make a turd shine, no matter how much elbow grease you put into it."

","I am watching Aquaman for the second time just because my brother begged me to watch it. He hoped that the movie would grow on me. But I still maintain my opinion in this. Save your money and ditch this movie. Weak storyline and mediocre acting. The only reason this movie has a 2 is because of the cinenatography and the sets. Anything other than that is a big mess."
"waydbarton","1","1","4","29 January 2019"," Absolute Generic Garbage
","Visually impressive and non-stop action, unfortunately this action is generic ""bad guys miss every shot and good guys just happen to survive everything"".
Storyline is complete generic trash, there's a couple of okay scenes (bar scene with the dad was wholesome, dive into the trench is awesome, giant cthulu crab thing was cool), Black Manta could have been cut from the storyline and the movie would have been better off for it.<br/><br/>I am convinced that the high scoring reviews for this film were from film staff as there is a MASSIVE amount of 10/10s posted weeks before the films release, which has skewed this films rating significantly.<br/><br/>Wait for DVD release, don't waste your $ seeing at the cinemas."

","Really nice action movie. Of course it wasn't amazing avengers was better. There are some boring scenes where people are talking too much and when action is starting the scene is overcrowded and it's very hard to fallow the plot. Sum up very nice DC movie. Worth to watch. 8/10."
"Wililjam","7","1","4","27 January 2019"," Pretty good...
","Aquaman is a much light-hearted DCEU movie than we've previously seen, more so than Wonder Woman. It has its pros and cons of course. Pros would be that you weren't taking the movie seriously, and cons would be that the comedy just fell flat at times.<br/><br/>The CGI looks pretty good, I absolutely love the colors they used, but parts of the story was actually pretty horrible. Manta is one of the most stupid characters in this movie, and his story was awful, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Manta and his father murdered innocent people on a submarine, Aquaman saves the remaining innocent people, Manta's father is trapped, Manta begs Aquaman to save his father who, mind you, just killed a bunch of people. When Aquaman doesn't save his father, Manta has the audacity to be upset. Really? Piss off.<br/><br/>Another small issue I had with the movie was the kissing scene between Aquaman and Mera. While half of everyone you're there to save is dying in the background, you're busy smacking those lips for half an eternity. There's probably time to kiss AFTER the whole ordeal is over.<br/><br/>Yet another small issue I had was some songs that were extremely misplaced, I swear I heard Pitbull somewhere, and that's never a good thing.<br/><br/>That being said, I really enjoyed the movie."

","This may well be the worst superhero film I've fully sat through ( BvS and Green Lantern didn't finish) total cringefest. Everything about this film was done so poorly it's honestly a joke. The script might have been written by a 7 year old, the plot was so thin and unbelievably predictable. The majority of the acting was unbearable even my guy Momoa.<br/><br/>It blew me away just how unoriginal and generic this movie is and sincerely implore you to save your money. The villain ""ocean master"" is the MOST CRINGE AND ONE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER I've ever seen. That goes for all of them as this movie has zero character development, other than the cliché maturation of the protagonist. The CGI and visuals are extremely overdone, it might have been decent if they didn't go so overboard with making every suit and city so over the top. And what is with the totally unrealistic, terribly acted news segments in every superhero film?<br/><br/>A number of things don't make sense but work out anyway because movie logic. They didn't even try to put any effort into the romantic arc other than have the two spend some time together."

","Cuz im not a teen anymore and probably have seen to many movies; this movie is,
king arthur pulling the sword from the stone. and his knights of the round table.
lots of lord of the rings stuff, giant stone statues, giant monsters of various sizes including a kracken, etc,
starwars stuff, flying ships through lots of tight spaces, even if underwater. a space battle with lots of dogfighting fighter ships and battle ships, all underwater.
if they can swim so fast, why do they need ships, or even the boat?
a bit of harry potter with the hidden world of the undersea people and even some moana stolen plot lines of the bottom of the ocean air bubble and its creatures.<br/><br/>when are they going to have an actual hero that sought out and wants to be a hero? and not someone who is resisting and has to be trained while everyone else who is completely trained and educated sit around waiting and dying.<br/><br/>how many die in the battle only to have the two leaders have mommy make them behave themselves and shake hands to be friends again? i thought was just as story killing as both of them have a mom named martha, even if she was mom to both.
rules of physics kept changing. sometimes the tridents could go through metal without any problems, other times it didnt even scratch, the same metal. can jump out of an airplane a thousand feet up and not get hurt, falls a few feet and gets hurt.
girl beats the crap of out the guards without any problem, then runs like hell from another guard just like the others.
in the beginning the sub, stolen by our bad guy, to shoot at who? the guy who he already has a deal with to start a war so that the shooting sub will make him want to start a war?????????????????
like i said, this movie is great for younger teens. logic is out the window so many times but its a lot of fun to watch if you ignore that. if you can ignore that. i couldnt. if this was a one off never seen before, first of its kind, i would have blasted it, more than i already did :) as a well informed adult with to many movies seen, i give this a 5.5 out of ten. 9 out of ten for everything visual, sfx, acting, dialogue etc. minus 4 points for the plot holes. and that is being generous.
it wasnt at all the aquaman i saw on tv cartoons as a kid, nor in comic books. i missed how much he relied on the animals of the seas for help and him, not his girlfriend, using waterballs as a weapon. and there was no hint, not in the late 60's and early 70's when i watched and read about this character, of an entire underwater kingdom. one that could easily outnumber the surface world. it is 3 times its size and the tech they got? we wouldnt stand a chance. but, like harry potter, they give the right of way to a bunch of ignorant morons like us. i doubt it. they would rule our asses off and probably better at it too."

","Honestly, this movie was very exciting. I loved the action sequences, the visual compositions and the cinematography.
It's worst part was that the story was very, very similar to How to train your dragon. That's not too bad though because it was noticeable to me only after the ending. It could've been unintentional too.
Another letdown was the unrealistic CGI. Even though the visuals were stunning, at some points, the CGI cancels it out.
If I were to nitpick, I'd say the villains' (the ones who attack the surface and always need some supply of water) costumes looked cheap and the music sometimes didn't match.
But overall, as I said before, it was very exciting. I was very engaged with the individual events in this film.

"Alexander_Blanchett","6","1","4","30 December 2018"," Another DC Disappointment
","Well it is not a castrophy or anything but it is the one DC film I had the highest expectations for because I really like the titular character. The result was a corny, and even for fantasy standards unrealistic (yes.. I am talking fantasy realism here) CGI overdose.
Okay, what I liked: Jason Momoa who has a great sense for self irony and comedic timing. Casting him in this role is one of the most creative and inspired decisions and it pays off. He is truly great and part of the reason why Aquman is one of my absolute favorites of the DC cinematic universe. But not even he could save the often awful dialogue this terrible screenplay offers. Another thing I really liked were many of the actions scenes were very well put in scene (save for all the slow motion moments). Also the first half of the film really promised a great fantasy tale with its own mythology. I gave up on that thought in the middle part when many things, motivations and actions just became ridiculous ( and yes.. again for fantasy standards). The ending was an overblown CGI fest (with some really nice visuals ... not the effects, those were mediocre, but the imagary was nice). I really liked the score and loved the soundtrack decisions which were top notch.
About the other actors. Amber Heard was better than I expected but I could imagine many other actresses who probably had given her role the bite it deserves and was intended for. Nicole Kidman was fine but she obviously did it for the fun (yes she gets to kick some asses which was delightful) and of course the paycheck. But having her here gave the film something majestic. Willem Dafoe was very boring - or bored. I always felt he was not really feeling good about being into that CGI mess. His facial expressions made you believe that he is constantly thinking of doing awful things to his agent. Dolph Lundgren was fun and Patrick Wilson servable as a villain. Oh and that gets me to another thing: Black Manta is probably the most useless villain in any comic adaptation ( except maybe Paul Giamatti in the second Spider Man of the first Spider Man reboot).
It was fun (yet overlong) as long as it lasted but caused many head shakes from me.. and not in a good way."

","On the verge of a global conflict between the humans living on the surface and the ones from the bottom of the ocean, a not so ordinary man who's been avoiding his roots must change his perspective and try to avoid the unnecessary conflict.<br/><br/>It's a superhero movie which focuses on the Aquaman character which possesses incredible strength and is able to speak to animals underwater. Featuring a complex story with many twists, more or less predictable, it manages to keep interest throughout its entire length. It's full of action, drama and even romance to make everyone happy. Its characters, well described and put into play, are credible and enjoyable, thus being easy for the viewers to empathize with them. The actors who play them are also very well picked, fitting perfectly within the required characteristics. My only complaint regarding the story and the main fact which made me lower its rating was that it follows some stereotypes which are quite hard to ignore. Take for example an event which happens in the beginning of the movie (the one at the end of the scene with the sinking submarine) which afterwards brings a new big threat to the protagonist just because of his ""decision"". I'm trying to avoid any spoilers here so I assume you've seen this movie in order to understand my complaint.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals, the movie looks astonishing. From the underwater landscapes to the intense action parts, you can clearly see that a lot of work has been put into this department, thus the end result is simply impressive. Its great soundtrack also contributes to the unique atmosphere, being there when needed while providing a big plus with every ""appearance"". I find it very hard to criticize these two aspects regarding the film.<br/><br/>It's a movie which I personally like very much. This type of a ""one man army"" simply leaves me breathless only when thinking about it, let alone seeing it in such amazing details. I liked the story, I enjoyed the characters and I definitely liked the actors. I was also impressed by the visuals and the music it had. I small letdown in terms of story made me lower its rating a bit but overall, it's a movie which deserves to be seen and enjoyed by comic fans and non-fans alike."

"nirome","8","1","4","27 December 2018"," Exciting and visually stunning rollercoaster
","Many things have been said about this movie. That it's generic, formulaic, predictable, but most critics neglect to mention what an entertaining and visually stunning spectacle this is. Granted it's got some cliche dialogue and some of the humor falls flat. Jason Momoa is a cool guy and very charismatic and despite his obvious departure from the comic book look, short blond hair and blue eyes, he's got the physical attributes to sell the part. Amber Heard is also a very interesting addition and she's got some of the coolest underwater superpowers from any of the characters in the movie and along with Michael Shannon's General Zod, we get one of the strongest villains in the new DCEU, Patrick Wilson's King Orm. Strong cast, very good CGI, but what really takes the cake here is the production and costume design. The level of detail and the obvious amount of work that was put into recreating every last detail of the underwater kingdoms, specially Atlantis, is breathtaking. 3D viewing of this movie is mandatory. If ever there was a movie for which this format was created, this is it. In short, a very entertaining and amazing looking film."
"jamesrupert2014","7","1","4","27 December 2018"," More of the same from DC
","The origin story of the 'Aquatic Ace' (Jason Momoa) folds into a somewhat incoherent tale of the titular submarine superhero saving us surface dwellers from extirpation by his villainous half-brother and self-proclaimed 'Ocean Master' Orm (Patrick Wilson) while simultaneously dealing with super-villain ""Black Manta"" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; who looks more like a fruitfly than his namesake batoid fish). Accompanying him is bottle-ginger Mera (Amber Heard), a warrior-princess with the ability to manipulate water in whatever way the plot requires. Needless to say, the two Atlanteans 'meet cute' and then follow the standard relationship trajectory from swapping insults to swapping spit. While agreeable eye-candy in her fishy catsuit, I found the 'Mera' character to be the worst part of the film and the quippy, trite relationship with Aquaman to be more irritating than endearing. Momoa is fine in a not particularly challenging role (the standard-issue, wisecracking, gruff, heroic demigod) as is the rest of the cast (William Dafoe as trusted mentor Nuidis Vulko is given a little more to work with than the rest of the 2D tropes). After a reasonably good first act, the film begins to stretch even the most generous suspension of disbelief when Aquaman and Mera jump out of a plane and hit the ground with no more than a grunt and a couple of quips. There are lots of heroic poses, three point power landings, overly choreographed and unconvincing fight scenes, all set to a pretentious soundtrack and cumulating in the expected climatic showdown between a bunch of characters that we haven't been given enough time (or reason) to care about. The film is spectacular to look at and the 3D cinematography in the version I watched was reasonably effective. I probably would have rated the film a point higher if I had watched it without sound but a point lower if I thought about it more. I am surprised at the scarcity of points in the 'goofs' section, considering the extreme cartoon physics of most of the 'underwater' scenes."
"Mattenhof","10","1","4","27 December 2018"," This is how you make a superhero movie
","I hope producers and directors will follow the people behind Aquaman because it's one of the very few superhero movies that's really well made.<br/><br/>This is not the case of many superhero movies where the writers, directors and producers want to save the best for the sequel. There won't be a SEQUEL if the first one is not good.<br/><br/>Every movie should be treated like it's the only movie and the people behind the film should not be lazy nor should they just think of themselves on how they could make a name on putting some senseless stuff into a movie to call it their own.<br/><br/>It's not your movie, people are paying you, the movies belong to the people. We are not here to help you build a name, that would automatically come when you think about the people who are going to watch just like this movie.<br/><br/>There has been high praise for director James Wan and rightfully so.

That's not a standard we're still trying to set. Besides, No matter how good your effects are, they can't make up for rushed and unrelatable character development, bad dialouge, forced humor (which was painfully obvious), and an overbearing/confusing storyline. So much was happening and there were so many strange inconsistencies. What was with the underwater lightning portal that took them to the center of the earth where there were dinosaurs? Overall I left the theater feeling like I had been cheated out of two and a half hours of my life and 20 bucks. If you can ignore the core parts of a movie that gives it substance and meaning than yeah, it was an action packed film with over the top special effects.

"asifahsankhan","8","1","4","21 December 2018"," Perhaps the Coolest DC superhero movie ever made!
","One of the most compelling aspects of Aquaman is the underwater superhero himself. While his initial casting was rather controversial, Jason Momoa absolutely nailed the role of Arthur Curry. Right off the bat, Momoa sold his performance to audiences as both a badass and charismatic character that everyone could root for. He had the perfect balance of snark that made Iron Man such an entertaining character and fervor that has made Batman such a big-screen spectacle. Even with these qualities, the future King of Atlantis was still a flawed protagonist. He wasn't a perfect character, which really only made him more compelling as the story went on.<br/><br/>While the actual plot of the movie may have seemed incredibly familiar, being another one of the brothers fighting for the throne stories like Thor, Black Panther and The Lion King, it still did a decent job at making it stand out from the competition. While there were certainly familiar aspects that were similar to those other movies, like the duelling scenes in Black Panther, Aquaman still kept some originality in the matter in order to keep things unpredictable. Additionally, the movie did a great job of avoiding cop-out deaths in order to trigger emotional reactions from the audience, with all of the emotion in the movie developing from the story itself rather than from these cheap tricks that many superhero movies have ridden on recently.<br/><br/>The absolute best feature of Aquaman, however, had to be its visuals. Whether the scenes took place underwater in Atlantis or in a city in Italy, nearly every shot of James Wan's was absolutely breathtaking. While previous DC movies like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice had clever framing, the shots didn't really stand out like the shots in Aquaman. The main difference that made this DC adventure stand far above Batman v. Superman was the color pallete. Previous DC movies attempted to have darker visuals with a desaturated look, whereas Wan and his team pushed the limits of color throughout the movie's entire duration. Its color and visual effects were even better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which broke records with the amount of visual effects put into it.<br/><br/>All things considered, Aquaman is a huge win for DC and Warner Bros. Pictures. Its narrative is compelling, the protagonist is well developed, and it's just a whole lot of fun to watch from beginning to end. This is definitely a movie that you will not want to miss in theaters, as the big screen is truly the best way to experience the visually stunning look that this brings to the table. At the end of the day, Aquaman may just be the best DC movie we have seen in years, possibly even better than last year's Wonder Woman. Hopefully this fantastic storytelling becomes a pattern for DC movies going forward."
"matildenunemn","6","1","4","21 December 2018"," Alright
","After being recommended Aquaman, I ended up giving it a shot, even though I really wasn't too excited for it.
It was OK, and there were some underwater scenes which were simply beautiful, so CGI was pretty awesome where sea creatures etc were concerned.
However, I just wasn't feeling the whole sea queen lighthouse keeper romance, it just seemed rather forced. For some reason Nicole Kidman just looked a bit ridiculous, maybe it was the weird looking hair or the cheap-looking outfit.
The dialogue overall wasn't great, even though there were a few good jokes some ""serious"" scenes actually made me laugh. Once again, sometimes it felt pretty forced.
Also didn't see the need to have them kiss at the end, I thought we were over that cliche, it's 2018!
However, Jason Momoa was definitely a good choice for the role, and so was Amber Heard. They did great jobs despite it all. Willem Dafoe was pretty random but awesome as one would expect.<br/><br/>Honestly, the fact that I've never really read any Aquaman comics or been interested in the character/Justice League in general probably didn't help. I'm more of a Marvel person and I enjoy the little easter eggs in the movies, whereas here I didn't connect with the characters or the story as much.
To sum up, if you're looking to entertain yourself for 2 hours I guess go for it!"
"joseealvarezm","5","1","4","21 December 2018"," Bad to the fishbone.

The movie flaws are huge, starting with a poor music & soundtrack choice. It's an annoying mix of every type of tacky music. Where's the Leitmotiv?
A poor screenwrite bleeds all over the scene. A lot of clichés.

Jason Mamoa does a solid job here, Amber Heard is a goddess, literally and figuratively, and James Wan shoots a beautiful looking film aside from a few weird CGI uses. The story is pretty similar to Black Panther, but it's not that derivative. There were some cool action sequences and I'll admit Aquaman's official suit was pretty fricken sick, but the music choices were baffling at times. I'm not ready to say this film or character can save the DCEU, it's a very solid superhero movie, but if it was set in the MCU it would certainly be one of the lesser entries. Kudos for not making a film that sucks though, choosing creative directors like James Wan will be key to DC regaining some of its former glory."

So I'm always a stickler for CGI in movies but this time I can't say this. The put down in this movie is due to props . But only in the costume department.

"Ingrouille181","8","1","4","17 December 2018"," Not enough to save the DCEU
","Aquaman was good in the Justice League movie last year, and they picked a good actor who fitted a dark gritty version of Aquaman: Joan Momoa. Now we have a full on Aquaman movie. Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, and directed by James Wan. Makings of a great edition to the DCEU, the problem is it runs on a by the numbers story for the main character. Warner Bros did something out of the blue: they had the ensemble movie first, with each new character a follow up solo movie; the beginning of Aquaman gives us a backstory, with the main movie focusing on the aftermath of Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>The story takes place sometime after the events of Justice League, with Arthur Curry (Aquaman) being forced into the open when Orm, his half-brother and King of the Legendary Atlantis is trying to begin a new war with the surface world. Now Arthur has to embark on an adventure with another Atlantean, Mera, to find a way to defeat arm and unite their two worlds.<br/><br/>For positives, the visuals are amazing. Atlantis looks phenomenal, the action set pieces are well done, especially the continuous shots that Wan is known for in his action films. The set designs and costumes are inspired, especially the classic Aquaman suit and Black Manta's armour. The budged for the CGI was definitely well spent, we get the studio mandated third act battle but I didn't care: we get War Sharks and War Sea Horses and King Crabs and a GIANT KRAKEN, THING! with missiles and lasers on them, smashing into each other while flaming balls of molten magma are being flung around on CATAPULTS!; I felt like I tripping balls for 10 minutes but it's so worth it.<br/><br/>The film has fun montages and flashbacks, and funny moments of humour sprinkled throughout. Amber Heard is very good as Mera. The way the Atlanteans live and function is interesting to see. The film is well paced and keeps you interested; can't say there were any times it was starting to bore me.<br/><br/>All that being said, Aquaman is very good on its own; if it had been the first instalment in the DCEU, or the second, after Wonder Woman, the DCEU could have continued on a better thought out franchise, instead Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have left, Batman v Superman and Justice League were messes, and Shazam doesn't come off like it'll be a surefire hit at all. Wonder Woman 1984's already in production so the train can't stop now, and the DCEU movies are heading into pre-production before any well thought out thinking can be done, It's gonna be distracting going forward; I still think they should have rebooted it post Justice League, especially since they're gonna have to ""Don Cheadle"" Superman and Batman now. The DCEU still has no concrete plan for their universe, and they certainly don't have a competent Kevin Feige figure.<br/><br/>But, for two hours of fast paced, action packed entertainment with a charming lead and supporting characters, definitely give Aquaman a see."
"Impsman","7","1","4","17 December 2018"," Enjoyable hokum
","A super hero from Atlantis who can talk to fish was never going to be an easy film to make a cohesive plot with so clearly the makers of Aquaman have decided the best way to cover this is to make it big and spectacular. They succeed with this. You are never bored whilst watching this film and some of the underwater imagery is beautiful to look at. Having seen Justice League last year the small underwater segment within that film gave some considerable concern on how this film would look. What was a dogs dinner twelve months ago is startling and impressive in this film.<br/><br/>The film itself is best viewed with your brain in neutral as several aspects don't stand up to close scrutiny and I am sure the goofs part of IMDB will get plenty of inclusions when you start to overthink the film. All I'll say is that the whole premise is ridiculous so just go with the flow. You'll enjoy it so much more if you do"

"redheughs","10","1","4","16 December 2018"," One of the best superhero origins films
","This movie was truly a delight. I had previously thought aquaman in the JL film was a bit of a let down. However, in this standalone origins film this all changed. With a stellar cast including dolph lundgren, Julie Andrews, William Dafoe and many more. It is a visual effects marvel with some of the best battle scenes rivalling Star Wars. You are continually blown away by the effects and the fact none of this was actually filmed underwater. The film equally matches avatar for the effects. The movie is long and over two hours plus the usual extra bit after the main titles so don't miss this. Jason M needs to be careful of not becoming too flippant in movies and be a little more serious. In one scene where he talks to his half brother the first line is quite good and delivering and then he ends it by saying ""but I now know your a dick"" It's not keeping with the rest of the film. Amber is stunning in her various outfits and probably puts down the best acting delivery of her career. I didn't realise just how tall Nicole Kidman is standing taller than Jason! All in all this is fab movie and definitely sets up for a sequel. Marvel now need to look more closely at what DC is doing. Another superman movie with the fab Henry Cahill and DC will have overtaken Marvel. I highly recommend seeing this film. Enjoy"

","I saw this movie in theatres with one of my good friends and let me tell you this movie was BAD. We are both Marvel fans but are also interested in DC comics and I want DC to succeed. This movie just set DC farther back from Marvel than it already was. Everything from the cgi to the score was so unbearably awful that all we could do was laugh. In the first scene when the Queen was awkwardly eating a fish out of the tank I thought ""okay I guess that could be funny if you think about it"" and then the military/guard people came to take her back to Atlantis and their costumes were so horrendous but still I thought ""I will give this the benefit of the doubt and I'm sure the movie will be better than this"". However, I was wrong. It gets so much worse than I ever would have thought. There were so many plot lines to take in at once it was just so confusing. Some people might say ""well if you read the comics you would already understand a lot of it"" but that's not how an origin story should be. I would understand if there was multiple movies before this that I needed to watch in order to understand but there wasn't. This is an origin movie. Don't even get me started on the music... what the hell were they thinking?! The ""love story"" was no LOVE story at all! They looked at each other sexually twice in the movie and at the end i guess they're in love or something i don't know! At the beginning of the movie ""Aquaman"" seems to be invincible and gets a grenade launcher shot at his chest and he's fine. But then later in the movie he gets stabbed and almost dies..... maybe i missed something??? I probably fell asleep from BOREDOM bc this movie dragged on and was so hard to follow. Do not waste your money to see this movie it is unbearably awkward. I have much more i could talk about that is wrong with this movie but I'm tired of typing. I don't know how this movie could be watched by producers and movie makers and actually be sent out to theatres. You have been warned. Unbelievable."

","I ask just one thing if a superhero movie. Entertain me.<br/><br/>They are meant to be fun. This wasn't.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure how they managed to squeeze in so many clichÃ©s, plot holes, stolen imagery moments from other films and blatant 'twists', but they managed it.<br/><br/>Nothing made sense, nothing flowed, nothing was viable, the cgi was very hit & miss, the script was lazy and weak, the action sequences (especially the black manta fight) looked like they were straight out of an early 90's power rangers episode.<br/><br/>Creating a world is always going to be a challenge and for that reason I will excuse their iteration of Atlantis but when they actually make real world locations look like low budget film sets it worries me about the quality of the footage that hit the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Ultimately I wanted to like this film. I wasn't optimistic in the slightest with dc's current strike rate but I hoped it would be good. In the end I would have walked out happier with aquaman dying at the end because at least I wouldn't have seen it coming.<br/><br/>This film makes suicide squad look like a success.

"alanjones-65107","4","2","14","14 December 2018"," Patchy script, boring characters, but sometimes enjoyable
","The overall experience of Aquaman is akin to a watching a mash up of the little mermaid and avatar, and unfortunately I didn't like either of those movies. These DC efforts lag so far behind the MCU as they attempt to cram far too much backstory into the already excessive running time, are far to reliant on CGI (Tom's hair!) and the wild camera swings and zooms make it incredibly difficult to tell who is winning the current fight scene, especially in the ring of fire.
The movie is the epitome of a tidal wave, big loud and tries to throw a lot at the viewer, but ultimately little sticks."

So finally Aquaman grab the trident and defeats his brother and become the true king of the deep. He's a surface guy but hey, he is half sea queen derivative so. There was a black person that was chasing him from the very beginning of the movie wanting to take revenge for his friend or something because aquaman was allegedly the reason of his death.

Then it just randomly jumps to Aquaman just knowing he's a superhero and can breath underwater somehow and attacking submarines.. ok??? Then there's random evil submarine men who just show up and start shooting at the sea people having a meeting. Why??? Did they know they were there having a meeting? WHY are they attacking them? So random. Not to mention Aquaman looks absolutely nothing like his supposed ""parents"" and he looks about 5-10 years younger than his dad. The acting, terrible. Plot, terrible. Music, terrible.

","In a shocking turn of events, DC Comics made a great movie that isn't about Batman! Finally, with Aquaman, fans get the type of movie they've always wanted from DC, and I see big things for the future of this franchise. Arthur (Jason Momoa) is the son of the Queen of Atlantis and a mortal man. He was born with extraordinary abilities, but not with the motivation to use them. After his mother was exiled and presumably killed by Atlantis, Arthur wants nothing to do with his people, until a world wide threat forces him to take action. The story here is the same as your basic comic themed film, saving the world while trying to get the girl, but what makes Aquaman really stand out is it's incredible special effects. Seeing as many films as I do, it's difficult to impress me with a little bit of CGI, but this film had some of the best effects I have ever seen! Even if this was a silent film the sheer beauty and magic of this underwater world would still be breath-taking. Jason Momoa stars in his biggest role to date and this guy absolutely killed it. My biggest fear going into this film was that it would be too cartoonish and led by a newcomer, not a great combination, but Momoa is terrific both his personality and in his ability to put on one hell of a fight scene. As for the cartoonish part, there is a little bit of that and it was a turn off, but you do need to pander to the young crowd a film like this is likely to draw. For my money, this is the best DC Comics film since the Dark Knight. I'm not the biggest Superhero fan and I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. The two and half hours literally flew by and in the end I was still craving more. I can't wait to see what's next for Aquaman."

There was no plot twist or surprises or development, the trailers showed the mom so don't make that an argument. You knew from the very start his aim and he achieved it without much hassle. In fact an hour could be taken from the middle of the movie that doesn't add anything, the first time he fights his step brother.<br/><br/>Every time there's a new superhero movie I bring my little sister to go see it, and this was the first time I've ever seen her underwhelmed in the cinema.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely atrocious.

In my opinion Aquaman is a bad movie because the plot is really bad ! The actors play good and the decors and costumes is good but I think this movie have been creat just for get lot of money. The plot talks about Aquaman (I don't know his true name and I don't want to know it). So, Aquaman wants to stop a war between the Surfaciens and the Atlentes. The Atlentes want to do war because the Surfaciens use the sea like a bin and Aquaman ar half- Surfacien half-Atlante,and mother of Aquaman she the queen of Atlatide.

","I'm a big fan of the director James Wan because he is able to blend realism and fantasy in a convincing way and this movie is a great example of this. The lore was interesting and the movie did a good job showing Aquaman's backstory with quick flashbacks that didn't distract from the main plot.<br/><br/>To start off, all the acting was amazing but I have to give a special shout out to Patrick Wilson (Orm). The villain could have easily came across as comical but Wilson brings a gravitas to the role that made the movie epic. Jason Momoa also did a fantastic job and his screen presence really shows in every scene and that's important for a role like Aquaman.<br/><br/>The CGI was fantastic, especially for all the underwater scenes. The creatures looked realistic and the world building was really great. I loved the camera work in the movie. A lot of directors get too comfortable shooting in flat, boring angles but this movie really showed how a visual medium should look to help bring out every scene. From the wide angles to the close ups, everything looked inspired and interesting.<br/><br/>I did find some of the music choices questionable at times and the songs distracted from the what was happening but at least they were short moments in an otherwise great score.<br/><br/>I really loved the fight scene between Aquaman and Orm. The tension and action was perfect and the small comedic quips landed. I also really liked Aquaman's speech before he got his trident.<br/><br/>This version of Aquaman was greatly improved from the Justice League movie. You can really understand his motivations.<br/><br/>I really got to hand it to DC this time. I haven't had this much fun watching a DCEU movie since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>10/10 would recommend 👍"

","Ok lets get this straight, Aquaman is a decent enough film. There is plenty to be excited about and its visually spectacular. Hell if we went by the first ten minutes this would be a ten. DC always does what DC does, thats take itself too seriously. Ant Man and Deadpool are perfect examples from Marvel where you practically take the piss out of yourself and still be great. DC are known for darkness are mystery, Aquaman is meant to be light hearted.
This movie in particular as stated earlier starts off excellent, character development and storyline. Also off the bat Jason Momoa is perfect for the role with his wit and general persona. The actual main plot is very thin though (even for Dolph Lundgren standards). Im by no means saying dont go, however just lower your expectations a little bit.

It felt off as far as tone, as if Wan couldn't decide when it was supposed to be serious and when it was supposed to be funny. Almost all of the jokes fall flat. Only 2 old ladies in our showing laughed.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is all the recycled material. Orm is like Loki, just way more over the top. That final battle scene was straight out of Lord of the Rings - water Orcs and Jonathon Rhys- Davies and all. There was even a shot that looked straight out of Avengers with the Chitauri bursting out of the
Leviathan.<br/><br/>Also, with all the CGI, you'd think they could wipe out the awful wig lines. Seriously, the worst wigs ever.<br/><br/>And DC seriously needs to get over it's mommy issues.<br/><br/>The good things? Some of the fight scenes were amazing. I'm so glad they kept the ""Snyder slo-mo"" to a minimum. The animals were beautifully rendered for the most part and I really love Thomas Curry.

","Up until Wonder Woman, I'd lost all hope for any good DC movies. Then, their Justice League movie sucked, too, which just made me go back to hating anything in the DC Universe again. While my wife and her friends were shopping, a friend and I decided to catch a movie last minute. We decided on Aquaman because it fitted with our schedule. I sat in my chair expecting another failed attempt at a good superhero movie, wishing that this was any Marvel movie other than Ant Man. Was I ever wrong. This movie had it all; great storytelling and the CGI was breathtaking. Acting was very good all around. The movie had so much depth and didn't rely on awkward teenage humor to carry it through heavily emotional scenes.<br/><br/>James Wan did an amazing job at directing this movie and I really hope that he gets his hands in more DC flicks.<br/><br/>If DCEU can keep up this momentum, I really think that they can find their own in the new era of superhero movies.<br/><br/>I have no idea how anyone who enjoys superhero movies could give this less than a 7. Also, as per usual, ignore Rotten Tomatoes and their biast reviews.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and see this in theatres. The effects are made for the big screen and will leave you absolutely submerged in the underwater Universe. Well done, DCEU!"
"lambiepie-2","8","1","5","23 December 2018"," Fantastic Job by everyone
","This was enjoyable entertainment, and a fantastic job done by everyone involved with this film. I can't speak too much on the DC vs. Marvel thing, I always liked Aquaman and saw him on par with Superman and Batman. I found him interesting BECAUSE he was part of the Sea. For years I heard rumors of a feature length film and was happy to finally see this one. It works!<br/><br/>What made the film first was the visuals. It's great to see, and I saw it in 3D. I will eat my hat if this team doesn't garner an Oscar nod, they deserve it. Then, there's Jason Momoa as Aquaman, and he fits the bill so much that you can't stop watching him. Aquaman has the difficult feat of being on land and sea, and Jason's portrayal gives you that struggle. And ""that thing"" about Aquaman that he can talk to the fish. He can. It was nice to see the beginnings of that.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Amber Herd, Wilem DaFoe and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II rounds it out great as an ensemble cast. And then there's James Wan, the director who made all this work - the actors, the special effects - what a wonderful triumph, once it got going, I could have watched more.<br/><br/>Aquaman is entertaining, it's family oriented and visually brings the undersea world to life."

","With a dull lineup of 2018 blockbuster winter superhero action flicks, Aquaman rises to the top. Although highly entertaining with stunning visuals, the movie falls short (**SPOILERS**):<br/><br/>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Black Manta) draws the short-end of the stick. Despite having the bravado of Wesley Snipes, Mateen's character was too flawed; an origin storyline deserves better dialogue. Despite unintentional comedic relief, the character served as a distraction. When Mateen revealed himself as ""Black Manta,"" I swear the audience heard ""Black Panther."" When Mateen obtains Atlantean tech, he turns to the camera deadpan and smolders; cheese, anyone?<br/><br/>If there was anywhere in the movie where one could insert comedy, it should be when characters referred to ""Ocean Master."" Fittingly, Momoa should have taken jabs at this title. He certainly saves Aquaman in other areas. Heard (Mera) nails the look; totally hot, but faces a battle with terrible dialogue, especially towards the end when Momoa is crowned as ""The King.""<br/><br/>No quarrel with the CGI; some parts seemed too rushed. An epic underwater battle that blurred together; for a good 3 minutes, the audience could not tell what was happening. And in other parts, way too slow. For example, Momoa is introduced shirtless in the first few minutes inside of submarine. Great, audience cheers! All of sudden, the scene cuts into an odd 80's slow motion. Did the studio cut corners with the production?<br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack: it's clear the studio was aiming for refreshed retro 80's nostalgia; a page out of Thor Ragnarok. Sure, lack of originality, but I enjoyed it. Actually, wanted more.<br/><br/>Hopefully, DC continues to step up it's game. Looking forward to more."

Wowwwww Aquaman was amazinggg.

Highly mythical with echoes of Lord of the Rings (Game of Thrones?) and Polynesian culture, DC's Aquaman was an action-packed, breathtaking movie you have to see. You actually forget you're watching a superhero movie for a moment.
I admit I intially had doubts about the actor, but now I think he fits the role well for a modern version of Aquman: a brute persona with an amazing costume that's improved from the original. Plus, it's good to see an ethnic minority as a strong protagonist in 2018. I love you DC"

","Aquaman threw out of the window 90% of MCU just like that. After I went out of cinema I was really wondering, if perhaps WB were intentionally trolling themselves with previous productions to make everyone thinking, that DCEU sucks, only to make the biggest comeback ever? Im no longer pesimistic about next movies from this franchise. Im really convinced that there will not be any crappy movie after they achieved so much for a character that is not the biggest Icon in DC Universe.
And they did that in the Best possible moment, cause upcomming Captain Marvel will be sour SJW trash and if Shazzam will keep the level of Aquaman (Im trully convinced that it will) DC will catch up a lot from the distance to MCU. And this is possibly the best news for fans of comic books like myself.
Well done WB&DC! You cought your opponent of guard and served him very mean left swing.
P.S. The line that Jason Mamoa spoke in conversation with sea monster is the Best line I heard in superhero movies ever and I dont recall even one MCU production with a line that good. Those who saw the movie Im sure will agree. Those who didnt, I envy you emotions when you will witness the moment.

","...That shark scene in the aquarium is just the best.<br/><br/>Aquaman...he used to be a joke, way before mainstream comic book movies became the norm. But to make his comic book suit work on film, is just an astounding feat. Those orange scales and green leggings, fit perfectly and does not look cheesy at all. For that - I applaud the team for not shying away from the character's roots.<br/><br/>As to the movie itself. I admittedly enjoyed the second half, way way more than the first half. First half (after the linear introduction of his origin to that of present day - which was great) was well...full of expositions that was somewhat weirdly edited to intertwine both present and past. It happens kinda often that it really took me out of the storytelling. Being able to mentally recall the last time it did that, it just felt repetitive and overuse.<br/><br/>And speaking of repetitiveness - that Michael Bay 360 camera rotation technique is just er...not good at all. If I recall correctly - it is used like three times for first half of the movie. And then there are those character building time scenes that was suddenly disrupted to lead into the action scenes - that got very repetitive too. Basically - it feels like the rhythm of the edit was very jarring.<br/><br/>Even the sounds got abruptly cut off, as the camera pans up from the drumming octopus to those in the ""lobby deck"" - was a very weird choice, instead of having it naturally fade out. And there is that one scene with Black Manta and a song playing full on, that felt so out of pace and out of place.<br/><br/>Besides all the technicalities above, after all the setups, once Arthur and Mera finally went on their expedition - that was when the movie kicked into another gear. It became a story that I found interest in. That was more enjoyable. Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard exudes a believable chemistry. And Black Manta was comic book perfection - to make his look work on-screen too. And I felt the heart of the movie - when he met with his mom, his brother meeting his mom, and lastly his dad meeting his wife - those were very nice touches.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film makes it cool to want to talk to a fish."

","As an artist, I try and see the beauty in everything. Visually the film is a masterpiece of technology. It is such a pity that the story line was so diluted (pun intended) because this was such a wonderful opportunity to make a significant statement about the rape of the oceans and the abuse of the environment - but instead we were presented with a limp excuse of a story line that was about class and prejudice. The injustice was the theme was held back by poor dialogue and Americanism of vocabulary.
In addition to the film being far too long - the stars were the fish and the goat in the plane flying over the desert. Never mind - take away all the bad bits and your left with a great screen saver!"
"a-78738","Null","1","6","25 April 2020"," He is my hero
","In the process of watching this movie, I was always looking for the real reasons why I needed the hero Aquaman, such as the appearance of batman is to save Gotham city, wonder woman is a hope of the world war, and the sea king? At first I gave the answer to the question of a world of land and sea, but in the end I got a different result. The first is to combine it with reality: with this film, the director may also want to convey that human behavior has invaded the ocean, and that the ocean will one day fight back against us. Second, on the original intention of the hero film: compared with other hero films, I think the appearance of batman or wonder woman is a desire for rescue. However, the sea king is more concerned with expressing the difference between the king and the hero, and the difference between the two is whether there is love, just as the sea king does not want to rule the land and the sea, he wants to save the people he loves and home."

","A simplistic cartoon of a story, with shallow, two-dimensional villains and predictable cardboard cut-out heroes, speaking painfully-feeble dialogue between the frequent and overblown fight scenes. The superhero genre doesn't have to lack nuance and depth to this extent, as several of the Marvel movies have demonstrated, so I assume the film makers were deliberately aiming at the most undemanding under-twelves with this movie. For everyone else, the artists and designers involved have worked hard to compensate for the lack of any emotional weight, and anything even approaching an interesting plot - so there's a wealth of gorgeous visuals to be distracted by; but there are scenes that are so excruciatingly awful that no amount of trickery can save them. The moments of ""triumph"" are so contrived and hokey that the obligatory orchestral score which swells up on cue is downright embarrassing to sit through. I defy anyone not to squirm when Aquaman steps fully-uniformed from a waterfall, or when he stares dramatically at the bad-guys through the prongs of his trident. As feeble and trite as this movie is, it doesn't fail as badly as it ought to because recent DC movies have set the bar so low, but nothing except the visuals will move you, intrigue you, or leave you wanting more."

"gcsman","7","1","6","21 December 2018"," ""Worlds of DC"" has discovered color!
","Aquaman has loads of spectacle and loads of color -- all the way down to Mera's ultra-red hair. In that one way it's the polar opposite of the dark and glum Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad. Director James Wan has decided to throw the kitchen sink at us, with giant armored sharks, supergiant weaponized crabs, fleets of manta rays, armies of mermen, magic tridents, and even wilder fantasy flights of imagination. What makes this work, which it pretty much does, is that it has the big advantage of being new: we haven't seen this before, by comparison with any other action-driven movies that are usually on the ""surface world"", as the Atlanteans refer to it.<br/><br/>But as writer Ursula LeGuin once said, if the only thing happening is unrelenting physical action then it's a sure sign that there is no story being told. And that's where Aquaman teeters on the edge. It's got a storyline, which is actually quite simple and barely adequate to support all the action, but in a sense the real center of interest is the spectacle itself largely because of its new and unfamiliar setting. The overall feeling I got was that I was watching some kind of stylistic combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pacific Rim, Star Wars, and King Arthur all piled together. My (adult) daughter says it's like a cross between Tron and Little Mermaid.<br/><br/>About the acting: Jason Momoa is -- OK. Maybe a promise for better things to come. He and all the rest suffer from having to deliver a pretty simplistic script with stereotype dialog. I was generally pleased with Amber Heard as Mera; she got more to do than I was expecting and they gave her a distinctive water-control superpower that was fun to see and came in handy at certain points. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe stood clearly above all the rest, however, just for their quality of diction; i.e. they didn't mumble. Why has slurring your words become a 'style'?? As a last comment, I thought Rupert Gregson-Williams' musical score was kind of a disappointment. It was workmanlike and did the job needed for an epic like this (essentially telling us how to feel at every moment) but it was nowhere near the standout work he did for Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that you'll get your money's worth for an evening's entertainment.

"SaintNinja","9","1","6","18 December 2018"," Not a Masterpiece, but solid.
","The best parts of this almost christmas time heart warming movie for me were:
<ul><li>Music. Original score is fresh and moving just like Thor 3 Ragnarok score.</li></ul>The Jukebox songs work very gwell placed. Black Manta doing Tony Stark's thing with the sounds of Depeche Mode ""It's no good""! Roy Orbison and Toto's ""Africa"" with rap - that's a combination, old pal.
The first song/theme in the movie is some kind of Atlantean lullaby - you can cry a sea of tears, it's very romantic.
<ul><li>Viuals. This is eyecandy - that's all.</li></ul>Momoa and Lundgren are great. Black pirates are cool. Main antagonist is charismatic and deep. There are some really good jokes in Marvel style.
Now let's talk about weak parts:
<ul><li>The Plot is too big for one movie in my opinion. Hollow Earth's sea and dr Auaman Jones in Sahara were thin and raw.</li></ul>Same thing with Black Manta and the city of Atlantis. I would love to see him walking around the underwater streets watching simple alien life etc)) All this glory didn't fit the screen time. Lord of the Rings was too fast and rushed too, but Aquaman is like 10 times faster. Maybe they will add some cut material in DVD versions.
So, I can't give it 10 of 10. But I give strong 9 for the great work and heart."

"asb_deutsch","5","1","7","23 December 2018"," Aquaman or Rajnikant 2.0? Atleast this CGI roller-coaster will please every Marvel fan!
","I have mixed response after watching this flick. First the visuals.
I watched Aquaman in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with no chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing. In a nutshell, a Picasso masterpiece of visuals.<br/><br/>Where is the character development? And where's the mission? The first half was nice, especially the script falls flat. It was more like Slaughter-man to me. I mean, what was Aquaman's weakness, to begin with? Black Manta's father shot him with a launcher and it seemed that it bothered Aquaman like a mosquito bite! Seriously, if Manta was not part of the movie it would have been worse.<br/><br/>For Superman, it is Kryptonite. Then why Aquaman was punched and KO in Justice League? At least there was a twist in the middle of JL.<br/><br/>Or pure female fantasy? I mean it was nice that Meera's character was not portrayed as a damsel in distress. She was looking sexy in the tight suit but why forced feminism? Why did Atlanna cry when both brothers were fighting? Rather she just saw her son going to 'bars"" without a tear in her eye. Arthur and Meera going to Africa and Italy seemed like they were planning on a honeymoon!<br/><br/>Verdict: Avatar+Tron+Star Wars+2.0*
My score is 4.5/10 but I will add 0.5 since the visuals were far much better than BvS and JL. And I watched The Dark Knight as it commemorated a decade recently. No DC/Marvel movie has even came close to that masterpiece. Sigh!<br/><br/>*Rajnikanth can do everything and anything, and Aquaman is no different!"
"Doeh","6","1","7","16 December 2018"," It's decent
","Aquaman is directed by James Wan and is the 6th movie in the controversial DCEU.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. The acting all around is excellent. Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen from a comic book movie in a long time. Another good thing going for this movie is that it's very self-contained. It's no Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad. It doesn't try to set up 2-3 spinoff movies, which DC movies are sometimes known for. The villains weren't half bad. You could understand them, and they weren't evil for the sake of being evil. Finally, James Wan creates a fantastic world, which for me was
breathtaking at times.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean there aren't negatives. The movie is clocking around 2 hours and 23 minutes, and you can feel it. There were so many scenes that were unnecessary, and so many of the jokes just fell flat and didn't land with me or the audience that I was with. Besides the action scenes, everything was lackluster. The Arthur and Mera relationship was cringy at times, but that's not something that's going to ruin the movie for you. Aquaman is also very predictable; which takes the fun and suspense out during certain moments of the film.<br/><br/>A film with great acting, excellent fights, and a fantastic setting are ultimately brought down by its dragged on runtime, bad jokes, and uneventful/unnecessary scenes.<br/><br/>Aquaman gets a 6/10."

Comic Book icon Superhero Named ""Aquaman"" And Turning it into Awesome Aquaman Movie And By Casting Jason Momoa To Play Arthur Curry a.k.a ""Aquaman"" Was The Perfect Choice To Play This Underwater Comic Book Hero, And The Way The James Wan Came Up With Some Terrific Action Sequences, The Beautiful Scenery Set Pieces With Excellent Exotic Locations Especially The Action Scene That Takes Place in Italy And The All Star Cast That includes Amber Heard, William Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Temuera Morrison, Nicole Kidman And Dolph Lundgren Were Brilliant. The Verdict. Jason Momoa Was Cool And Bad Ass As ""Aquaman"", I'm Not a Fan Of Amber Heard Films But i Have To Say i Thought She Did Great Job Of Playing This Hero Character Named ""Mera"", Especially Her And Aquaman Are Helping Each Other Out Also By Having Them Saving The Day And The Two Of Them Also Share a Kissing Scene, Patrick Wilson From Zach Snyder's Dark Superhero Film ""Watchmen"" Where He Plays The ""Nite Owl"" Character, Also He Has Started in Two Of ""Insidious Films, And Two Of ""The Conjuring Films"", in Aquaman He Plays Aquaman's Evil Half Brother Named ""King Orm"" Who Wants To Rule The Entire Underwater Atlantis And Of Becoming The Ultimate King Of Atlantis Which Was a Pretty Good Bad Guy Character To Play, Tamuera Morrison From ""Star Wars Episode 2 "" The Attack Of The Clones"" Where He Played The Bounty Hunter Character Named ""Jango Fitt"" in Aquaman He Plays Arthur Curry's Father Which Was Cool To See Him Again in a Movie, Then We Three Big Superstars Like Nicole Kidman Who Plays Aquaman's Mother Named ""Atlanna"" Who Has a Bad Ass Action Moment Sequence Scene it Was To See Her Play a Defferent Kind Of Character Role, The Always Great William Dafoe From ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", The First ""John Wick Film"" And My Favorite Film in Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" Where in Aquaman He Plays ""Vulko"" Who is Aquaman's Mentor And Teaching Him Of How To Learn Of Fighting And Showing Him Of Using Powers To Speak To Underwater Sea Creatures And Finally There's Action icon Star Dolph Lundgren Who Plays ""King Nereus"" Who's Also Mera's Father, Now For Me i Thought He Was Awesome To See in An Superhero Action Film For The First Time Well Not Since He First Played The ""Frank Castle"" a.k.a ""The Punisher"" Character in 1989s ""The Punisher"". Way a Go James Wan For Coming Off Of Directing The Supernatural And Suspense Films Like ""The Conjuring"" And ""The insidious Films, Also Making Of The First ""Saw"" Movie And The Puppet Fright Film ""Dead Silence"", Once Again This Was a Defferent Kind Of An James Wan Movie And i Think He Should Make More Action And Superhero Films Because He Has a Good Eye For Making These Kind Of Movies With Style, Coming Up With These imagination ideas And a Amazing Direction."

","Overall not sure about this film will have to rewatch but here are my first impressions. Started well apart from Atlanna Tridenting the classic puppet series Stingray! They're the good guys Atlanna!. Enjoyed meeting big boy Aquaman whilst taking on Manta,was a pretty cool opening action sequence. After that it got a little too much with excessive CGI and really too much going on for a single viewing. Dafoe was ok but not enough mentoring for my taste. Plot was overall ok except for the Duel with Orm. Aquaman was not getting his ass kicked to hard so seemed a bit cowardly to run away with Mera. Tended towards the cheesy in closing sequences but I will watch again to see what subtleties I may have missed in the crowded action sequencies. Momoa was very good in the part (liked him since Stargate Atlantis and obviously as badass Khal Drogo in the butchered GOT) Others fitted in well even an obviously aging Kidman (check out the facial wrinkles that werent covered well). I liked it on the whole and I am sure it will improve with each additional viewing. Hope you liked it too."

I read some review that talked about Momoa acting like a tattooed, bullish thug as the character in this movie. Not sure what that viewer was expecting to see,, but the last thing I saw was a thug. Momoa plays the character of Arthur Curry perfectly,, and yes, he's a bit rough around the edges,, but he's a hero of the land and sea!! The rest of the cast was great as well,, including Heard. Wilson, Lundgren, and Kidman (also Pops Curry, and the guy who played Black Manta).<br/><br/>So, the main movie starts after the events of Justice League. Arthur Curry is doing what he has been for awhile, protecting the sea. Otb, the redheaded Atlantian Mera shows up and tells Arthur that his half-brother Orn is bringing a war to the surface/land,, and he must challenge Orn for the throne of Atlantis! From there,, action ensues!!<br/><br/>The one complaint,, or more of an observation/question, I have is what the heck is up with the music being played in that scene where Black Manta was putting his suit together?

Please to say otherwise I found the world they created sufficiently immersive to retain my attention.<br/><br/>Does anyone watch comic book films for a plot? I don't think so they tend to be predictable and this is no different when Aquamans Dad sat farewell to his Mer-Queen on the pier close to his home we instantly know the ending! However, I can't be bitter about this as the films blends action and humour seamlessly for the majority of its run providing you leave the higher functions of your brain disconnected ( Physics etc of jumping out of a plane etc) and its cinematic style is brighter then many of DC attempts at creating a comic book universe to rival marvel.<br/><br/>If you out looking for something light and fluffy to pass a couple if hours and your in the mood for some under water comic book shenanigans then you can't go far wrong."

I personally think that any DC movie in the past can be rolled over. The picture quality, special effects, and imagination are all first-class."

","The story was surprisingly good. As the origin story of a possible series of movies, the story with the male owner of the sea king's ""search for self"" experience and the male brother's war stringed up the basic pattern of the undersea world, as far as possible to show the audience the world never appeared. this is done well.
The film is really great, director Wen Ziyan is great. Hope to also see the DC film directed by Wen Ziren"
"DLochner","6","0","2","31 March 2020"," Interesting hero in a stupid world
","What an interesting hero in a stupid world. In my eyes, Aquaman was a huge opportunity to create something really big - but the film was incredible and exaggerated by a thunderstorm of animations and colorful underwater world. The best thing about the whole film is the hero himself and the first 30 minutes of the film."
"kermitkid","8","0","10","31 March 2020"," Better than it has any right to be
","This was fin-tastic! In my ""Justice League"" review last year, I praised the way they handled Aquaman, and made him cool instead of the butt of the joke that he's been for the past 75 years. He's just as cool here. From the opening battle to the final battle, his awesomeness has no end. The story is pretty good, though I did feel like I'd seen a lot of it before, but it's such a fun journey, that I didn't care. The action sequences, at least when they're grand scale battles with wide shots or pan-shots, look gorgeous. The hand-to-hand combat stuff, not so much. The way those are shot made me feel like I was watching someone play the ""Injustice"" games. Some of the dialogue is pretty corny, but that's the case with most DC films lately. They're trying to be live-action Saturday morning cartoons. I have no problem with that in the action aspect, but some of the dialogue really needed some re-writes. I usually complain about CGI in Warner Bros. movies saying how it always looks like a trailer for a PS2 game from 2004, but that's not the case here. Ok, there were some parts underwater that were very obviously green screen, but those were few and far between, at least not to the degree of ""Wonder Woman"" where I could tell when things were CGI. Most of the cast is pretty good, but I do need to complain just a little bit about Amber Heard. During the fight scenes, she was great, but anytime she had dialogue, her lips came up into a sort of sneer, like she was smelling rotten eggs. It didn't matter what the line was. It always looked like that, and it was distracting, and a bit funny. A lot of times it also sounded like she was trying to imitate Scarlett Johansson with the line delivery. In fact, if I closed my eyes, I could almost mistake her for Scarlett Johansson. The movie also had a lot of unnecessary figurative hand-holding for the audience. Every time there was a new location it felt the need to tell you where you were, despite the fact that most people could figure it out from visual context clues. It's obvious we're in Atlantis, it's obvious this is the Sahara. You don't need to have the text on the screen tell us. We're not dumb. We can figure it out in the first 5 seconds of seeing the location. By far the best part of this movie is the directing and cinematography. The wide shots are just gorgeous and the non hand to hand battles are well directed too. For a movie called 'Aquaman' where the main character's power is talking to fish, this was a lot better than it had any right to be. This is definitely, surprisingly, one of DC's best.

","This was definitely an improvement on the DCEU movies. I enjoyed it much more than the recent movies based in this universe. First, the pros- the visual effects are aesthetic and absolutely stunning. The action scenes are also great, and the amount of CGI work on this actually shows. It looks really good. Jason Momoa is also a big asset in this film, because, to be honest, he makes Aquaman cool. Aquaman hasn't been one of the most-liked superheroes in popular media, and many have previously made fun of the character. But, Momoa here really flips the script. The way he carries himself in the film has really changed the way I look at Aquaman, and I'm sure he has done the same for others too.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were good, and I liked Nicole Kidman's portrayal as Queen Atlanna. Patrick Wilson was also good in his role as the antagonist.<br/><br/>Moving on to the cons, I thought the script was a little weak. It seemed like a rehashed plot and was very similar to other superhero origin stories and a little cliched too. I especially thought the movie was awkward at times. Without going into spoiler area, I thought some moments didn't make much sense. Black Manta also was not so well-used here. I wish we could have seen a little more of him. I am expecting better for the sequel as this movie really makes me want to get into the DCEU. This was fairly good; one extra star for the CGI effects, which were very well done."
"codygdietrich","10","0","5","15 February 2020"," It's part a finding yourself and part action movie
","It is a really well done film that has layers, sorry to all the haters that clearly weren't paying attention. Part of it is about Arthur's birth and childhood and then about him finding out he is the prince of Atlantis and then becoming Aquaman. The haters say he is a mindless thug, ignoring the fact that he can speak Japanese and has an in-depth knowledge of the history of the Roman Empire. He did not grow up in Atlantis so when he arrives there is a lot he doesn't know, because it's like him traveling to a country he has never been before. His female companion is as much as a historian as she is a guide, because again he didn't grow up in Atlantis he doesn't know the legends and laws. Despite what the haters say the movie is less of a social commentary about polluting the oceans as it is about racism. Which is evident by the comments about him coming from many.<br/><br/>It really is a story about forging your own destiny while staying true to your heritage and ignoring what the negative people, it shows being a hero is about more than superhuman powers."

","Aquaman took it for the DC Comics Universe and becomes their highest-grossing movie worldwide, surpassing Wonder Woman, Superman and even Nolan's Batman trilogy individual films. Who would've thought? People always demean Aquaman so he deservedly got a Huge film! Massive production. A whole new world had to be created underwater, amazing effort. Special effects galore and the script is good enough.<br/><br/>Apparently they made the most out of the superhero, they made the most out of Jason Momoa, treated him good and he shined at moments. However, hardcore fans might complain of his portrayal as a bar thug tattooed kinda trashy guy (that's what some reviews say?) as opposed to the comic version sophisticated and smarter.
I love Amber Heard, she is such a gorgeous woman, to me she is very charismatic. Nicole Kidman, nice special character and great presence. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe delivered accordingly. Black Manta's motivation left me a little incomplete.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie that doesn't emphasize on the acting but in the end, I liked the conclusion so much, it appealed to my taste. I was satisfied, it's a crowd pleaser, nicely written. I'm not gonna knock it down because it's not at the masterpiece level of The Dark Knight, but shall support DC because they really need to compete (after many let-downs) and they did it with Aquaman, pleasantly surprised.
They found the right direction for the superhero, so I think the second part could easily be better, it has to, I have expectations now. Could it be more successful?"

The CGI is pretty good (the designer might have got lazy here and there). I was blown away at how they managed to do a few things (won't say, it's a spoiler) and fit it so well in the storyline.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa This huge beast is the best thing there is in the movie. The underwater CGI version of him is 8/10. Amber Heard'' did a pretty good come back.<br/><br/>DC has pretty good characters but screenplay-writers, not all are great. It is clearly visible that the pressure from Marvel has made them rush. This did not end well for rank 3 and 5. WonderWoman and Aquaman are the key reason why DC is still afloat. Maybe, this says, DC should have done what Marvel did, story out each character and then fit them like Avengers. Justice League is this case.<br/><br/>Peace Out!"

The cgi weird st times and well it's a 5 but I appreciate DC trying"" I take back the dialogue and the organic nature is aquaman in the iis movie and the cgi is not as bad as I thought it serves a purpose and I anyway I think this movie has staying power and Jason M is an excellent aquaman - I noticed recently that he truly makes movies better with his presence and I am coming to appreciate him and his acting so much !"

","This was one of the better ones but that's not saying much considering some of the messes lately in this genre. First of all I don't care about MCU vs DC and I don't think I'm alone in that regard. What most people want is a good captivating entertaining movie period.
This one had great elements - directing was good, visuals pretty well done considering, and I did find the main lead actor playing Aquaman entertaining. But and this is a very very big but, aside from him, the worst acting I've seen in a long time. Amber Heard was awful. I mean I couldn't even stay in the plot when I saw her on screen - I just kept thinking about her being Elon Musk's ex. That's pretty far off from the movie's plot. Is she supposed to be a beauty? Because aside from a little cleavage there's just nothing going for her in my opinion. Nicole Kidman a little better but not great and the 2 main evil opponents don't even get me started either.

Majority of the cast were great in their parts but Amber Heard just irked me throughout the movie. To me her ""acting"" was doing a bad impersonation of Black Widow. And her hair looked like a wig.

"Endless_01","6","0","1","15 June 2019"," A decent and fun DC movie, but still not achieving excellent quality.
","Despite the harsh criticisms that the cinematic universe of DC has received over the last few years, they have managed to remain stable and again and again have tried to meet the expectations of their audience, yet again and again failed; now, as for Aquaman, it seems to be a green light to a ray of hope for the future of these movies, because they finally offer us something that is both entertaining and decent, without mediocrity or folly.<br/><br/>Aquaman is an entertaining movie, full of intense moments designed to satisfy our eyes through a pretty cinematography and a great choreography, this but a soundtrack quite attractive that manages to help the scenes are quite satisfactory to our senses, well, at least the action scenes.<br/><br/>Leaving the action on one side, I think that the rest of the film during the moments when nobody is fighting, are then, boring, full of dialogues and performances that sincerely do not contribute anything to the importance we have on these characters. His narrative is full of the cliches expected in any film, however it is something forgivable, but reaches a point where we simply want a break from observing the same thing over and over again during these dialoguing scenes. I think this is the weak point of the film, in contrast to the very good action it has, it lacks a strong narrative or structure in which we can be interested enough about the story of the film, the motives of the characters or the characters themselves.<br/><br/>In spite of this, it is finally a healthy and well-received attempt in the action genre, apart from a good movement on the part of DC.

And the best thing: This movie doesn't take itself more seriously than it should.<br/><br/>Sure - it could have been, no, SHOULD have been way shorter, and it would have made the movie much better, but if James Wan has proven anything with this flick it is that you can tell the most cheesy story for the thousandth time - and it will still work, if you tell it well.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would."

"elicopperman","6","0","1","31 May 2019"," Hysterical Popcorn Entertainment for All
","One of the most infamous films to come out of the DC Extended Universe in definitely Justice League due to its messy structure and clear behind the scenes meddling. That being said, what followed up could very well be their most creative endeavor yet, and that is the cinematic stand alone flick centered around Aquaman. It also happens to be the only addition to this franchise that grossed over a billion dollars worldwide. After finally having watched it, I must say that it is arguably their most epic and rad flick they have made thus far.<br/><br/>The main storyline revolves around Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry, who is the heir to the underwater kingdom called Atlantis. However, he is destined to step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world. From that premise alone, the film has a very predictable narrative, and its not hard to figure out what happens throughout the runtime. In addition, the film has a rather pointless subplot centering on Black Manta seeking revenge towards Aquaman, and it barely has much connection to the progression of the film as a whole. Also, many of the other characters are two-dimensional at best, Arthur's relationship with Meta lacks the proper chemistry needed for a romantic arch, and the film may really didn't need to be nearly 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>However, where the film may lack in originality, it more than ever makes up with a huge epic scale and some amazing action. It really feels as if director James Wan was having a field day with all the different set pieces the film displays. From the underwater regions, to the vast Sahara desert, to the coastal villages of Italy and more, the overall scope of the film really creates the feeling that were are viewing an epic globetrotting adventure. Not to mention, the CGI is highly imaginative and the vast amount of creature designs are enough to inspire plenty of animators and visual effects artists. All these different areas and monsters the film plays around with make me feel like I'm experiencing something out of this world, something that even some of the best superhero movies don't offer.<br/><br/>Now admittedly, the film does feature unnecessary slow mo angles like the former DC films, but at least they don't rely on it. Also, most of the acting is relatively good, even down to Jason Mamoa seemingly having fun with his character. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman are serviceable enough, whereas the likes of Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren seem like they're underacting, and even the younger actors playing past forms of Aquaman come off as laughably bad. More often than not, trying to act bold and stoic doesn't really lead to an appropriately convincing performance, but then again, this movie isn't even about Oscar worthy performances. If anything, that Oscar goes to the catchy and upbeat rendition of Africa by Pitbull.<br/><br/>Never in my life would I think I'd be enjoying a movie from this franchise solely out of its production values and creativity than the actual story. Despite its cliched storyline and hit or miss characters, Aquaman might be the most entertaining DCEU venture next to Shazam, although this one is more entertaining from how nutty it all is. Where Shazam was amusing and fun intentionally, this film creates such a crazy world of its own that it might as well be in the history books of biggest blockbuster superhero hits. Even if you're not a DC fan, I would actually recommend this movie due to the epic scope and highly imaginative visual aesthetic. It may be more brawn than brains, but as pure campy popcorn delight, you won't be disappointed at all."

I saw this film and it's just okay. It's not very good and it's not very bad. The things I liked about it:<br/><br/>Black Manta: One of the only DCEU archenemy villains that they get right. I love the improvements on his suit design and how tough and intimidating he was. The lasers that shot out of his eyes were very cool.<br/><br/>Mera: Even though Amber Heard is not a redhead, she still was a good leading lady role, and I wonder why movies like this in the DCEU have better love interest roles than Man of Steel (And Superman's my favorite DC Hero!!)<br/><br/>The things I disliked:<br/><br/>Black Manta: I liked Manta, but some of him seemed like a Killmonger knock off. With the story of his dad and his vendetta against Aquaman. Also, the fact that he wasn't the main villain was a disappointment. He only had 19 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The Humor: I believe it was a worthy thing for them to try and brighten up the DCEU with humor, but when you think about the universe that these movies exist in, it seems sudden and out of place.<br/><br/>That being said, it's definitely not a movie I would buy on blu-ray, but it's a better entry in the DC Extended Universe. I'll give Warner Bros. that."
"Dello_","5","0","2","27 May 2019"," Puddleman is surprisingly entertaining
","Director James Wan intended this film to be an high level superhero movie, one who could re-establish DC status as far as movies. It can be seen by his camera movements, forcedly ingenious that felt like he wanted to show how good he is as a director. The problem is that this feeling is not received, with numerous scenes that were annoying to watch and one in particular where the camera is moving excessively fast where I felt a bit of nausea. The direction was not all bad, indeed at the beginning of the third act there is a really beautiful scene, that shows Wan's history in the horror genere.
Another bad aspect of this movie was the CGI. The underwater setting was way distant to seem a bit realistic, with a lot of light effects so artificial that were disturbing to watch in a 2019 movie.
Also the plot was not that good, very linear, with some plot holes but in the grand scheme of the film it could have been acceptable if not for a narrative pattern overused. There are like 5 or 6 scene where the screenwriters didn't know how to start the action and so they decided to interrupt the dialogue between two or more characters with an explosion. The first time is ok, the second time you can accept it but when the third happens before the 40 minutes mark it's not good. Also the lenght was a bit excessive like a half an hour could be speared.
But why didn't I give Aquaman a terrible rating (less than 5)? Because at the end of the day it is an enjoyable film, with some big big problems but that entertains. Yes you will probably feel that some things are not working but you won't leave the cinema in pain.
In the end Aquaman is formally a bad movie but it has the rare power of entertaining, obviously not on an high level but it's not a poor experience."

","This was a good and entertaining superhero movie, but that's all there is. I prefer DC when I read comics, but I think they have a lot to work with when it comes to movies. DC are taking the right direction with their movies though. After Superman v Batman and Justice League, I think they've learned a lot and are starting to make there solo movies to maybe make something greater later in their universe.<br/><br/>Back to this movie. I think the writing of the conversations are a bit poor. I'm no filmmaker, but I really got so little from Arthur/Aquaman in this movie. His lines was so short. I wish we could see more character development (event though this was a origin movie).<br/><br/>I also think there was a lot of cliche moments, which I feel is typical DC to do. The bullying part and the kissing in the middle of the battle to mention some.<br/><br/>Lastly I think the CGI was too much. I know this is under water, but if Marvel manage to make good Thor and Guardians movies with great CGI, DC can do it to. The CGI in this movie kind of reminded me of JL, which was reeaally bad.<br/><br/>As I said, I feel like DC is on the right way, but still a lot to work with when it comes to writing and CGI. I haven't seen Shazam yet, but so far I've heard only good things about it, so maybe DC have learned!"
"StoryTaker1","7","0","5","3 May 2019"," Worth watching despite knowing Aquaman's origin story
","Summary: A fresh and entertaining take on Aquaman's origin story. Not as great as Wonder Woman and has its flaws, but that doesn't stop this movie from being a great action-packed adventure-entertainer that shouldn't be missed.
--------------------------------------------
I put off watching this movie because I have already watched Aquaman's (AQ) origin story, perhaps more than once, through DC's animated series/movies. I am glad I tried this one anyway since this movie breathes fresh air into the characters and story, and kept me captivated throughout even if it wasn't entirely perfect.<br/><br/>The movie was generally quite well paced with the very first action scene getting me hooked into the story while also showcasing the power and glory of Atlantis. I liked Momoa's portrayal of AQ which is quite impressive and liked that the humour aspect wasn't overused unlike in some Marvel movies. I liked that Mera gets to play an important role and was with Aquaman every step of the way. I was worried if Amber Heard could handle such as important character, but she did.<br/><br/>I also like how Atlantis was crafted so beautifully for this movie, the special effects, the fight scenes, the sheer scope of everything etc. Orm didn't get to do much this movie, but I like that there are hints of more character depth to him. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him and his motivations - how losing his mother, feeling she betrayed him and then losing both his fiance and kingdom to the firstborn she seems to prefer etc drives him.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was Manta Ray. His scenes just didn't work, because the actor couldn't act to save his life. He came across as childish and petulant and like a joke. Hope he gets recast. The arc of AQ where he grows to regret not saving his father also fell flat - everything seemed too random. I also didn't like that a lot of the plot felt like a video-game, complete with quests for the hero - even a lot of the dialogue sounded too direct, simplistic and hollow.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great action-packed and fun adventure entertainer that has to be watched despite its flaws."

salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep. for all its sporadic wackiness and wonder , on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they have given it a heroic shake. I liked the mum that came out of this movie very much. I think that's a good movie."

","No-one could safely complain about this movie. It's got everything. It's got a tidal wave, it's got vicious sharks, it's got as much colour underwater as Avatar's forests have luminescence at night, it's got as much action as two Bond movies and fantastic fight scene bashes, it has endless fantastical locations underwater and awesome scenic locations on land, it has better beasts than Harry Potter, and it has better submarines than Extraordinary Gentlemen. Quiet moments are rare, and in any case poignant. The water graphics are amazing, and often tasteful. I really don't understand critics who deride this work as too over the top. Over the top is the job of movies and the wonder of our age. If too much cgi bothers you, you should pay for a theatre ticket instead. What a relief this movie is, I can't thank it enough for being all in. A wondrous experience. This is the sort of movie that easily sustains itself for over two jaw-dropping hours. Punters should try to see it on the best quality, largest HD digital screen possible, preferably on Ultra 4D Blu-Ray. Buckle up."

Super muscular fins for legs would have been more understandable, then when they're out of water they develop legs and vice versa. Kind of like the Little Mermaid. Forthly, using ocean dwelling creatures that already exist in nature instead of some far fetched crazy creation would have grounded the story more and made it seem plausible. The laser weapons just have to go. Again, let's keep it traditional to what they actually have available from nature to use.

","Aquaman is a super hero movie based in the DC comics, the production of the movie started getting in production at late November 2016. As cast members we have: Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Amber Heard as Y' Mera Xebella ""Meraa"", Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Patrick Wilson as the Ocean Master, and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. This is an action movie and is basically directed to ages of sixteen and on because it has strong language and scenes, but some fans are very young age and the best option is going with their parents. Some part of the audience thinks this movie was not as how it supposed to be like in the comics and some other part of the audience thinks that this movie was one of the best made about this character. This movie showed a lot of good special effects and action considered that it is a super hero movie and some type of fight scene should happen, it was well do it under water where is all about. This is a movie that at first you will think twice to watch if you are not a fan of superhero movies but when the movie begins this attached feeling to the movie will come immediately and the movie will be well enjoyed. In general, the movie was really good with good special effects, good fighting scenes, great music, and very good acting especially form the main character Aquaman who in my perspective it was the best from all the cast. The main actor, Jason Momoa made a really good job giving live to this character and I think the audience who really loves this comic will be pleased with his work. Overall the movie was really good personally I am not a big fan of super heroes movies but this one deserves a try, in my opinion I would give this movie a 8.5/10, if you have not seen it then you should watch it and enjoy the 2 hours of movie time."

","To this day, the best movie DCEU has provided it is still Wonder Woman. Aquaman falls into a second place, it is mainly a decent film with several flaws. I can't get over the fact of how dreadful the CGI is. I mean, I can understand that in the DCU's first movie they may not get it right, but after several releases and millions of viewers complaining about that same aspect, why wouldn't they try to improve it? Aquaman fails to deliver a believable proportion of action and visual effects, in terms of how realistically they should go together. Black Manta was such a weak rival, poorly acted, unlike the rest of the cast whom I thought did a pretty good job. Jason Momoa is fantastic as the titular character; Amber Heard and WIlliam Dafoe properly delivered Mera and Vulko; Nicole Kidman was fairly good in her portrayal of Atlanna; and Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal task in giving life to King Orm. Some visuals were cool, some of the music was not (Pitbull); the scene in Italy was fantastic, I had a blast watching that.<br/><br/>I am almost certain that if the CGI had been great, it would have changed my vision regarding the picture as a whole, but to me it was entertaining nonetheless. The cast is what does it for me, the story could have been a lot better, or it could have been executed in a more non-generic fashion. I have to give it to Jason Momoa, from the moment he was cast we all knew he had a difficult task in playing a superhero that has been a laughing stock for decades, and yet he made Aquaman cool for nearly everyone! Although, the Arthur Curry from the DC Animated Universe is badass as well. Decent effort from DCEU, but I expect much more, as I'm sure many other fans do too."

","The fact that DC pulled this movie after Justice League debacle is a dismay to many. In my opinion, they have always made better solo movies compared to marvel at this stage. Mos and BvS may be a critical failure but they were true classics which only an ardent DC lover can understand. Not to disrespect others opinions, but the criticism received by these movies was just unfair and whats more appalling is the common complaint of movie being too dark. These movies are made and meant to be dark which most of the critics berated and lost the whole plot.<br/><br/>Aquaman made over a billion dollar and is the DC's highest grossing movie which shattered many other records during its leggy run. The fact that movie was such a huge box office success after JL is a huge relief to the fans and the production house. This success is imperative to DCEU and it's future installments.<br/><br/>Coming to the movie, Aquaman has right amalgamation of story, visuals and action sequences. Out of these departments, VFX has been top notch that one would feel wet after coming out of the 3D Imax screens. It is synonymous to Avatar in terms of the graphics and one of the mainstay for the film's success. Furthermore, the trench sequence under the sea is a visual spectacle and major highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Story wise movie is well balanced and predictable at times but overall it is decent story line that sets up perfectly for the sequel which is expected to start soon. The actors played their part well, especially Jason Mamoa charisma is a huge benefactor for the film's wide reach across the globe that later turned into box office numbers.<br/><br/>Finally, Aquaman is legitimate movie which can't be juxtaposed to any other superhero movie as there no such similar made till now. Although, the movie won't blow your mind but gives a refreshing feeling with astonishing visuals which can't be missed in theatres.<br/><br/>Comic Book Wise - 10/10

When his half-brother Orm unveils a scheme to declare war on the surface, Arthur has no choice but to reclaim his birthright if he wishes to protect those he loves. Latest addition to the DCEU is chock-full of conventional elements like action, globe-trotting adventure, romance, and cheeky humor (much of which you can see coming a mile away) yet somehow still manages to be engaging thanks to effective casting, a spectacular view of the aquatic world, and a good decision by director Wan to never take things too seriously. Glib, brawny Momoa is perfectly cast, and there's also good supporting roles for Heard as the obligatory love interest, and Dafoe as the traditionalist mentor.

It's hard to do an underwater world that doesn't look cheesy, so I think the filmmakers have done the best I've seen so far with the underwater scenes. The storyline is somewhat linear, as all the movies based on comic books are that I have seen. I was entertained the entire movie, thought the battle scenes were very well done, and found the characters interesting.<br/><br/>The development of the love story between Mera and Aquaman is simple and predictable, but it's based on a comic book, what do you expect?

Easily the worst dialogue of 2018 but also a contender for best artistic vision. Worth watching but only barely.<br/><br/>
Visually excellent, Wan's direction clearly focuses on Momoa outshining the other characters, which he certaintly does, and individual artists being given liberty to amaze the audience with stunning details. With set pieces spanning multiple genres and a rather broad scope on Atlantean culture, DC almost makes this film above average but fails in almost every other category aside from these few specific areas.<br/><br/>Part of what makes DC comics and animated features so great is their willingness to not oversimplify complex themes. Ocean Master is a phenomenal and complex character but the writers in this film made him a one-dimensional stereotype. This pattern is repeated across nearly every character as each speaks exactly what is expected and nothing more. Momoa is the slight exception to this as he brings humanity (lol pun) to the derivative atlantean dialogue. This decision was clearly taken out of fear that creating multiple complex, logical characters would overcomplicate the plot and ruin the experience for the lowest common denominator. Whether or not this is a positive is up for debate but with such depth in source material, I personally believe we should hold DC films to higher standards.<br/><br/>Is it awful? No, but it does have very poor execution in a few areas which are highlighted by excellence in other areas. It is my sincere hope that future DCEU releases focus on character depth primarily and visual artistry secondarily. Without a change soon, the opportunity to rival marvel may be gone and the complex characters we love will be confined to the small screen permanently."

","For a long time DC has produced movies that are quite enjoyable, deliver stable intake of action but don't dwell too hard on the scenario. Kind of a quick bite to fight the hunger before the feast that is cooking behind the kitchen door. After giving the trailer a look I thought 'Aquaman' was going to be a bit different and has a potential to stir that stiff dark matter that we call a universe.<br/><br/>Fairly enough we can call it an origin story but the character has been on our radar before, which means that the basic knowledge is there and we don't need a fundamental course. I really like Arthur simply because he is down-to-earth guy: not nerdy as Barry Allen, not pompous as Bruce Wayne, not inconspicuous as Clark Kent, kind of like Diana Prince but male and for sure not metal as Victor Stone.<br/><br/>Will not hide anything from you by saying that in the end the plot as usual goes down the drain and as always, we can observe some particles of good ideas getting stuck on the exit. 2h23m was the amount of actual time, although if we take out all the slow motion and sugaring of viewers' eyes with abnormal amount of visuals we are left with a common 1h30m or even less.<br/><br/>The most confusing and disgusting point of the movie was the build-up of the villain that has never been finished, which can only mean the path for a sequel, and on this the curse of abruptly cut stories continues. A lot of actions that should have borne major consequences were just forgotten and walked on by like a beggar on the street.<br/><br/>You know what they say: each Hollywood project has two wolves - Visuals and Story, the one that you feed most eats another - here we have the first one already gnawing the latter but the poor thing has a few breaths left. Going back to the conclusions I would say that Jason Momoa has been training all his life and is worthy wielding the Trident, however, as the rule says - if it's not planned as a one-man movie then it cannot be carried like that. I hope DC will understand it and put a little bit more effort next time."

You'll miss out on something very important part way into the credits. I'll give this an extra 1/2 star for the humor in this film, which many superhero films lack."

","(spoilers) The editing and sequencing and sometimes the dialog need help. Director Wan forgets any introductions, and goes for non-sequential development.. What follows is a mess for the first 30 min or so. The story gets some traction about the time Atlantis is wonderfully introduced; the visuals help us forget the shortfalls and problems with dialog, direction, and acting. Music soundtrack as pop-synths work well, but some of the contemporary soundtracks fall-flat. Jason Momoa's hang-loose mentality seems at first out-of-place and too loose, but we acclimate to it. Amber Heard is passable, and probably could've been done better by someone else. The movie is certainly like a live-action cartoon, and though sinks initially holds on to its grandiose bravado enough to become entertaining with the help of an underwater mishmash of medieval and scifi that works . 7/10 -- better than expected."

My favorite part of the movie was the reaction of the underwater life at the aquarium when Arthur was threatened, it was heartwarming and showed the great power that he was capable of. My biggest disappointment was that we didn't get a chance to see enough of the black manta, other than that this was definitely the best DC movie to date (calm down wonder woman fans, just my opinion).

","Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is told that he is the only one who can bring the two worlds of land and sea together and he must do it as King. Arthur says he is no king and has no desire to be so. Princess Mera (Amber Heard) tells him he must do this because his half brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson) says it's time for the sea to claim the land and scorch the whole Earth. The only way Aquaman can do all this is with the Trident that the first King of Atlantis used and is most powerful. Aquaman believes the Trident is fiction. In time, Aquaman agrees to this mission, but first he must beat David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who wants revenge on Aquaman because he killed his father Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) in the submarine when they as pirates tried to overtake the sub.<br/><br/>The story opens with Arthur's father Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) who finds an unconscious Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), who is the Queen of Atlantis and they fall in love and they have Arthur in time. She leaves him to protect Arthur and she must return to Atlantis to save him. She vows to return to Thomas.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie has Aquaman and Mera going here and there worldwide looking for clues to where the Trident is. He does have a battle with his half brother, King Orm, but Mera helps him escape.<br/><br/>The CGI is absolutely unbelievable and you'd swear you are seeing things for real. Yes, some of the CGI scenes do go on for a little too long, but they are mesmerizing and really, really good. And Director James Wan must be given tons of kudos for this absolutely great production. He may get an Oscar for his work. The acting all around is spot on. The cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>Notables: Willam Dafoe as Vulko a counselor to the King of Atlantis and he claims to know where the Trident is; Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus who King Orm wants an alliance with; Amber Heard as Princess Mera is also the daughter of King Nereus; Kaan Guldur as 9-yr old Arthur and the big shark in the aquarium sees Mike (Jack Andrew) bully Arthur and bangs against the glass enclosure until Arthur puts his hands up to tell the shark to stop; Otis Dhanji as 13-yr old Arthur being taught Warrior techniques by Vulko; Julie Andrews as Karathan the Voice of a giant monster that guards the Trident and tells Arthur that only the real king can extract the Trident.<br/><br/>I did not recognize Nicole Kidman when she first appeared as Queen Atlanna as she has this amazing ability to transform herself into a more beautiful woman. Kudos. The music is excellent. Watch carefully and you will see an Octopus on the many drums. Ha!<br/><br/>When the credits run the first time, stay and you will see that David Kane (from the sub, remember?) is still alive and wants to know who Aquaman is and this will lead us into sequels. Ready? I am. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes, at times. Language: Two S-words

"agferguson-43117","8","0","1","26 March 2019"," Great value for money
","I've been big fan of Aquaman ever since I started reading about his adventures in DC Comics (hah, Adventure Comics) when I was a very young kid. I grew up on an island where the ocean was the centre of my universe, its all I knew, so reading stories about heroes fighting crime in these large concrete jungles in parts of the world I'd never visited was completely alien to me. You're basically telling me tales of people living on the moon, and I couldn't relate to that. But, heroes that fought crime in the ocean? That was literally my backyard and something that my young mind could wrap its head around.<br/><br/>The other part of the story that resonated with me was Arthur's bi-racial and bi-cultural background. He had a foot in both worlds, but was treated like an outsider by each one. That was also a feature of my childhood, growing up as a minority on an island without much of a tie to the culture of the majority.<br/><br/>So, Aquaman was my guy.<br/><br/>The thing that impressed me the most about the film was the ambitiousness of the filmmakers. They didn't hold back at all when making this movie. Given the underperformance and tepid reception of the DCU films to date (with the exception of Wonder Woman), it's reasonable to expect that the studio would have scaled back the production budget and made a smaller film to reduce their risk and ensure that it turned a profit. But, they didn't. They fully committed to the project and it shows; this is a very expensive looking movie.<br/><br/>The other thing that impressed me was how closely the film sticks to the source material. Based upon the rebooted DC Comics New 52 series from the creative team of Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis and Paul Pelletier, they changed very little from the book. Inculcating Jason's Hawaiian heritage into the role of Arthur Curry and changing the sequence of events around Atlanna's time spent on the surface world with Tom Curry (which is cleaner and works better than the comic book) are the only deviations, the rest is exactly like the source material.<br/><br/>In this day and age where they're trying to generate broad appeal amongst an audience that has a casual relationship with the character and his world, that's no small feat.<br/><br/>The filmmakers also give us the viewing audience an extensive look at Aquaman's universe, taking us from his birthplace in Amnesty Bay to Atlantis and then on to all (or most) of the remaining undersea kingdoms all while introducing us to the main characters from those places. This could have easily caused the film to feel overstuffed, but it doesn't. It really felt like world building, which is something that Marvel has done very well with the MCU, and that allows them to tell stories beyond the typical origin stories going forward. I think this is really important for the ongoing viability of the character because not a lot of people are familiar with him and his universe.<br/><br/>All that said, it is a bit of a silly movie, but in a good way. At no point during the film did I find it hard to suspend my disbelief. It wasn't trying to be anything other than what it is; a big, bombastic summer blockbuster tentpole movie. You're not going to find Shakespeare here, but you will find a superhero fantasy film with a little Greek mythology, Lord of The Rings, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and a smattering of horror elements. It blends together seamlessly and creates something unique amongst the superhero genre, not to mention unique amongst the typical origin story we've seen many times.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie is fun and engaging, visually stunning with great action sequences supported by a compelling enough story without leaning too heavily on comic book tropes, all while staying very faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>This is for me the best DCU movie to date and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next installment with James Wan at the helm."

","The visual effects of this movie shocked me.
Generally speaking, a movie with a visual special effects theme can always make me look forward to it, such as Frozen, How to Train your Dragon, the ice and sky from the beginning to the end, how to do it in the same material but with a colorful change?It is a test of the skill of the production team.
One of the scenes that I felt particularly stunning was that the male and female protagonists encountered many monsters in the trench kingdom. When they jumped out of the sea and broke through the monsters, the feeling from a cross-sectional perspective was really wonderful! The people who are intensively phobia will surely feel Uncomfortable and pleasant. Anyway, this scene is the main reason why I admire the visual effect of this movie.
In addition, the female characters in this movie are very cute. Whether it is the mother of the main actor or the main actress afterwards, their interaction with the human world is really innocent and cute. You can see that they really can't hate humans, which is why there may be a way to make the land and the sea people live in peace."

","Interviewer: Our next film I would like to ask you about is Aquaman...<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: Dude! Holy wow. I mean no disrespect when I say this but Aquaman is the most fun movie to come out of DC/WB.<br/><br/>Interviewer: Can you elaborate on that?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: Wonder Woman is fantastic. I love that film. Gal Gadot is Diana/Wonder Woman to a T. The film has a decent story, great emotional beats, and some fun action sequences. There are comedic elements and it so cool to watch. It does so much for actress, female-led superhero movies and I don't want to compare them at all. Aquaman is a bananas fun fantasy ride, that us DC Comics fans have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Interviewer: So you take DC over Marvel?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: If you were to put me on the spot I would easily take DC over Marvel only because DC has my favorite comic book character of all time, Superman. Let me explain Aquaman. I'm not a huge of the character. He's not one of my favorites. But when we finally got to see him serious in the comics and animated films, it did the character justice. (No pun intended) Jason Momoa's take is a bit different but equally as cool and confident. He's not just a man who can talk to fish. He's a bridge between worlds. He's this powerful being who's also a total badass. He's having so much fun being this character is drips off-screen. I can't wait to see more of him. And I hope we get to see more of him interacting with other DC superheroes. One day I'll explain my love of the Justice League movie.<br/><br/>Interviewer: Can you give us some of the plot details for those who haven't been following the story?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: It's actually pretty simple. Arthur Curry, Aquaman, is half human half Atlantian. His mother fell in love with a human and they had him. His half brother Orm, hates him and the land dwellers, they declare war on the land from the sea. In order to save his world and all of the world, Aquaman has to team up soon to be queen Mira (Amber Heard) to prove to Atlantis that he is the one true king. One the way he makes enemies of a train pirate who goes by Black Manta. The film jumps all over the world in a fun fantasy adventure with elements of Indiana Jones, The Fifth Element and even some old school monster movies.<br/><br/>Interviewer: Much as been said about the cast, how are they in this film?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: As I said earlier, Momoa is excellent as the Aquaman and easily carries the film whenever he's on screen. Amber Heard is very good as Mira. She's not the helpless damsel in distress. She's a soon to be a queen that cares about her people, her land and is just as capable of kick-ass as Aquaman. The filmmakers did her well. Patrick Wilson as Orm is okay, you get his ideology. He likes to chew scenery and is very over the top in his portrayal but it fits the film he's in. Willem Dafoe is the excellent mentor role, bring his talents to the character. The scene stealer of the film is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta. He effectively in what screen time he has to give DC film fans the best villain they've had in all of the DC live action films. His character has weight, style and a personal attachment/grudge with Aquaman. It gives him more depth than most superhero villains get to have. I can't wait to see more of him.<br/><br/>Interviewer: This is a big action film, how are the action sequences and direction?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: I'm not saying this as hyperbole, James Wan is the best action director working today. He has a few other directors on his heels but I would place him at the time. The action scenes in this film are wild. They are so well shot, so much fun and pretty crazy. He doesn't put himself in a box. He goes for broke and they all shine when happening. There's an opening sequence with Nicole Kidman's Atlanna (who she is great in this) that looks to be filmed in one take. It's jaw-dropping. The film uses neon colors and sets to express this is a fantasy world and it pops. This is a trippy watch but so enjoyable. Wan even gets to go back to his roots with one sequence that is very horror inspired. It's probably my favorite scene in the movie. It's violent, kind of terrifying and feeds into my need for Wan to make a monster movie.
Interviewer: Any final thoughts about Aquaman?<br/><br/>JohnnyPHreak: James Wan has created a wonderfully rich and deep universe here with his first superhero entry Aquaman. The whole cast is great with Momoa, Heard, and Abdul-Mateen II being the standouts. The film looks beautiful, including a bunch of sequences shot in IMAX. The action is wild, easy to watch and just fun. The story is not that deep but it spans all over the world. It has the best elements of Indiana Jones with none of the Crystal Skull. All fans of DC should have seen this on the big screen because it's worth the price of admission. But if they couldn't see it in 4K because the transfer is gorgeous. Aquaman was one of my favorite films of 2018 and is now tied for my second favorite DC Comic live action film."

"FelipeCarrillo","8","0","2","22 March 2019"," Epic, mythological CGI mega-spectacle blending ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" one for the ages
","""Aquaman"" is a stunning miracle; the most visually oddball and mesmerizing big-budget superhero film the world has ever seen. Do not misunderstand me, the Arthur Curry solo film is far from perfect, it presents an origin, born-to-be-king story, rhythmically goes from dynamite to languor and storytelling-wise is whimsical and silly dealing with Greek mythology, but that bravery and audacity, coming from a huge budget and an amazing source material, are what makes it an experience as dangerously unconventional as imperfectly extraordinary.<br/><br/>It's no secret that the DC Extended Universe went from bad to worse within American comic book film landscape; diabolically histrionic, unnecessarily drawn-out, fiercely dark, overly serious; whatever the dilemma may be, Walter Hamada, the new president of DC-based film production after legends Geoff Johns and Jon Berg stepped down in early 2018, had to move quickly and wisely his cards after ""Justice League""'s inglorious financial outcome and poorly critics' response.<br/><br/>An angel from heaven, ""Wonder Woman"" opened at the very right time - #MeToo and #Time's Up, - displayed a powerful war tale of exquisite female empowerment aided by Patty Jenkins' unflinching direction, introduced the only superheroine portrayed on the big screen so far through Gal Gadot' astonishing performance and let free a fictional universe as feminist and uplifting as promising with a few drops of fish-out-of-water humor that put the subsidiary of Warner in competition again. Clearing their minds and knowing what to do and what not to do as for the kind of movie audiences want to see, they left a bunch of projects behind, rewrote some scripts and gave the go-ahead to ideas discussed for a very long time. Among the category of polished and slightly modified scripts, with special emphasis on comedy, was its latest, most risky and pleasant Hollywood chaos.<br/><br/>If ""Wonder Woman"" was somewhat like a Spider-Man for DC, Arthur Curry would oddly be a colorful hybrid with DNA from Tony Stark, Thor and Star-Lord. The King of the Seven Seas has chances to become the most outstanding, fascinating and exotic superhero of the whole combo out there. Momoa gives his role a dominant macho vibe and look, as well as silliness and sarcastic humor that provide much of the funny and not-so-funny jokes spread throughout the feature film. His acting range and rancidity in each of his scenes are the reason why he's so special, so unique, so emotionally relatable and flat-out politically correct.<br/><br/>Bigger-sized muscles, two antagonists, responsibility, legacy, kingship, splendid chases, and hand-to-hand combats, we've seen this before, haven't we? - cough, ""Black Panther,"" cough. - But as Ryan Coogler diligently proposed to make a stand against racism, politics, Hollywood's diversity and some other highly important social matters, Wan loosens up and never takes the material too seriously; it's simple: a silly, funny, over-the-top fantasy actioner with two specific purposes on its mind: a message of solving your problems peacefully and an act of redemption for DC; its fuzzy proceedings are what makes it so enjoyable, so strangely magnetic and carefreely brilliant.<br/><br/>
""Aquaman"" is a bona fide rara avis, and one of the big ones. Auteurs entrusted with a nine-digit budget to make an original screenplay a reality- Mr. Christopher Nolan - can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Fewer filmmakers get such whopping sums of money to pull off a bizarre comic book adaptation, which is under the eye of a whole company; judgments, visions and worldwide expectations included. After a hurtful slate of bad decisions and critical misfires, DC changed its mind and left its unexpectedly successful billion-dollar baby to one of the most qualified, professional and creative artists working today in the industry.<br/><br/>James Wan is a filmmaker for the ages. Visionary, maestro of horror and action, creator and owner of the most profitable, breathtaking and poignant entry in ""Fast & Furious"" franchise yet and king of mainstream contemporary horror at the expense of his 2013 vintage masterpiece/hit, a billion-dollar IP from which spin-offs, prequels, and sequels emanate. These endless victories are the reason why the Malay is now Warner's spoiled child, which was more than enough to entrust him one of the riskiest, most crucial projects for the future of DC.<br/><br/>His kinetic and idiosyncratic style for action is high and low from stem to stern. Fight sequences are provocative, diligent, straight out of the wildest video game. The filmmaker also finds time to experiment and toy with settings, nearly masterful camera movements and angles, with explosive 90/180-degree rotations he previously tested in the Hobbs vs Shaw hand-to-hand combat in ""Furious 7"" and then F. Gary Gray in the prison escape in ""The Fate of the Furious."" The camera savagely runs at the audience, endowing dynamism and thrill in large part by the uber-excellent technical, artful features of a couple of incredibly and masterfully executed sequences that might be easily part of the annals of this postmodern genre.<br/><br/>Despite CG-overstuffed, even in scenes perfectly filmable in real locations, the film does not limit its creative faculties. We all agree that CGI is everywhere and at all times, which might constantly divert attention from the flick's narrative purpose. Its aesthetics and visual fearlessness, however, make pictures an alluring spectacle propelled by truly great VFX. So far, far away from the gigantic old-fashioned set-pieces of modern Hollywood masterpieces as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"" and yet the film's an artificial delight. By taking place mostly underwater, it was to be expected that even with the enthusiasm and commitment of the crew, it needed to be conceived or at least rendered digitally. Wan and his team created an entirely unique aquatic world for us, certainly embellished by Don Burgess, which is over-the-top, dazzling and exciting, absorbent and carefully designed, is pure visual ecstasy crowded with creatures, altered animals, Atlantic beasts and, why not, an octopus playing the drums. There is time for natural, majestic landscapes as well, such as a beautiful Italian village, the stunning Sahara desert or the claustrophobic Trench. Portraying the fantasy-tinged Greek mythology from the comics sounds heavy, but it pulls it off fabulously with inventiveness and audacity unusual in big-budget cinema. In the end, it's appreciated that this extremely gorgeous world, harmonized by the high-sounding techno-compositions of an unbeatable Rupert Gregson-Williams, is not only a reflection of the cinema of our time, but a reminder of the magnificence sound and image can achieve.<br/><br/>Kidman nails it as Atlanna, a kind of character not entirely foreign to her if you take a look at the prolific career of the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" actress. After the ten-minute prologue and a surprise appearance amid the story, she does have no time on screen. Still and all, her interpretative balance between fish-out-of-water humor and family drama puts her in a strange yet brilliant position; a golden gift for the genre. Played by Amber Heard, Mera's design is literally and figuratively sparkling; she's the one who leads a couple of commendable sequences that breathe #MeToo. Willem Dafoe as Vulko embraces ambiguity, having fun in a simple, smaller role that doesn't seem to agree with his previous efforts, especially keeping in mind that after the eccentric characters he delivered to the genre, the actor has focused on more serious, raw roles in outstanding dramas by Sean Baker and Julian Schnabel. Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, King Orm and Manta respectively, wrongly take turns for being the bad guy. It's hard to tell who and where is the real villain here, whether in the ambition of the former or the anger-driven vengeance of the latter. They both try their best, but the material does not help them at all.<br/><br/>""Aquaman"" by horror mastermind James Wan is a cinematic oddity; it has an irregular pace, speaks louder than it should, ergo runs longer than it should, but even so, Arthur Curry's first solo adventure is the most playful, hilarious, rewarding and profitable comic book adaptation you will find in the troubled DC Cinematic Universe to date. Even if my voice is shaking, I dare say it is the most eye-catching, wildly stunning sci-fi show I have seen into a big-impact Hollywood production since James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" visually speaking. To make your life easier, ""Aquaman"" could be synthesized like this: ""Black Panther"" and ""Star Wars"" meet ""Avatar"" and ""Jupiter Ascending,"" and these, in turn, bump into ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" energized by a kinetic video game vibe and an unhealthy dose of toxic masculinity and sheer spectacle."
"margulanabutrlov","9","0","2","22 March 2019"," Aquaman Review
","Arthur Curry's (Jason Momoa) parents are a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and Atlantean queen (Nicole Kidman). When a war between the subsurface world of Atlantis and its ruler Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens the human world, Curry must confront his past to save the day.
Imagine if someone cut together all the biggest action sequences from the last few decades of Hollywood, resulting in a mash of Tron, Avatar, Clash Of The Titans, Superman, Jurassic Park, and Gladiator. Imagine a film where an octopus gets a drum solo, and it isn't among the top ten weirdest moments. Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either.
Our lead is Aquaman/Arthur Curry, a portrait of the superhero as bar-brawler. This sometime Justice Leaguer (it's barely mentioned) is larger than life and twice as fond of a beer. Arthur gives the impression Momoa just rolled out of bed, went surfing and drove from the beach straight to set, and the film's all the better for his slightly hungover air. But instead we cut away to endless Atlantean politicking, with Patrick Wilson's CGI-suited Orm floating around on a war-shark (which is a thing?), working on his Julian Sands impression. Orm wants a war with humanity, so executes a false-flag submarine attack. That might lead another hero on a film-long quest to prove humanity's innocence, but here it's barely mentioned again; nor is a first-act tsunami felt around the world. There are bigger, er, fish to fry.
Instead we're on two parallel but equally bonkers quests. Orm must unite his kingdom of Atlantis with Dolph Lundgren's seahorse riders, Djimon Hounsou's mer-men and John Rhys-Davies' crab dudes. Meanwhile, Arthur must escape a place, and decipher a thing to find another thing in order to earn the throne and stop the war. His primarily human upbringing means he's a fish out of water whenever he's in the water, following the long-ago disappearance of his mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman). For guidance and a modicum of sense Arthur relies entirely on Amber Heard's Mera, a Little Mermaid cosplayer who is his main source of exposition.
The plot is honestly a mess: over-complicated yet predictable. What makes the film passably entertaining is that director James Wan throws astonishing amounts of action at the wall, and much of it sticks (though not always together). There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top, exploding in such strange ways. Just when you think you have a handle on it, something bizarre will happen. Nicole Kidman defending her baby son by taking out a death squad, say, or villain Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, underserved) inexplicably detouring to the North Sea (the film's geography is deeply non-specific), or a Star Wars-alike battle on the seabed.
Momoa takes every inch of space the film gives him and runs a mile on sheer roguish charm, and Wan is a sufficiently gifted action director not just to keep you watching but to regularly dazzle you. But it's all just so much. You sense that they didn't trust this hero to hold our attention, and they really should have done. He's more fun than any octopoid percussionist."

","Aquaman review matters- I wanted to like and enjoy this film. BUT, I agree with others here saying the plot was an overall mess of changing characterization fiascos and cliches', but feel they set 'the bar' too high. Those people are discussing films as if they are 'art' and not 'product'. That discussion has gone on for years with career professional, critics, audience and fans. It will never end. Because every opinion is backed by their own point of view and that will not be compromised. BUT, I agree that 'Aquaman' had a interesting, fun and very strong first act. That was a pleasure to see in any superhero films. It is a prerequisite for good film making. But then the rest of the film was disappointment. It became a 'Thor VS Loki"" in underwater kingdom rip off. And the extraneous & obvious audience viewing 'shiny objects' plot devices thrown in with red haired (forgettable) underwater princess, dinosaurs, trident seeking, sea monsters, and confusing multi sea kingdoms politics junk pile rehash ruined this film. Disney, Spielberg, Pirates of Caribbean, LOTR, & Game of Thrones should sue. It is very hard to know how much millions of dollars and time are spent on these to show rehash to the audience."

","I am just a movie fan . such a nice fantastic movie and full of fun . especially lovey bar scene . thx for the producers, director and the lovely cast"
"bibingraj","5","0","1","19 March 2019"," Below average...
","All these comes to point out that no matter how much money you put in a film and how much interesting character you can use from a beloved universe, if you don't set the story straight, you will KILL its potential.
DC had already messed up its film and Wonder Woman being just AVERAGE, Aquaman was seen with lot of hope. And without a doubt compared to previous DC films, it may be a better film,, but we don't lower our standards.<br/><br/>At start, though Nicole Kidman acted well and the other guy tried his best, the connection was just not there. Their reunion was like blah. Nobody cares.<br/><br/>Joke attempts were pathetic. You could pinpoint the joke long before the joke is delivered. They even added some joke sounds or something. Just pitiful.<br/><br/>And the MUSIC! Totally out of place. Just didn't feel right at all. Soundtracks accompanying many a things were just bad, pulled you out of the experience.<br/><br/>Villian generic. The sub villian whose dad died, just total waste. Could have scrapped him and developed the story well.
The chemistry between the leads Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard - NON EXISTENT. Totally forced, out of place.
You can't blame the actors because the dialogue and script was crap. They can do nothing with the crap dialogue.
You could just predict, yes this is the joke part, yes this is the caring part, romance part and all feels so stupid and manipulated.
Most unintentional hilarious scene - Goes to some place in Italy (Here the aspect ratio changes to 'bring in the romance or whatever'). She looks around in wonder and some guy gives her a bunch of roses for NO REASON (maybe he got enticed by the red hair and just blatantly obvious distracting dress) , makes some water dolphins and the kid watching it gives her a Pinocchio book. WHAT?
Everything feels plastic. No amount of light and CGI effects can mask the blandness of the whole movie. Trying to suck out emotions from audience unsuccessfully.
Just different styles mixed here and there. At times felt cinematic, other times like a badly made romcom tv, other times like a video game!
There's a scene when its nighttime and they are in the boat towards the place with the trident, and some creature things jump the ship to attack them. That whole 1-2 minutes feels like that out of a video game! The camera movement, closeups, the whole thing.<br/><br/>Ultimately the plot as a whole was not the best. But it could have been salvagable.<br/><br/>Forgettable watch.
But its not without its positives. Had some pretty cool action scenes.
Atlantis was very colourful! And thats it."

","I rate this movie using two scales. Critically and experience. Critically, this movie only gets a 2/5. But in terms of enjoyment and experience, freakin' 5/5. I know that the 5/5 is subjective because it applies only to myself and nobody else. However, this is what I think of the movie. If you're looking for a well-written, and greatly structured movie, then I wouldn't recommend this to you. But, if you want to watch an entertaining and fun movie that can keep you engaged for 2 & 1/2 hours, then you may enjoy this movie. I say that it's the 3rd best DCEU film, but most of the movies that exist (besides Wonder Woman) aren't good to begin with.<br/><br/>Now, the story was generic, the pacing was off, the dialogue was more cheesy then it needed to be. The characters don't have much personality, but rather exposition people. However, I really likeed Jason Mamoa as Aquaman. His charm kept the movie entertaining. Amber Heard actually did better than I expected, but just not anything special. Riddled with plot-holes and inconsistencies. However, thank goodness that it had the best DCEU villain so far: Ocean Master. So overall, critically, only a 2/5.<br/><br/>Now in terms of enjoyment, a 5/5. The visuals aren't perfect but they did a pretty good job with a movie that takes place underwater most of the time. The action was good (not for the underwater battles). The action scene of them in Sicily will hold up for a long time. The colours and effects were very engaging.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie was mainly about spectacle and excitement. So it really depends on what you're looking with this movie. Critically, it did not do good, which I hate. But I had a tremendously good time with it. Definitely not a 1/10 or 10/10."

Myself and the family who are by the way big fans of the marvel franchise could only watch this for about 40 minutes. Its a shame because Jason Momoa who I think is a very decend actor was let down by this very poor script. This character was much better portrayed in Justice League but then Zack Snyder directed that where Aquaman was directed by James Wan who would be better known for directing Horror movies and I think this is where he went off the rails.

There is even a random scene of him spray painting an armor. There is so much missing in the films development but they had time to film a scene with random spray painting of a random dude who will just die.
The music sounds terrible and does not fade into each other properly, it is very very random.

This movie is one hell of a ride, from start to finish.<br/><br/>Let's start with the CGI, because it is present in abundant amounts. It is very well done, but sometimes nears the point of being too much, especially towards the end. For me personally it never did cross that border, though, because of the simple reason that it has its place; it makes sense.<br/><br/>The musical score, ranging from orchestral to 80's synth is a weird mix of awesomeness. Is this a case of catching a ride on the bandwagon of what seems to work for other movies/shows? Maybe, but it works, and I'm digging it. It never goes overboard.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't take itself too serious, but still manages to stay serious enough for you too care about what happens. There's no unfunny joke every two minutes. There are some, though, which didn't bother me.<br/><br/>Usually, this type of movie features a one-dimensional plain evil villain with a simple agenda to rule the world. Well, this movie is actually no different. However, it also features a bunch of ""villains"", which aren't quite that. It's not near as black and white as you may expect.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it's simple and predictable, but the story is there. And it works. It's a superhero action movie, folks, not Hamlet.

","James Wan certainly produced a better enjoyable DC film than the previous ones in the line. But however, it fails at a number of places. Firstly, the logic didn't add up, it was plain stupid. I know you don't need logic but this was pure stupidity. Secondly, Orm didnt really feel like a villain, he was weak and pathetic. Even Steppenwolf appeared to be a more challenging one than Orm was. I had keep Manta in the main villain but lets skip that. I do feel it was a bit rushed. There was a lot of plot holes and off topic or unnecessary scenes. Not to mention it became boring and cringe, more it advanced to the end."

","I watched #aquaman the other day & it shocked me; so I watched it again yesterday to make sure it was a #bad movie & not just in my head or because of my mood. It was bad, really.
Throwing in a beautiful girl & a couple of cheap jokes does not make for a good film. No matter how hard the crew tries or how good a job does the CGI team, they don't compensate for a miserable #screenplay. Take this dialogue for example: -aquaman: ""how did you find me?"" -black manta: ""your lady friend has people who like to keep tabs on her."" Are you serious? The infamous fearsome pirate gives away such advantage just like that?! When the #villain is dumbed down, the #protagonist gets dumbed down as well. It was a great opportunity to make #Mira look smart, but the #writers were not clever enough to seize it. And this dumb person can take apart a ""prototype"" Atlantian weapon & turn it into a helmet. That very much sums up the consistency in the story.
And if the goal was to surprise the audience by revealing that his mother, the queen of Atlanta, was alive & struggling all these years, you shouldn't have mentioned her being ""sacrificed"" three times prior to her reappearance.
Additionally, whoever said the gaps in the story could be filled with #music, is gravely mistaken. The music is so loud & varied that it sometimes over-shadows even the actors & actresses performance.
Finally, the worst issue, what made me see red, is the callous use of the #Ocean'sPollution issue. The makers of this flawed film have had the audacity to take advantage of such dire problem of our time just to make more money. They have cheapened the serious concerns regarding this phenomenon.
It is better to make no film at all, than to make a wretched one based on beloved characters. The sooner you learn this, the less credibility & profits you loose. Think of all the resources wasted in the process."

","A fresh take on the DCEU is nestled somewhere between epic & camp. It's obvious that they were going for a more Marvel-like vibe and they almost succeed. Where they come short is the writing, as some scenes are so over the top that they are almost groan-inducing (like the one on the Italian island), but it seems like they almost embrace it. On that note, I liked how they tackle & try to explain all the illogical concepts from the comics before people can criticize them.<br/><br/>There are some good action set pieces, however it seems like we're just going from one to the next and the scenes in between are treated like filler. The CGI is good although very comic book like at times (which I guess is on purpose).<br/><br/>Altogether a fun romp, although a bit tiring at times.<br/><br/>6.5"

","I rarely review movies, but when I do, it is because they made an impression - either for worse or better.
I am happy to say report that this movie was of the latter category.<br/><br/>The avalanche of superhero movies being thrown at audiences in recent years has left me somewhat numb and hard to impress - a CGI spectacle alone no longer impresses the way it used to. But applied as it was here - to show us an entire new world in explicit detail - was a feat to take note of. Just wow!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has all the clichÃ©s, but it also has humor and charm in spades - and it cares about its story and characters - without taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Gotta hand it to Jason Momoa - I think he nailed it about as well as Robert Downey/Ironman. Most enjoyable character in a long time. Congratulations!<br/><br/>As for the director - I certainly hope James Wan will be back for the sequel (which should be a certainty now that the movie has done appropriately well at the box office). Outstanding job, sir!<br/><br/>The only thing that I can point my finger at, would be that the chemistry between Momoa and Heard didn't exactly throw sparks - but was merely adequate.<br/><br/>For me this was a GREAT movie - if you are looking for entertainment, look no further..."

The movie also did not stick to the comic book, as his parents were dead, or at least his mother was by the time he was King of Atlantis. The biggest mistake was casting.

He thinks his mother is dead because when he was 3 years old, she was arrested by the forces of Atlantis. Arthur is now 30 years old, and Mera, the actual princess of Atlantis has asked him to go on a quest: they must research a trident to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and the humans.<br/><br/>This is an action, adventure and fantasy movie. It was produced by DC Comics, the company who has produced Justice League. This movie is 143 minutes long, so it is extremely short for an action film.<br/><br/>About the cast, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are the funniest actors for an action film. They form an explosive and emotive duo and it was incredibly funny to follow this strange squad during the film.<br/><br/>This film is action-packed: the wars between Atlantis and the humans, the powers of Aquaman and Mera... So the visuals are terrific, that explains the budget of 160 000 000 $.<br/><br/>The score of this movie is disappointing and it doesn't correspond to the movie.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, thank you DC Comics for this magnificent film: it makes me laugh, it makes me happy, and it is entirely original and fun.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the scene when Aquaman finally meets his mother is the greatest moment of the film because it was full of emotion and very beautiful."

"ScrystaLz","Null","0","2","9 February 2019"," fun & enjoyable movie!
","I have to admit I initially had low expectations for this movie considering most of the other movies in the DCEU sucked, but I was pleasantly surprised by Aquaman! There are so many things to love about this movie, firstly the casting, I can't think of a more fitting actor to play Aquaman than Jason Momoa, he was perfect in the role, I didn't really care for Aquaman before but Jason really brought a charm to the character, he's witty, he's charming, he's humble and he's relatable, unlike other superheros, Aquaman doesn't gloat about being a hero and he was reluctant to become king of Atlantis, but he reluctantly became a hero & king because he felt he needed to in order to protect the people he loved, and not because he wanted glory, Aquaman is a very unique superhero and his personality is different to most other superheroes, now Aquaman has become 1 of my fav superheros! Love Mera too, she's strong & a hero in her own right, she's no damsel in distress, and I think Amber Heard did a good job with the character, Nicole Kidman was also good as Aquaman's mother, I also like some of the other supporting cast & characters including Willem Dafoe as Vulko and Temuera Morrison as Aquaman's father, all these characters are likable. The visual effects & CGI were stunning, I really don't understand why some of the negative reviews would say the visuals were ""horrible"" because they're not at all, the visuals were so spectacular and beautiful & top notch and so realistic, they're some of the best visuals I have ever seen in any movie, even better than the visuals in most of the MCU movies. The cinematography is also great and the transitions between the scenes flows smoothly, I enjoy the action scenes too, I also love the music especially the themesong ""Everything I need"" by Skylar Grey, it's a beautiful song. The storyline was a bit simple & straightforward but easy to follow, and while the movie did have lot of the typical superhero cheesiness & cliches, surprisingly that didn't bother me because I was so invested in the characters and the visuals & cinematography and music. Some people think Jason & Amber lacked chemistry, but I disagree, I think they still had some chemistry, they didn't have the best chemistry together, but I didn't see any awkwardness between them either. There were some very touching moments between the characters throughout the movie which got me emotional, especially the scenes between Aquaman's parents & the ending scene was really powerful & beautiful it really resonated with me.<br/><br/>Now to the negatives, well there really wasn't many flaws for me, I suppose the duration of the movie was abit too long, for such a straightforward & simple storyline, the movie definitely could've reduced its run time & I don't think it would've affected the overall storyline, almost 2.3 hours is abit too long for a superhero movie. The dialogue was a bit cheesy at times and I think some of the humor was a little forced, but I like the humor most of the time. And the villains were rather uninteresting to me, especially Black Manta, he didn't really have a big role in the movie, he was there mainly to serve a personal vendetta against Aquaman, but his role just seemed insignificant and didn't contribute much, I think the movie still would've worked without him in it. And Prince Orm aka Ocean Master, unlike most evil villains in superhero movies that are typically one dimensional and just wanted to destroy the world, Orm's motives were understandable & that made him a more complex villain, but still I didn't really care for his character much, as the main antagonist in the movie, Orm was rather weak and not hardcore enough.<br/><br/>Even with these flaws I think the positives still outweigh the negatives and it's still a fun and entertaining movie overall and visually beautiful to watch and more light-hearted than all the other DC movies I've seen, I thoroughly enjoyed Aquaman a lot from start to finish, and I would even go so far as to say that I think this is one of the better superhero movies I've ever watched! and I have watched many DC and Marvel movies over the years, I enjoyed watching Aquaman even more than most of the Marvel movies I've watched, and this is surprising to even myself because I usually prefer Marvel movies & I'm one of those people who often mocks how terrible most of the DCEU movies are. So it's surprising that I could love a DCEU movie more than I do with most Marvel movies, and yet that is exactly the case with Aquaman, this movie is a pleasant surprise for me, I initially didn't think I would like Aquaman but I ended up LOVING it and loving Jason Momoa and the other casts, this movie has become 1 of my fav superhero movies of all-time!
I give Aquaman a solid 9/10!"
"ericstevenson","8","0","2","8 February 2019"," You'd think an Aquaman movie would be bad
","This is the second best movie in the DC Cinematic Universe next to ""Wonder Woman"". I think the only character that I knew before watching the movie was Black Manta. He's actually the secondary villain as the main one is Aquaman's half brother. I admit that I can tell that the director saw the ""Thor"" movies. Even Aquaman's bulk is like Thor's. Probably this film's biggest strengths is how beautiful and colorful it is. The Earth is mostly covered in water, so it only makes sense we should have movies that take place underwater!<br/><br/>I do wish that Black Manta was in this more. It does get kind of too silly at times, especially with how they suddenly have monsters and dinosaurs randomly appear! There's still no doubt that this is a very creative film. While not as good as ""Black Panther"" or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" it's still a film people should watch if only because of how popular it is. Trust me when I say there's tons of great action and creativity everywhere! Yes, we get a nice romance story in too...but not as good as Thor's. ***"

The visuals were amazing...the illumination reminded me a lot of Avatar. This has officially made #2 on my DCEU list (Sorry Jason...Wonder Woman is still my favorite). If you are a comic book movie fan like I am...this is a solid watch."

","I believe that Aquaman is a sorry excuse for a movie and I will not change my mind. I started believing this right after the movie ended. I think that this belief is rational as the plot of a movie is extremely important and this movie has so many plot holes that it's basically swiss cheese. Nothing could change my mind; even if the movie's lack of continuity was an artistic decision to comment on movies with a lack of continuity, the movie's attempt is way too unintentional to ever pass as one. This belief is very strong (maybe unimportant) but very strong. A significant number of people agree with my belief. I would be very disappointed in the world and film experts if they rate Aquaman as a good movie."

"CabbageCustard","5","0","1","1 February 2019"," Ridiculous but surprisingly enjoyable.
","I've watched this movie twice now. After watching it the first time, I found it hard to escape the realisation of how ridiculous the whole thing is. That being said, I also found it entertaining. That was the first time though. The second time I watched it was about a month later. Viewing movies twice is often a valuable experience. Quite often you spot little things you missed the first time around, but which add to the appreciation of the film. Sadly, with Aquaman, what I spotted was the movies flaws: how really banal the dialogue is, how bad the acting is and how preposterous the plot is. I missed those 'nuances' the first time as I was bombarded by the spectacle of it all. On second viewing, even that spectacle seemed cartoonish and obviously CGI-heavy. The writer(s) hardly miss a superhero movie cliche in this story. The movie tries to take a tongue-in-cheek approach at times, but the humour is quite lame. Much of what is enjoyable about this movie can be attributed to the charisma of Jason Mamoa who plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman - the first Polynesian superhero. His Aquaman scarcely resembles the character found on television and in comic books and is, in some respects, almost an anti-hero. He's not Deadpool, but he's going in that direction. Jason Mamoa isn't a great actor. I'm not even sure he's a good actor, but he's certainly charismatic and, I guess, that's what matters most in this type of film. It also helps that this movie doesn't spend the first hour or so explaining the origins of the main character, before he is seen on the screen. Instead, his story is told in flashback form throughout the movie. Maybe that's because his back story isn't really that interesting and can be dealt with quickly, but anyway... The cast surrounding Mamoa is pretty dull and includes all the perfunctory nods to being racially inclusive. It also includes the obligatory 'big stars' playing mentoring roles to the main protagonist although Willem Dafoe's cheesy character will make you laugh or maybe grimace (though not intentionally) and Nicole Kidman will make you yawn (as usual). Julie Andrews even turns up, or at least her voice does, playing what must be one of the more unusual characters of her career.<br/><br/>Aquaman's closing credits make it obvious that this movie is set up for a sequel and IMDB reports that one is scheduled for 2022. I look forward to seeing that. It will have to be better than this<br/><br/>My conclusion? Turn your brain off, don't expect too much, and you will probably enjoy this movie - the first time. Just don't rush to watch it again."

"jc-29071","8","0","1","31 January 2019"," Justice League 2 tie in has made a big splash and is riding high
","The king of the 7 seas proved his point, however I would have loved to see one or two members of the Justice League at the end of the film most notably the Green Lantern whom I know has to be in Justice League 2 since he is a founding member. I want to say that one of the best parts of the film besides Jason who is just the best Aquaman there has ever been, in fact he's even better than the rest of the Justice League members! You guys may have to recast the rest of the team and just start over, begin with a real well don Green Lantern and the whole green lantern corps and color ring wars which is just a mind blowing storyline and the parallax story line as part of the trilogy must not be left out, and we want the real Hal Jordan as green lantern, this time none of that riding in a rollercoaster as in the last movie, which I liked, but there are better and more visually striking ways to use his powers like powerful green cyber armors, giant robot suits, powerful blast and feats of superhuman strength with the green energy etc. Ultimately Green Lantern must join the group and have his movie, just put it in the right director's hands and it will go well. Back to Aquaman I love the whole ocean philosophy and raising awareness about very real issues this is very important and should remain a theme for the next two films. I love the oceanography and many of the CGI were great especially some of the encounters he has, they are really great, except for the octopus scene, you know the one come on stop that. Aquaman's suit , the chainmail should be smaller, it looks plastic as it is and plastic. Also the scene at the end of the film the CGI looks fake, I hope the CGI will look much better in the other films. Merma was great and must remain throughout the film, Nicole Kidman was also great and likewise must remain, in fact all the cast members did a wonderful job. I would love to see the costumes look better, more convincing and the strange races are fantastic and should be looked into more in the coming films, as should the monsters and all the strange history, artifacts and the action scenes all add to the intrigue keep it coming you had everyone eating out of your hands that's why this film grossed so much and is on the top 25 of all time grossing films . Final word when they face Darkseid it should all lead up to it after we get to know everyone and seen their movies and there should be cameos from group members to show cohesion and the CGI has to be top notch."

"aultimaetapa","5","0","1","28 January 2019"," Aquaman!
","Aquaman! Finally, DC. Hi. Before I begin the analysis, I must say that I am a beginner in this world of ""human"" movie criticism. I'm brazilian, my english is ""meh"".<br/><br/>Do you like a fun movie full of surprising and frantic action scenes to the point of impressing the viewer at any time? Correct movie. Do you prefer well-developed characters and a script that is minimally credible and does not abuse of the cliches? Wrong movie. From the very beginning we have unprecedented destruction, the film minimally tries to stop to introduce its characters in a way that provokes the affection of the public, this simply occurs naturally with the course of the scenes. Let's say at least we have some dialogues geared toward a basic introduction of what is happening and things to provoke the comic side (to the end)... Other than that, explosions. Arthur is by far the only character with a ""mini-arc"" of presentation, as the narrative unfolds between flashbacks and present events; not to curl up, since everyone has a sentimental connection to each other and only complements something for the public's understanding. The arc does not take much of the film, which is good and does not arouse the boredom of the viewer, moreover, the performance is good enough to portray with skill the strong personality of the protagonist who, although theoretically very generic, can take advantage of the clichÃ©s in a good way and improve the reputation that the hero has here. I would say that despite using the clichÃ©s in a good way, ""Aquaman"" abuses this. For example, the relationship of our couple is totally superficial, being moved and carried by a meager clichÃ©s of comedy and, also, conveniences of action. It can be said that ""Amber Heard"" does not shine or cause fascination, because her character is very superficial, which possibly hindered her performance (coloring the tedious is difficult). Mera is used as a convenient tool, more than is used as a character. Black Mamba demonstrates an interesting potential, however, it is forgotten and used in a confusing way, being a simplistic opposition to the main objective and appearing at random as a script convenience. The matches are short (with tactics worthy of Power Rangers) and may, rather, disappoint the fans. In the meantime, our antagonist is acceptable; the action reinforces well its ideals and brings to the fore that, in the end, it is not only an opposition to the others, but, yes, someone who does not understand or accepts facts; being minimally humanized in its choices and slightly different from what we are accustomed to, even though it is completely clichÃ© and having almost nonexistent development, I believe that at least we have a potential for continuation. Other presences media have only the value of supplementing the narrative and do not necessarily give much emphasis to something, nor do they sketch out prominence (with some exceptions in certain scenes). Still, the cast is very generic, simple and poorly developed. The script, however far from being a wonder, is very predictable and simple, can impress. Because? Well, most of the cliches are well used, in addition, the direction manages to catch the viewer in some moments, although it can not be called primordial. The action, however, is quite convenient at times, and there are, yes, many repetitive scenes to break the spectator's expectation, but obviously few are caught by surprise (currently, it would be more surprising if nothing happened). The script prolongs through unnecessary comedy the romance of the main couple, only, obviously, to receive this in the end (in a moment of peace). Generic is relative, however, I would say that the movie is medium in this regard. Other than that, the ending is a stereotype used positively. You can not count predictability as a grotesque mistake, as we already knew that this premise of ideological battles would engender such a feat (even more so in a movie of a ""independent"" hero). However, the film is filled with grotesque conveniences and occasional to the extreme, misrepresenting (even) the sense of some things or generating flaws and holes. As has been said, action is impressive and frenetic; now, combine with the fundamental and beautiful design (the best part). Armor faithful to the HQ's, without removing representative details (they do not look like a cosplay either, which is great); everything is well detailed and immersive. The effects do not sin so much (only in some moments); soon, they enter, yes, in the standard quality of films of heroes of the present time. The comedy of the movie is really bad if you are already accustomed to several movies of the genre, since the jokes are only recycled from other works. Being direct, ""Aquaman"" is incredible for those who seek to have fun or for those who praise cliche heroism. Final grade? 5. Define well. Medium but fun."

","Hahaha That was a pun. Or word play. Or something.<br/><br/>Ooooookay, on to the business at hand. The Aquaman movie.<br/><br/>I try to see every comic book movie that comes down the pike. I went into this one not expecting mush. The character came across as an obnoxious frat boy in the Justice League movie and I figured this one was just a showcase for Momoa and his pecs and tattoos. "" Pecs and Tats"" might have been a great title for the movie, I thought.<br/><br/>Well was I pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty entertaining. It was fun and had some nice bits of comedy and the action was good. The cinematography in real world settings, like the small village where Arthur first encounters Black Manta, was really good. and Momoa might not be a great actor but he did have good chemistry with all his co-stars.<br/><br/>While it wasn't a great ,movie like say, LOGAN, it delivered fun and action and adventure, pretty much everything you could want out of a good, solid, comic book movie.

","Didn't expect much and wasn't really disappointed.<br/><br/>
The story was 100% predictable. Everything was obvious from the start and there was really nothing the movie could've impressed me with.<br/><br/>
Around 70% of the dialogue was expository, 20% was people saying really stupid things and 10% of really awkward humor. I did laugh at some of the lines though, but those were unintentionally funny. They did sometimes make fun of some things showing that they are aware of some of the stupidities they have there only to stay true to the source material. They did, however, spend a lot of effort to make sure you understand everything that is going on. Everything that happens or even gets mentioned is explained in a flashback scene or by characters in full. Even before the giant sea beast attacks it makes sure to give you some exposition at first.<br/><br/>
Most of the visuals were ok but not very creative or interesting. They did have some good ones though, like 2 or 3. From the top of my head, the starting lighthouse fight scene was cool, the trench dive and the wine magic scenes were also pleasant to the eye.<br/><br/>
Most of the acting was good (would've been strange if it was otherwise with such cast). Except for our two leads, Mera and Arthur. I didn't like both Aquaman as a character and Momoa's performance. First they set him up as a guy with super powers and an enormous ego. I though this was made intentionally to show his path and his growth as a character in the end. But this wasn't the case, he just was lucky to get a better weapon and randomly rescue his mom in the process (side quests, right?). He's still the same egocentric guy with super powers. And this is pretty much what he was, the movie even emphasizes on that since the ending is extremely dull, they even go for the basic ""become the king and get the girl"" thing. Super one-dimensional. I'm not familiar with the source material so maybe this was just them staying loyal (just as having a laughable costume for the Black Manta).<br/><br/>
Mera's motivation as a character was unclear yet she seems to care so much (not sure about what particularly) throughout the movie. She was ruined mostly by Amber Heard's performance. She was horrible, she didn't care for a second about her acting and it was obvious. They did gave her nothing to work with though, she's just a plot device, a girl the main guy gets in the end. At least I did enjoy her costume :)<br/><br/>
There was also some sort of an environmental message but it was so bleak I almost forgot about this when I finished the movie.<br/><br/>
The main problem of this movie is that it's around 7 years late. This would've worked so much better if made around 2012. The hero is not impressive, the story is not particularly interesting, the lore is stupid and unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>
They did know what they were doing and there clues in the movie to substantiate that. I don't think that there was a better way to make an Aquaman movie, but this is still instantly forgettable."

I mean what other superhero movie can you think of that tries to make us feel something for a bad guy that just killed a bunch of innocent people? Okay, maybe Loki. But in the same scene? Or one that has an endless kiss that takes place in lieu of the hero stopping the carnage of a major battle? That latter was a bit much for me, but hey...<br/><br/>Obviously, the movie doesn't want you to take anything too seriously, so don't.

"TheOny13","9","0","2","25 January 2019"," Beware, this movie is not just mindless action!
","I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D (which wasn't so great btw) and honestly saying I wasn't disappointed. Many people (including the critics) have praised this movie for being only ""fun"" or putting the accent on ""good old fun"". But in my opinion this movie has much more to it than that. The only reason I didn't gave this movie a ten is because overall is a bit cliched at times and overall the stakes aren't that high really, to make you surprised or mind blown by what turns this movie took along its 142 minutes run time.<br/><br/>The story: Many people have compared this movie with ""Black Panther"" or ""Lion King"" but the story although being about someone who steps up to be the king of his people, is quite different. The main difference is that Arthur doesn't want to be king and his character along the journey this movie takes it, becomes more selfless and more dedicated to his people or to the saving of his people rather than on some claim he has. I'll say this: first like 20 minutes of this movie are awesome with a backstory that was touching, powerful and memorable. The movie loses its tempo only in the middle but you never lose the plot if you pay attention. I will also point out the development of Arthur's character and how a certain scene speaks so powerfully about what makes a good leader. Someone who doesn't think about himself but rather gives everything in him for his people. Very nicely executed scene, and one more reason why this movie was more than just good fun for me.<br/><br/>The villain: Although some people said Manta wasn't actually needed in this movie, if you really pay attention to the movie you'll see he has somewhat of a role in it. But the other villain is what makes this movie good. Orm is very strong of a character and his motivations are very understandable. There's a scene between him and Arthur in Atlantis that displays all his motivation and how humans are responsible for that. For me that scene just spoke and raised the problem that we as humans continue to perpetuate upon the environment, and how we do everything that we like with it without worrying about it's degradation. Very nice and deep thematically.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was good. Standard I would say: Vulko is the mentor, Mera is the ""partner along the journey"" for Arthur, but the rest which I won't spoil for you, two characters are very good even though they don't have that much screen time. Their story is superb and touching. The soundtrack again was very nice done by Rupert Gregson Williams, but a little to loud at times.<br/><br/>The visuals: This movie is wihtout a doubt the most visual and the most beautifully looking movie I've seen in a long long time. It is beyond me how this movie wasn't nominated by the academy (btw one of the worst nolinations this year at the academy) for visual effects and production design, which are incredible well done. The amount of work that went in it must have been crazy. I couldn't but appreciate all the visuals and the digital altered faces (which are quite a few) throughout this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, great movie with so much fun and excitement but also with a good and flashed out villain, good character development and good enough themes throughout the movie. Well worth watching. Stay until the mid credits for the post credits scene that sets up a sequel, which hopefully will be made."

","Aquaman was the most anticipated movie of 2018, I was so scared to be bad or disappointing, and fortunately it wasn't, in fact it was great, not perfect but still amazing.. so it's time to talk to u, guys about this amazing movie, so let's get into it!<br/><br/>Aquaman is directed by James Wan, his very first superhero movie, screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, and starring Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.
Story by Geoff Johns, James Wan and will Beall... The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime--one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a king.<br/><br/>This review will be spoiler-free, because I don't want to ruin this movie to you, guys...
I really don't know where to start, guys... Let's start with the direction.. James Wan's first superhero movie as its director is Aquaman, so I was concerned to see him failing, because we're used to see him mostly in horror movie like The Conjuring Universe, Saw and Insidious.. so yeah I didn't expect him to make a great job with the direction, in fact I was blown away of his amazing job with this movie, especially with the action scenes, he made every single scene epic, and breathtaking, thanks also goes to the crew of the CGI which I'm gonna talk about later on. James Wan did some mistakes with the direction as I predicted when I first heard that he will direct this movie, he actually tried to make some jump-scares in this movie, for no reason I don't get why.. let me tell you how... Most of the NORMAL scenes, when people are talking or doing anything but fighting, especially when they are in a house or somewhere closed, they always ended with someone exploding the wall or anything unexpectedly just like horror movies, and that's what I was afraid of! That's my only issue with the direction.<br/><br/>Let's move to the flawless CGI!!!! Every scene of the underwater world was was well made, by the CGI and the direction as I said above, it's amazing.. I can't find any proper word to say about it.. it was fascinating, i was super-entertained by how well done the CGI of this movie is!! They weren't afraid of making that much of Atlantis, like Godzilla did, I don't want to compare movies, but Godzilla was too afraid to make that much of scenes of him, but Aquaman took that risk and they nailed it!<br/><br/>Also the performances were very talented by everyone, Jason Momoa is amazing as Aquaman as he was in Justice League, and maybe more! Amber Heard is badass as Mera... Patrick Wilson is an amazing villain and I loved him as King Orm and I can't wait to see him again in other DC movies!<br/><br/>Let's move to my biggest flaw of this movie, and it's a random choice.. I don't know but this might have some spoiler for you... There's a scene when Aquaman and Mera were fighting CREATURES in a boat, and in this scene Arthur AKA Aquaman said a very random line, that these creatures are from the bottom of the sea so they fear the light, so he opens a random box to find a LIGHT SOURCE and he scares the creatures with it... This scene was so random, the line of Aquaman can be forgiven, but the random choice can't be!
I tried to make it spoiler-free as I could and I highlighted some keywords, which who watched the movie will understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So for those who want to know if Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is better than Aquaman or not, my opinion is yeah, it's better than Aquaman, but it also depends on what you want to see, if you wanna see an epic, old fashioned way superhero movie, so Aquaman is your movie, but if you wanna see a surprising and with a very powerful story, so Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is your movie. Anyways I really loved Aquaman and I'm gonna give it an A!<br/><br/>Alright, guys, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews.

","The story is a total borefeast - the pilot is an automat and I could follow, I swear, the whole movie using only one braincell.

"newguy85","8","0","2","24 January 2019"," Perfect Mix of Camp, Action, Plot & Style
","This movie wasn't on my radar, I was thoroughly disappointed by Justice League and had zero desire to see this. Yet as the reviews came in, and as Jason Momoa killed it on the PR trail, I finally decided to give it a go and really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Some standouts:
Jason Momoa is a star. He carried this script with all of it's tongue-in-cheek groan-worthy lines... I read somewhere that he uses Metal songs to get into character and that Tool was one of his inspirations. Personally I think Tool is a Very Serious Band and so is their front-man Maynard, but he has a pretty weird sense of humor.<br/><br/>For some reason I kept paying attention to the physics - there are a lot of people flying through walls and getting hit really hard, you really feel the kinetic force of the action.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable but epic, the final battle is outstanding, and the world design is colorful, interesting, and fun.<br/><br/>DCEU really steps up the game with this entry into its universe, but I don't really see Wonder Woman, Super Man, or Batman as having the ability to carry a movie with this level of humor and color. They're going to need to introduce a new team in an alternate setting that can be comical, colorful, and have a ton of action - I think the Lantern Corps are going to be the best way even though it was attempted previously."
"lark40","10","0","3","24 January 2019"," can bridges of both sea and land be built upon a seaman quest to unite the wild atlantis way
","The film is a game changer in terms of special effects its up there with avatar if I had seen it in 3 d it would change superheros films for ever
Let's start off with a bit of truth: I like Aquaman. I' DC Comics fan. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe, but it is a lot of fun. ""It's a bizarre but weirdly effective movie."" I can't put it any better than that. Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.with William defoe playing vulko who show aquman how to learn his role with tridentand using his skills he need the back story is good with king orm talking over the king of atlantis when he over throws the and attacks a meeting aquaman is forced to fight him in an underwater arena this is epic and mera helps but but as we see Nicole kidman character is good givers good advice and was rescued so when aquman has to find the real ruler he must become the hero and go epic and clues to atlantis and its power before its destroyed he has to light the way
I can, however, give you a few more details. We begin with a new version of Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who feels more like an aquatic vigilante than the deep sea prince we're used to. Arthur's rogue hero lifestyle leads him into a faceoff with a group of high-tech pirates. The pirates are lead by David Hyde (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father Jesse (Michael Beach), who just so happen to be in the middle of stealing a submarine. You know, because why not. This leads to one of the most emotional scenes of the movie and after it's all done Arthur and has his first enemy in Hyde AKA Manta.
The enemies don't stop there. Arthur also has an Atlantean brother by the name of Orm (Patrick Wilson) although he'd probably prefer King Orm-because he's pretentious that way. I mean, this guy is the quintessential bad-news-sibling who might want you dead or imprisoned or just somewhere bleeding 'cause you're lost to the world. The battle under water is like lord of the rings its amazing
To counter the forces rising against him, Arthur has a great dad (Temuera Morrison), and a mom (Nicole Kidman) who loved them both deeply before she had to leave because, you know, Queen business ain't nothing but work. He also has a potential crime-fighting partner and a love interest in Mera (Amber Heard) the princess of another underwater kingdom.
So Arthur's life is fun...because he loves danger...and he's a total bad boy...but he has a lot to learn about compassion and what being a hero means. Which is what this movie is about.
So, shall we go with the good & the ugly? Let's do it.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is glorious. He's funny, charming, and tough. That's what you want in an Aquaman and it's what's been missing from DC movies-other than Wonder Woman. As his foil, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is the perfect counterbalance. His Manta (formerly Black Manta) is ruthless, charming, and relentless. I've got nothing but applause for these two and I've got big hopes for their rivalry to continue in future films.
Secondly, DC has found a formula I believe will work well for them as they redevelop and revamp their live action movies.10/10<br/><br/>
The computer generated imagery is brill at times like the tsunami and not in a campy way that feels intentional. The characters and their hair [see: tresses] move more like they're flying through air rather than gliding through water.
Still...It's a fun movie. Jason Momoa makes everything better. And this represents a first step in DC finally giving their characters and their fans the movies we want and deserve. So, I say cheers to Aquaman-his pilsner glass may be far too flashy but at least it's filled to the brim with good stuff."
"thuurhutjens","8","0","2","24 January 2019"," Finally 3D has added value
","This movie's storyline is standard. The acting can be better, but the versatile visualization of the underwater world makes up for it. It took some years. But this movie proves wearing 3D-glasses can have added value. You really feel you are part the underwater world."

","This film is fantastic movie I watch after long time"
"Aaron1375","9","0","3","24 January 2019"," Never thought I'd enjoy an Aquaman film adaptation
","I am in the minority when it comes to the DC films in that I have enjoyed them all. I thought Man of Steel was an awesome Superman film, Batman versus Superman wasn't great, but the last portion of the film was good, Suicide Squad was pretty cool and Wonder Woman, well people liked that one. I even thought Justice League was good and was baffled that it had a disappointing box office take as it was so much better than Batman versus Superman. This one I was not sure of, because I just thought it would be difficult to make an interesting movie using only Aquaman. I was wrong and was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>The story has Aquaman coming out into the forefront as he takes out some pirates after we are introduced to Arthur's mother and his dad and how they met. He leaves a pirate father/son duo to die as they had been killing indiscriminately; however, this would later turn out to be a mistake as son wants revenge on Aquaman. Aquaman, meanwhile, must go back to his kingdom of Atlantis as his brother tries to start a war with those of us who reside on land. Arthur/Aquaman must try and reclaim his throne and prevent this war his brother so desperately wants and also deal with a new enemy, the Black Manta!<br/><br/>One of the reasons I enjoyed this one was the cast who did a very good job. It was nice seeing Dolph Lundgren in a big movie for a change rather than the direct to DVD stuff he usually does these days. Jason Momoa is really good as Aquaman and is one of the main reasons I think this one worked as he is very charismatic as the hero in this one. My favorite though was the Black Manta as they had the costume down pat! He looked completely awesome and the fight between him and Aquaman was the highlight of this movie for me!<br/><br/>So, overall, a very fun action movie and surprisingly so for me. I think the DC films are rather good, though I still favor the Marvel film universe more. I have always enjoyed Marvel more in the comics too as I find their heroes more relatable and less overpowered than those of DC, but I like the DC characters too. I am looking forward to Shazaam as well as that one looks fun too. Sorry, but comic book films should be fun and not all dark and serious...unless we are talking Spawn of course."

"dmbelafan","7","0","2","23 January 2019"," Empty eye candy
","First things first - this movie is gorgeous. Aside from a few fleeting (and forgivable) moments, the visuals in this movie are lovely. Objects feel like they have the scale and ""weight"" that they should, which can be difficult to get right from a CGI perspective. I found the movie's humor hit-or-miss, but mostly enjoyable. Some lines felt forced, but Mera's first ventures onto land included numerous clever moments.<br/><br/>Dialogue was sadly predictable, but generally delivered well. Amber Heard's performance was at times engaging, and at times distracting. She didn't seem particularly well suited for moments of powerful monologue.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, character development was rushed, but they certainly made an effort to add a bit of depth to at least a couple characters. I wanted to like Black Manta, but came out disappointed. Maybe they'll do something more clever with him in the future.<br/><br/>Numerous plot elements just sort of happened for no real reason, other than to tie up the loose end of a joke left hanging from a setup ten minutes prior (Pinocchio, for example). The ""National Treasure"" sequence on the quest for Atlan's trident seemed out of place within the scope of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great popcorn movie. It'll end up in my collection, no doubt, but likely won't merit another viewing until its sequel is released."

","At the start of the movie, somehow him being born by a human and a mer-person and somehow he gets all the powers to control all the fish even though his brother was born by mer-people and didn't get to control all the fish. Then it went back to him as a kid training and then something happens with his trainer bringing up his mother's death and the you figure out she isn't really dead, which is just a cheap twist. My biggest gripe is Aqua-man's brother was trying to get all the sea's kingdoms together but 2/4 he just started killing people. You'd think you'd need those people, and then aqua-man somehow controls the god and then just kills a bunch of people, and then his mother tells them two to stop fighting, which is the best scene in the movie. So overall, a decent movie if you're a superhero movie fan you'll like it."
"Chudderz","7","0","1","22 January 2019"," Fishy Fun with plenty of Bright CGI
","First review so here goes.<br/><br/>Aquaman. I am a fan of Superhero movies so thought why not catch up with this one after not seeing it at Christmas time. All in all it passed the time and I left having enjoyed the film but I won't say it's the best I have ever seen. DC tends to be a bit of a darker side of this genre but this one felt a bit more lighter and fun. Back Story is quickly sorted so you can watch as a stand alone movie and we find out it is set after Justice League during general chit chat.<br/><br/>No real spoilers as our hero goes off on a quest to save the world and reluctantly claim his rightful thrown. The plot as you would expect can be picked through but all of the stars in the movie have a bit of fun. Jason Momoa is a bit wooden but he fills the role well. There are plenty of good CGI moments and loads of bright colours whilst not to my taste and sometimes a waste of screen time I am sure the younger people will enjoy. Fight sequences get bigger and bigger as the movie goes on as Aquaman goes on his travels.<br/><br/>All in all a fun film certainly not the best but certainly not the worst. Shame no other DC characters didn't make a guest appearance but I guess being mostly under water kind of rules that out. Will I watch Aquaman 2, yes probably. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do."

","Full disclosure, the only other DCEU film I have seen is Suicide Squad. I am not emotionally invested in this franchise. I went to see Aquaman because it involves one of my favourite actor/director combos; Patrick Wilson and James Wan. (And the fact that Jason Momoa plays the lead didn't hurt.) Wan's horror films are elevated above the genre because of the character drama and I was hoping that would be the case with Aquaman too. The story is fairly predictable, but that's forgivable, and the characters do have some quirks outside the general tropes for this type of film. Maybe unrealistically, I wanted a little less action and a few more quieter, character driven moments. Patrick Wilson was the standout for me, a nuanced and captivating performance. Temuera Morrison was great too. (The opening sequence telling Tom and Atlanna's story was one of my favorite parts of the film.) The difficulty I had was getting on board with Arthur's journey, not because he wasn't likeable, he was, Jason Momoa does a fine job, it's the fact that Arthur's motivation is weak and selfish at times, and that I kind of agree with Orm. Humanity is destroying the world's oceans, and should be held accountable for it. I also found the final battle scene disturbing if I'm honest. The way the sea creatures were used as weapons with no regard for the fact that they are living beings. It didn't feel like the way a king, or hero, should treat them. The visuals are undoubtedly spectacular, the special effects are beautifully crafted and a pleasure to watch. Overall, Aquaman isn't the best film you'll ever see, but it certainly isn't the worst."
"xadamantto","10","0","3","21 January 2019"," Simply memorable!
","A fantastic movie, made with great caprice and that will be a reference for others for many, many years, more than deserved!"
"batuhanakcaygs","6","0","1","20 January 2019"," Not that good as the hype.
","This movie has many good reviews compared to better movies, that get bad reviews.<br/><br/>First of all, why this movie isn't as bad as the other DCEU movies:
This movie has great visuals and a good cut. This movie is a difference to the really dark DC universe. This is very refreshing.<br/><br/>There are many actors who are very sympathetic and play well. I found Jason Momoa and Amber Heard very likable and they had good chemistry between each other. What I found sad was that Willem Dafoe did not have enough screentime or influence. He could have had many meaningful influences on the plot, but this was not realized. But that is not so tragic, because the film can convince by the sympathy of the characters. I want to see more of each character.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why that movie is not that good:
This movie copies many elements from other movies. I know that most Hollywood movies are copying, but this movie is an embarrassing combination of elements. For example, the Post Credit Scene is mimicking the Post Credit Scene of Black Panther. Or, for example, the Trident of the Trident is imitating some other beings from other franchises. I do not mind, but it was painful to see how some of the movie elements were taken in a bad way.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Black Panther. This film has many parallels to Black Panther due to the royal theme. The difference, why Black Panther is better than Aquaman is simply that you experience many emotional scenes like important deaths at Black Panther. Black Panther shows many parallels to royal dramas like those of Shakespeare, but Aquaman has few scenes that really carry emotional weight. I had expected a superhero movie with parallels to royal dramas and elements of love, but was disappointed with a complete romance movie with CGI.<br/><br/>I know that the comparisons with Black Panther are exaggerated. But do you still know in what point Black Panther is better than Aquaman: the music. The Marvel movie had a soundtrack, especially composed by Kendrick Lamar in collaboration with other artists, while Aquaman has songs that are not compatible with each other (like Two Steps from Hell - None Shall Live and a Pitbull cover from Toto - Africa) a female singer) and can not make a uniform sound.<br/><br/>But what you can notice is that the dialogue between the characters is really very stupid. The producers should have allowed themselves time for production and had to revise the dialogue. Some statements from characters are sometimes exaggerated cheesy or ridiculous. Then you realize that they wanted to copy Marvel, but unfortunately failed, because most ""jokes"" have failed. With every joke, no audience laughed.<br/><br/>Towards the end, the film was so cheesy and so predictable that I was bored and expected the end of the film. The film was usually very predictable, especially at the end of the film.Maybe some people think I'm overdoing my criticism because it's a DC movie. But that's not true. I'm a big fan of DC Comics and I grew up with DC Comics when I was a kid. One of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. I watch every DC movie, no matter how bad it may be. I'm not saying that this movie is a disaster, but for me it was very predictable and towards the end I was very bored. I will wait and I would be happy about an Aquaman 2, but hopefully it will be better implemented.<br/><br/>
In summary:
I think, I would give this movie user-defined 6.7 points from 10 points. There are plenty of better superhero movies, but this movie is one of the best DC Extended Universe movies. I found the movie more exciting than Wonder Woman but not so exciting. If you judge him as a very ordinary movie, he is average and nothing special."

The only thing well two things I found problems with was the name Arthur, pulling the trident out of a stone and s sea mo stern that is eerily similar to the kraken and the fact that they called him king Arthur at the end of the mo ie. Actually get a grip DC, it's a slippery slope I mean Meta-Humans, you've plagiarized every other fable why not just call the characters Mutants!"
"nirmaljustin1","9","0","4","20 January 2019"," One of the best superhero movies of all time
","Aquaman is a movie you should best watch in packed houses. Then you can really enjoy all the fun of the movie. Yes, as the critics have pointed out this is a CGI fest, but that is a great plus for the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is simple. The real essence of the movie lies in its wonderful visuals. As you would know, the movie is set in the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. The makers have excelled at making Atlantis as beautiful as possible.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting, William Dafoe and Patrick Wilson were outstanding. But the biggest praise goes to Jason Momoa. Oh,how cool he was! I have become his fan now. Amber Heard was a constant source of irritation with her skin-fit and cleavage-barring outfits. But Nicole Kidman was the one who disappointed me. I was hoping a good performance from her but all I got was her walking around in skimpy costumes.<br/><br/>Overall, Aquaman was a hell of a fun ride. Go for it!!"

","The best DC movie so far, although, thats not saying much considering their output so far has been mediocre. having said that, Jason Mamoa was born to play Aquaman, and has more charisma in his finger than Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) has in his entire body.<br/><br/>a good balance of story and action, and the underwater scenes are nothing short of spectacular. the visual effects guys who walked on this movie should be commended for the stellar work they did. Black Manta was an awesome villain and his suit was faithful to the comics.<br/><br/>if i had one minor gripe, it would be the romance between Arthur and Mera. i have never been a fan of romance in my comic book movies as i feel it takes you out of the flow, and that kissing scene, while explosions go off in the distance was cringe inducing.<br/><br/>so, a success for DC, so lets hope they can keep the ball rolling with Shazam shall we?"
"Pedrisky","8","0","1","13 January 2019"," A very good movie of superheroes
","This is a movie that raises my hopes that Dc will make good movies again:<br/><br/>The film has great successes, as for example: the CGI is pleasant to see and very colorful; The fight scenes are very incredible and it becomes very interesting.<br/><br/>But it has a bad point: it is that it is overloaded with history. I think that the plot with Black Manta could have been saved for another Aquaman movie. Many people say that the film is predictable, and the truth is that it is true, but honestly, I did not care, because the entertainment made me forget that point.<br/><br/>In conclusion: I recommend that you go see Aquaman, unless you usually get bored easily."

"rannynm","10","0","1","12 January 2019"," Powerful Message About Being the Best You Can Be
","I really like this film because the message is so powerful. It's about training to be the best you can be. Then, when you are ready, your task is to beat anything that's in your way, with a humble heart because good always wins. Another reason why I like it is because of the action between Arthur and King Orm. These two teach that, no matter what the situation is, violence is never the answer. I also really like the background music because the suspense really moved me and made me want to jump out of my seat with excitement and joy.<br/><br/>This amazing action/adventure film is about the city of Atlantis, which is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry king Orm. With his army by his side, King Orm plans to take over the remaining oceanic people to become the King of all oceans better known as the Oceanic Master, then to rule the surface world. Standing in Orm's way is his half-Human, half-Atlantean brother, Aquaman, known as half-breed. With help from Vulko, who is the royal counselor of the throne, Aquaman must retrieve the powerful trident of Atlan to proclaim the title as the protector of the deep blue sea.<br/><br/>The cast includes Arthur/Aquaman (Jason Momoa, Game Of Thrones), Atlanna (Nicole Kidman, Dead Calm), King Atlan (Graham McTavish, Outlander), Mera (Amber Heard, Never Back Down), King Orm (Patrick Wilson, Insidious), Vulko (Willem Dafoe, Spider-Man), Manta (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II, The Greatest Showman).<br/><br/>My favorite part of this film is when Arthur finds out that he has the power to talk to the creatures in the water, in other words echolocation. Following that, Arthur doesn't know how to control the power that he has, which is why King Atlan puts Arthur in the hands of the royal counselor, Vulko, to learn to control his powers. From the training that Artur does with Vulko, Arthur shall use it in the future.<br/><br/>Aside from that, King Orm plans to take things into his own hands and decides to conquer the seven seas to become King Of The Deep Blue Sea, also known as the Oceanic Master. After that, King Orm plans to take apart the surface world to become his treasure for good.<br/><br/>I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, as well as adults. Truly the whole family will love this film as it has so many funny and good reaction moments. This film also requires very good anthropomorphic qualities in various scenes. Don't miss this amazing action/adventure film directed by James Wan, which is playing in theaters now, to find out what happens at the end.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Siaki S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

","This is by far not a bad movie, not at all. Jason Mamoa is one again great as Arthur curry or Aqua man and is joined by a star studded cast with actors such as Willem Dafoe, Nicole kidman, Amber Heard, and Patrick wilson. Where this movie excels Is in definitely int he action scenes. From the beginning to the end I was continuously amazed by these really well shot and choreographed action scenes and really added to my enjoyment of the movie. This movie is also visually stunning especially when we first see Atlantis for the first time. Where this movie does struggle is that their is just way too much going on in the movie, which overall leads to a messy story with no real cohesion , in addition the script at times is not the best as some lines are too cringe. Overall this movie is very entertaining but has its flaws. But The DC seem one step into the right direction with these movies."

There has been a lot of cgi finales in previous DC films and Aquaman does the same, admittedly Atlantis needed to be heavy cgi. The big plus in this film for me was Jason Momoa, charming and very likeable, definitely embodies the roll. If you enjoyed Justice League this is as good but it's no Man of Steel."

"kluseba","7","0","1","10 January 2019"," Predictable fun
","Aquaman is another exchangeable superhero movie but it's so dynamic and visually stunning that you won't care about the insultingly predictable plot and the repetitive superhero tropes.<br/><br/>The movie has a short and appropriate introduction before the epic adventure unfolds and ends on a concise positive note going back to its opening sequence. The underwater world looks fantastic and especially the animals like sharks are lovely. The quest that leads the main character and his female sidekick across the planet includes stunning locations like Sicily and Morocco that offer a welcome change from the seas. The settings are carefully chosen and cleverly mixed with computer animations. Director James Wan filmed everything calmly, extravagantly and precisely. Even the dramatic action scenes like the breathtaking escape sequence in Sicily avoid shaky cameras and exaggerated special effects which makes the film enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The final duel between the courageous half-breed protagonist and his sinister half-brother is visually spectacular and emotionally engaging.<br/><br/>You will get exactly what you expect from this movie: shallow but gripping entertainment for the whole family with a big budget. It's pleasant while it lasts but also quickly forgotten because of predictable tropes, an overall tiresome story and mostly average acting performances. Up next, let's create another exchangeable superhero movie called Airwoman, Earthtransgender or Firetiger."

","One of the most beautiful and visually rich movies I've ever seen. Designers carried the show in almost every way. (Then there was Black Mantis who looked like he fell out of 1960s Star Trek). Aquaman's character felt likeable, honest, admirable. Mera, although not embodied with the best acting, wasn't a nuisance and became rather endearing by the end. Whenever I began to doubt her casting choice my eyes would wander and I'd quickly come to my senses. There were some pacing issues at the beginning with how much emotion they tried to cram into the backstory but the pace pretty much sorts itself out by the end. Never did I find myself bored. In fact there were probably a dozen scenes that had me absolutely enraptured. In the end, I found myself inspired by beauty, a decent hero architype, and I would be happy to watch it again."
"bfml-03018","7","0","2","9 January 2019"," Good characters, wonderfull effects and an ok script
","Aquaman is full of cliches and deus ex-maquina, things only happen because the script wanted too, the story feels forced too.
But the acting is good for the most part, Momoa evolved and knows how to create an interesting character and Amber could be better. Daffoe and Patrick could apear more and black mantha to. The action and direction are wonderfull and the cgi is perfect and really of quality.
In an oversaturated genre, aquaman because of the effects and solid story is a fresh air, unfortunately, same can't be said about the script. As with a sequel underwater won't be anymore something new, if continues like that, it will be kinda bad."
"danhoughton","7","0","2","8 January 2019"," A good, not great, movie
","It's easy to give this movie 10/10 if you compare it solely to its DC movie peers, but that's not a very high bar.<br/><br/>It's fun, the visuals are incredible, but the humour is very obvious and therefore, unfunny, the love interest and the 'oh my, did we just hold hands?!' moments are worthy of some monstrous eye-rolls and, if I'm honest, there is just too many 'superhero pose' moments that it almost becomes irritating. Oh, and the black Manta looks like he's out of the power rangers. And I'm sorry, but if the villain has to say 'you can call me Black Manta' then they really need a kick up the backside. And there's an A-Team esque moment in there that makes you want to beat yourself to death with your own eyes.<br/><br/>Despite all of these negatives, it's an enjoyable movie. No, it's not the best DC movie ever made, as much as I wanted it to be, but it's a fun movie. The Atlantis scenes are beautifully visualised, and the action is very well done. But the brazen attempts to copy the humour of Thor Ragnarok and combine it with the upbeat, music driven abandon of Guardians of the Galaxy just doesn't quite hit the mark. Its too cheesy, too obvious and it's been done better elsewhere. If it can't decide if it wants to be serious or light hearted, then how is the audience supposed to decide. I came out having enjoyed a visual feast that had just a little too much ham and cheese."

It totally does not link the surface world. That is not what you see this movie. You want to see the action, and story with action.<br/><br/>There are two cons about this move..<br/><br/>1. The black actor who's father got killed by aquaman seeked revenged, but his result was not really plotted so well, he just got thrown off the cliff, not even opening up the mask?! Not dramatic enough.<br/><br/>2. Too messy at the end. Too many CGI, the civil war scenes under the sea were too much in some way.<br/><br/>Overall, it is not a bad movie...

"Noah_Biondi","8","0","2","7 January 2019"," Superhero swims in fresh water
","Yup. This is a spoiler review. Sorry, guys.<br/><br/>For those of you who have read some of my previous reviews, you'd know that I really hate the DCEU. Sure, Wonder Woman was fine and all, but all of the other films ranged from pretty bad (Man of Steel) to absolutely unbearable (Batman v Superman). Enter Aquaman- a film that actually managed to be the very first good DCEU film, and the reason why is because it's trying to be its own thing.<br/><br/>What's the story? Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people -- and then the surface world. Standing in his way is Aquaman, Orm's half-human, half-Atlantean brother and true heir to the throne. With help from royal counselor Vulko, Aquaman must retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep.<br/><br/>The best thing that this film has to offer is the visuals. The underwater cinematography, the designs of Atlantis, the creative and energetic action sequences, and, of course, the water effects are extremely innovative and breathtaking to look at. It's a huge step up from the visual effects in Justice League, and it manages to blow Zack Snyder's visuals for DC movies to the water (no pun intended). Another thing that works very well is the heart of the film. Believe it or not, there is actually a lot of very good and well thought-out emotion, way more than you'd expect from an Aquaman movie. There were scenes where I was almost gonna cry. It's hard to make me cry when I'm watching a movie, so that's an impressive move that this movie pulled off. For example, when Arthur's (Aquaman's) dad says that he still waits for her to come back on the dock by his beach house and when it actually happens, the tears start to fall on the floor. If I were to criticize something, it's that we don't get a very good introduction on Mera. It's like, Arthur's dad is about to die in one scene, and all of a sudden- surprise! Mera shows up. She ends up healing Arthur's dad, so it's not like he dies or anything. Also, the story not only takes elements from MCU films like Thor and Black Panther, but later on in the film it just becomes this generic fetch quest where Arthur has to retrieve a trident to become king of Atlantis, and of course, once he retrieves it, it becomes like every other film where everything goes into slow motion, there's Gregorian chanting, and as a bonus, Arthur and Mera end up loving each other. The ending of the film is a bit generic, but it's still a nice ending and the rest of the film plays on well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Aquaman is not just a really good movie with spectacular visual effects and many heartwarming moments, but it also got me into DC. I know there's two kinds of people who either love Marvel and hate DC or hate Marvel and love DC, but I'm gonna be an exception for this because now I love both. I hope DC continues to make some really great films in the future, because Aquaman proves that even DC can wield a golden trident."

","The CGI was damn awesome graphics especially in the fight scenes where it is really amazing . The story line had a nice flow but lacked suspense due to the predictable scenes and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, aweful. Half of the conversations that were in the movie were there because they had to be rather than augmenting character relationships as they should have rather than practically undermining momoas character and even his acting in the scenes where he was speaking. Not to mention the fact that 90% of the movie was drawn out fight scenes that happened so fast you couldn't figure out who the good guys or the bad guys were mixed with unrealistic scenarios with fire underwater and watching 2 people with the ability to swim fast underwater use a boat to get across the ocean. I mean REALLY, use a flare underwater to navigate through the ocean. The love story could of been built up better, and the protagonist and main character the whole movie was about didnt have anything to overcome, the movie starts with aquaman having superpowers and being this big hero and ends in the same way. He doesnt find himself in anyway and practically walks into a room for 5 minutes picks up a fork and becomes the king of the ocean or whatever<br/><br/>Honestly the only reason i give this movie a rating of 6/10 is the amazing CGI, incorporation of music and the general storyline, but really whoever was in charge of characters needs to check themselves."

","Possible Spoilers:<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film immensely. Much more ""whimsical"" (not unlike Marvel's- Black Panther) than previous DC entries. The story was very much the ""hero's journey/quest"" with really intense battles saved for Act 3. Although pollution of the oceans was admonished, it was not overly ""preached"" to get in the way of the story. James Wan's direction managed to bring Arthur Curry/Aquaman to vivid reality and Jason Momoa was delightful in the part. With a good ""back-story"", it explains his modern colloquial speech in Justice League perfectly. Happy to see Willem Defoe as a good-guy and Amber Heard was a thoughtful and dryly funny Mera. Patrick Wilson brought his ""A-game"" as the co-villain with an intense turn by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as the bookend villain, Manta. The villains carried ""dimension"" and were not just ""cookie-cutter"". Beautiful filming and well executed CGI along with many bows to the comic and the Saturday Morning cartoon, Super Friends as far as the actualization of Aquaman went. I would give the film a solid B+ to A-. Hope to see more adventures with Arthur/Aquaman."

"neobateman","7","0","1","5 January 2019"," Rousing excitement.
","Aquaman is the latest installment in DC's cinematic universe. Their sets of films have generally left me personally, with mixed reactions. I enjoyed Wonder Woman's refreshingly emotional narrative and Justice League's lighthearted chemistry between the main cast. Films like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad however suffered strongly from overly convoluted stories and unlikable characters. Aquaman luckily succeeds with the adventure formula, presenting a exciting, fun and action packed narrative headed with a charismatic lead actor. When a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) shares a romance with the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) results in the birth of a half blood son, Arthur (Jason Momoa). The Queen is forced to return to Atlantis where she is sacrificed for her treachery. This fuels the hate within Arthur's half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to wage war with the surface world. In order to protect humanity Arthur is trained and helped by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard) to go on a deadly mission to dethrone Orm. A story that has been seen a zillion times in superhero movies I feel. But what makes Aquaman so much fun is it's fast paced energy, charismatic performances, production design and action scenes. Jason Momoa really puts his stamp on the character of Arthur Curry, a drifter who has no will or ambition to become the King. He shares great father / son chemistry with Morrison where the audience really buys their loving relationship. Unfortunately the character becomes less significant as the story gets going. Kidman for her limited amount of screen time shows off prowess, strength and beauty. Patrick Wilson is a competent villain, certainly the best in the entire DCEU, there was potential at the start to make him more than a two dimensional bad guy. Unlike Killmonger this arc feels unfinished and the villain loses the initial interest. However unlike Steppenwolf, Ares, Zod and especially Lex Luthor, there was a actually a sense of threat that functioned about Wilson. His ambition and blood thirst makes him effective but nothing special, he is a standard MCU villain. Willem Dafoe also has great chemistry with Momoa as this mentor figure and it was certainly nice to see Dafoe in a superhero film again. However there also were some let downs in the acting department, Amber Heard is wooden and shares no chemistry with Momoa. I fully understand why Wan decided to cast Dolph Lundgren in this movie, but he unfortunately is an incredibly stiff actor that doesn't even possess this guilty pleasure 1980s charisma (something that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris or Christopher Lambert perfected). Some of the cgi effects still look unconvincing especially a deaging effect used on a certain actor. The story is contrived and thin and is only supposed to lead from one action scene to the next, from one exotic and interesting location to another. And as this, Aquaman succeeds. Fans of adventure serials and lighthearted superhero movies look no further. For those who look for something with more depth (no pun intended) should perhaps stay away. This is not comparable with The Dark Knight, The Winter Soldier, Logan or Infinity War. But for fans of Brendan Fraser's The Mummy will feel right at home."
"hud97","7","0","1","5 January 2019"," A good one for DC
","When I first heard about this movie coming out I was very skeptical especially since this was following the train wreck Justice League. I am not fully against DC movies ( although I prefer Marvel) because DC does have really good ones, Batman, Wonder Woman, and now Aquaman. The cast was very good, Jason Momoa did a fantastic job, he fit the part really well and he is not hard to look at which is a win for DC. The casting of Aquamans evil brother however could have been better than Patrick Wilson, his usual type of movies ( insidious, and the
conjuring) are very different from his part he played in Aquaman, his acting was not bad at all I just had a hard time seeing him fit the part. Overall this movie was very fascinating to see with all of the underwater special effects since it is something I have yet to see in movies before, great color, great action. I would say it is worth it to go see Aquaman while it is still in theaters just because your television at home just can't quite capture the action and special effects that a movie theater can. Is this movie perfect? no, but really no movie is, but I would recommend you seeing this movie as it was an enjoyable fun experience."
"dawargo-791-693331","10","0","2","5 January 2019"," Absolutely loved this movie
","This was equal to Wonder Woman. The movie about Aquaman I always hoped for"
"williampsamuel","6","0","1","4 January 2019"," Good Dumb Fun
","It occurred to me more than once as I watched this movie that Aquaman is basically DC's answer to Thor. Now I know full well that Aquaman was created in response to Marvel - then Timely Comics- Namor. But this Aquaman; the big, strong, kinda dumb hunk with the beard, the magical weapon and the goofball sense of humor, he's DC's Thor. And this movie, this equally goofy, fast paced, action driven blockbuster about a heroic fish out of water character (pun intended) fighting his brother for the throne; it feels a lot like the Thor franchise. For better and for worse.<br/><br/>Like Ragnarök, this whole production Is so cheerfully goofy. For instance, when Aquaman first faces his brother in a gladiatorial arena in front of cheering crowds, there's a holographic display of the fighter's stats, just like on ESPN. Later, Aquaman actually suggests peeing on something to properly hydrate it. Yes, it's that kind of movie. So naturally, the plot, such as it is, is completely predictable and exists mainly to string together the fight scenes and comic relief sequences.<br/><br/>And these are very good. I especially enjoyed the showdown with Black Manta that featured so heavily in the trailers, while the submarine fight in which they first meet made for a refreshingly serious change of pace. The gladiator fight is a lot of fun, and the massive final battle with multiple undersea fleets shooting it out even more so, though both scenes ended a bit too soon for my taste. The comic relief meanwhile is nonstop and pretty much all good, especially when Aquaman and Mera are bickering. They're a lot like Emmett and Wyldestyle from the Lego Movie, only with stronger romantic overtones.<br/><br/>It would be an understatement to say that Aquaman has tight pacing. With the exception of one inexplicable Semi Obligatory Lyrical Interlude, this is not a movie that believes in slow build-ups or stopping to catch its breath. Towards the end things keep speeding up more and more until everyone's rushing through every plot twist and expository speech like they've gone way over schedule and the crew is about to kick them out of their sound stage. And it's a good thing the pacing is fast, or else the numerous plot holes would be even more noticeable.<br/><br/>Like why doesn't Atlantis send emissaries to the surface to deliver a warning before declaring war? Why did Mera sneak Aquaman into Atlantis to show him something that she could easily have taken to him? How can the instructions for finding an ancient treasure involve something that wouldn't be built for millennia to come? You don't get to ask these questions, because by the time you get to them Aquaman is punching a bunch of monsters in the face.<br/><br/>While the plot may not be anything special, the visuals certainly are. This is an absolutely gorgeous movie. From the impressive set pieces and location shots in Sicily, to the futuristic, glowing Atlantean weapons and armor, to the massive battle sequences, every bit of this movie is a feast for the eyes. The production design is honestly Oscar worthy, which is the only that phrase can be applied to this movie.<br/><br/>Much of the dialog could easily have come from a Saturday morning cartoon or a high school play. Sometimes that's clearly intentional, meant to establish how clueless our protagonist is. Other times it just feels like no-one bothered to review the script or read the lines aloud before shooting, and the laughs are entirely unintentional. Sometimes I wonder how the actors are able to recite their lines without cracking up. Or why they didn't write new lines on a napkin between takes. But hey, I guess that's just part of the cheesy goodness.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is dumb as all get out, but fun enough to mostly make up for it. Aquaman may not be Wonder Woman, much less Avengers, but it's no Dawn of Justice or Suicide Squad either. It's a step in the right direction for DC, and a pretty good popcorn flick."
"craigperry-57455","5","0","2","4 January 2019"," Half Decent Directing
","Okay, so I've JUST watched this film.<br/><br/>James Wan directed this well. The scenes where just the characters are fighting are wonderful, but the rest is OK.<br/><br/>The writing is poor, and the characters are quite boring. However, this is one of the better DC films after Wonder Woman and Justice League.<br/><br/>I'd watch this if you're invested in DC or if you're a fan. But, if you aren't, don't worry about it.<br/><br/>Now, the story is very cliché. Black Manta is very under used and boring. Also, the love hint toward Arthur and Mara is awkward and rushed -- it feels like Wan wanted to get through this films and go straight into the fights.<br/><br/>The music is very weird and out of place."
"Gromstaur","8","0","1","4 January 2019"," It's a great adventure movie!
","First off, the bad: Sharks can't sit still (they die), and they definitely don't growl. Also, Manta's helm is too stupid for live action. Beyond that, it's a great adventure movie. I love movies that take you to radically different locations (as the original Star Wars trilogy did). Jason Momoa does a really good job of lifting the mood out of the DC gutter, so there might still be hope for the DCU."
"MovieMystro","Null","0","1","3 January 2019"," Some Fun But Mostly Bad Cheese
","There's no question that they really needed to cut at least 40 minutes out of this CGI monster. At times it was way more fun then I was expecting but at a point every new video game type crescendo started to all look the same. The CGI chaos actually became boring.<br/><br/>The plot is nonsensical and the cheesy dialogue was dialed up way past high. By the time the main bad guy declares himself ""The Ocean Master"" in full over-the-top B-movie mode I reached my cheese limit. Aquaman's power base also seemed all over the map in silly eye rolling ways. One minute he's super-farting a submarine and lifting it out of the water and the next he has trouble lifting his own body weight.<br/><br/>What elevates this movie above the other atrocious DCEU movies that have come before are the visuals, the cast and some of the action beats. The whole Aquaman vs Black Manta scene was a joy to watch. Yes, Black Manta has the silliest and forced inclusion in the movie but it paid off in that brawl.<br/><br/>The entire cast was really good. Mamoa gets the praise but Amber Heard was amazing and perfectly cast. The one edge I can give WB/DC over what Marvel has done is their casting of female leads. As with Wonder Woman, they allow their talent to be complete and captivating. That means strength of character but also not afraid to show female skin or deny that their heroes can be feminine as well as tough. Well played and I hope it continues and hope that Marvel learns from them in that regard.<br/><br/>Overall, more fun than I was expecting and if they limit all the over-used CGI cheese I would want to see more of these characters."
"euandaley","6","0","2","3 January 2019"," Too much
","The film overindulged itself in special effects and big money action slow-no shots that leave the entire film feeling less interesting due to a lack of a final big payoff while the final battle is expertly done many of the action sequence before fail to hold you in, due to ""unrealistic"" happenings, there are people who walk unscathed out of situations in which they should not.
And this draws you out of the action ruining the immersion.<br/><br/>This film also falls flat with its villain, Ocean master, who lacks any good motivation unlike the black manta villain placed in the subplot, manta is an expertly executed villain who deserves to be the main villain. All the actors pull out decent performances apart from Wilson, who feels out of place despite looking the part. Some of the stories content and little details may leave general audiences confused, nonetheless this is a good introduction into a new far more badass vision of aquaman."

"msolonsch-63866","3","0","2","3 January 2019"," Seriously...totally underwhelming (Mild spoilers only)

Well, kudos on the trailer, you convinced us to fork out our dollars and go the cinema, but the popcorn was the highlight of the evening!<br/><br/>Ok, ok, I accept that this is a comic/superhero movie, and it's aimed for a teens audience. So, in that respect it was sort of entertaining. But really...Aquaman was such a mish mash.<br/><br/>There were the attempted moralistic tales. First about polluted water. Next about being judgmental about other cultures (in this case the Atlantians being judgmental about the surface world) and a few others tossed in. The movie gets a tick for trying, but any decent environmental studies student could have improved that part of the script.<br/><br/>The scenery was nice and the CGI passable - but certainly not out of this world, even though it was trying to be out of this world.<br/><br/>But onto the weaknesses.<br/><br/>There were the jokes. Hmm, attempted jokes. I don't think I actually laughed at any of them. Next, what's with the 70s style riding on fish creatures with a harness when the main characters all have underwater superpowers.<br/><br/>And what about the plot? Well there are goodies and baddies. A predictable love story. And all that was really just a pretence for sequence after sequence of shoot-em-up on land and in water. And that's why it was so disappointing, it offered very little for the viewer if you were after anything more than an action flick."

He's humorous and much like what we got from him in Justice League. The action sequences and visuals can both be stunning and enjoyable at times.<br/><br/>The script on the other hand, is AWFUL. This dialogue came straight from The Room. People laughed harder in the cinema when the film was trying to be taken seriously than when there was intentional humour.<br/><br/>Black Manta? Complete shoehorn. No need for him to be in the film whatsoever. Despite being a far more interesting villain, they spend all of the time, energy and budget on the stroppy and entitled brother.<br/><br/>People will tell you that it was meant to be a silly and fun movie. Of course it is. That doesn't mean they delivered on that effectively. They couldn't decide if they wanted it to be Thor Ragnarock or Lord of The Rings.<br/><br/>I haven't wanted to leave a movie so much in a long time.

I fell asleep halfway through it and kept checking my watch to see how much longer the movie was. The Dark Knight, though several years older, still has a better story and is still worth investing my time to watch. You feel connected to the characters and even though you know how it's going to end, you still want to see the Dark Knight all the way to its ending. Aquaman feels like a fish of water, you know what's going to happen, everything is boring and repetitive from other superhero movies. We can't compare Aquaman to Marvel, because the way they were written in the comics are very much different. But comparing this to DC movies like the Dark Knight, it clearly falls short of the water a fish out of water needs. Boring, too long, and obviously a terrible super hero movie."

","After years of DC failures I had no hopes for Aquaman, but to my surprise the film was good. Not as good as you'd expect a film of this magnitude should be, but worth watching. Atleast as a friday night popcorn feature.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is that it doesn't really know what it want to be. As Jason Momoa tries to deliver puns without an ounce of comedic timing it seems more like a childish attempt at trying to be funny, but at the same time the film has so many random events that are darker and dumber than they should be. The scene where two frogmen are in a sinking submarine with one trapped under a heavy object seems beyond stupid as they both have breething equipment and should just wait until the room fills with water to be able to lift the object. Instead one pulls out a grenade and kills himself. Allthough it causes no harm to the submarine. This is to setup just an extra enemy of Aquaman, but one that serve no purpose at all. As he comes and goes, and then goes for good, without causing more than a water ripple in the movie overall.
It makes you wonder how a script like that passes the initial reading.
Same with the scene where Atlanna stands on the docks, I get that it's supposed to be a cool scene, but how long has she been standing there. 20 minutes? 2 hours? This film doesn't know what it want's to be; funny, dark, romantic... and it falls short of all of it.<br/><br/>The GCI is amazing though. And the films visuals are worth a view.
Patrick Wilson is great as Orm, and really gives the DCEU a villain that has both depth and clear character motivation. I hope to see more of his character in the future."

Dafoe was obviously the best, and Dolph Lungren was surprisingly good!<br/><br/>Special effects were good, but while technically marvelous, the director seemed to have put little thought or effort into making the effects coherent or supportive of the story.<br/><br/>And the story, well, that's the real problem. There were half-a-dozen stories crammed into this movie. Maybe a better writing team and director could have pulled it off, but this group of moviemakers wasn't up to the challenge. The audience was silent most of the movie. I was the only one who laughed at any of the jokes, and I laugh at anything. Well, there was one funny joke, but I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>Basically, it was pretty lame for 85% of the time, and while Momoa, Kidman, and Dafoe did rally around the reunion story, I don't think anyone cared much about the rest of the plot. Maybe they can pull off a Justice League movie if they hire Joss Whedon or one of the good Marvel directors."

","I feel like DC went ""full Marvel"" with Aquaman. This movie is a light-hearted action/comedy that feels like a dramatic shift from the dark and brooding films that came before it in the DCEU. The storyline doesn't bring anything new to the origin story table, and the acting is hit and miss, but the visual effects are impressive. This isn't one of my favorite superhero movies, but it'll be a fun one to watch with the kids."

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","30 December 2018"," More to Aquaman than a Guy in a Wet Suit
","Well, after watching some rather disappointing movies of late, this one turned out to be quite enjoyable. Okay, it is basically another superhero movie, and one based on a character that none of the main characters on The Big Bang Theory ever want to go dressed as to a fancy dress party. It sort of made me wonder whether Aquaman is one of those characters that nobody really likes all that much, so I was scratching my head as to why it turned out that they decided to do his origin story as the next in the DC Franchise.<br/><br/>Look, if you are expecting anything on the scale of the MCU films, then you are probably going to be a little disappointed. Like all of the other DCEU films, this is basically a standalone film in the shared universe. In fact, I've noticed that the other characters don't even seem to make an appearance, but then again that probably has something to do with them wanting to maintain the focus on Aquaman and not divert the audience's attention to some of the more popular heroes, such as Batman.<br/><br/>I'd probably say that this is your typical origin film, and as far as the story goes it is hardly original. The film is set about a year after the events in Justice League, and Aquaman is being approached to sort out a problem with Atlantis. The thing is that the people of Atlantis have become so annoyed with the surface people treating the ocean as if it were some huge garbage dump that they decide that they want to do something about it. Honestly, I really don't blame them, but then again we happen to be the surface people, and despite all of our crimes against nature, for some reason we always deserve a second chance.<br/><br/>This is where Aquaman comes in. He is to challenge the king for the throne, particularly since he is first born. The problem is that he is the illegitimate child of the queen, so technically he doesn't count. Well, because of that he decides to go on a quest for a legendary trident, that he doesn't actually believe in, but because the princess of one of the kingdoms is encouraging him to do so, namely because she doesn't want to marry the king of Atlantis, he does so anyway. So, you can probably guess what happens from there, and it does include a huge undersea battle, as well as another enemy who wants to kill Aquaman because his father died when they were attempting to capture a Russian sub.<br/><br/>Another thing about this film is that it is also technically a coming of age film, though of course the coming of age happens to be Aquaman, or at least Arthur Curry, becoming king of Atlantis and actually taking his birthright. However, the other thing is that it was a little odd that it came after the Justice League movie, but then again this might have had something to do with them being a little apprehensive when it comes to a character like Aquaman, who tends to be considered somewhat ineffectual. However, I certainly hope this film does dispel that rather unfair association."

I never laughed at the clearly intentionally placed jokes because they almost always fell flat and laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be funny but felt so overdone that they slipped into the ridiculous and felt like a superhero spoof movie (giant black manta helmet, cliche slow motion shots with hair blowing in the wind and longing looks, eating a rose, cringy kissing scene... Really, it was hilarious and I was waiting for Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nilson to turn up at any moment)
At times it felt like a text book rundown of every stylistic means from 'introduction to movie making 101' ca. 1985.<br/><br/>The other thing that bothered me was that they clearly 'borrowed' whole scenes and lines from other movies which I noticed a few times and it kind of ruined it for me.

"briangeorgi","5","0","1","29 December 2018"," Disappointing
","The DC movies have, in my opinion, gotten a consistently bad rap from the critics. I thought Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice, and The Justice League were all better films than was reflected in the ratings and I enjoyed each of them. So the ""55"" metacritic rating wasn't going to deter me when it came to Aquaman. I was prepared to like it. I wanted to like it... I didn't like it.<br/><br/>It seemed not to know if was dark (Batman v. Superman) or light (Justice League) and it was pretty clear after the first 30 minutes that it wasn't going to be aspiring to Wonder Woman-level heights (overrated though that movie was). I've seen every featured actor be solid-to-excellent in other things but the performances were stilted in almost every case. Momoa, in particular, had some painfully awkward dialogue with Amber Heard. It seemed as if they were trying - hard - to force a Hemsworth/Portman-like chemistry that just wasn't there. And above all, it was silly. The theater I was in heard at least a dozen people, myself included, laughing aloud at moments that weren't supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>My 11-year old liked it. To that end, it's perfectly fine. But Marvel and DC have happily raised expectations over the last decade and Aquaman just doesn't make the grade."

","I went to see this with another lady and of course you know we would have gone to see it even if everybody said it sucked, because how could we resist Jason Momoa in a bathing suit? lol. But fortunately it totally didn't suck.<br/><br/>The main character:<br/><br/>The character Arthur Curry is basically King Arthur, but underwater. So it's got that whole ""based on mythology"" thing going for it, like the original Star Wars movie did.<br/><br/>The visuals:<br/><br/>The fx are great. That's fortunate because there are a ton of them. Since so much of this movie is set underwater, and both the underwater and non underwater scenes have a lot of action and fighting, this is really a big cgi fest. If you don't like looking at cgi you won't like it. But this is the new cgi, not that older stuff that will make you seasick because it flickers like older animation. This stuff is seamless, so give it a try.<br/><br/>The story:<br/><br/>There's a lot going on, but basically the two intertwined plots are about a bad guy who is against Aquaman for personal revenge, and a bad guy who is against Aquaman because Game of Thrones and sea Nazis who hate genetic impurity. Oh and a love story. Nicely handled, too. Not the one with Arthur's love interest, that's way too ""defeat big bad and get the girl,"" I mean the one about his parents. I liked it.<br/><br/>The worldbuilding:<br/><br/>Inevitably, because this is a story about a hidden kingdom where the main character has to fight in personal combat in front of a crowd to win the throne, it will be compared to Black Panther, and it's going to fall short in the worldbuilding dept. Black Panther was a fantasy of Africa in an alternate universe in which it had never been colonized; the language, dress, customs, etc. were all based on real African cultures. Aquaman is not like that. This story borrows the popular culture myth of Atlantis, which is not a real place. (OK, I know there is probably an archeologist out there who is going to make an argument for a Greek island, but seriously, pop culture Atlantis is a fairy tale.) It can't possibly measure up, and it wasn't intended to.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Plus, it has sharks. Oh yeah, and some great actors, too. And Russian language, which is always a cool plus for me. And dinosaurs, a cool plus for Betty. It's definitely not just for us ladies. There's more than sex appeal going on here. It's fun, see it."

","Epic scale.
Drops a few cheesy lines.
Schools DC and MCU on how to be grim but enchanting (BB & TDKR excused).
Must have had a whale of a time shooting wave after wave of action sequence.
Heard's performance bouyant with bravado and absolutely gorgeous looks.
Momoa captures the spirit of the half-breed King hook, line, and sinker.
This movie versus the somewhat disappointing The Justice League are oceans apart.
James Wan's horror movie pedigree occasionally floats to the surface to profound effect.
Should help change the tide for DC cinematic universe.
Supporting cast - Morrison, Kidman, Lundgren, Wilson, Dafoe - are sharks at their game.
The intelligent design, beautifully rendered (for the very most part) special effects, shakespearean tragi-familial plot points, and the mesmerising underwater-filmed performances provide the depth to the movie. The frequently shallow dialogue remains submerged under this sea of blockbuster brilliance.
Saw it on Vmax with Atmos, however, the argument that this needs to be seen on a mega-screen doesn't hold water. The sense of scale in this film is presented more with heartfelt, artistic creativity than size alone so if someone tells you that it must be seen on a huge screen, don't take the bait.
Whilst my insistence on piscatorial puns might smell a bit fishy I can assure you that my recommendation to see this in the cinema is above board."

"benv-89995","7","0","1","28 December 2018"," Spectacle Over Story
","The most used word to describe ""Aquaman"" is FUN, and it most certainly delivers in this regard. From the beginning of the movie until the end the movie throws BRILLIANT action scenes at audiences that are directed masterfully and overall paced great to keep audiences ""glued to the screen"". These range from one-on-one fights to GIANT army-on-army battles against the visually diverse settings of the seven seas and the surface world. These different settings for the narrative and spectacle allow for audiences to distinguish the different cultures across the seven seas and allow the film to maintain colourful and vibrant, unlike some DCEU movies. Like stated, though, the directing is truly where the film shines. James Wan brings great impact, scale and intricacy to the way the action and other moments of the film are shot, with a memorable example being a chase scene, unfortunately revealed in trailers for those who have seen them. However, where the directing adds a layer of great spectacle which carries audiences' enjoyment from beginning to end, those critical with story will surely find faults. The narrative's biggest issue, after watching the film, is its underdeveloped and simplistic nature. Characters from the protagonists to the villains lack deep and complex motivation for their actions throughout the film, making some ""confused"" as to why the characters are so persistent in their goals. Also, the film, for some with perhaps lesser knowledge of the character and the world, appears incoherent when ""jumping"" around to different Atlantic civilisation, inter-woven with flashbacks which simply distract from the plot at hand. As for its simplistic nature, it follows a clichÃ©d formula of a ""road trip"" of sorts, accompanied with ""fish out of water"" humour which varies in quality. Finally, there is a revelation in the final act which is predictable and irrelevant. That being said, the film does occasionally hit emotional beats and manages to encapsulate much of the character's heavy law in its run time, though it doesn't balance screen time for some characters as well as most would like. Overall, despite the MANY story problems which may frustrate critical audience members, the pure spectacle alone is a master to behold and the thin plot is overshadowed by the ""fun"" and enjoyable nature of the film which embraces its absurd routes, similar to James Wan's work on ""Fast & Furious 7""."

","I sat sanwiched between my 20 year old daughter and her 13 year old half brother, and they both fell asleep in the middle of this movie! That was surprising because the movie didn't have a dull moment, and was visually amazing. But maybe that was part of the reason: an overload of CGI, anti-aging, and failing to slow down long enough for us to really connect to the characters.
The pros:
Colorful visuals and unique underwater effects.
Fast pacing.
Diverse characters and creatures.
Some fan throwbacks, like the Aquaman telepathy rings.<br/><br/>The cons:
Too much cgi, making it too unbelievable.
Acting was mediocre.
Plot was predicatable.
Time was irrelevant and not respected.
Faces looked almost animated and unrealistic (if that's what saltwater does for aging, I'm in!)
The distinction between humans and meta humans was not always respected, as humans thrown and beaten severely often get right back up and continue the fight. And the unclear rule about who can or cannot breathe above water was not well thought out (they all evolved from land, but then devolved?)<br/><br/>Overall, it was entertaining, but nowhere close to Wonder Woman. I may have even liked Justice League more than this one. Go see it in the theater for the visuals, especially if you have passes or discounts.

I was so looking forward to seeing it in 3D because I saw all the opportunities for 3D to really shine again as it did in Avatar. I'm one of those people that really want 3D to succeed and come back though I may be in the minority. It wasn't very long into the second time through, watching it in 3D, that it struck me. The whole movie is just too dark.I don't mean that in the sense that it's evil. I mean it's just too dark. There we're so many scenes that would have been so much better had we as the audience be able to see them and more light.

It is my belief that are younger movie Makers just don't have the background and basic fundamentals....
How bright does a picture need to be or how long to display text so people have time to read it are just two things that popped out for me. I believe DC missed a huge opportunity here.

","'Aquaman' is almost the best DC film since the Dark Knight trilogy - it's certainly more fun, colourful and enjoyable than 'Justice League', 'Batman v Superman' and 'Man of Steel'. 'Wonder Woman' is still the benchmark, but only just. The film works well as both an origin story and a coming-of-age story. Arthur (Momoa) is the offspring of Tom (Morrison), a lighthouse keeper, and exiled Queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (Kidman), making him half-man, half-Atlantean and the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis.<br/><br/>We see Arthur trained by Vulko (Dafoe) in flashbacks and helped in the present by Mera (Heard). To stop his step-brother Orm (Wilson) from starting a war with the ""surface dwellers"", Arthur has to embark on a journey to track down an ancient trident that will make him King of Atlantis and unite the two realms. There's enough tongue-in-cheek-ness and charm from Momoa to help you past some of the daft moments - Manta's suit (overall a weak villain), octopus drums, plesiosaurs, underwater fire and giant seahorses.<br/><br/>It's not too long (just over 2 hours) and is fast-paced and much of the story makes it feel like a cross between 'Indiana Jones' and 'Lord of the Rings', with many of the underwater colours reminiscent of 'Avatar' - none of which are bad things. The battle at the end is all a bit absurd, but there's so much colour, action and humour to make it worthwhile. Wish all DC films were as joyful as this!"
"baibing-chen","6","0","1","26 December 2018"," Good visuals, bad dialogue
","Pros: you can tell they spent a lot of money on CGI and the visual effects, which were amazing. The action sequences were also above average (this is coming from me, a person who think almost every fight scene in Hollywood movie sucks 'cause I compared them to Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies in the 90's). The acting was good in MY opinion, but I'll get to what overshadowed the acting in the Cons section. The storyline was decent, they at least TRIED to make it relevant and that the foe had a purpose, compared to Steppenwolf in the previous movie that we should no longer speak of.<br/><br/>Cons: The amount of cheesiness in this movie almost killed me. I mean this is pretty close to the first superman movie where I just laughed for the entirety of the movie. Given how good some of these actors were, I truly felt bad that they had to deliver some of these lines, and I honestly don't understand how they could've delivered these lines on set without bursting into crying laughter. The second con is the story. Yes it was better than justice league, but that's not saying much. Yes they gave the villains a purpose to do what they did, but they didn't explore the characters or even try to make them more unique. Too many dramatic scenes with explosions out of nowhere and people walking out of the water slowly. This is not Bay Watch or 007.<br/><br/>Overall: I didn't go into the movie with high expectations, and I came out not surprised in any way. I am happy with the visuals and actions in this movie, but I suggest the writers put more time in making the dialogues better in the future DC movies."

Same can be said for Black Manta, who is the standout character of the movie, with a good motivation for doing what he does and what he will continue to do.<br/><br/>Cons: Ocean Master aka King Orm, the main Villian has some great scenes, and some motivation that does not really blossom into something meaningful.
The movie can get a little cheesy, especially with those close ups.<br/><br/>All in all, as I've said it's a solid movie that stands on its own, something that cannot be said for DC's previous endeavours. Along with Wonder Women and Aquaman, DC seems to be heading in the right direction."

","Let's face it, for the most part DCEU movies critically have not been received well. An ambitious project by director James Wan, Aquaman attempted to turn this ""losing streak"" around, and did it work? YES. Aquaman delivers on almost every aspect. The characters in this film are very well developed, the cinematography is exceptional, the story has high stakes and a surprisingly good antagonist. Any worries had about Aquaman from 2017's ""Justice League"" are completely thrown out the window.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is at the top of his game in this movie, showing off both his dramatic and comedic chops. Amber Heard also puts in a respectable performance as Mera.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone. Here's hoping this is the start of a new direction for DC and their films!"
"anvonbank","4","0","2","25 December 2018"," Recycled tropes and stilted dialogue ruin a character that ruined the inspired casting of Momoa
","Ever since he was cast as Aquaman, I was excited to see Jason Momoa make this character his own. I enjoyed his appearance in the otherwise problematic Justice League and this should have been an enjoyable thrill ride. It certainly could have been.<br/><br/>To be specific and somewhat spoiler-y, my primary issue with this film really didn't have anything to do with Momoa's performance, nor Aquaman as a hero. There were plenty of scenes which captured the titular character well. If course there was going to be lots of underwater battles and even talking to fish. All that was there. Trouble was, for me, there were very few scenes that weren't ripped off from better films.<br/><br/>A few of the many examples: young Arthur is bullied while admiring beautiful creatures behind glass, and then he communicates with said creatures and they assisted in not only thwarting the bully but helping to reveal his own powers. If that doesn't ring a bell, just rewatch the early scene from the first Harry Potter film and you'll see essentially the same scene play out. How to Train Your Dragon offers similar material, both in the long lost mother in the lost world, but also in befriending the big baddie (which even looks like the king sized dragon) to fight his battle. The display of the wonders of Atlantis, er...Pandora...is so very reminicent of Cameron's idyllic world they should have paid royalties. And the usurper to the throne, battle, disgrace, and redemption so closely resembled the central storyline of Black Panther, I wished that film was playing instead. Nearly every sequence immediately called forth another, better film, and for me, Aquaman played more as a supercut homage than an original film. Of course, common themes and tropes abound in big budget films such as this, but generally they reframe them into something new altogether. There was nearly nothing original in this film.<br/><br/>That is not to say it was completely devoid of entertainment. The third act was by far the strongest, despite following standard superhero format. The sea battle was exciting, though quite similar to the land battle of Avatar. The final mano a mano includes the requisite good guy fighting bad guy throwdown, just as you might expect.<br/><br/>In all, I felt that what promised to be a new take on a weak DC character, falls not on its vision, but in a lazy script that neither expands this character's interest, creates excitement to ever see this character again. That is a pity, because even after seeing this film, I still love Jason Momoa's Aquaman. I just wish the makers of this film did as well."
"croechance","2","0","1","25 December 2018"," A series of great movies meshed together into an abomination.
","The first twenty minutes of the film are well worth its own movie. After that, the movie struggles to find its overall tone, message, story, and any original thought. The ""inventive CGI"" are just action clips from other action blockbusters that were actually worth the money. Some examples include the rooftop scene from the fast and furious franchise, pitch black, a sudden appearance of a kaiju similar to Godzilla or Pacific Rim, and journey to the center of the earth, plus many more. I'm much more a DC fan than marvel, but marvel movies are so much more worth the time and money. The income of this movie is nothing more than a marketing scheme by the movie industry. I honestly hope that DC will pull a new 52 scenario and completely restart their franchise."

","I would actually rate this movie 8.5 out of 10 and not 9, because it's definitely better than an 8, but it isn't really a 9 due to reasons that I will get into; however I will be generous and round it up rather than down.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds of this movie are pretty much exceptional, barring minor pacing and plot issues. The creativity is unreal, and I have to admire James Wan and the entire cast for doing such a great job and giving Aquaman such a distinctive and fresh thematic and audiovisual style that I found immensely enjoyable, and for being unafraid to actually try and tell a story.<br/><br/>Without spoilers, these minor plot points are eventually explained, but suffice it to say that it's better to give your audience all of the necessary information BEFORE your action sequence starts rather than after it, or you risk the audience asking 'why is this happening' rather than engaging in the action.<br/><br/>Still, it didn't really detract from the movie too much, and all cases where this happen are eventually explained properly, if you can be patient and just roll with it for a bit.<br/><br/>However, from a logical standpoint, the movie kind of fails in the third act. Too many parts were a bit of a stretch for me or just flat out CGI nonsense (lighting flares underwater?), and is pretty much the only reason I'm not rating this 10/10.<br/><br/>Yes it's a superhero movie, I understand that, but it doesn't mean we need to throw normal physics out of the window entirely.<br/><br/>Overall, a very fun and engaging movie with an actual plot and surprising emotional depth (pun intended), but just roll with it when it gets too silly towards the end."

You'll be entertained if your expectations aren't too high. But there's some bad acting and really cringe worthy lines. Some of the plot doesn't make sense, and the parts that do are 100% predictable.<br/><br/>Ordinarily I would give this movie a 6 or even a 5, but there are two redeeming graces that make it stand out.<br/><br/>First, the visuals. Yes, about 80% of what you seen on screen is CGI, but it blends very well and does not look out of place. If you don't notice it, who cares?<br/><br/>In the age of Marvel, Star Wars, and other spectacles, it's not easy to impress me with visuals alone. What really pushes this one over the edge is the art direction. It's creative, beautiful, and sometimes frightening.<br/><br/>The second redeeming aspect of this movie is a very heart warming love story. It's not even close to the focus of the movie. A second love story gets much more time, and falls completely flat.<br/><br/>But the first love story is a surprising spot of tenderness in a blow um ups blockbuster.<br/><br/>This movie is a solid 7. The people giving it 10s are raising your expectations way too high.

The costumes felt like a power ranger costume designer came up with them and that further added to tonal inconsistencies.

""Aquaman"" is so bad that it was actually kind of good... I mean it has no screenplay, absolutely no acting, no structure - nothing. But at the same time for some reason I can't say it was boring to watch. It was a plain circus, just a ridiculous show, a performance full of booms and baams...<br/><br/>In the beginning there was a Russian submarine hijacked by pirates... Aquaman swam around while wearing his usual rock'n'roll jeans and boots, decided to help the Russians, killed all the pirates (without forgetting to pose heroically in between), pushed the submarine from the ocean to the surface (in reality that would kill everybody in the submarine) and the submariner were like ""It's Aquaman! Hooray! You saved us!"". So... after such an amazing start you just relax, let your sarcasm loose and try to enjoy this crappy ass show.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of the first ""Capitan America"". Dumb, ""serious"" (the characters try to copy Marvel heroes and joke, but without any success) and all story just falls apart. I'm really sorry for Nicole Kidman,Willem Dafoe and of course Patrick Wilson. They are great actors and now they have to be a part of this... Though it looks like this movie is an absolute top for Jason Momoa. He doesn't look like a real actor, though I seriously believed the director would surely use his natural charisma. He didn't. Literally anybody could play Aquaman in this movie. The role is so dumb and empty you could put anybody in those ""ocean king of Vegas"" clothes.

"randycubs","4","0","1","22 December 2018"," Potatoes Rating: Instant Mashed
","Allow me to quote Raj from The Big Bang Theory. ""I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.""<br/><br/>Oh, DC. I thought you'd learned! Wonder Woman was proof, wasn't it? All of the elements of great movie storytelling were present. It was wonderfully cast, carefully scripted. The film evolved at a crisp, but comfortably artistic pace, a tribute to careful editing. And when the magnificent amazon finally revealed her power at exactly the right moment as she stepped majestically onto the battlefield? Goosebumps.<br/><br/>So, how do you explain the obvious regression of Aquaman?<br/><br/>The casting is...meh. Jason Momoa is a fine, physical specimen of the fish man, but his hero is startlingly flat. The rest of the cast might work fine if this was a made for television movie, but it isn't. It's a major theatrical vehicle and DC has failed to bring in a suitable stable of supporting actors to carry the weight. And even though it's unfair to continually compare the DC universe to Marvel's, the parallel is unescapable. Ant Man, who ranks in the Marvel pantheon probably even lower than where Aquaman stands in the DC hero collection, carries two stand-alone movies effortlessly. Aquaman struggles from the beginning of the film, through its tedious center, to its final cheesy conclusion to justify the film's reason to live. Storytelling is the key, and where Wonder Woman earned a well-deserved A, Aquaman receives an equally merited D. Perhaps if the writers had chosen to meditate for two hours on the character's back story and built methodically toward a big reveal, I might be submitting a very different review. But instead the writing bumps along like an old roller coaster, jerking us through rickety rails of track, always in a hurry to get us to the steep climb and the furious fall to the end. None of it is satisfying. Instead of feeling like a big budget superhero film, the movie increasingly feels like a sad mishmash of Godzilla and Finding Nemo, although Nemo did a much better job of creating an interesting undersea world.<br/><br/>DC continues to give us heroes but can't seem to connect us to them. It's the primary flaw in the DC universe. It's characters are too cold and detached from the audience. It's a problem that will only be fixed through better movie storytelling.<br/><br/>I rank movies like I rank potatoes, because I love potatoes. Aquaman receives my Instant Mashed Potatoes ranking which roughly translates this way. They will do if you're in a hurry, but they generally suck. And in this case, Raj was right. These taters suck underwater."

Everything seemed to come really easy to the MC and the plot was predictable. Like REALLY predictable. By the end of the film, only people I cared about were the parents of aqua man. Another thing that was really annoying was the gross over-use of music. You know that powerful crescendo movies use whenever the main villain hits the screen? Well this film used it. Like Eleven Times. Every time ANY antagonist came to the screen you'd hear the loud minor chords, and every time aqua man accomplished the tiniest feet the music got loud and majestic. After 30 minutes of the film the sounds will really start to annoy you and you'll be begging for a quiet scene. In general this was certainly not the worst film, but wasn't the best either.

"x-88466","5","0","7","22 December 2018"," Same like justice league, audience can't join the movie.
","First, I didn't read any Aquaman comic books or any DC comic either. But I watched 'Justice League'. I don't want talk too much about 'Justice League'.but after watch any DC's film, make me feel liked I'm like freshman in DC math class, my teacher is using few day teaching me what is math, then my teacher is taking me to finish final immediate. My points is Aquaman had so many story plot didn't talk same like Justice League. But director is pushing so hard to finish story. I knew DCU is tried to copying 'The Avengers'. Before 'Avengers', MCU already produce lots of films to tell us what is Iron man, captain America, ect. We were watching every hero grows up. But DCU is trying to put equivalent job in a film. As same as Aquaman, director Wen is pushing story so fast. I the sorry had four different water race, but he didn't talk too much about it. And he didn't talk too much about human, it shows like this is all story is about other world stuff, it is not link with human, but the acctually conflict is cause human. Wen didn't show enough.
Secondly, 'Aquaman' showed early in China. I'm Chinese, so I read some news and comments from China internet like Weibo before I watch this film. 'Aquaman' is successed in China, most comments said 'this is good movie, good CG, good actor, so-so story. But good director.' I agree that. By the way, this film is better than other DC film, but all had same problem. So my question is these problem is made by every DC directors, or because DCU' management wants using less money for making as same money as MCU.
Thank you for reading, sorry for bad grammar."

","Good action movie, though ""dramatic"" moments built in all around made me smile a lot))). Clearly, not the best DC creation."
"WylieJJordan","6","0","2","21 December 2018"," Uterly fantastic
","The story is faily simple and largely predictible but only very loosely connected to reality, which may appeal to many viewers. Most of the film consists of eye-blistering computer animation that I found slightly boring, but the accompanying very loud noise keeps one alert."
"lawrenceconwayvulcan","9","0","6","20 December 2018"," Who is making Fish jokes?
","Long a joke for many non comic book fans thanks to the film bearing his name Aquaman is now a much more respected character. Jason Moama gives the character a sense of place. There are an number of great action set pieces. the first of which is Arthur fighting priates on a submarine while another has Arthur and Mera (played by Amber Heard) have to fight and elude an number of baddies. With support from the likes of Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren and Julie Andrews providing the voice of a giant sea monster. Aquaman offers great entertainment."
"franke-44831","8","0","3","17 December 2018"," I can't say it was DA BOMB
","Ok I rarely like comic flicks so I could be bias and I had to keep reminding myself that it is a comic story.<br/><br/>First of course the aesthetics were second to non although I wondered how Nicole Kidman could fit her outfit 20 yrs later but I personally really liked the sea scenes.<br/><br/>ALSO THE ONLY REASON I WENT TO SEE IT WAS JASON MAOMA LORD HELP ME (sorry Lisa for my dirty thoughts)<br/><br/>Ok the plot could have meshed together better. Some areas I was lost like wtf is that who is that why did he die so quick who was he really I thought he was going to be a strong contender. There were a lot of Greek and Egyptian references and that thing aquaman rode on the head looked like Baphomet (like seriously guys why). Again the storyline could have more put together in some places it was very elementary and cliche BUT AGAIN it's a comic story so it serves its purpose!<br/><br/>I did enjoy it I wish more scenes were under water"

","It is one of the better movie in the dceu.The visuals were just mind blowing and Jason Mamoa was just phenomenal.However ,the narrative could hsve been better and one thing and i didnt like in the movie were the scenes were fights were provoked .They looked almost like jump scares.Nevertheless,the movie gives an overall delight and joy to watch it in the cinema"

","The story was okay, the acting was alright, the visual were incredible, but that feeling.. I'm telling you, it really felt like you were watching a comicbook and this is the first time I truly feel that, they are not trying to be relistic, they finilly let go that Nolan religion and embrase what they truly are with the costums and everything and men, that's something worth watching."
"dinds3-563-136910","10","0","2","16 December 2018"," The Best DC movie ever!
","Damn Aquaman is the real deal!!!!!<br/><br/>After watching the portrayal of Jason Momoa as the Aquaman, I now have a favorite movie from the DC universe. Its more than all the Batman movies, its more than all the Superman movies!!!! or any other DC movies that came out already. The best thing that this movie has are the nods to some familiar scenes that we may never realized we've grown in to it. The discovery channel documentary about mermans and how they came to be. The zombie apocalypse with that torch waving among the hordes of Trench!. The G.I. JOE scenes and the James Bond chase scenery in Italy. The Journey to the center of the earth, the jurassic park scenery. The nod to the Little Mermaid, not to obviously see the whole Ariel look of the princess but man look at that scenery in the Atlantis! The Octopus drummer, the turtles, the ring of fire, the throne!!!! Ursulas pet!!!! and who would forget Sebastian being too OP as Aquaman's grand finale!<br/><br/>Love how they build the story without messing up with the entire concept. Love how they build him (Jason Momoa) and finally seeing him in his suite.<br/><br/>Im excited to see his next enemy! That helmet from Black Manta at the end seems familiar!!!!"
"carloscatej","6","0","4","16 December 2018"," THE SECOND BEST MOVIE OF DC
","With a great performance by the cast and good special effects, this film ends up being entertaining and at times exciting, it would have improvements by some secondary characters and parts of the plot that seem a bit boring."
"sayonarasensei-53294","9","0","1","16 December 2018"," All HAil to the king!!
","James Wan you're the guy !! already since the trailers this movie already promised a lot, and it was a beautiful one of a trip to atlantis, sensational !! wan manages to deliver the basics of the hero's origin despite feeling a bit rushed in telling the story and the movie having 2 hours and 20 minutes, the action of the film is wonderful and the soundtrack that accompanied the action scenes were amazing, I had the slight sensation of the action of the film always staggering and getting bigger and bigger until arriving in the epic final battle lord of the rings style and still see it in imax and with a sensational sound, i was totally delivered, the movie has its problems, some jokes, and there, musics badly placed in strange moments causing a climax break, I missed a tragedy in the film at least I think atlana should die, I thought that Nicole was only going to make this movie but it seems that no, I missed it too, a little more drama but the film compensates for this in all other issues, until I see arthur curry from comics in momoa in some glimpses of his acting, there after he returned to be momoa kkkkk, cast, score, ok script, wan managed to adapt atlantis throne without putting the league together which I found very skillful on his part.
So I say that the result is more positive than negative, the films of heroes have to be like that, embrace the exaggeration and that the wan did with mastery, do not try to put some kind of sense of reality in something that does not have, stories in comics are very exaggerated and I want to see it on the cinema screen and also have to respect the original material and try to be as faithful as possible to these characters in their respective media, now all that remains is to wait for the 2nd to come."
"surya-teja850","7","0","2","16 December 2018"," Good movie !! But in parts..
","The much awaited DC movie was good, but in parts... The good parts were supported by splendid performances by Jason Momoa and Amber Heard.. Nicole Kidman did a fine job as well.. The visual effects were great and Battle scenes were legit! The only issue with the movie is that the storyline was little weak and stretched (I got bored in few occasions). But it was compensated by the caste and direction.. So I would recommend watching this ""popcorn movie"" over the weekend, but don't expect too much out of it.."

"karthicdm","7","0","2","15 December 2018"," Aquaman-The DC's Thor
","Comic based superhero movies are like making a movie out of stories from epics of India-Ramayanam & Mahabaratham. Most of the people already knows the story, The movie's success will be based on the way it is presented. I noticed one key point for the success of these superhero movies- Tell the story from the beginning. Deliver it slowly. Say it like you tell to a kid during his/her bed time. Most of the successful superhero movies are falling under this line. Batman triology, MCU Avengers Universe, Man of steel, Wonder Woman all succeeded because they told the story from the start and they told it slowly. If they decided to hurry things up then the result will end up like Batman Vs Superman & Justice League. Thankfully Famous horror film director James Wan made it slow and had patience to tell the story from the start.<br/><br/>Aquaman is not so well known character for Indian Audience unlike Ironman & Batman, atleast for me, I dont know Aquaman much. I just know he is a member of Justice league, king of underwater universe called Atlantis, he can control water and he talks to fish. What is his origin? How he became the king of Atlantis? what is his Power and weakness? His emotions, his family everything is explained clearly in this movie. As STR said in vinnaithaandi varuvaya ""Avaru epadi ithukulla vantharu, avaru epadi Don aagi Billa aguraru"" Thats what the Aquaman is all about.<br/><br/>Visuals, Graphics and Locations gives a pleasant watching experience. This is the main plus point of this movie. Throughout the movie we can witness the eye pleasing experience specially with the 3D glasses on. Be it an isolated light house, underwater shots, Sahra desert, a village in italy, fantasy worlds beneath water everything was captured excellently. It was like seeing the dreams without even sleeping.<br/><br/>Slow paced screenplay and telling the story from the start can be considered as both pro and con of this movie. Though we get to know the character very well, the movie feels lengthy and without much twists and turns, so most of the scenes are predictable. Background score gives life to the visuals. Bgm's are good in all scenes.<br/><br/>Similarities between this movie and ""Thor"" are really surprising. Be it the fantasy world, the story and the characters, this movie reminds us of MCU's Thor in many scenes. The scope and screenspace given to Female characters in this movie are something what Indian directors should learn from. So summing it up Aquaman with its bed time tale kind of story is a visual experience to be enjoyed in theatre once.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.25/5"
"kitellu","7","0","2","15 December 2018"," Visually Impressive and Stunning....
","I am not really much of a fan of comic book movies, apart from the Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan, but I really enjoyed watching Aquaman for what it is. It is not the best movie ever made but it is very entertaining and I never got bored by the running time also.<br/><br/>Kudos to James Wan who created a mesmerizing world for Atlantis. The visuals are really spectacular, some of the best I have ever seen on screen, and you really must watch this movie in a cinema to appreciate the art behind it. As I already said, the direction never feels too slow or boring even thought there is nothing new to the plot. It is effective in it's simplicity and I was entertained throughout the whole movie. The performances by the actors are good especially by Jason Mamoa who portrays Aquaman effectively.<br/><br/>My only minor issue with this movie is the script which I found a bit weak and cheesy. Although I do not mind some humor, in certain scenes I felt that they went a bit over the top with some dialogue and it was distracting for my liking.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very entertaining movie with really impeccable visuals and great action sequences. It is the perfect movie for Christmas as many generations of movie goers will surely enjoy!"

","Aquaman delivers on all fronts. The story isn't too farfetched, the action sequences are superb and the actors themselves are great. Could argue the length of the film is a bit too long and I would've liked to have seen more of Dolph Lungdren's character"
"pakkoui","6","0","2","15 December 2018"," Nice superhero movie but...
","Ok i get the hype and i like the action part of the movie,cgi was great...but a lot of kliches ,fully predictable and finaly and extremly importan to me, i like superheroe movies that are connected in a universe with other superheroes to be very carefull with what they present ,especially in a universe where superman exist and you know if he gets involve things go bad for the bad guys. First of all didnt the atlantians know about the existans of superman? How would they rage war on surface if a guy can come and kill their king in 2 seconds? When the atlantians attack surface ""warning"" and obviously a couple of thousand people where kill the justice league just said ok aquaman has this no worries? Atleast in the other movies their was no justice league or superman didnt exist. I can understand if the movie didnt involve surface to contain the movie around aquaman but from the moment that the world is in danger you would expect master of the seas getting a batstar and superman wiping the floor with his face. I can't get over these plotholes in a movie like this with a budget of 160 mil and other movies to be made that are connected to that universe with similar budgets and not one person thinking ok lets not f.. the story and try to be logical here...! Finally if batman knew about the guy that came from outerspace, he knew about the fish people too...same goes for superman! Marvel did a prety good job with that and before aquaman so did dc...now you can expect darkseid coming in a batman solo movie and a lot of close ups (a lot) and with unrelatable soundtrack. :)"
"sumit-chawla","9","0","3","14 December 2018"," WELCOME BACK DC
","Better movie than following MCU movies
* Thor
* Thor 2
* Thor: Ragnarok
* Spiderman: homecoming
* Doctor strange
* Ant-Man
.. yet some of the above mentioned MCU movies have better Metacritic score ..
... bias against DC , that's it ..
... Anyway , imo this was the best DC movie , even better than WW tho I didn't like last few minutes of both movies. Too much CGI .
... Aquaman vs Black manta & Meera vs atlantian soldiers scene was the best scene of the movie ..
... Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are BADASS combo
... Better villian than black panther but I loved panther fighting scenes more because those looked more real ... This movie on the other hand is 95 percent CGI and I just hated that fighting sequence against that monster ...
Was going to give 8/10 but Nicole Kidman stole the show at the end .. Her 3-4 scenes are perhaps the best part of the movie .. 1 extra mark for her ..
... Background score was ok-ish but better than justice league but comes no way close to WW and BvS.
Overall , a solid comeback from DC .. 100 times better movie than justice league .. well done DC ..
Looking forward to Shazam next yr .."
"Tevinr93","7","0","3","14 December 2018"," Best DCEU Movie to date.
","Aquaman, a character I went in only knowing very little most of which coming from DC Justice League.<br/><br/>Going in I wasn't as hyped as I usually am for a comic book action movie but I have to say what a beautiful film it was, the scenes in Atlantis were just breathtaking and the costumes were great. first act sets up everything I need to know about Aquaman and where this story is going. Some of the comedy beats in this film just didn't work for me personally and tho his suit looked awesome Black manta just wasn't as exciting as a future villain, his hate for Aquaman is understandable but seems like a very underwhelming villain for now, I'm sure he'll improve come the sequel. The final act was just as great bar a few scenes and they all lived happily ever after.<br/><br/>Looking forward to what DC has to offer in the future, this was a great first step in the right direction."
