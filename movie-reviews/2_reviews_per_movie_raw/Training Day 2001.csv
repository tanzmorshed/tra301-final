","I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.<br/><br/>I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.<br/><br/>Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.<br/><br/>Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!"
"ExpendableMan","9","121","141","15 May 2006"," Fantastic, Denzel Washington's finest hour
","Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>Set over the course of twenty four hours, the film whisks Ethan Hawke's naive young police officer onto an introductory day of Narcotics work under Alonzo's tutelage. As the hours go by, Hawke is subjected to more and more violence as the heat and paranoia of suburban Los Angeles combined with his loose cannon superior officer play a heavy toll on his nerves. Consequently, the film is very much a two man story with Hawke and Washington playing off against each other expertly as polar opposites. One young, inexperienced and a firm believer in the rule book, the other older, more cynical and twisted by all his years on the streets into a bull-headed monster.<br/><br/>The story itself is fraught with tension. Alonzo forcing his young protégé to smoke PCP at gunpoint is just the start and from there on the pulse pounding never stops. The execution scene where Hawke realises just how far gone his partner is for example is one of nail-biting pressure and shortly after, his encounter with a trio of Mexican gang members is jaw dropping, working as the exact moment you realise how much hot water he has found himself in.<br/><br/>The end result is nothing less than a brilliant thriller. Hawke and Washington make for a phenomenal double act and the pace only occasionally lets up to allow the characters time to breathe and establish the depth that makes you care for them more. Highly, highly recommended so long as you're prepared to be absolutely terrified of Denzel Washington for years to come."
"tburke85","8","46","53","13 June 2009"," Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller
","Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","10","147","187","28 December 2006"," Stunning performance by Denzel Washington...
","""Training Day"" was a very good movie. I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, ""Black Hawk Down""...no clichés, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. ""Training Day"" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, ""not Oscar material"" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?"
"bkoganbing","9","55","68","19 April 2008"," Street Justice Dispensed
","Ethan Hawke, bright eyed and innocent, reports to his training officer for his first day on the job in narcotics in the LAPD. He never could have fathomed just how much he would learn on that very first Training Day.<br/><br/>His training officer is Denzel Washington, a thirteen year veteran on the police who's put in a few years in plainclothes in Narcotics. He certainly has the experience, but just what kind of experience and what he imparts to Hawke is the subject of Training Day.<br/><br/>A film like Training Day will rise and fall with the performances of these two characters since one or the other and mostly both is on screen from the beginning. Fortunately both Washington and Hawke complement each other's performances like jigsaw puzzle fit.<br/><br/>It is no accident that Denzel Washington won his second Oscar, his first as Best Actor. This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. Washington is at all times, charming, capable, corrupt, violent, street smart, and arrogant. What I liked most about it is how the various facets of this character are revealed bit by bit to the audience and to Hawke though not at the same time.<br/><br/>As for Ethan Hawke it takes him to realize just exactly what he's dealing with in a training officer. Hawke was nominated himself as Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jim Broadbent for Iris. Still it remains his career role so far.<br/><br/>Corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department isn't exactly a new story. In fact one of the supporting players, Scott Glenn who plays a drug peddler and well, did another film about LAPD corruption in Extreme Justice. LA Confidential also dealt with this issue recently, another fine film.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. He's a guy who dispenses more street justice than going through the traditional system. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>And I won't say what it is, but you've got to see Training Day to find out."

","If you ask me, TRAINING DAY is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Harris (Denzel Washington) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish."

","In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!! A must watch"

","Wow! What a superb film, Denzel Washington at his superb best. Denzel plays a terrific part as Alonzo Harris, a cop with a dark personality.<br/><br/>From the moment you set eyes on him you can relies that Alonzo is a feisty character, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke provides excellent backup but Denzel steals the show. I don't want to give an plot lines away but there are only three movies in cinema history I have given 10/10, and this one was so close to being number four.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope to see Denzel put in another performance like this one.<br/><br/>Plot is excellent as it leads you into false sense of securities and even shouting at the TV set.<br/><br/>I loved every breathtaking moment of this film and I am sure you will too.<br/><br/>Quite extraordinary."
"seymourblack-1","9","11","12","27 January 2012"," Authentic, Intelligent & Utterly Engrossing
","This movie's a top quality police drama that's not only violent, tense and exciting but also authentic, intelligent and utterly engrossing. It's set in the most dangerous neighbourhoods of L.A. where undercover cops regularly have contact with drug dealers and gangsters and also face high-risk situations on an almost daily basis. The men who undertake this work have to assume many of the characteristics of the criminals they pursue in order to be accepted and in so doing are expected to avoid being sucked into behaving in the same way as the people they're seeking to bring to justice. Needless to say, not every officer manages to do this.<br/><br/>Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)is an ambitious young rookie who wants to advance his career by becoming a member of an elite squad of undercover officers who work under the leadership of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Alonzo agrees to take Jake on a one-day ride-along, Jake's thrilled, eager to learn and hopeful that he can show that he has the qualities needed to be a successful member of Alonzo's team.<br/><br/>Jake is naive, idealistic and totally unprepared for the events that he'll experience during his training day. He's initially disconcerted by Alonzo's repartee and sense of humour and is later unsettled by some of his mentor's practices, which seem incredibly unorthodox. Alonzo has many years of experience in undercover work and so Jake is reluctant to challenge his methods too strongly.<br/><br/>After observing the sale of some drugs in a park, Alonzo chooses not to make any arrests but simply acts in a very threatening manner towards the buyers and then confiscates their drugs. When Jake sees a young girl in an alley being sexually assaulted by two men, he overpowers them on his own and is then surprised when Alonzo decides not to report the incident after viciously beating up the two attackers. Alonzo knows that the girl's related to a gang member who will ensure that the two men are suitably punished but Jake is appalled by the use of this kind of street justice.<br/><br/>Later, Jake accompanies Alonzo when he uses a fake search warrant to enter a drug dealer's house so that he can steal the dealer's money and on another occasion when Alonzo and the rest of his squad kill a drug dealer who used to be a cop so that they can steal his money. Jake refuses to take a share of the proceeds but then is forced to change his mind after Alonzo threatens to frame him for the murder.<br/><br/>During his day with Alonzo, Jake is forced at gunpoint to smoke marijuana (laced with P.C.P.) and later pressured into drinking whisky and beer. He also learns that Alonzo owes a large amount of money to some Russian gangsters from Las Vegas and that the money stolen from the drug dealers is to be used to pay them off.<br/><br/>Jake's recognition of how corrupt Alonzo had become had grown as the day progressed but things then become even more threatening when he realises during a visit to a Latino gangster's home that Alonzo has abandoned him and the gang are determined to kill him.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" contains plenty of action and violence but it's all relevant to the story and is very effective in portraying the level of danger that Jake finds himself in. The way in which the story unfolds draws the audience into identifying with the hapless trainee and in so doing makes the whole drama extremely gripping. The initial meeting of Alonzo and Jake is fascinating and the way that their relationship develops turns out to be both interesting and unpredictable. The inclusion of sequences filmed on location in the neighbourhoods where the action is set, enhances the realistic feel of the whole project and the authentic sounding dialogue strengthens this further.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance captures perfectly Alonzo's unique combination of charm and menace and Ethan Hawke is extremely impressive as a young guy who experiences the most eventful and memorable day of his life."

","This movie impressed me by its great quality in all ways, the story, thrilling with great police detective action and the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the acting performances of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke; they put his soul on the characters making this movie a total delight for those who like action films with intelligent scripts and also like for high quality films.<br/><br/>About the Movie: Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a rookie police officer with a good curriculum that is assigned to a one day trial day in order to qualify for a narcotics division in Los Angeles. Hawke meets then detective Alonzo Haris (Denzel Washington) who was assigned as trainer and evaluator for this rookie. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to ""protet and to serve"" of Alonzo. In this day Hoyt will meet a true challenge and will face the total opposite way to proceed from the one he learned in the academy; he will also face some of the more dangerous neighborhoods and streets of Los Angeles."
"the_muffler","9","93","134","23 February 2006"," It's my favourite movie
","I remember being lent this on DVD during the summer holidays by a mate soon after it was out. I must have watched it every day/second day for about a month! I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're ""Just people and they always were"" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).<br/><br/>The movie isn't the fastest paced one around - there are some slow moments but they are played out meaningfully due to some great acting talent which gels the scenes together well. The more you watch it, the more subtle lines and actions you will pick up which make this movie authentic.<br/><br/>Overall, to each his own. I have found this to be one of my favorite movies due to great acting, great directing, great casting (Hawk, Washington, Scott Glen etc) and an interesting storyline."

","Denzel is a real chameleon. This is a sinister and likable personality...all because of him. Enter Ethan Hawke's character, officer Jake Hoyt. With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game. <br/><br/>The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.<br/><br/>From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore. Denzel Washington, should be applauded for the part that he became ' wholly ' involved in. Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk! <br/><br/>Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, ""Just wanting to do the right thing"" type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....<br/><br/>Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","5","5","27 February 2018"," Training Day is a prime example of how just one scene can elevate a film to greatness.
","You all know the scene I'm talking about. Alonzo's monologue against the street that he thought would cooperate with him. That scene. Urgh, genius. A rookie narcotics officer is paired with a more experienced, albeit corrupt, detective for a day of training in the urban streets of Los Angeles. What looks like a semi-professional day on the job turns out to be a nightmare for the rookie. There are a ridiculous amount of positives, but unfortunately there are various negatives that prevents the police drama from being classed as a classic. At its core, this is a character study. A twisted, demented and self-assured detective who may have started out with the right intentions, but gradually becomes corrupted by the streets. The screenplay consistently reaffirms the idea that it is the environment that changes a person. Being adaptable under given scenarios. The depiction of the streets of Los Angeles and the black and white segregation is rather prominent throughout the film's runtime. Yet it feels extremely real. It is the gritty and dark undertone embedded within the narrative that intrigues you and makes you invested in the characters. Speaking of our protagonist(s), Ethan Hawke was sublime as the naive rookie who just wants to help the world, one crime at a time. However, Denzel Washington just owns every scene in what I can only describe as his best performance. His acting was ferocious. Conveying confidence and fear simultaneously. David Ayer's best script (although that's not saying much...) and Antoine Fuqua's best directorial effort. It's just a shame the ending was unsatisfying with too many plot conveniences throughout. What were the chances that the girl they saved at the beginning was the cousin of a Sureño who was going to kill Jake!? Absurdly convenient. Then later we get the craziest overkill of the decade. Bullets galore. Alas, I do find this to be a gripping police drama and Washington's best performance. That's enough for me to highly recommend this."

","Awesome, one of the best films ever and Denzel Washington does a very convincing portrayal of the cop who crosses the line, but you have to agree with some of his motives. I love when he shoots Roger and Jake freaks out, he makes a very good point when Jake asks why he shot a friend. ""Why was he my friend, because he knew my first name? Roger sold crack to kids and the world is a better place with him dead!"" Every point he makes about modern day ""street"" justice rings very true to modern day crime and justice. It sets the tone very well for an awesome films and all though he is ultimately the bad guy, Alonzo Harris is one of the best characters to every grace the big screen and you can't help but like the guy. There are some great cameos from Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg<br/><br/>A true modern day classic. Highly recommended"

","Finally, a movie where Denzel Washington plays the bad guy! And, wins a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...<br/><br/>There are three threads to this complex plot: first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die  there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years  and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself  money-wise that is.<br/><br/>So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves  so that they can then cash in...<br/><br/>A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...<br/><br/>Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once."

","Do you take big money from a studio, thus enabling you to hire the actor that could make your movie great, knowing that the studio will make certain script requirements guaranteed to ruin the whole thing?<br/><br/>This movie was so bad, but came so close to being so good.  I was thrilled for the first, say, 105 minutes of Training Day.  Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending.  Not only that, the last 15 minutes are an assault on the viewer's intelligence. We are required to believe that Hawke's character would give up his weapon, we are hit with a ridiculous coincidence with the wallet, and it is suggested that our hero would know how to use LA's bus system to travel (quickly, another joke) from Boyle Heights to South Central (for those of you not from here, that would not happen).  Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.<br/><br/>But up until that point, I was so impressed.  Hawke's internal struggle was great to watch, and pretty plausible.  Washington, awful as his character was, was a joy to watch.  It was fairly reflective of local issues, coming on the heels of the Rampart police scandal, in which cops in one part of the city (where most of the movie was set) took over the streets, making a huge impact in crime while doing some terrible things.  The action scenes (until the latter moments) were fairly realistic looking and fun to watch.  The character actors in smaller roles (Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and especially Cliff Curtis and his friends) were outstanding.  You know, this movie had everything I would have wanted, except for an ending that didn't p*** me off.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, but once it moves to the bathtub, feel free to stop."

","With two very engaging actors taking lead roles, in the form of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, this movie seemed to promise a great deal. Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.<br/><br/>The beginning was almost a cliché of the genre, in which Hawke as naive rookie gets treated with cynical contempt by his street-wise bad-ass mentor, Washington. The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. <br/><br/>But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. <br/><br/>Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. <br/><br/>Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. <br/><br/>After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.<br/><br/>A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.<br/><br/>You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times. It lights up predictably, shines brightly for a while, but fades without much flair. <br/><br/>Worth a watch if you get the chance, but not recommended for any particular quality."

I can think of other characters he's played that were much better than his Training Day character...Alonzo.<br/><br/>I was wondering why the whole elaborate set-up for Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to take the fall. Why didn't Alonzo simply shoot Scott Glenn, take his money, and leave the body until someone discovered it and conclude Glenn  killed by robbers?<br/><br/>Also, after when they were in Glenn's house, they dug a big hole in his kitchen to get the money that had been buried in a chest.

How did they fill in the hole in the kitchen so quickly and replace the floor boards they chopped up witht he ax? If they didn't do that and the hole was still uncovered..it seems like a homicide detective would have been somewhat curious about it and would have asked questions.<br/><br/>Plus, they tell the officers that Hoyt was shot Glenn and the cops don't take him in for questioning and let him continue on his shift. It's seems like he would've at the very least been taken off his shift until internal affairs investigated the shooting.<br/><br/>Next, Alonzo leaves Hoyt with some gangsters, assuming they were going to kill hoyt.

","I thought the bad guy was ""too bad"".  Maybe there are people in the world who are that bad, but I don't find movies about them very interesting.  I did not see any complexity in his character at all, and no redeeming qualities - the witch in Wizard of Oz was more likeable.<br/><br/>As for the ""good cop"", he was just a greedy wimp.  (SPOILERS)  Sure, he turns down the buttload of money he's offered after the bad guy kills the drug dealer...  but does that matter?  Through most of the movie he puts up with or participates in illegal activities ""against his will"" - why? - because he wants to work his way up the ladder to a better job - why? - for the MONEY.  ""You should see the houses THEY live in"" he says to his wife in the first scene.  He acts so righteously offended by the bad cop right from the beginning, but goes along and goes along because he wants to attain his career goals.  Some moral high-ground, huh?<br/><br/>The bad cop was bad right from the start - the rookie had no reason to respect him, take his advice, or want to follow in his footsteps.  I much prefer corruption movies where the bad guy's evilness slowly leaks out into the story, and where the rookie at first has reason to trust and respect him.  The moral dilemma and internal conflict of having to change your view of someone is just much more interesting than knowing from the start that he's a jerk.<br/><br/>So the two main characters just left me feeling nothing except annoyed.<br/><br/>Then, there's the plot.  I found too many things hard to swallow - that Washington's character was so very very bad and had apparently never been caught at it (yeah, there are corrupt cops, but this was too much), that he would involve the rookie in THAT MUCH corruption on his first day as a ""test"" of his character, that Washington's character thought even for a second that the rookie would just buy into his bulls*** and cover for him... I thought it was contrived and basically made no sense.<br/><br/>The only thing that I *did* like plot-wise was the most contrived thing of all - the young woman the rookie saved turning out to be the cousin of the man who later would have killed him.  Now THAT'S a contrivance I would have liked if the rest of the movie hadn't annoyed me so much.  Sure, it's totally unrealistic, but at least it had some sort of point to make.<br/><br/>All in all, it kept me awake and provided minimal entertainment.  It was interesting seeing Washington being a bad man.  But I wouldn't see it again or recommend it."

","""Training Day"" is a third rate cop drama/thriller with an uninteresting plot and not one believable character. The movie couldn't be further removed from reality. If this was supposed to be a brainless action movie it wouldn't bother me that much, but since this flick has won an Oscar one can't be so forgiving.<br/><br/>It's good to see Denzel Washington not preaching about American History or Human Rights for once, but that's not saying he can't give any speeches here. He still finds more than his share of opportunities to go on and on about the tough life on the street, what it means to be a cop, etc., etc. His character is a joke. The things he is saying all day are so obviously BS, that no one would buy it. Ethan Hawke's character is ridiculously naive and/or stupid to fall for Washington's excuses every time he screwed up again. Good cop/bad cop are just two of the stereotypes in the movie. Add to this countless ""ghetto nigga""-clichés, a peaceful drug dealer who wants to quit the business and start a new life, and a bunch of brutal but honorable ""gangstaz"". This is no portrayal of reality, it's a kid's (or an ignorant white guy's) imagination of life in the drug squad.<br/><br/>What's worst is that the movie isn't even entertaining for the first hour or so. It's not until the third act, when we've finally accepted the stupid nature of the movie, that it gets a bit thrilling. It's still implausible and annoying how all of a sudden every character turns against the bad guy. I can't figure out how this shallow script convinced anybody. There are better dramas and there are way better cop movies out there. This ""Training Day"" is better soon forgotten."
"slinky-8","Null","37","75","18 April 2002"," A Shocking Farce
","After seeing this movie I was convinced that the Academy Awards is fixed. Where do I begin with the absurd implausibility and script of this film? What starts off with a decent premise disintegrates about midway through the movie where the ""rogue"" cop can somehow get away with virtually everything. Denzel is a baddie that is not only untouchable, but seems to have been unnoticed by everyone, including the press and those who are not involved in the corrupt underground. The plot holes are gaping, especially where he leaves his partner to an uncertain fate for reasons unexplained and with an escape that gives a whole new meaning to the words ""deus ex machina."" The ending, where a white man can simply walk through a tough black neighborhood and then get their backing, was about as awkward as John Goodman on a tightrope. Worse is how Washington's partner is able to pull of physical feats that rival those of coming back from being pummeled more than Rockey and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound *and* showing strength and ""stickum"" like Superman and Spiderman. You'll wonder who thought up this tripe. Denzel Washington is a fine actor but the script was so awful that Denzel was left with the memorable tag line ""you shot me in the a**!!!!"" I fail to see how any actor could win an Oscar with such a poor script. The ""all black win"" at the Oscars was unquestionably pre-scripted for this warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment to America. Denzel may deserve an Oscar for another film, but combine this tripe with Halle Berry (and there were plenty of other films and performances that were far better than hers) and you can understand what kind of contrived garbage you have here. If you want to see another fine black actor who hasn't won an Oscar and should have that appears in an awful film that should, unfortunately, prevent him from receiving an Oscar, go see Morgan Freeman in ""Along Came a Spider"" -- another contrived piece of garbage."

","I was anxious to see ""Training Day"" because Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his performance. It indeed was an Oscar-caliber performance, but that alone doesn't make it a great film. In fact, to me it is seriously flawed.<br/><br/>As Denzel said in an interview this week, when he found out his character met such a finality, he took license to make him a really bad guy. With perhaps noble intentions, this cop deals out his own form of justice to the drug traffickers, in one scene shooting Scott Glenn's character with a shotgun in his apartment, then telling the other officers present how they should relate the incident to authorities. Denzel was also a cheating husband, with a primary family of wife and 4 sons, and a young son on the side with a Hispanic woman in the ""hood.""<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays an honest, by-the-book type of guy who is also street smart and capable of handling himself, a good cop. He eventually gets the upper hand on Denzel, after being abandoned for dead among Latino gambler thugs, and prevents him from getting the stolen money to the payoff point.<br/><br/>The following comments contain information which may be considered SPOILERS for those who have not yet seen Training Day.<br/><br/>The story covers one day, from early morning to midnight, it is Ethan Hawke's first day ""training"" with corrupt cop Denzel to become a narcotics officer. It ends when Denzel, unable to get the $Millions to the Russians by midnight, is gunned down at a stoplight by a half-dozen or so Russians. But I get ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Although difficult to watch at many points, most of the first 3/4 of the film has a realistic, ingenuous feel to it. Then the last parts become disingenuous. After a brutal fight, Hawke drops from the roof onto the hood of Denzel's car? Denzel, instead of getting out and disposing of him does a multiple car-ram routine in the parking lot? Denzel flaunts disobedience of all the rules, even pointing a gun at another driver in mid-day, but at midnight, on a deserted street stops and waits for a light to change to green?? That was obviously done only to stage the finality where the Russians box him in and then start shooting. A rather promising story, once again, ruined by a poor and unimaginative end game. Staged fights, near-executions, saved-by-a-phone-call scene, car crashes, slow-motion execution do not a good movie make.<br/><br/>I saw it on DVD. While the picture and sound are fine, and there are a couple of interesting extras, overall the presentation by modern standards is average at best. Overall a disappointment, with much foul language and crude sexual references, and I will not recommend ""Training Day"" to friends."

He was great, no doubt, but he's done better movies with more compelling stories. It's like it was a handout for playing something more true to his ""race"". I thought the film was gritty enough and showed that cops can be turned from seeing what they see all the time. The film was good at presenting that side instead of the justice for side. Ethan Hawke kinda took a backseat to Denzel's power in this film. It was necessary however so Hawke could determine for himself if he wanted that life badly enough. It made me wonder how many cops are like that and if there really is any justice left when within the police lie people like Alonzo.

","I have never walked out of a movie before.  I don't intend to start doing so.  But, man alive, did this flick try my patience.<br/><br/>Training Day is about Jake Hoyt (Hawke)'s first day in training to be a narc.  His mentor' is Alonzo Harris (Washington), a veteran of the LAPD narcotics beat.  Now, Hoyt isn't a true rookie  he's been a cop for over a year, but he wants to be a detective.  One good way to become one is by training in narcotics.  Alonzo has been on this beat for years, and is considered one of the best.  What better training ground could there be? During his day of training, Hoyt learns to disregard the 4th Amendment, lie, use drugs, and all sorts of other things a good cop shouldn't do.<br/><br/>Now, there is some validity to having an undercover cop or narc be familiar with the quality of drugs, but they must also remain above the culture. Donnie Brasco and Rush both showed this very well.  Training Day does not.<br/><br/>I have a host of complaints about this movie.  I'm going to address them in no particular order.<br/><br/>1) The story made no sense at all.  It starts off fine  Alonzo is a typical hard-nosed narc with little to no patience with a rookie who wants to be a do-gooder.  The street has no patience for those types.  Ok  I'll buy that. But then, all of a sudden, we're in the middle of a mystery, and we have no idea where it started or what the details are.  We know that Russians are involved, and some other guy, and then all of a sudden we make a bust that makes even less sense, and then, the movie doesn't end.  It keeps going, adding new subplots, and don't even think that any of these are going to be resolved at the end.  And then the movie is over.<br/><br/>2) Alonzo is not likable.  Yes, he's a tough cop.  Yes, he uses methods that aren't exactly legal.  But Washington gives the audience nothing about his character to like.  We grew to like Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  We liked Darth Vader.  We saw the humanity in those characters.  Washington is a very good actor, and has the awards to prove it.  I don't know if it was the way the character was written or what, but we are given nothing about Alonzo to like.  We aren't allowed to see his humanity.<br/><br/>3) The pacing is terrible.  This movie went on and on and on, and just kept going after it had stopped making sense.  Now, this, I don't understand. Fuqua started off directing music videos (This is not a bad thing  David Fincher, who directed Se7en and Fight Club started out the same way.  As did Spike Jonze, who made Being John Malkovich.).  He should understand pacing. He directed The Replacement Killers, which starred Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino  he can obviously work with actors.  So, I'm not sure what happened.  Perhaps the editor should be canned.  Or the writer.  Someone, anyway.<br/><br/>I'm done making my list.  There are just too many things to go into with this movie.  I'm not about to write a spoiler for those of you who still insist on seeing this movie, but I will advise you to reconsider.  There are plenty of other movies opening this week.<br/><br/>I'd go into more detail, but, this movie was so frustrating that it made my brain hurt."

"youdontsmellbad","4","25","51","14 October 2001"," I wondered what it had to say, and then...
","I saw previews for Training Day and foolishly deduced that it was a film with a message, something about street justice versus legal justice.  That's not the only reason I'd see this kind of movie; it was just my preception. I didn't get what I expected but I did stay through the whole thing.<br/><br/>Denzel plays a psychopathic police officer (impersonator in my opinion) ""training"" Ethan on his first day as a rookie narc on his way to becoming a detective.  Along the way Denzel spouts philosophical mumbo jumbo about street justice and about how he's the real cops and not the guys helping old ladies with their groceries, that sounds real good on previews -hey they got my seven dollars fair and square, right?  Unfortunately on the way to possibly becoming something appealing intellectually, it back pedals and turns into an over-the-top action-suspense yarn.<br/><br/>In the end I was not satisfied, though I may have been had my expectations not been contrary to the true intentions of the movie.  looking back, the best parts of the movie were probably the ones I enjoyed the least- the silly ones.  Were I watching in a different state of mind this movie might have grown on me.  But don't go out of your way to see it.  There's always cable."

","This movie is alright, but nothing special.  I think they just really wanted to give Denzel an Oscar.  I even suspect that they gave Ethan Hawke a nomination just so it looked like this movie was actually worthy enough to allow Denzel to win.  Basically, he should have won for Malcolm X, and then he did a bunch of bad movies, so they were overanxious to give him one. Both actors do good work here, and I like Denzel in general, but there is nothing special about these roles.  I think Russell Crowe or Gene Hackman or Haley Joel Osment should have won, because those roles were truly unique. 5/10"
"gmnstrunr37","2","30","63","10 April 2004"," Abysmal
","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>(But what's to spoil here?)<br/><br/>Sure, Denzel may have won an Oscar. Sure, Hawke may have been nominated for one. But what in the heck were the producers thinking when they filmed this movie?<br/><br/>It might be a commentary on how some police officers do business. That element is good. Playing good cop/bad cop is okay. Washington does a good enough job of it. But the reason the entire ""training day"" took place as it did isn't introduced for a while. Why, or even IF, Washington's Harris decided to pull the stints he did is unclear. Hawke simply follows him around greedily. Not much to the plot anyhow; the complete disregard to mention what is happening to Harris -- instead of focusing only on Hawke's Hoyt -- makes the movie a dull police flop."
"Buff2001","2","30","63","26 March 2002"," Give me a break!
","I got this DVD to see what it was that Denxel Washington did that was so much better that other roles he has played outstandingly. What a disappointment! Consider Denzel's Oscar this year for his body of work, to open the door for more non-white winners, to avoid the threatened botcott, or whatever but puleeze - not for his outstanding performance in this run of the mill violent cop flick. I am reminded of Sylvester Stallone in Copland which was a much better film in this overworked genre. Denzel's performance unfortunately did not add much.<br/><br/>By contrast, Will Smith was robbed because his performance as Ali was great and different. Sean Penn was no Dustin Hoffman but did better than Denzel. And of course, in spite of his off screen behaviour and like him or not, Russell Crowe was the best in A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this film, that is unless you want to see the real Best Supporting Actor performance, a really great turn by Ethan Hawke."

","To tell you the truth,<br/><br/>now that i am commenting on this movie i do have a ""guilty feeling"", giving this movie a score of : 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>So i changed it to : 4 Out Of 10!<br/><br/>But really after watching it : i couldn't really do anything else!<br/><br/>The hole show was Denzel Washington and to this day now i really can't understand why the plot was so predictably Poor!<br/><br/>It's easy to predict a ""Denzel Washington-Movie"" when you see it. Because the role is always the same : ""A man ho has to run from his family to protect his wife and child and also has to deal with the mafia. or like in this movie he deals with Drug-mafia's and for once he's the Bad Guy!.""<br/><br/>This one wasn't special although i must admit i have a ""Soft-Spot"" for the ""Beautiful, Foxy and Sexy Femme Fatale"" Eva Mendes.<br/><br/>This movie just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is an actor but is he a great actor?<br/><br/>He has won an Oscar, but let me ask you this : Is everyone ho wins an Oscar ""Worthy"" of winning the Prize?<br/><br/>Is John Ruiz truly a Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world?<br/><br/>Is Lennox Lewis one of the all-time great Heavyweight Boxing champions?<br/><br/>The answer on the Denzel Washington question will always be a split decision, in my eyes.<br/><br/>The best movie i saw of him was : ""The Hurricane"".<br/><br/>That was truly a brilliant performance, but ""Training Day"" is not.<br/><br/>And i think that movie will always make the grade in my book.<br/><br/>The ""annoying"" thing about this movie is that the ""predictability"" is pretty ""obvious and boring"".<br/><br/>When i mean ""Predictability"" i mean : Guns, Drugs, Mafia, shootout and This and that.<br/><br/>And even if Denzel played the ""Bad Guy"".<br/><br/>There wasn't anything ""Special"" about that role.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's ""Beautiful Mind"" but especially Will Smith's Ali are much better ""Performance's"".<br/><br/>Some people on ""this Board"" seem to think this movie is ""real day to day life."" or think that this Denzel's best performance.<br/><br/>Well i don't think so!<br/><br/>Hurricane was his best, Malcolm X i wasn't impressed with and Out Of Time was Good to watch but Sanaa Lathan and again Eva Mendes made it even more Tasty!<br/><br/>And all that talk about this movie being real ""day to day"" life?<br/><br/>How ""Out of touch"" can you be?<br/><br/>At the end of the day everyone is in titled to his opinion.<br/><br/>So my conclusion : This movie isn't one of ""Denzel's"" better performance's. Eva Mendes will always be ""Beautiful"" on the screen, she is a ""Very Underrated"" Talent.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke seemingly is very popular for his ""role"", witch was pretty good.<br/><br/>And there are a lot of ""unnecessary"" ""Rappers"" invited like Dr. Dre and Snoop ""Doggy"" Dogg.<br/><br/>And that doesn't much help the credibility of the ""real life case"" of this movie, that is put forward by some people on this board.<br/><br/>And although the movie is rated ""High"" by many in my eyes the movie was nothing special than a ""Mediocre, Nothing Special Predictable"" Performance.<br/><br/>For the people ho enjoy these kind of ""Action, Drug Mafia and Denzel type movies"" I'd recommend it.<br/><br/>But for people ho are looking for ""more"" depth and a better or a more ""Real Life"" performance, i say : This is not the movie for You!<br/><br/>My Score : 4.2<br/><br/>""Groeten"" from Gerrit"

","This movie is nothing more than another action movie. It has some nice action scenes and that's about it. Denzel Washington's role is overrated.

"Tiger_Mark","1","27","56","4 March 2003"," Both Good and Bad
","This film is kind of like the two officers that are the main characters, good and bad. There are scenes that are really good and creative. In particular, the ""card game"" scene towards the end, very  intense. However, there are way too many MTV Music Video scenes as well. No characters other than the main two have any depth whatsoever. You see talented actors like Scott Glenn trying to bring something extra to their scenes, but there is nothing written for them. Moreover, some scenes are just plain silly and you want to groan. Acting tends to be the over the top. However, in my opinion, it is the work of Ethan Hawke that really saves this film over all. Hawke portrays a character that I think most people can relate to, he does what we would probably do if in his situation. Overall, I would give this movie a B-, because it showed potential, but had too many mistakes."

"melchiah1644","4","24","49","30 March 2002"," Seen Better
","Training Day was a plotless cop movie that is made worse by the fact that it won an Academy Award. Denzel Washington is an over the top, rogue cop that doesn't do anything rewarding of an award. He kills, steals and murders yadda yadda yadda. Seen it a million times in a hundred other movies. And the performance isn't that great. I give Ethan Hawke some credit, for at least his character is believable and he does a decent job of moving the plot along. What little plot there is. Basically, it doesn't make that much sense. Bad cop versus good cop. From there, its up to the viewer to fill in the gaping holes. Overall, there are a bunch of other movies that do it better, one being L.A. Confidential. Go rent that rather than this tired, rough movie totally undeserving of any such awards."

His girlfriend is wonderful 3. the idea of concentrating all the story in just one day is fresh But on the other hand the plot lacks of realism, the psychology of characters is neglected, the Ethan Hawke is not at his best."
"pizzolog","8","29","61","3 February 2004"," Awful or Excellent?
","I am not sure how to rate this movie, 1 of 10 awful, or 10 of 10 excellent.<br/><br/>
If you like being frighten and appalled while watching a movie, and enjoy walking away feeling disgusted and dirty, wanting to burn your close and take a shower, and derive joy from having bad dreams at night, than THIS is the movie for you!<br/><br/>
Training Day depicts the worse aspects of humanity, betrayal, treachery, greed, murder; and shows an unsuspecting trainee cop pitted against this onslaught while he searches to do the right thing; and photographs it all in a horrifying way.  This is NOT a feel good movie.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor children, nor anyone under thirty who may well be scandalized. This movie is disgusting, vile and is a piece of trash.<br/><br/>
On the other hand, Training Day is movie making at its Very Best!  Denzel Washington is remarkably good with his performance of Detective Alonzo Harris; and Ethan Hawke, the trainee, seems to come out of no where to match Denzel's performance scene to scene with the excellence attributed only to the premium big name heavy weight actors in Hollywood today. And that's not easy to do!  Denzel Washington is as good an actor as there ever was, and better then most. Hawke's performance is superlative.<br/><br/>Astonishing performances were also rendered by Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Macy Gray, Scott Glenn , Nick Chinlund, Jaime Gomez, and on and on.  How did they all get so good?!<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent film due in large part to Denzel Washington who makes everyone around him perform better at their work.  Director Antoine Fuqua, and actress Macy Gray openly admitted this on the DVD's special feature segment.<br/><br/>The intensity of Training Day paralyzes the viewer and doesn't let go until the end.  This movie is a ride into hell.<br/><br/>So, how does one rate this film, Awful or Excellent?"

Sat down with a vision of a fair and insightful representation of corruption and places like the jungle. What did I get? A jumped up half bad action half ridiculous philosophical gibberish. Don't get me wrong Washington played his part well but he was up against Russel Crowe from a (Beautiful Mind) and in my opinion the real winner in Will Smith (Ali). Anyway lets just say the film was a let down in a big way. Ethan Hawke was a hell of a lot better in this than some of his others but overall a disappointment don't go out of your way to watch it."

Parents beware: the level of bad language used leaves nothing to the imagination! On a side note: YOU GET TO SEE EVA MENDES COMPLETELY NAKED!!!!

Cops (even crooked ones) do not shoot with both hands cocked sideways but if that was the only flaw I wouldn't be asking for 2 hours of my life back. It is sad that despite a big budget and big names, they can't top the lower budget TV series The Shield, which takes this story and does it right.

","Perhaps the timing just wasn't right.  Somehow, watching Training Day two days after the horrors of September 11th made my heart and stomach that much more sensitive to violence.  But Denzel Washington IS as good as ever. Ethan Hawke is strong in the boy-scout role.  The script is cleverly manipulative and the direction is great.  I even thought Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg hit the right note.  It just felt like a finely executed streak of violence.  Accurate?  Maybe.  But not exactly the kind of film I was in the mood for.  Too many bullets in the chest, not enough redemption.  I'm not always a softy, but after September 11th I'm looking for more."

Instead you get a ridiculous, over the top, shoot-em-up. And some huge holes in the plot.

"Bud_Sturguess","1","28","59","21 January 2003"," A twisted buddy-movie fails in many aspects
","In a twist on the generic buddy movie, Ethan Hawke is a naive rookie narcotics officer paired for the day with veteran rogue Denzel Washington. Throughout one twenty-four hour period, Hawke finds himself involved in scandals and corrupt business, all the fault of dirty cop Washington. Fair for its grit and tension between the two lead characters, but unapplausable for its generic approach. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, and it sure shows, and not in a good way; it seems overly obvious that the lead man crafted his role not to entertain, but to obtain a gold statue. His Alonzo Harris character is obviously a corrupt rip-off of Popeye Doyle (from ""The French Connection""). Hopeless in some places, while Hawke and a slew of other minor characters save the day in a supporting manner."

","Apparently, the viewing public and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, loves bad cop movies. Now, I know what your thinking. Was that five bad cop movies, or six? Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kinda lost track myself. <br/><br/>You know, the nice thing about the internet is that the ordinary, run-of-the-mill-movie-viewer can express his/her thoughts about the entertainment they've paid for, and not have to think that what the critics think is what everyone thinks. So here's what I think:<br/><br/>I can't believe the fuss made over this new bad cop movie.<br/><br/>
Without a doubt, you will be captivated and even frightened by Denzel Washington's portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris, an over-the-edge narcotics detective. And you will be equally riveted by Ethan Hawke's portrayal of rookie detective Jake Hoyt, who has the all time worst first day on the job. The movie mixes the fantastically corrupt cops with Godfather (Mafia type) violence with the backdrop one of this nations largest cities, 혩the Hood'. <br/><br/>This is a case to way to much talent wasted on the tiring bad-cop-good-cop theme. Training day ranks up there with 혩The French Connection', 혩Dirty Harry' and 혩L.A. Confidential'.

Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well). Even so, his trainer, Denzel Washinton, manages to get him to, or I should say the ""script"" manages to get him to, on their first day together as partners, smoke PCP, take responsibility for a murder, release two rapists, shake down a drug dealer in a wheelchair, drink beer and hard liquor on the job, conduct an illegal search, and more. It defies believability. The core of the movie seems to be a vehicle for DW to be the big angry, over the top bossy, black guy, and call his new rookie ""nigger"" for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. There was no suspense, no tension, just an angry black man yelling at his new white rookie for two hours. Nothing here for me.

","In his Academy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no- nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set- ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives. This is a must watch! The one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washington. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

"Screen_Blitz","10","2","2","28 January 2016"," Gritty, thoughtful police drama with an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington
","This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas. <br/><br/>Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.<br/><br/>Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre. Complete with mesmerizing performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, powerful directing by Antoina Faqua, and a spectacular screenplay by David Ayer; Training Day definitely hits home."

He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.<br/><br/>The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.<br/><br/>He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.<br/><br/>The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.<br/><br/>Overall, I love Training Day.

","Training Day is a good movie and I think it is a good movie for all of the right reasons.<br/><br/>The plot is very interesting.<br/><br/>It follows two LAPD narcotics detectives named Jake Hoyt and Alonzo Harris over a twenty four-hour in the gang neighborhoods of North West and South Central Los Angeles and they ride around the block, do some cop work and this leads into a very good and intense ending.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing in this film.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt and he did incredible in all of his scenes, including that fight he had with Denzel Washington at the end of the film and I am surprised that he did not win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his part. He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.<br/><br/>The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.<br/><br/>He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.<br/><br/>The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.<br/><br/>Overall, I love Training Day. It is a fine example of what police dramas should be and this film does not get enough credit.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Fanatics of Crime, Thriller and Drama Films will find this movie interesting, I recommend it to everyone though, I believe any person can find this movie entertaining.

","Don't be misled by the innocuous title of this 2001 movie - for Los Angeles cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his first day with the narcotics division, this is going to be a day from hell. And don't be caught out by the casting of Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris, Jake's mentor-cum-nemesis - this is is not the Washington whom we first met in 1987 in ""Cry, Freedom"" who has since played a whole series of good guy roles. In this movie, he is one real m****r f****r. And, if you don't like this sort of language, don't watch the film because it is replete with four- and six-letter expletives as well as street language that is sometimes hard to follow .<br/><br/>Writer David Ayer and director Antoine Fuqua have provided a violent and bloody narrative that grips from start to finish. Both Washington and Hawke are rarely off the screen and Washington in particular gives a capital performance. In fact, both actors attracted Oscar nominations with Washington deservedly winning for Best Actor for his bravura turn. The Alonzo Harris character was loosely inspired by the disgraced LAPD officer Rafael Perez who served two prison terms totalling six years. If he ever saw the movie, he would feel that it could have been a whole lot worse."

I thought the acting was superb, the story line probably read well, and that the cinematography was well-done, but this movie drug on forever. There just was too little content for the plot line. Not one I would recommend seeing. Of course, if you liked this one, you would probably like ""Bad Lieutenant"" with Harvey Keitel. Sorry, I cannot give this movie high marks, which really disappoints me, as much as my disappointment in having picked this one over five other movies playing that night at our local theater. I must not have been alone, because one of my companions did leave after about 15 minutes and the other went to the concession stand twice.

","I would have given it one star, but I wanted to be fair just in case the second half of the movie that I failed to see after I stopped it and took it back to the video rental store was any good.<br/><br/>This movie reads as a compendium of every sick thing you can think of to make a cop do, and it's done to the point where you almost have to laugh because you're waiting for the point where Denzel steals lollipops from babies and kicks widowed and terminally ill old ladies out of their homes for failing to pay rent just so they had their bases covered to show just how screwed up Denzel's character is. It even starts off with some really cheesy smart-ass talk about Denzel having his morning paper interrupted by Ethan Hawke and so Ethan had better have a really damn entertaining story to justify interrupting his ""entertaining"" newspaper.<br/><br/>I dunno. I mean, if you are a real bad ass like Denzel's character who is bored to tears by Ethan Hawke's traffic stop story and you like to routinely shoot people and split their ill-begotten cash, what exactly do you find entertaining in the newspaper? The recipe section? The legal notices? Or is it just some dribble from a screenplay writer who was churning out a gun porn film that is one of the dime a dozen that hover somewhere above the straight to video benchmark, and are mostly forgettable as they are paint-by-numbers plots with a mildly interesting twist and stocked with at least one recognizable name?

"FijiRevisited","10","6","10","12 April 2007"," Setting it straight
","Let me start out with this: This movie is amazing. End of story. I've read through the other reviews here, with people nitpicking the movie and finding minuscule ""plot-holes"" that are too stupid to be repeated here, and let me just say: WHO CARES?!?! Training Day is a great movie, and here's why: Denzel Washington. This film is the Greatest Actor in the World's shining achievement, and that alone makes it great. The character of Alonzo is one of the most menacing villains to hit the screen, and it's all because of Denzel. He BECAME Alonzo - almost everything that Denzel says in this movie is purely his creation (and I know - I've read the script.) For those of you who said Denzel was not Oscar-worthy in this film - you are extremely wrong. Just sit down and watch all the clever things he says (that he made up), all the subtle nuances. The scene in the car after they kill Roger is one of my favorite scenes of all time, because he goes from ghetto and evil to sweet and almost fatherly. The shift is brilliant, and Denzel pulls it off completely.<br/><br/>Like I said above, picking out irrelevant ""plot-holes"" is pointless...every single plot-hole that was brought up in other reviews has a logical explanation, but people are so against this movie that they feel they need to find some need to tear it apart, and since they can't tear apart Denzel's amazing performance, they focus on minuscule plot elements. This movie is GREAT. It's a gripping tour into a side of the streets we aren't exposed to, and Alonzo is our guide. And try and tell me it isn't classic cinema when Alonzo, broken and beaten at the end, puts a cigarette into his mouth and says ""I'm still winnin'...I can't lose..."" Denzel's greatest performance, and if you know anything about his acting skills, that is SAYING something. Please don't turn away from this movie. It's worth your time, believe me."

"mcgriswald","2","5","8","26 January 2007"," Unbelievable coincidence
","In Altman's ""The Player"" there is a subplot that involves a writer of a film who insists that his film retains his dark ""non-Hollywood"" ending--he is adamant during his pitches that ""life is like that"" and that people don't always live and that endings aren't always happy. He ends up selling out, and his movie has a stereotypical Hollywood ending in which a character played by Bruce Willis pulls a daring last second rescue of the formerly doomed heroine, played by Julia Roberts, complete with snappy exchange between the characters.<br/><br/>In ""Training Day"" there is a unrealistic coincidence that allows Ethan Hawke's character to survive a situation where he should have died; I immediately thought about ""The Player"". I can hear the producers insisting that the hero (Hawke) survive, and that the villain (Washington) get a comeuppance. They may have shot an ending in which Hawke dies, and Denzel Washington's character goes on leading his corrupt life, but like in ""The Player"", it ""didn't test well"" with audiences in an advanced screening.<br/><br/>I also was never convinced that Denzel could be so rotten, the fact that he always played heroes weighed on my ability to suspend disbelief, but that is my own subjective opinion. Denzel certainly played the character well, but I am not alone in my opinion that the Academy gave him the Oscar as a ""makeup"" for his being passed over before.<br/><br/>What ruined the movie for me was the pat ending, and the coincidence that allowed it."

","Revisiting Training Day the other day after about fifteen years actually raised my score of it from an 8 to a 9. At the time, back in 2001, when it was released it was following behind a golden streak of movie years dating back to the mid-90s, so maybe it wasn't as appreciated as it should have been since the standards were so high; it was still very good, but something left a little to be desired. This sentiment held true on the rewatch, but only as to the very end of the movie, which in my opinion was still disappointing.<br/><br/>Having Alonzo go out like Scarface was a let down and still is. It feels like an easy way out and a lazy way to end the story; it may have been chosen to add to the realism of the movie, but the film was dark enough throughout and didn't need a pitch black depressing ending. They should have at least had Alonzo fire back in a shootout to take out some of the bad guys after him, but the writers didn't allow him to even get one shot off- kind of anticlimactic if you ask me.<br/><br/>However, this is really my only complaint with Training Day. In a surprisingly completely original story, Denzel Washington takes Ethan Hawke's rookie NARC agent through the streets of L.A., teaching him that what he learned in the Academy means zilch in reality once he is in the street game.<br/><br/>Washington's Alonzo rarely evokes sympathy and even when you think he may, you have to question if ALonzo is just playing the game since he is so deceitful and can fake his emotions so well. However, there is one scene where it looks like Alonzo does let his guard down, and it is in that brief moment that you see that the real Alonzo is a broken man who has been hardened and corrupted by the true realities of the job through the years, which has taken its toll on him, giving him no choice but to play the game.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, Alonzo is a bad guy. When the plot unfolds and his reasoning and tactics are revealed, you see that he is a scheming criminal, who is ruthless and will do anything to save himself, even if it means gaming and playing a rookie partner as a pawn in his game of survival.<br/><br/>There is lots of truth and revelations as to the nature of cop corruption in this movie that I had never seen this realistic before. The way Alonzo can get dirt on everyone, but only use it if he needs to is very shocking and eye opening. He uses it to keep everyone on the street (and in his department sect) in line, but if they step out of line and get him in trouble, then he will just go write them up for a past violation and charge them. Knowing this, he purposefully tempts those around him to commit crimes (sometimes deceptively) so that he immediately has dirt on them (exampled in telling Hawke to take the dirty money and smoke the marijuana, which Hawke later learns from Alonzo himself is actually a much harder drug in dust- this btw was one of the most disturbing scenes watching Hawke's character get corrupted so early on by this lie).<br/><br/>Alonzo has his ""dogs"" or ""boys"" all over the slums of L.A., which are for the most part his informants who he has been protecting from throughout his time working the streets. But you watch as he will play them as an Ace card in the hole if he needs to in order to escape justice himself, and simultaneously he explains why these high rollers can never face the court since they have too much dirt on everyone else as well and it would be hard to get a conviction after years of them serving as informants.<br/><br/>In summary, the movie depicts an inevitable corruption that evolves in some police departments, as Alonzo has become corrupted and disillusioned by the realities of the game, which can only be learned through experience. The dangers and temptations, as well as him facing himself in the mirror have taken their toll on his soul, leaving him with no choice but to check his heart at the door in order to survive both the street itself and his own criminality. Alonzo is ruthless and willingly wears two faces throughout the job, always playing chess, but for all of his street smarts, you can't help but despise his bad behaviors and corrupt acts.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that is riveting, creates constant tension, and teaches what can go wrong in police departments, especially those that have to deal with the dregs of society and the drug game. Hopefully Hawke's character went on to just write parking tickets like he implied after getting a taste of the realities of the job that no good soul would ever want to be a part of.<br/><br/>9/10"

","One thing I will say about this film is that it has some of the best one liners ever put on film. I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.<br/><br/>The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.<br/><br/>The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.<br/><br/>However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion."

","Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.<br/><br/>Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!<br/><br/>Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.<br/><br/>Here we are in ""blacktown after-dark"" (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!<br/><br/>I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here.

However, not only was I absolutely blown away by Mr. Washington's potrayl of a cooked cop, but I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable. Ethan Hawke was a perfect contrast to Washington, and the director and writer did a great job of capturing the feel of such a neighborhood.<br/><br/>It's still hard for me to say that Russell Crowe did not deserve to win, however after seeing this movie and knowing what a great actor Mr. Washington is, I can honestly say that I have no complaint with his victory.

(The other was ""Death Wish"", which I saw when I was 19 yrs. old, so it's understandable why it was so disturbing). Why this movie was so disturbing can be summed up in three reasons: 1) a cop never surrenders his gun. Why? why? why is the gun surrendered? The fact that the viewer can understand, that the young officer is trying to trust the corrupt Denzel, is probably what is so disturbing. We KNOW he is blowing it, he should NEVER hand over his gun.

A very well written plot, tense and suspenseful, unpredictable at times even for film afficionados, and much enjoyable. Beautifully photographed, it should be teached in film schools. The first image, the rising Sun is unforgettable. The scene in the latino quartier is also remarkable. Noel Guglielmo and his camarades are so authentic.

One of the most authentic depictions of the streets in recent memory. The gangsters in this movie act like they came right off the corner. I think it is important that people realize that this movie is not at all far fetched when you consider the Rampart scandal and the story of ""corrupt cop"", Rafael Perez and the ""boy scout"" detective that eventually blew the whistle on this corrupted department. Rap fans would be interested to know that this same Rafael Perez and one of his colleagues David Mack have been linked to Death Row CEO Suge Knight and many loosely suspect they had some hand in the rocky events that eventually led to Tupac and Biggie's deaths. Great performances by Denzel and Ethan. To me this movie is hard to look at for some people because the injustice it shows never affected them and in a sense they either feel guilty for it in a way or they just despise the whole environment but whether you chose to accept it or not you can't hide from this movie because the subject matter is relevant and the movie's quality is exceptional."
"Buddy-51","Null","18","55","6 July 2002"," So What Was His Second Day on the Job Like?
","Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day' portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols. We've seen plenty of 'bad apple' cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place. Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants. For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the lowlifes at their own game - employing their tools, using their methods - the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.<br/><br/>Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner. Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner. Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flauting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves. Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such 'unconventional' actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations. Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking? The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.<br/><br/>'Training Day' is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting. The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from. Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre. However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness. This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable. Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world. The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us. However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.<br/><br/>As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake. Washington, generally relegated to 'good guy' roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character. In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer. Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life. As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows – or thinks he knows – is right. These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), 'Training Day' provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie – and much, much finer acting."

","In all honesty, I have to admit that I went in to see Training Day at the Toronto Film Festival with somewhat less than stellar expectations. When I walked out I was impressed with what turned out to be a well written, well directed and incredibly well acted L.A. cop thriller. The story focuses on Ethan Hawke's character, a lowly cop being promoted to a narc who goes out on a day of training with an unconventional undercover veteran played by Denzel Washington. I won't say too much more about the plot but I must say that both actors play their roles very well; Hawke is very subdued while Washington is completely over the top. The movie moves at a satisfyingly quick pace and keeps you hooked right until the very end. The film does have its flaws but for a film of its genre they are so few and far between that you barely notice them. If you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours without having to think too hard then go out and see Training Day."
"johnnyboyz","7","4","8","4 August 2007"," Watch it for Washington's performance; some well made, unpredictable scenes and let it just draw you in.
","What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.<br/><br/>I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.<br/><br/>Secondly, the way in which each character acts  Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American  Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.<br/><br/>Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling  again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great  the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.<br/><br/>What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically  although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.<br/><br/>In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on."

"cinephile-27690","10","2","3","21 February 2019"," Training Day is the BOMB!
","I watched Training Day last night and it rocked! This is easily, hands down, my favorite Denzel Washington movie!<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple: Ethan Hawke plays a cop on his first day, who gets lessons from Denzel Washington, a professional cop veteran. Together, they stop criminals, but it may turn out that the biggest criminal of the day may be with them the whole time.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great. Denzel won Best Actor for his performance-and it's well earned! If someone else won in his place-that would have been a crime against humanity! Well, maybe not, but it would still be cruel!<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was great too, and I have not seen much of his work. I will be keeping an eye on his work now! In fact, everyone was great in this movie!<br/><br/>If you read my reviews, you know I am against movies with a ton of language(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street for an example.)<br/><br/>While the IMDB trivia page says that the F word is said 211 times, and that can't be too far off, I found the movie to be more concentrated on it's awesome story than dropping in the next curse word in, unlike the other movie I mentioned! Still, if coarse language overused bothers you, wait for this to air on TV.<br/><br/>I have read reviews saying that the end was kind of predictable, and it personally shocked me at first, then it didn't so much. If you don't overthink the entire movie, the ending is still impressive. Personally, I found the ending to have the best twist ending ever in a movie-and yes, I've seen The Sixth Sense!<br/><br/>Some also argue that this movie couldn't have ended in one day. I would have to disagree. If this day starts somewhere from 7 am- 9 am, I could totally buy that this event ends before midnight! Plus, it's a movie for heaven's sake!<br/><br/>As I watched this movie, I kept thinking of Quentin Tarantino, not just because of how brutal the violence can get at times, and not just because of the coarse language, but simply how the movie is structured.<br/><br/>For example, the opening scene in the diner could have been an alternative opening to Pulp Fiction. This scene also has some Tarantino-like humor. I actually had to check the case to make sure QT had no involvement in this movie! This is the Tarantino movie that he didn't make!<br/><br/>If this is not enough to make you want to see this movie, I don't know what else could! If more movies were as well-constructed as this, I would have a lot more absolute favorite movies!<br/><br/>Training Day is the bomb, and there are few movies that I could recommend more! I feel like this movie should get a couple more stars, it's that brilliant!i can't say enough great things about it, so I'm stopping here-but definitely give Training Day a watch!"

","Temptation and falling down the wrong path can end a long streak of devastation and horrendous outcomes. ""Training Day"" reflects a day in the lives of two L.A. cops who both lead into two different directions. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is a new police officer with a great heart and string conscience who starts his first day with experienced and dirty police officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo takes Jake into the brutal and corrupt crime world of L.A., which causes Jake to question his morals, his opinion on Alonzo, and what line in life he will be headed for. The two are faced with many experiences that are both used in a way to train them, but not all experiences will be responded to wisely. Denzel Washington gives an absolutely gritty and flawless performance who swears better and yells louder than any actor out their. His ""gangsta"" attitude is not overdone or forced at all, and provides entertainment from just watching this lion roar. Ethan Hawke is also brilliant as a wide-eyed cop turned determined warrior who always seems like a new character in every scene. Director Antoine Fuqua portrays the dark world of L.A. perfectly with amazing action sequences and a setting that looks like hell. Filled with criminals, drugs, and violence, you see some of the most disturbing landscapes in the history of film that will make you nervous from just watching. David Ayer's script is a monumental work of art. Filled with rich dialog and interesting characters, he takes a simple plot and turns it into a moral compass for doing what's right and not giving in. ""Training Day"" is one of the greatest cop films of all time and can be used as a template for making and developing a story about good and bad."

","In this Modern Film Noir classic, Denzel Washington is Detective Alonzo Harris, who runs an elite narcotics task force. Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly ""recruited"" to it and even eager to join.<br/><br/>Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of ""detecting"" - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.<br/><br/>In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.<br/><br/>Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter ""The Jungles"" by himself. Harris appears to be the ""benevolent protector"" of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our ""First Impressions"" and how they are wrong.<br/><br/>We get to meet many of Harris' ""friends"" and acquaintances, who are either ""retired"" drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as ""Roger"") or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.<br/><br/>And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is ""Why""?<br/><br/>Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.<br/><br/>This film puts a new slant on the words ""Patsy"" and ""Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross"".<br/><br/>Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the ""Innocent Look"" that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" were used as well.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music."

","A+ <br/><br/>This is movie is a hard hitter and definitely not to be missed. It's an urban crime-thriller taking place where else but in the run down ghettos of Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke is quite good as the naïve protagonist and the cast is also filled with many other well done roles. Peter Greene is always entertaining, and Eva Mendes is always a treat, clothes on or off. The highlight of the movie is Denzel Washington. His performance is a combination of spectacular acting and writing. Half the time you're not sure if he's just an abuser of power or a true demon, and every second of his screen time is just marvelous. Also starring in small roles are many rap legends from the genre's 90s hey-day, namely Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.<br/><br/>The action is pretty intense and the camera follows it gracefully. My favorite scene had to be when Denzel visits his friend Roger, played by Scott Glenn . Delightfully brutal, and also a very plot-driven film I urge all to see."
"compi24","9","2","3","30 June 2011"," Review of ""Training Day""
","""Training Day"" is the story of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), an LAPD rookie who is looking to join a top-notch narcotics squad led by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; ""The Fast And The Furious"" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the ""Crime doesn't pay"" and ""Power corrupts"". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found ""Training Day"" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable."

","Every great actor has a defining performance. A performance that they will always be remembered for. De Niero's was Raging Bull , Pacino's was Scarface and Tom Hank's was Forest Gump. I believe Denzel Washington will always be remembered for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day. This was the first time we had really seen Washington play a bad guy and you have to say , he took to it like a duck to water.<br/><br/>Training Day is one of my favourite movies of all time. Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.<br/><br/>This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare. Maybe The Departed has come closest.<br/><br/>If you have never seen Training Day , do yourself a favour and go out and rent or buy this now. You wont regret it."

","At the end of the Oscar-winning movie ""Training Day"", one must ask, ""where's the fine-line between doing what's right and the tactics one must go through in accomplishing it?"" The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. <br/><br/>Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. <br/><br/>The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like ""American Gangster"" (another film Washington was in) proves my point. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. <br/><br/>For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent ""Lethal Weapon"". The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. <br/><br/>Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time."

","I saw this movie when it first came out. I liked it a lot, the setting, the acting, the storyline was fantastic. But I never really got hooked on it like some people who still to this day, worship it like some kind of cult movie. Back then I didn't fully understood the ending, but I just didn't like it.<br/><br/>Today I rented it to watch it again because even to this day, people still bring it up for comparison like with Street Kings, so it seems like it's set a standard for this particular genre. Well, now I remember why I didn't like the ending back then. It was unrealistic. Training Day is all about realism, all about the streets. So how the hell did Denzel get beaten by the rookie, who somehow survived getting killed by the 3 Latino's because one of them decided to grab his wallet before popping him, checks the wallet, sees the photo of the schoolgirl who somehow Jake had saved earlier that day. Unbelievable... and why didn't they just kill him? Why beat him up, why not choke him to death then take him to the bathtub. Won't leave much of a mess either.<br/><br/>So Training Day is a very good movie with an Oscar-winning performance from Denzel, but the ending was typical Hollywood ""good cop wins"" ending. I guess I'm spoiled by the more modern films which are much more gritty and cruel. Jake (Ethan) wasn't just a good cop, he was NAIVE. I wish there was some kind of twist were Jake screws Denzel over at his own game, without having to resort to pure luck and inconceivable behavior from Denzel where he spares him on the rooftop rather than finishing him off. Unfortunately, unless Jake smartens up and ""becomes the next Alonzo"", he will get killed within two months if he goes on to pursue a Narc career. I just hope that for his sake, he gets a desk job or goes back to patrol.<br/><br/>The ratings are fair, Training Day is good but nowhere near Top 250 good. The people who go all ga-ga over it and the ending are all teenagers, or equally naive people who still think good people have good things happen to them. Wrong... it's the SMART people that live. Jake was a liability to the force, even if he lives by the end of the movie, if he continues his do-goody ways, he will most likely get popped by some other bad cop. It's unfortunate but nowadays it requires a hell of a lot more than integrity to become, and survive as a good cop. You need to learn politics."

Exactly how far is he willing to go?<br/><br/>The acting by both leads is amazing. Honestly, for everyone in this. Denzel steals the show, but Ethan still really makes a mark. This is immensely gritty, with many honest looks at what happens in the bad neighborhoods of LA, as told by a screenwriter and director who actually lived there. The authenticity is a huge part of why this is so compelling. With a few exceptions, you really feel like this could happen(there are things that are not very credible. Others have already detailed them, I don't really have anything to add), and it really provokes a discussion of police brutality. Despite an episodic nature, every scene has a distinct purpose in the overall narrative, although for a number of them, you won't realise what it is until later.<br/><br/>This contains a lot of strong language, some brutal violence, and a little nudity.

","It looks like this is another one of those films that I missed during a period of time when I didn't go and see films anywhere near as much as I did in the past, or I do so now (which is probably between 2000 and 2006). So, during that time I really wasn't paying all that much attention to what was coming out, or even going and seeing films that did come out at the time. However, this is also one of those films that seem to keep on popping up every so often, and a part of me felt that maybe it is worth actually going back and watching, particularly since Washington did win an oscar for his role in the film.<br/><br/>I have to admit that it is pretty gripping, and things seem to get deeper and deeper as the film progresses, though we should note that the entire film occurs over the span of a single day. Basically the film opens up with a beat cop Jake being offered a position as a narcotics detective, as long as he successfully completes a single day on the job, which is basically an evaluation. Obviously Jake is pretty egar to impress.<br/><br/>The thing is that there are a lot of things going on behind the scene which is slowly being revealed to us, but not necessarily to Jake, namely because Jake is not quite in earshot, or simply assumes that everything is above board. Sure, he sort of has some suspicions that things are not quite right, but sure enough, he is an innocent beat cop who is eager to please, so he isn't really all that keen on asking too many questions.<br/><br/>That is the other thing about the film, and that it is basically told entirely from his perspective. Unfortunately, unlike literature, we aren't really able to get into his mind, and understand what he is thinking, but then again the film doesn't actually provide us with a narrative. Should it? I'm not entirely sure, because it still sort of works out, at least most of the way through the film.<br/><br/>Well, sort of, because once we get to the end, the coincidences do start to pile up, such as the girl whom he saved turning out to be the cousin of the guy that has been paid to kill him, which means that he spares his life and lets him go. Yet, if we work on the principle of Chekov's gun, that incident earlier in the film really does need to have a reason for occurring, particularly since he picks up her wallet after she leaves - even though Hollywood movies don't necessarily follow that rule, having such a thing occur without having a reason for it later on in the film would effectively be sloppy film making, and it certainly isn't one of those films that throws red herrings at you.<br/><br/>It is an interesting look at corruption in the world of the detectives. Look, corrupt cops are nothing new, there have been countless numbers of films and TV shows made about them, and of course they never seem to actually get away with being corrupt. Though this story is much more interesting, particularly since our detective lives in the heart of gang territory, and doesn't seem to have a problem with living in the heart of gang territory. Sure, he is corrupt, but I think the film goes a little further than that.<br/><br/>For instance, Jake, at the beginning of the film, refuses to smoke any marijuana because, well, cops don't do drugs - remember, he is pretty innocent - yet is suddenly told that one needs to be a little flexible if one is going to be effective. By sticking to a moral code means that you are going to be outing yourself pretty quickly. Yet by bending your moral code raises the question as to how far you are going to bend, and the further you bend the more corrupt you eventually become.<br/><br/>I guess Alonzo, our detective, in a way is a very tragic character. He is a highly decorated officer, yet in becoming effective has resulted in him becoming corrupt, and the more effective he becomes, the more corrupt he becomes. Yet it isn't just him that has fallen down, because it seems that the rot has spread far and wide throughout the system - it is just that Alonzo, as we soon find out, has stepped just that little bit too far over the line to discover that he has found himself in what is effectively a no win situation, that eventually tips him over the edge.<br/><br/>In this case, sometimes innocence, and the desire to maintain one's honour, can save one from falling too far, yet it also results in an awful lot of sacrifice, since it is clear that Jake probably will not being going down the path of the narcotics detective, though this is never really made clear at the end of the film."
"MitchellCombden","9","1","1","31 August 2017"," phenomenal performances anchored by a tight script make this one a classic.
","Training day is a classic film. it's difficult to find negatives here. the screenplay is tight and realistic. the acting is phenomenal, the run-time doesn't feel too short or too long, and in terms of production value the film is top notch. the sound and visuals are great. so lets get into the details of why everything is so great.<br/><br/>firstly, the performances are excellent. Ethan Hawke gives us a timid yet bold performance as the rookie narcotics agent who's not all that comfortable with the way his first day unfolds. his character's main goal is to become street ready and become the best cop he can possibly be. he starts out as a soft yet passionate officer who isn't very in tune with all of the street details that are required to perform the job. in scenes where he needs to be a little reserved and in his head, Hawke pulls it off. in scenes where he needs to be bold and charismatic, Hawke pulls it off as well. the key to the character is the outstanding morals he displays. he is at his core, a good man who seeks to do good. Denzel Washington's character is the polar opposite. the grizzled vet who knows what it takes and might cut some corners in order to get the job done. Washington is very charismatic and sells his characters motivations and morals perfectly. his character acts as the corrupting force that could be Ethan Hawke's characters undoing. the interplay between the characters moral differences is what drives the plot and keeps the story flowing smoothly and with consequence. each scene where a moral question comes into play could or could not affect Ethan Hawke's character in a major way. it's interesting to see how each scene plays out and how it will affect our perceptions of the characters as well as the perceptions that characters have of each other. <br/><br/>what really ties everything together though is the script. the screenplay allows for both the characters to propel the plot and the plot to propel the characters. it's this balancing act that makes the movie special. an event happens, we learn about our characters, they learn about each other which causes a new reaction or event and the story flows smoothly. every time Denzel's character teaches Hawke's character something, although it may be immoral or even insignificant at the time, it comes into play in the third act. Hawke's character grows and towards the end of the film becomes the cop that he set out to become. completing the character's arc and completing the story with a tightly wrapped bow. <br/><br/>it may not be on the level of the godfather or citizen Kane, but it sure is a great film and if you haven't seen it.. watch it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Training Day, Denzel Washington pulls out all the stops and delivers a performance. Written by David Ayer and directed by Anthony Fuqua, Training Day grabs you. While the ending suffers from an overload of coincidences and contrivances, the movie still packs a wallop as it asks the question: Can honorable men deal with the worst of humanity on a daily basis without being corrupted?<br/><br/>Co-starring Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a Los Angeles cop out to become detective. To that end, he tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness. The hitch is that Jake has only one day to prove his worthiness to Alonzo. Even within his drug haze, the boy soon realizes that Alonzo is not merely an officer that plays fast and loose with the rules - he's a full-fledged rogue cop willing to do anything to get what he wants.<br/><br/>Some of the most harrowing moments take place in a neighborhood completely under the control of thugs. Alonzo lives there, convinced he is respected by his brutal neighbors due to his ability to work the system. In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because of his badge and gun.<br/><br/>Taking place over the course of a single day, Training Day builds momentum and never backs off. The film creates and maintains a sense of genuine danger. As the proceedings grow ever more dark, you begin to wonder if the key players can possibly survive the day. Until the last 15 minutes, that is, when the story wraps up too quickly and in far too pat a fashion."

","In my opinion in Training Day and American Gangster Denzel gave the best performance as a villain. <br/><br/>There are some clichés like ""I didn't sign up for this..."". The car doesn't start when they are in danger, even though it's a super muscle car. Seriously, how is it possible that he saved that girl (clearly not 14 years old) from rape and it happens to be the cousin of that anger gang member, who was about to kill Ethan Hawke. The end is great but, when you get shot in the bottom, it hurts, the least thing you do is start threatening others.<br/><br/>This movie is great, the plot is great, even with all the flaws, for an action movie, the end is satisfying and the performance of denzel is very good. <br/><br/>10 - excellent"
"The Grand Master","9","1","1","5 February 2015"," Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both cast against type in this excellent cop movie
","It's easy to look at Training Day as just another action/crime movie with the bad cop corrupting the rookie and dragging him into his world. With Denzel Washington turning in his best performance as the villain and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic, likable and heroic good guy, this is anything but a routine movie. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job bringing a gritty no holds barred crime movie to the screen.<br/><br/>LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is an idealistic, honest, good hearted rookie who has one day to prove himself that he has what it takes in the Narcotics Division. Jake Hoyt is very eager to make a good impression and earn his place as well as seeing this role as a stepping stone to making Detective. Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington in his Academy Award winning role as Best Actor) is a 13 year highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and has a feared and respected reputation amongst all police officers, friends, criminals, and enemies alike. Alonzo is assigned to showing Jake the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles as well as taking Jake under his wing as a mentor. However, Alonzo Harris is a corrupt police officer to the point where the line is blurred between cop and criminal, right and wrong, good and bad, and what is legal and illegal. Alonzo Harris is not above physically intimidating and assaulting suspects, as well as stealing, robbing, assaulting, planting evidence, and setting up a murder to look like a justified shooting. Though Alonzo Harris justifies this as all in the good of taking bad guys off the street or in his words which he lives by on the streets of Los Angeles, ""To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" Alonzo Harris is also extremely arrogant and selfish who will do anything for money as well as caring very little for anyone else but himself.<br/><br/>Once Jake Hoyt witnesses Alonzo Harris' unconventional methods of enforcing the law through his own brand of street justice in which he makes up his own rules, Jake finds that it may be too late to save himself and his career. Alonzo threatens Jake by making him smoke drugs at gunpoint otherwise face being thrown out of Narcotics Division. Jake also witness many immoral acts committed by Alonzo to the point where he questions his own conscience and whether Alonzo is a police officer wanting to enforce street justice or just a criminal wanting to commit acts beneficial to himself.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is well known for portraying a variety of good guys on the screen in movies such as Glory, Philadelphia and The Hurricane. Cast against type in Training Day, he does an excellent job portraying the villainous, down and dirty Alonzo Harris. There was a lot of controversy when Denzel Washington won the 2001 Best Actor Academy Award for his role when Russell Crowe was strongly tipped for his role in A Beautiful Mind. Regardless, Denzel Washington thoroughly deserved to win for his role. This is definitely Denzel Washington's best role in his entire career.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was previously known for his roles in Dead Poets Society, Alive, Reality Bites, and The Newton Boys. Ethan Hawke, who also deserved to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, comes of age in his role as the idealistic and honest rookie Jake Hoyt who is very eager to make a good impression but finds himself in over his head in an unfamiliar world. Although Jake Hoyt makes several mistakes which end up almost costing him his career as well as his life, he proves himself to be a capable police officer when he saves a teenage girl from being sexually assaulted by two homeless men, which later saves his life. To date, this is Ethan Hawke's best role.<br/><br/>Other actors which appear in Training Day include Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs) as a local drug dealer Roger, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as District Attorney Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin (Scarface) as Detective Doug Roselli, rapper Snoop Dogg as wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue, New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis (Three Kings) as a thug named Smiley, pop star Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Eva Mendes in an early role as Alonzo's mistress Sara, and as part of Alonzo's corrupt crew of police officers rapper Dr. Dre as Paul (who comes across as a thug than a police officer), and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) as Tim.<br/><br/>Training Day certainly left a long lasting impression of me when I first saw this movie back in 2002 which will never be forgotten. In what could have been a routine action movie, becomes an intense, gritty and compelling cop drama. Excellent job all round, Denzel Washington earns his well deserved critical acclaim as the bad guy Alonzo Harris, and Jake Hoyt also deserves acclaim for his role as Jake Hoyt. It's also great to see Antoine Fuqua go on to direct greater movies such as Tears of the Sun, Shooter and The Equalizer. Screenwriter David Ayer has also carved out his own career following this movie and has also made his mark as a director with Street Kings, End of Watch, and Fury.<br/><br/>Training Day is an excellent movie which is definitely highly recommended.<br/><br/>9/10."

","In his Oscar-winning performance, Denzel Washington inhabits the role of the street-tough narcotics cop to such an extent that you forget that, prior to this movie, Mr. Washington had begun to be stereo-typed as the perpetual good guy. No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.<br/><br/>Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.<br/><br/>To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com"

But Alonzo's methods are questionable and sometimes illegal. <br/><br/>This film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, to watch this straight arrow cop have to do things every bone in his body is telling him not to, was completely enthralling. At times Ethan's performance reminded me Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad just the way he carried and handled himself in certain situations was superb. High praise indeed from me. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar worthy performance. To see somebody switch from borderline criminal to genuinely caring mentor and leader, was simply incredible. The story has twists right to the very end and what makes this film so special and separates the good films from the great. Is that you understand what Ethan's going through, how he sees Denzel's character, how he's conflicted between knowing whats right and what he wants. This is due to the marvellous work of Director Antoine Fuqua, the acting of the two lead roles and the script! The script was sensational it really was, it was dark and gritty throughout keeping a harsh realistic aspect to it. The cinematography was great, some of the shots of the gang driven streets of LA were beautifully done. Overall I loved this film and thought it was done incredibly well with outstanding acting, script that was directed really well. A 9/10 from me."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","1","28 March 2014"," Haunting tale
","Impression- This is a very well written film about a man who is taken under the wings of a sketchy and untrustworthy cop. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, and I'm glad they both got nominations for their work here. After seeing Hawke in the 'Before' trilogy I know he can do dramatic roles and it goes without saying that Washington can act. The only thing I was worried about was that this movie may have that over the top action like some movies similar to this do. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Praise- Its a high octane thrill ride from the beginning till end. I cant say I didn't predict Washington setting Hawke up, but its still for the most part un-expecting and very interesting. It was one of the first times Washington played a complete bad-ass on screen, and he played it well. I totally bought into Hawke's character being frightened by Washington and him daring to do all the crazy stuff that he is ""supposedly required to do"". There were also some great cameos by great actors playing small roles. Tom Berenger and Eva Mendes are barely present, but their presence is felt. This movie also has a high re-watch-ability factor. Particularly for the banter that goes on between the lead characters.<br/><br/>Complaints- To be honest I felt that some things were unrealistic. Such as the bullets in Alonzo's car. You mean to tell me that nobody at the crime scene happened to notice the bullets in the rear view windshield? I also find it hard to believe that for over 10 years this man got away with going outside the law to put away criminals. But it is a movie, so anyway....<br/><br/>Good movie overall with a memorable dynamic between the leads. Very pleased with the outcome.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","In ""Training Day"" Ethan Hawke plays Hoyt, a rookie cop on his first 24-hour training day with the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?<br/><br/>""Training Day"" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of ""Training Day"" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, the latter ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in ""Runaway Train"" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now,"" etc., etc.<br/><br/>As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, ""I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir."" How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.<br/><br/>There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.<br/><br/>Additional actors include Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Eva Mendes, Charlotte Ayanna, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.<br/><br/>The film was shot in L.A. and runs 122 minutes.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""Training Day"" is an excellent urban thriller with an ultra-captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","The movie is about the first day of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a young soon to be narcotics officer, at work. It is actually a journey into the real world of the streets of LA as it is presented by prestigious detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Hoyt soon realizes that Alonzo's methods are far from legal. All through his training day, he finds himself having to choose between his ethic and what Alonzo tells him what he should do, because the real world is a ""jungle"", and one has to be a ""wolf"" to survive in it. So, according to Alonzo, an officer could co-operate with drug dealers, steal money and even murder as long as he succeeds in his primary mission. Hoyt never seems to agree with this and when he finds out that the training is in fact a setup, he has to come after Alonzo. In the end Alonzo dies as a wolf because in this kind of game there is always a greater wolf.<br/><br/>This was a really interesting movie. It shows a completely different aspect than the ideal world of police in the US as it appears in many other movies or TV shows. <br/><br/>There is also an excellent performance by Denzel Washington. He surely deserved his Oscar award for that one."

","""Training Day"" tells the story of young cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) assigned to Narcotics, partnering veteran cop Alonzo Harris (Washington) on his first day. As he tries to improve Hoyt's ""street IQ"", Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question: how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question that all of us must ask ourselves from time to time. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts ""Training Day"" beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One: he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest. Two: Russell Crowe didn't deserve a second Oscar after ""Gladiator"". Hawke, I feel, was probably a little peeved at not getting as much recognition as this is easily the best film I've seen him in. But Washington is at his scene-stealing best, especially towards the end. Most other actors only appear for short periods of time (Dr Dre, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, etc) and don't really contribute that much.<br/><br/>Unlike most other cop movies, ""Training Day"" feels a much more realistic picture than others in its stable. LA isn't the playground of the rich and famous that we expect in the movies - it's a scorching hot-bed of drugs, gang violence and simmering racial tension. And it looks great. This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the ""hood"" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame. What it did do was leave me wanting more and I haven't seen a film in a while that left me like that."

","Director Antoine Fuqua did Training Day justice in this crime drama. The story starts as a rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) first day with a corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Jake is stunned by the methods that Det. Alonzo uses in his daily routine. Because Jake wants to become narcotics office he follows Alonzo instructions. As the story unfolds it is found out that Alonzo is in debt with the Russian mob and they have a deadline on when he must pay them back or he will be killed. This causes Jake to be thrust into Alonzo world of using drugs, stealing, and even killing. <br/><br/>This film is centered on the theme good versus evil. Jake is the naive rookie narcotics officer trying to bring down the overbearing corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris. The cinematography was great in showing this. The camera angles and lighting were great for the fact that it showed the desperate measure that Alonzo was willing to through in order to pay back the money and save his life. <br/><br/>A few scenes stood out as very powerful scenes in the movie. In the beginning of the movie Alonzo with a gun forced Jake to smoke PCP. Little did Jake know that this was part of a big plan Alonzo created to get out of debt. The use of slow motion was awesome as Jake smoked the PCP. There was also the use of different colors in the lighting. It showed how zoned out Jake was. Another scene in Training Day was where Alonzo was cornered by the Russian mob there was misty fog. The lighting was very dim and then the gun shots rang out. Hundreds of bullets were let off. This was a very powerful scene in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a great must see movie. Highly recommended."

","The acting was good, which is about the best that can be said for this movie. It exploits ethnicity, racial culture, tough talk, and violence for the sake of entertainment. None of what it presents is justified by the highly predictable ending.<br/><br/>Did the people who made this want it to be like ""Serpico"" and ""The Departed""? They failed to understand that it's really creepy to make a hero out of the Denzel Washington character. Fans will say that Washington's character is not a hero, that the dialog and script clearly depict him as a bad cop. Despite that, he is the most powerful character in the film by miles, which makes him the hero. His demise is ultimately effected by an anonymous band of machine-gun toting thugs we have not previously seen, leaving the impression that this guy was so powerful that none of the other characters could stop him -- not a very satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds are slow, consisting of little more than Washington acting uncompromisingly tough and Hawke acting compromised by his ambition to advance. Only in the last third of the movie does something resembling a plot materialize, almost as an afterthought.<br/><br/>The action was unrealistic. The dialog -- of which there was so much that a viewer could follow and understand the movie with eyes closed -- was artificial. It takes more than violence and tough talk to make a good film, unless the viewer is only after cheap thrills."

","I can't believe that Denzel Washington won a Oscar for his hammy, over the top, ridiculous, over the top performance where he practically chewed the scenery.
He probably only got it because he didn't get it for John Q, and Hollywood got accused of racism, so they handed him an award, regardless of the fact that his acting almost made this movie a comedy.
I don't remember much about the movie itself, because I kept being distracted from the actual movie by noticing the terrible acting by Washington instead.
Which probably means it wasn't a good film."

","A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans. I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one ""Alonzo"" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one ""Jake"" (Ethan Hawke). This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started. At least that was the case on the first viewing. On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening.

The movie has a few errors, but at a movie with such a story does not matter a few issues, practically the story and the mode the movie is made ""repairs"" the issues keeping you close to screen that you can't see them. Denzel Washington plays awesome, I haven't seen somebody playing so good in this kind if role since Al Pacino in Scarface, I'm sure that if a person that doesn't know Denzel Washington as an actor, watches how he plays, that person will probably tel you that is a men taken from the streets, not an actor. Ethan Hawke plays great to, he was probably deserving an Oscar at the time but perhaps it was just bad luck.<br/><br/>It's an excellent movie with a great story that is waiting for entering Top 250, if you wanna see an exceptional movie you should watch this, I can't find my words to describe it so I probably have to end my comment here."

","'Training Day"" is an equal-opportunity police brutality picture, depicting a modern Los Angeles in which the black cop is slimier and more corrupt than anybody ever thought the white cops were. Alonzo Harris, played by Denzel Washington, makes Popeye Doyle look like Officer Friendly. So extreme is his mad dog behavior, indeed, that it shades over into humor: Washington seems to enjoy a performance that's over the top and down the other side.<br/><br/>He plays Alonzo as the meanest, baddest narcotics cop in the city--a dude who cruises the mean streets in his confiscated customized Caddy, extracting tribute and accumulating graft like a medieval warlord shaking down his serfs. His pose is that the job must be done this way: If you don't intimidate the street, it will kill you. This is the lesson he's teaching Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a young cop who dreams of being promoted to the elite narc squad. This is Jake's first day of training, and he's been placed in the hands of Alonzo for a taste of street reality. Jake's dream: Get a promotion so he can move his wife and child to a nicer house. This may not turn out to be a wise career move. Just as a warm-up, Alonzo forces him to smoke pot (it turns out to be laced with PCP): If you turn down gifts on the street, he's told, ""you'll be dead."" He watches as Jake stops two punks who are raping a girl, and then instead of arresting the rapists, Alonzo thoroughly and competently beats them.<br/><br/>Dispensing street justice is what it's all about, Alonzo believes; the enemy lives outside the law, and you have to pursue him there. Jake hallucinates for a while because of the PCP, but surfaces to accompany Alonzo on a visit to an old and slimy colleague (Scott Glenn), on a raid on a drug dealer's house, on a visit to what seems to be Alonzo's secret second family, and to a restaurant rendezvous with what appears to be a circle of top cops who mastermind graft and payoffs. Along the way there's a sensational gun battle, although it doesn't draw enough attention to interrupt Alonzo's routine. I'm not saying all of these events in one day are impossible; in the real world, however, by the end of it both cops would be exhausted, and shaking for a druggist for Ben-Gay.<br/><br/>Is Alonzo for real? Are the city and its cops really this evil? (I am asking about the movie, not life.) At first we wonder if Alonzo isn't putting on a show to test the rookie. The rookie thinks that, too--that if he yields to temptation, he'll be busted. That theory comes to an end when Jake is ordered to kill someone, or be framed for the murder, anyway. And Alonzo isn't the exception to the rule: We can tell by the lunchtime summit that he's part of the ruling circle.<br/><br/>For Denzel Washington, ""Training Day"" is a rare villainous role; he doesn't look, sound or move like his usual likable characters, and certainly there's no trace of the football coach from ""Remember The Titans."" The movie, directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Bait"") and written by David Ayer (""The Fast and the Furious"") keeps pushing him, and by the end, it has pushed him right into pure fantasy. Antoine in the earlier scenes seems extreme but perhaps believable; by the end, he's like a monster from a horror film, unkillable and implacable.<br/><br/>A lot of people are going to be leaving the theater as I did, wondering about the logic and plausibility of the last 15 minutes. There are times when you're distracted from the action on the screen by the need to trace back through the plot and try to piece together how events could possibly have turned out this way. But Ayer's screenplay is ingenious in the way it plants clues and pays them off in unexpected ways, so that ""Training Day"" makes as much sense as movies like this usually can. It might have been better if it had stayed closer to life, but it doesn't want to be.<br/><br/>For its kinetic energy and acting zeal, I enjoyed the movie. I like it when actors go for broke. Ethan Hawke is well cast as the cop who believes ""we serve and protect"" but has trouble accepting the logic of Alonzo's style of serving and protection.<br/><br/>And the supporting roles are well-crafted, especially the retired cop played by Glenn, who seems to be sitting on a whole other buried story. Aware as I was of its loopholes and excesses, the movie persuaded me to go along for the ride. Of course you can't watch the movie without thinking of the Rodney King and O.J. Simpson sagas, two sides of the same coin, both suggesting the Los Angeles police are not perfect. I found myself wondering what would have happened if the movie had flipped the races, with a rotten white cop showing a black rookie the ropes. Given the way the movie pays off, that might have been doable. But it would have involved flipping the itinerary of the street tours, too; instead of the black cop planting the white boy in the middle of hostile non-white environments, you'd have the white cop taking the black rookie to the white drug-lords; gated mansions in ""Traffic"" (2001) come to mind. Not as much fun.<br/><br/>Footnote: Will audiences accept this movie in the current climate, when cops and firemen are hailed as heroes? I think maybe so; I think by delaying the movie's opening two weeks, Warner Bros. sidestepped a potential backlash. And Denzel's performance is sure to generate strong word-of-mouth. Second question: It's been asked if violent movies will become rare in these sad days after the terrorism. The box-office performance of ""Training Day"" may provide the answer."

","This movie is the slow unravelling of a cop who is charming and charismatic on the face of it but as the day goes on you see through Hoyt's eyes that Alonzo is not quite the super cop he seems.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect with this movie and the role was different for Denzel so I was pleasantly surprised. You instantly warm to Denzel's character. Even as his acts get gradually more and more questionable throughout the movie you want to believe it's not quite what it seems. Perhaps this is all a test, but no he is actually the bad guy. A loose cannon drunk on the power being a cop affords him leading him to a path of corruption.<br/><br/>Denzel's performance is excellent. I particularly liked the emotion behind him explaining to Hoyt why they can't do everything above board after murdering a drug dealer. Retrospectively looking at this scene you can tell he is a desperate man, like he doesn't really believe his own lies anymore but he has no choice. His fall from power at the end is also spectacular.<br/><br/>Credit to Hawke who played the naive and eager-to-please rookie. He was perfectly cast and was truly believable in the role.<br/><br/>One criticism I have of the story is that Hoyt's rescue of the girl being attacked which subsequently saved his life was a bit too convenient for me. LA is a huge place and what are the chances, in the same day!<br/><br/>Despite that a thoroughly enjoyable movie largely because of the excellent performances throughout, plus you have to love a Snoop cameo."

I've watched a lot of such movies, with similar plots but I was positively impressed by the atmosphere which this one creates. The perfect mix of the images highlighting Jake and Alonso driving through the hood and the tensioned music playing on these moments, makes you think and believe that this is a harsh reality and of course, as Alonso said once in the movie, ""what you learn in the academy is nothing compared to what you see on the streets"". Other nice points of this movie is the plot, which is totally imprevisible, always asking if Alonso is good or bad and the morale which implies to stick to the good rules and do what is right, because you never know when this is going to return back at you (I am talking about the saving of the girl who was so close to being raped.

It was interesting to see Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendez in this movie as well for a moment. I did not like the fact that the bad cop was the black guy, but realistically speaking I guess even the black cops are corrupted. It was interesting to see Jay the whole time be the good cop actually fighting for justice and you see how all corrupted people give you no choice but to be corrupted as well. Also, Denzel's character was very good in using lies and reverse psychology to control Jay's integrity. I loved seeing Jay gain not only his integrity back but he also kept his courage with him. I loved Lonzo's final speech and yelling with King Kong ain't got nothing on me. It was so enjoyable to watch the movie."
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","21 December 2017"," Training Day is worth watching, any day! It's a masterpiece.
","'King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!' That's sure, right! 'Training Day' was an amazing movie! Directed by Antoine Fuqua, and written by David Ayer, this neo-noir crime thriller, tells the story of a young naive LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) undergoing a nightmarish single day evaluation by corrupt, yet renowned and respected narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) who has big sinister plans for him. Without spoiling this movie, too much; while this good/bad cop film has amazing performances from both main & supporting actors like Ethan Hawke, Cliff Curtiss, Scott Glenn & others, much of the success of this movie has to go with how surprising good, Washington was as the villain. It's sad to think, that Denzel had to depart from his usual squeaky clean image, to win, an Oscar for best actor, but the performer really does shines in this type of roles. You can truly tell that, with his use of body language and tone. The way, Washington show, primeval street grit, with long, hard stern looks, loud boisterous charisma yelling, and disregard for the public safety, such as bumping into people as he walks, show how much of an utterly detestable character, Alonzo can be. No wonder, why most of the audience were so eagerly for his comeuppance, even if Denzel, personal, is so beloved. Yet, there was another part of the character, Washington was able to display, without the writer spending too much time on his character backstory, visually; which was showing empathy for Hoyt. You see this, whenever Jake does anything, valor and honest & Denzel having to react from that. Its shows the struggle of guilt, within Alonzo. It tells the tragic story of a mild-mannered, family man, slowly morphing into a ruthless criminal in a matter of a few words & stares. It's nearly perfect. Yet, there was a few flaws, with the character as a whole. Much of that, comes from the misuse of the source material, which 'Training Day' is loosely based on. While, Alonzo is somewhat based on real-life, corrupt Los Angeles, police officers, David Mack, Rafael PÃ©rez & Kevin Gaines. Some of the actions, the character commits as a Narc Cop with Hoyt, throughout the film, just doesn't seem very plausible or realistic. They come across as too flashy, gimmicky and cartoonish, rather than smart street cops. One such example is the smoking, a confiscate drug scene. First off, it's a little hard to believe, that an officer like Hoyt that use to do patrols, would be that gullible and foolish, what it takes to become a narc. In most cases, police officers received an average of 41 hours up to 540 hours of instruction training before going into that field. There would be, no way, Hoyt would be that adequate. Secondary, it really doesn't make much sense that he would take the drug, knowing full well, that he was going to drug test in a few days & he wasn't dealing with any perps at that time. Third, it's highly bizarre, that Alonzo would plan out, for a whole week of stuff, on a specific one day plan that relies so much on the highly off-chance that Hoyt would take the drug, in order to blackmail him. Much of this movie could had be resolve in the first couple of minutes, with Hoyt, saying 'no'. Fourth, how in the hell was Alonzo's many crimes, overlook for so long!? I get that, he get stuff done in the department, but even if most of the department share the same corruption as the officer on the field; cops still have to write reports, submit a financial disclosure statement, undergo random drug testing, and pass recurring background investigations, yearly. There is no way, they can hide everything from the public & other government agencies. The corrupt cops would eventually get caught. Probably quicker than later, like what happen in real-life, with the Rampart scandal; which this movie is loosely based on. Also, none of the criminal sequences, throughout the day, felt anywhere near realistic. The idea that they easily find illegal drugs, as soon, as they pull a corner is far from truth. In real-life, Narc spend hours on end, on one, suspicious activity, with little to no pay-off, that a crime is being committed. Also, much of the crimes, portray in the film, felt more like step-up sequences, rather than isolate scenarios, which occurs more, likely. Regardless of that, I do have to fight against the claims from critics that this movie is nothing, but the continuous negative stereotype of minorities in film, by saying the movie does show that corruption happens in every level, regardless of class and race, such as the case in the restaurant scene & with Roger (Scott Glenn). As for the critics that says, Hoyt was nothing, but a ''white savior' cinematic trope whom job is it to rescue people of color from their downward plight. I also have to disagree with them, as the film shown in the end, Black & Hispanic communities, are willing to stand up against crime. Hoyt didn't make them, change. They did it on their own. Nevertheless, the film approach to women, could had been a little better. Most of the women in the film does nothing, but look and act like sleazy floozies. Sadly, actress, Eva Mendes is just there, for eye-candy and pointless nude scene. Still, that's a lot better than the jarring use of black musicians artists, like Macy Gray, Snoop Dog, and Dr. Dre, as criminals. That was awkward. Still, great use of their music in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, this strong Rated R movie, was an intense & compelling watch. While, this crime drama is not for everybody, due to rough language, graphic violence, drug use, and sexual references. It's still worth checking out, unlike the 2017's TV Series of the same name. Forget that show. Watch the movie, instead."

This makes Alonzo implausible.<br/><br/>The film aptly uses the location of Los Angeles, which suffers from the socio-economic issue of drug cartels and gang wars, also relevant to the plot's context.<br/><br/>I've seen it once as of, but definitely wouldn't mind watching again, since it's no-campy, complex story line makes one to delve deeper into it's dialogues, thus increasing it's re-playing ability."

","Ethan Hawke has made a career out of perfecting the nervous smile and candid shake of the head. Even as he gets older he has retained that youthful naivety about him. In Lord of War I noted he was woefully miscast as the FBI hotshot - Hawke is not the arrogant, in control type. In Training Day he is a different brand of law enforcement, where his character plays to his strengths. In the beginning Jake Hoyt feigns confidence and ambition, but soon after is immediately wringing his hands and vibrating with a nervous energy because of the things he is being asked to do (he put this aura to great use as the fresh faced teenager in Before Sunrise). Hawke is like a modern Jack Lemmon, but dropped into a urban, unforgiving environment and a tireless role. His body is withered and lean, with a scratchy, unkempt beard as a symptom of long nights. He represents a rat, a narcotics cops scurrying over to the dark side. <br/><br/>Alonzo Harris is his opposite, who shares the same traits as Hoyt that might sooner mistake him for a dealer instead of a cop. Washington is relentless to the point of being overblown; with his skullcap, black 'matrix style' trenchcoat, silver crucifix necklace and penchant for double wielding pistols (with one aligned in the 'kill-shot' position), he treads the dangerous line between authenticity and the Hollywood vision of the edgy, corrupt cop. His dialogue is fast and furious, showcasing his 'street' knowledge and his wielding of racial capital to play both sides of the thin blue line closely, and often recklessly. In another world it would be easy to imagine him as a drug kingpin. <br/><br/>It is this approach that leads to Hoyt's first challenge. Harris underlines the offer with a bit of wisdom that makes so much sense that almost makes up for his methods: to be a narc you must know and love the drug. The second part of his nefarious plan is to lace the joint with PCP and create a trial of evidence that will later come into play. The 'drug vision', shot from the perspective of the dazed Hoyt, is where the film shows some of its false colours. It's ridiculous, highlighted with a nightmarish green tint, canted dutch angle and erratic shaky-cam straight out of some Don't Do Drugs PSA for a high school crowd. The nauseous combo with extreme close-ups barrelling in on the young rookie's reactions are part of Fuqua's treatment of 'realism', albeit a shiny, sanitised version of working narcotics. Occasionally, he even is allowed to splurge, and the result of this is a dramatic rooftop meeting of similarly corrupt cops about to raid an informant, or as they call it, 'cashing in an account'. We understand that each of the four have gone through the same trial by fire that Hoyt is being pushed through. But what's wrong with a Starbucks?<br/><br/>The ideal behind Hawke's Hoyt is a good one, if not simplistic. An early scene tacks a wife and child onto him like some sort of moral compass point, but not as part of a three dimensional character. He's an amalgamation of the characteristics that we and Hollywood like to see often in movies - white, middle class, young father, morally upright. Fuqua aligns the audience alongside him, and we nod and agree with his moral choices, before all that is upended and we discover that the streets operate on an entirely different level than the cinematic black and whites we are so used to. But the film also falls victim at the same crux. It posits that sometimes the bad guys win and that simple morality might not always be such an easy out, but then lets the angelic protagonist navigate the messy and heartless territory it has worked so hard to establish with relative ease and a few convenient narrative strokes. <br/><br/>Training Day recalls other tangled crime dramas about figures trying to navigate the corrupt waters of the system, in particular the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and its more well known western counterpart, The Departed. While the former wears its pulp on its sleeve by using a flashy action aesthetic and showy, soap-opera-esque flashbacks to push the narrative along, the latter was well and truly americanised. As with many of Scorsese's films it verges on the point of being overdone, stretched an extra fifty minutes and made gritty, grey and quietly devastating. A distinct difference lies in the treatment of the undercover gang member who infiltrates the police system: the original had a way of swinging allegiances and evoking Buddhist sentiments of a perpetual guilt, whilst Scorsese all but batters Matt Damon into the ground, leaving no room for dispute. Interestingly, Training Day was released but a month after the 9/11 attacks, with the American public distraught, and fear and paranoia running rampant. In that climate a cop could do no wrong. Nowadays I look around and see a very different environment, one where the lessons of Training Day might not be so shocking. While the two former films are more or less straight thrillers, Training Day attempts to say a little more, but it's not entirely successful either."

","""To protect the sheep, you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" This questionable sentiment is how rogue LAPD detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) justifies a heavy laundry list of dirty deeds, scary volatility, sociopathic backstabbing and a complete disregard for the badge that he wears on a chain like dog tags. And indeed, inner city Los Angeles can seem like a war zone, but its like he's in fact more part of the problem than the dark angel of justice he sees in himself. Antoine Fuqua's combustible crime drama Training Day rightly won Washington an Oscar for his unsettling runaway train of a performance, and he owns it down to the last maniacal mannerism and manipulative tactic. The film takes place over one smoggy L.A. day (hence the title) that feels like an eternity for its two leads, as well as all the colorful and often terrifying people they meet along the yellow brick road that's paved with used needles and shell casings. Harris is tasked with showing rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the ropes in his neighborhood, in the hopes that he'll pass the test and achieve Narc status. Jake is prepared for a run of the mill crash course, but as soon as he's treated to a verbal beatdown from Harris in the diner they meet at, he has a feeling it ain't gonna be anywhere close to a normal day. This is just another day for Harris though, as he drags Hoyt by the scruff through drug busts, gang warfare, the worst neighborhood in town and pulls him deeper into his very dangerous world. Fuqua has a knack for getting the atmosphere of his settings just pitch perfect, and the feverish nightmare of the inner city comes alive, seemingly possessing the characters themselves until the atrocities just seem like a way of life. The trouble really starts when they run across Harris's old drug lord buddy Roger (a wicked Scott Glenn in a role originally intended for Mickey Rourke), who proves a valuable asset later, though not in the way you might think. Harris introduces Jake to his equally crooked and scary team, including Peter Greene, Nick Chinlund and Dr. Dre who struggles in the acting department, especially in a room full of such heavy hitters. Jake is aghast at the horrors he sees and cannot believe the streets are like this. Harris devilishly assures him that this is the job, mutilating the symbol of his badge even more by justifying such behaviour as necessary. Tension reaches unbearable heights during a visit to a Latino gang household run by Cliff Curtis, Raymond Cruz and the eternally scary Noel Gugliemi. This is the heart of darkness fpr the film, a story beat from which there is seemingly no escape, until it becomes clear that Jake has somehow evolved a step up the food chain as far as LA goes, and is now ready to put down the dog who taught him, a dog who has long been rabid. People complain that the final act degenerates into a routine action sequence. Couldn't disagree more. With a setup so primed with explosive conflict, it can't end up anywhere else but an all out man to man scrap, which when followed by no flat out action sequences earlier in the film, hits hard. Their inevitable confrontation is a powerhouse, especially from Washington, who finally loses his composure and yowls like a trapped coyote, his actions caught up to him. In a role originally intended for Tom Sizemore (who would have rocked it in his own way) I'm glad Denzel got a crack at it, for he's absolute dynamite. Watch for Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry and Tom Berenger as the three senior LAPD dick heads, Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as a screeching banshee of a ghetto whore and Snoop Dogg as your friendly neighborhood wheelchair bound crack dealer. Fuqua keeps attention rooted on the dynamic between Washington and Hawke, who is excellent in as role that could have easily been swallowed up by Washington's monster of of a performance. Hawke holds his own, and the film is really about how two very different guys view a difficult area of town, how it changes them both, and ultimately how their moral compasses end up on a collision course. One of the best crime framas out there, and quickly becoming timeless."

","With his hopes for one day making detective firmly in mind, a young Los Angeles cop by the name of ""Jake Hoyt"" (Ethan Hawke) is excited about his new transfer to the narcotics division. To assist in his training he is accompanied by the man in charge of the division, ""Detective Alonzo Harris"" (Denzel Washington) who shows him the ropes for the first 24 hours. During this time he quickly learns that the rules he has been taught at the police academy do not apply and that his life is in jeopardy if he fails to adapt. He also learns that there is another sort of justice other than that rendered by the courtsâ€”street justice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was movie offers a no-holds-barred glimpse at the ""war on drugs"" and gang activity from the perspective of those living in the eye of the storm--and it isn't very pretty. The movie, on the other hand, was certainly entertaining enough with Denzel Washington performing in an excellent manner as did Ethan Hawke to a lesser extent. That said, I have rated the movie accordingly. Above average."

I felt like there were some unnecessary close ups on the fantastic portraits.

","There is one quick line in this feature that is pivotal to the plot: when Alonzo takes Jake to see Roger, the dealer, Roger asks Alonzo about the Russians. Roger says, "" . . . you know I've got your back."" So, think about the irony: Roger was promising Alonzo protection from the Russians; if Alonzo had not killed Roger, he would have been safe! This, I believe, is the supreme irony of Alonzo's reckless campaign to save his life by killing the one man who was prepared to save him. The hubris that Alonzo demonstrated is a symptom of his arrogant self-reliance - he planned everything in order to get his money, with no thought for the lives of those whom he used to achieve it.

When Harris begins to cross the line, Jake finds himself willing to look the other way.<br/><br/>Amazingly set over the course of 24 hours, the movie is a look at the seductive nature of corruption, how deeply it can bloom and how its ruinous consequences permanently stain anyone who comes in contact with it.<br/><br/>Washington radiates a wicked, malicious magnetism he's never displayed, by way of contrast with the heroic roles he usually takes on. This is the first villainous turn of his career. Being bad brings out the best in Washington, and his performance elevates ""Training Day"" past its familiar street-cops scenario into something far richer. Denzel is surely the star of this film and was quite deserving of his ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" academy award, even though I am sure many people claim Russell Crowe deserved it more for ""A Beautiful Mind"". In my opinion, the winner should have actually been Sean Penn for his work in ""I Am Sam"". However, I also think Ethan Hawke deserves some praise, this is a guy that has grown on me over the past few years, especially with this film and ""Before Sunset"".<br/><br/>Obviously Training Day is an example of a movie that showcases the talent of everyone involved, especially the talent of director Antoine Fuqua who, in my opinion, is not getting enough work but I am absolutely sure we will see more from him soon enough. 9/10"

","Warning! SPOILERS galore!<br/><br/>I was genuinely interested in this film to begin with... and I absolutely loved the acting of both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>BUT - about three quarters of the way through this thing I could no longer suspend disbelief.There are just too many things that accumulate for this film to be taken as seriously as it could have been...<br/><br/>Yes, there are rogue cops out there. That is not my problem with this film. It probably comes extremely close to the truth when showing how corrupt the cops can be - and also probably very close to what the streets and their scum are like.<br/><br/>The problem is with what happens to Ethan Hawke during the day in the life ... First problem. He smokes some pot laced with crack. He is totally out of his head... but probably not long enough to be realistic. He should probably have been almost totally knocked out for several hours... but it seems like only an hour or so after being high he is charging down a street and capturing totally by himself two would-be rapists... Not bloody likely. (And while I'm at it, I can't imagine real cops walking away from the perps leaving them with their handcuffs on... they would have at least taken back their equipment!<br/><br/>Please remember that one of the rapists kicks Ethan in the side at least two or three times during their scuffle. <br/><br/>Second: Ethan gets beaten up a second time by the hoods in the house where he is left by Washington. Sorry, but anyone who has been beaten up once by rapists and then beaten up a second time by these hoods would have been barely able to walk or do anything for the rest of the night. But not Ethan... he goes after Washington, and not only gets into a tumbledown fight that should ALSO have left him totally unable to move - but he actually jumps off a roof onto the windshield of a moving car and is STILL able to walk and operate on a pretty high level. <br/><br/>Sorry, but if anyone reading this has ever taken even a quarter of the punishment Ethan does in this film, they would know that he would have been inoperative for most of the day... and certainly not in any shape to get through the last quarter hour of this film; Like, who is this guy, anyway? Superman?<br/><br/>Third: How many 4 year old kids do you know that would trust a guy he's never met more than his own father? How many women who greet their man the way Washington's girlfriend (wife?) does when they stop off for lunch - would abandon him so quickly near the end? She grabs up her kid but does nothing to help protect Washington... and there is no explanation of why.<br/><br/>I could go on - but why bother? There are so many holes in this film that although I liked much of it - and could believe the angle of the rogue cops etc... there is just no way that someone like Ethan would have been able to physically make it through this day.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way - in a town of how many millions, what would the odds be that the ONE 14 year-old girl who Ethan saves from being raped would turn out to be related to one of the hoods who is supposed to have killed him for Washington? Oh, come on! That is the weakest part of the entire plot. Could anyone who took two seconds to THINK really accept such a corny device? One would have better odds trying to win the lottery!<br/><br/>All of this means that the film is really pretty stupid - or taking its audience for dunces... The only reason I gave this film a 6 instead of a 4 is because it is well-shot and well- acted."

Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been.

The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie.

Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil.

Ethan Hawke was surprisingly great at his role although his role did not have much of affection to show just many physical action. <br/><br/>you may think if the performances were good then how come you did not like it ! <br/><br/>Answer to that question is simple , it takes more than just big names or good performances to make a movie that everybody can connect to. the most important element is the story. unfortunately the story of the Training day was kind of childish, very unreal and raw! the writers had to cook the story more and answer basic questions on the minds of the audience about the sequences of the movie. for example we never realized who were those Latino guys ? who was Eva Mendez , a girl Washington sleeps with , a whore or his wife ? why didn't anybody help Washington in the neighborhood? <br/><br/>The biggest turn off for me was the scene where Hawke shot Washington! it was so unreal! first of all , in real life LAPD guys are trained to shoot and they don't flirt with the suspect just like Hawke did with Washington , they count to 3 or maximum of 5 and then boom they shoot! they don't wait for your bullshit ! second of all , in real life and in an African - American neighborhood no White has the balls to stand with a gun in his hand shooting another African American while he does not have ANYTHING to show that he is a cop! <br/><br/>Another questionable scene was at the same moment , when Hawke was going away with the money , Washington who was shot in the butt was jumping up and down ! who on earth can even stand with a bullet in his butt ???? Or how strong a very average and kind of slim man like Hawke can be to survive all that punches he got from Washington , jumping down from a building and still being the tough guy and standing on his feet and giving the bad guy to justice ! <br/><br/>I know it's just a movie but , what I'm trying to say is : <br/><br/>entertain us , don't ridicule us!"

","I have seen many Denzel Washington films, but this might just be his masterpiece. From watching Denzel in other films, i never thought that i could ever see him play the antagonist. But to my surprise he did a wonderful job. The way that he allowed us to see that his character was this brutal, uncaring person that was only looking out for himself; its what makes him such a stupendous actor.<br/><br/>I also have to say that the film was very well directed. this movie was authentic, it shows some of the things that happen in real life and in the real world. some of the pressure that is put on some police officer in the corrupt world of the law.<br/><br/>It is good to know that there is some officer that would still rather do the right thing, just like how Jake (Ethan Hawke) did.<br/><br/>Nevertheless in my opinion this is the best movie all of the actors in training day have worked in."
"butchfilms","10","2","5","14 October 2008"," Denzel Washington is excellent as Alonzo, a tough street wise cop
","What a great movie. I would put this movie between the best movies for men besides ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", ""pulp fiction"", ""die hard 1 & 2"" and ""predator"". Denzel Washington's performance as a tough cop Alonzo is terrific. For me there are just 2 movies ""pulp fiction"" and ""training day"" that have made me feel an exciting fast ride sensation since the first minute until the end.<br/><br/>The plot is about the first day of work of a rookie policeman called Jake (Ethan Hawke)who have to learn about the job from a tough street wise cop named Alonzo. During the day Jake is surprised how Alonzo handles different police's situations in a not by the book way, but Alonzo tells him this is how things are done in the field because you have to be a wolf in order to protect the sheep. Will Jake agree with Alonzo's methods to do the job?..... <br/><br/>I think a 7.5 is the correct grade for ""training day"" for its worth as a movie, but i give it a 10 because of the emotion that made me feel despite its common Hollywood's final. I think if this movie would have had a more realistic final part, ""training day"" would be considered one of the great movies of the decade and not just as a good action movie. <br/><br/>This is one of my all time favorite movies."

","After seeing The Lord Of The Rings, there was no doubt in my mind this flick would get all the main Oscars. How wrong I was! I watched Training Day after the Oscars were handed out and I truly must say I agree on Denzel winning the actors prize. In this movie you will see him as you've never seen before: a really bad cop who doesn't seem to care about anything. Very well played - also by Ethan Hawke by the way - and very nicely 'over the top'. A must see for lovers of police-thrillers. Great!!"

"xgros","2","4","16","1 February 2002"," Bad cop, good cop, violence.
","This movie can be summarised by: bad cop, good cop, violence. There is nothing more, nothing deeper, nothing exciting, nothing new. It is not the first movie about bad cops doing bad things and getting punished. It's not the first movie about black & white cops either. Let's hope it will be the last.<br/><br/>There is nothing to say about the acting. Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are playing very well, but the movie never really kicks off and the end is predictable. The movie compensates its poor scenario by a wave of violence and insults. If the US are really like that then it is difficult to understand why anybody would like to immigrate over there. What comes out of the movie is not so much the fact that the nice cop wins but more how poor and miserable the US are. Indeed, not only is the movie showing drugs, violence, alcohol, etc. but it also reveals that 99.9% of Americans are only interested in money. I guess the 'happy end' part shows that there is 0.1% that are above corruption and bribery.<br/><br/>A dead boring violent movie that is best to avoid unless you are into this kind of low level scenario."
"kenjha","3","2","6","28 September 2010"," Meandering and Ridiculous
","A rookie cop spends a day getting schooled in the ways of street life by a decorated narcotics officer. Washington, playing against type as the epitome of a bad cop, is so over the top that it is not surprising that he won an Oscar for this role. He is supposed to be charismatic but the character is not the least bit likable. The script starts off as meandering, with hardly any sustained narrative during the first half; it then crams in too much plot and ends up as unbelievably stupid, including a key scene that hinges on a silly coincidence. The action scenes are utterly ridiculous, with Fuqua not making any attempt to infuse credibility into them."
"Antagonisten","3","2","6","14 August 2006"," A B-movie
","I can start off by saying that i consider the Academy Award to be a very dubious award. It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of ""The Shield"" (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.<br/><br/>And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of ""The Shield"". The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste."
"ParanoidAndroid1982","6","2","6","7 April 2006"," Denzel Washington has one of the most detestable main characters ever
","Training Day is an entertaining movie about good and bad cops. Nothing that hasn't been made before in Hollywood. Actually, there's nothing spectacular about the plot or the theme. It's full of clichés, situations that you've seen over and over again in movies just like this one.<br/><br/>However, Training Day has something other movies don't have: a wonderful performance by one of the greatest actors of his generation. Denzel Washington's character is just despicable; there's nothing likable about it. And yet you can't help but admire all the work and the energy Washington puts into it, making it one of the most hateful movie characters ever.<br/><br/>A word for Ethan Hawke whose work, however strong, is completely overshadowed by Denzel Washington's performance."
"Muhammad_Rafeeq","10","1","2","8 February 2020"," Alonzo Harris: To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","The most intense ride along ever. Antoine Fuqua directed a wild cop drama like you have never seen before. Dealing with systematic corruption in the police force, crime investigation, drug dealing, bribery, and ethics. Training Day is a visceral sprint into law enforcement. Training Day forces you right into the position of a rookie cop asking yourself what would you honestly do in the same situation. It is brilliant due to David Ayer's clever and complex script alongside Fuqua's innovative and gritty direction. Training Day is timeless thanks to its commentary on police corruption and our contemporary police brutality problem. I think everyone needs to see Training Day. Denzel Washington is the real star as he comes across as the most real and selfish cop ever put on screen. His violence, anger, and ingenuity are met with his display of likability, experience, and results. Washington portrays a man of deeply held convictions that poses as a good cop to fool all those around him. Washington earned that Oscar for real. You will absolutely despise his character by the end. Notably, Ethan Hawke is the everyman rookie cop that we are meant to empathize with from the very first scene. We are along for the ride right by Hawke's side and he plays it wonderfully. From the naive well wisher that does not understand the streets to the honest cop that does the right thing, Hawke pulls off a very relatable performance in Training Day. He plays off of Washington's outgoing psychopath very convincingly down to the last. I like Hawke in Training Day quite a bit. I must mention there are so many neat cameo and supporting roles scattered throughout Training Day. From Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eva Mendes, and Terry Crews. Training Day's cast is wild. Everyone is realistic and feels a part of this horrid world of crime and corruption. In all, Antoine Fuqua did a phenomenal job directing Training Day. It has aged well with the same intensity as when it first released in theaters. Training Day is still shocking and visceral down to the last moment. This is a brutal ride along for the books, but well worth the watch."

An outright 10. It is entertaining from the beginning to the end. The plot of the movie unfolds nicely and has a satisfying ending, the action/shooting sequences are amazing, but, in my opinion, the best part of this movie is the character of Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington. Alonzo is a long-time LAPD cnarcotics detective who is ruthless, corrupt but nonetheless extremely cool. The amazing performance brought Denzel Washington an Oscar. I highly recommend this movie to everyone even if it's not the genre you typically watch. Maybe it'll change your mind."

","This has got to be one of my favorite street/hood movies I have seen. Although this is more from the point of views from a good cop and a crooked cops perspective of things. The narrative is easy to follow but there is street smart and street depth to it. Despite few parts not being all that believable, especially when it comes to some of the decisions and actions of some people in this. So yeah, the story connects really well together even the parts that just look like subplots. And when you throw in Denzel Washington putting on his most explosive, menacing, charismatic and powerful performance. You got yourself one heck of a awesome street/hood/crime movie that pushes towards what street justices is like. Ethan Hawke is even believable playing a naive rookie officer with a good heart. This is a entertaining and yet enthralling experience to sit through, especially because of Washington's performance in this. Overall, this is a movie I can highly recommend.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I absolutely adore this movie! My favourite Antoine Fuqua film by far. I absolutely love the tensity in Denzel's character, and at the the same time his emotion. Denzel makes this movie. He makes it a success, with some of the best acting I have ever seen on screen. Ethan Hawke also does a great job with the Innocent cop, but Denzel just steals the show. With high tensity and action packed police drama, this is definitely a film to see! Furthermore, there is disturbing dialogue within the film. But once you get past that and get into the world of good cop, bad cop you get into the mind of how Ethan Hawkeyes character is feeling and how he is thinking, and how he is being played for a fool by Denzel. Truly a masterpiece in the making!"

","An honest rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), on his first day in the narcotics division, is assigned to be trained with a street-smart veteran, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris demonstrates through his actions that in order to deal with hard-boiled criminals, it is necessary for the cops to get their hands dirty at times. They visit gang-infested neighborhoods, chase drug-dealers and conduct house-raids. But as the day progresses, Harris's methods become increasingly questionable and Hoyt starts suspecting his mentor's true intentions.<br/><br/>The stories of corrupt cops and naive, good-looking, rookie cops gaining an experience of their lifetime (""character arc"" in movie parlance) have been told many times by Hollywood. But the performances of Washington and Hawke set this movie apart. The supporting cast is pretty good too. There is plenty of suspense and good action to keep the viewers engaged for two hours. But none of it stays in the mind after the movie is over."
"PassPopcorn","7","1","2","15 August 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Denzel Washington won an Oscar for best actor in 2002 for the movie Training Day. Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it – he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.<br/><br/>Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.<br/><br/>I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool – but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.<br/><br/>Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time – there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time – especially those Alonzo calls ""the three wise men"". All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"Semmy-tones","10","1","2","8 August 2012"," Never mind Washingtonwhat about Hawke
","We all know that Denzel can cut it and performed his role here with unmistakable mastery. However personally I thought the Oscar should go to Ethan Hawke; one of my favourite actors and often under rated. He's one of those actors who is so good in his supporting roles that he often gets overlooked. From the first time I saw him in Dead poets, I've been following his career and in Training day I thought Hawke gave the performance of his life. This is a fantastic gritty suspenseful story that is so refreshing in the face of all the bubble gum thrillers out there that just want numbers at the box office. This movie proves that you can have both realism and popularity in the same reel. Whatever minor flaws this movie had was more than made up for by the palpable screen chemistry between these praiseworthy actors who took the viewer on a roller coaster ride with the sticky plot, thorough script and various unexpected twists and turns. An adrenaline fuelled edge of the seat trip; riveting from beginning to end10 out of 10"

","""Training Day"" is an awesome film with one of the most memorable character of the 2000 through 2009 decade.<br/><br/>Alonzo is one of the best characters in recent memory and one of the best villains in movie history. He begins the film as a good guy, showing Jake the ropes. He quickly becomes questionable with his techniques that just don't feel right. As the film goes on it is clear that Alonzo is very, very crooked and needs to be put in his place. There is a very memorable line from Alonzo during his drastic downfall, which is, ""King Kong ain't got s**t on me!"" The way that Washington delivers that line during Alonzo's monologue is magnificent. <br/><br/>Beyond the fantastic villain character, ""Training Day"" has a great script. Yes, it is unlikely that all of this would take place in just one day if this was real life, but I firmly believe that that notion of reality can be stretched at times in cinema. There is little to be said on the plot, but it is just very well written and executed. <br/><br/>Jake's good natured personality is a good opposition towards Alonzo, but his character is left in the darkness next to the brilliance that is Alonzo.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. It is a fun story with a very memorable character."

Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.<br/><br/>Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.<br/><br/>Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.<br/><br/>Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up.

","The ending was a bit of overkill. That could be said. And the mano-a-mano fight après the ending was a bit drawn out. That too could be said. But the rest of the film was more than excellent.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.<br/><br/>Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.<br/><br/>I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then ""led"" on the ""trip"" by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil—and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of ""guidance"" you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.<br/><br/>Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","In re-visiting TRAINING DAY (2001) recently, I have absolutely no doubt that Denzel Washington deserved his Best Actor Oscar. He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.<br/><br/>In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! <br/><br/>Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.<br/><br/>Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray. But the obvious standout is Washington, whose powerful performance wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar...And he got it!"

As Jake's 'Training Day' progresses he learns that his Police Academy rules don't apply in Alonzo's world, and with increasing concern, not to mention personal jeopardy, finds that Alonzo, some of his fellow detectives and even higher officials in the LAPD, have distinct rules of their own.<br/><br/>Not an original premise, but here the delivery is bang on. Washington plays on his past comfortable screen personas, initially coming across as the experienced, tough, no-nonsense, but well meaning, detective. We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.<br/><br/>There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA  in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.<br/><br/>However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"zardoz-13","8","1","2","7 February 2008"," An abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture with a great Denzel performance
","Denzel Washington delivers a dynamic performance easily worth an Oscar as a rogue cop in director Antoine Fuqua's gritty urban crime thriller ""Training Day,"" co-starring Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Snoop Doggie Dog, Macy Gray, and Tom Berenger. This unsavory but exciting R-rated law & order melodrama paints a considerably less than flattering portrait of police corruption in Los Angeles. Essentially, scenarist David (""U-571"") Ayers has exploited the recent Ramparts police scandal in the L.A.P.D. as the basis for his controversial but contrived screenplay. While he infuses the film with his charismatic personality, Washington goes against-the-grain for a change as a dyed-in-the-wool villain who won't hesitate to double-cross friends. Not only does bad-ass Denzel tote a chrome-plated automatic pistol under each armpit, but also he cruises his asphalt domain in a customized obsidian-black 1978 Monte Carlo. Gear heads will drool over Denzel's ride which doubles as his office. As an extension of Alonzo's amoral character, the Monte Carlo compliments his roguish personality. Sadly, as psychological actioneers rate, ""Training Day"" lacks the tenacity that Washington imparts to his warlord-like antagonist. Fuqua and Ayer employ sentimental stratagems to align our sympathies with Ethan Hawke's half-hearted hero who turns wimp in the end. Surprisingly, unpardonable logistics sabotage Fuqua's mise-en-scene, especially in a rooftop foot chase! Further, the filmmakers bank on sheer coincidence to bail out the hero. A ""Scarface"" inspired scene as Latino gangsters prepare to ice our hero in a bathtub illustrates the worst of the coincidences. Ultimately, if ""Training Day"" constitutes the best Hollywood can offer as a cautionary tale about police corruption, we're all in trouble. Basically, the Darwinian message of ""Training Day"" is big-fish eat little-fish, or survival of the fittest, so what does it matter if how criminals buy it in the end if justice is served? As cynical as ""Training Day"" tries to portray itself, it winds up as a formulaic but flawed thriller about legal courtroom justice versus street justice.<br/><br/>Basically, this abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture does nothing countless other thrillers like Sidney Lumet's ""Serpico"" (1973) haven't done better. Specifically, ""Training Day"" resembles a white-washed version of director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1994 dirty cop saga ""Bad Lieutenant,"" starring Harvey Keitel as a heroin-shooting, trigger-happy, N.Y.P.D. detective in deep trouble with loan sharks. Like the Keitel character, Washington's renegade cop shoulders his share of problems. He has teed-off the Russians (presumably their mafia) during a wild and woolly weekend in Las Vegas, and they want payback. Even Alonzo's police superiors refuse to believe he is anything more than a walking dead man. Alonzo aims to prove them wrong and his narcissism makes him perversely appealing. Some of the problems with ""Training Day"" is what we learn about Alonzo's off-screen activities seems more interesting than what we see him do. Take the encounter with the Russians in Vegas. Apparently, Alonzo snapped, killed a guy, and the Russians have dispatched hit men to get him the same way the Colombians nailed Al Pacino in Brian De Palma's ""Scarface."" Nevertheless, Alonzo never loses his cool in ""Training Day,"" because he believes he is in control, particularly with regard to a rookie auditioning for the sixth man slot on his elite team.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" chronicles a 24-hour span in the life of young, idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke of ""Dead Poets Society"" & ""Hamlet"") who wants only to 'protect and serve' the public. Since joining the Los Angeles Police Department 19 months ago, Hoyt has been angling for a big break. Thirteen-year veteran L.A.P.D. Det. Sgt. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington of ""Remember the Titans""), who heads up an elite narcotics squad, provides that break. Harris gives Hoyt the chance of a life-time to prove he can perform undercover without getting himself smoked by a paranoid drug dealer. If Hoyt can make a favorable impression on Alonzo, he assures his young beautiful wife breast feeding their 10-month age, infant daughter they will be bound for a better life.<br/><br/>As a typical, formulaic American movie, ""Training Day"" relies on rewards and punishment to shape its morality. Hoyt interprets this assignment as his ticket to the big time. Not only is Hoyt in for a rude awakening, but also so is the audience. By the time those fateful 24 hours elapse; Hoyt will emerge as an entirely different person. His saintly ideals will be tarnished as well as his own sense of innocence. Anyway, Ethan Hawke gives an evocative performance, but the actions of his character ultimately undercut the brilliance of his acting. He plays a stereotypical hero who balks at doing what a hero's got to do. Hoyt's last confrontation with Alonzo underlines the weakness inherent in Hawke's character. As the young, hungry cop, Hoyt represents hope, so his refusal to rub out Alonzo smacks more of political correctness than dramatic closure. Similarly, ""Training Day"" compares these two characters and reminds us in no uncertain terms who epitomizes good and evil.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include ""The Replacement Killers"" and the slick Jamie Fox caper ""Bait,"" gives ""Training Day"" a sleek, sharp, and snazzy look. Unfortunately, while the movie amounts to a visual feast for the eyes, David Ayer's script degenerates during the second half of the action. The hero stands for law and order, but he refuses to get himself dirty do his job. Clearly, ""Training Day"" contends that what you sow, so shall you reap. Anton Fuqua and David Ayer have made a passable film that provides reassurances if the cops cannot take care of corruption, then criminals will."
"dead47548","9","1","2","9 January 2008"," Original and engrossing.
","Police corruption is a topic that is used numerous times in films to the point of annoyance, but this one makes it much more gritty and realistic than any example I can think of. I'm always a fan of the 'Good v. Evil' scenario and this one employs it perfectly. The polar opposites that the film creates in Alonzo and Hoyt (the former being completely corrupt, the latter being completely pure) are very interesting and the balance between them kept me engaged the entire film. As we watch Hoyt try to understand this new world that he's been thrown into, while still trying to keep his morality and good nature intact, we realize (just like he does) that there is no right or wrong. You have to create a balance, because the line 'It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.' couldn't be more true, so sometimes that's why you have to bend the rules in order to bring the bad guys down. The ending is one of my all time favorites, as Hoyt leaves Alonzo to be murdered by the numerous men out to get him because he can't arrest him and he can't kill him himself. Brilliant. Both of the lead performances are excellent, and Denzel's win was fully deserved. His charisma and the fact that his character was so against his normal 'good guy' type made for such an interesting and ethereal portrayal of one of my favorite characters. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the huge coincidence that the girl Hoyt randomly saved from being raped just happened to be the cousin of the man who was about to kill him. I found that insanely dumb, but it didn't affect my opinion on the film at all."

","Id agree with everyone who liked this movie but think of this Ethan Hawke was the main character therefore he was the main actor the protagonists he should have won the Oscar because he was the main actor, Denzel was the antagonists and the secondary actor and therefore the supporting actor... the only reason he won is because he was more known. don't agree with me think of who the MAIN CHARACTER. So therefore the that is why I hate Hollywood, i admit Denzel is a good actor a very good one. But he was the supporting role... I think I have to keep saying this I liked the plot twists, the way everything fell together at the end and how everything especially the mafia shooting at the end... so there you have it people."

It is interesting to see the people Jake(Ethan Hawke) meets during his first 'training' day in this new team. Interesting to see how people, who we initially take for 'bad' guys care more about honor and duty than persons who's 'job' it is to protect these values<br/><br/>Eva Mendes also has a small role too, that for me is hilarious, but i guess this was just a step forward for her towards 'star'-status later in her career<br/><br/>9/10 for story, acting and production<br/><br/>peace"

","Training Day is the story of a man's first day as a narcotic's officer. He joins to protect the community and seemingly his wife and infant child. But his partner (Washington) gives much, much more than he bargained. This is a wonderfully looking film that starts out very strongly and has some really intense scenes that do stick with you(particularly the climax, a scene in an alley, and, well, I'll let you be surprised). There are a couple plot holes and you have to watch and listen carefully to understand everything that' going on, but it's well written with a couple of clever twists in between. The ending is a little formulaic, but that is saved by a powerhouse, Oscar winning performance by Denzel, and an equally intense Hawke. This is the best film on Fuqua's line of action drama's. With the exception of Lightning in a Bottle of course."
"handiman22","Null","1","2","12 May 2006"," Thought provoking but not 100% plausible
","Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke provide excellent performances, but the plot has some obvious holes. Nevertheless, the reason I think highly of the movie is because it really explores the conflict that undercover officers face- to be very effective, one must almost become a criminal. Morality is not always crystal clear. I think the message of the movie is this- Denzel's character crosses the line and it thoroughly corrupts him which leads to his demise. In the course of the ""Training Day"", Ethan Hawke's character sees what one must do to reach the pinnacle of effectiveness as a narc cop, but in the end, he rejects that philosophy because he sees the paradox. One cannot claim to be an officer of the law, however effective at fighting crime, if one engages in criminal activity to achieve the effectiveness. This is an incredibly profound and compelling concept for all cops. Do you ""create"" justification to pull over a vehicle you suspect may be involved in criminal activity? Does the end justify the means? Is society better off with cops whose methods may be immoral but whose results are extremely productive? Great food for thought and debate."
"foOki","7","1","2","11 May 2006"," Watchable
","When this movie first came out I absolutely hated it but having just watched it again I don't think its 'that' bad. It's not a very deep movie and glosses over a lot of its issues and themes to the point that I missed them originally. Maybe I was expecting too much from this 'dark and gritty' police drama..<br/><br/>It looks to be a simple story of morales. Nothing to do with law. Just about egos and mainly noting that a criminal is still a criminal with or without a badge. Ethan's character's turmoil seems to be more that he keeps hoping that Denzel's character will eventually show him something through his unorthodox teaching 'methods'. Instead he simply learns what not to do and that he doesn't believe in Denzel.<br/><br/>That's all. The ac tings OK, and the direction competent. So doesn't deserve rave reviews, but probably doesn't deserve bad ones either."
"ravi_k_gandhi","Null","4","18","12 September 2001"," High energy filled with sharp dialogue
","In Training Day, we get a high energy movie with sharp dialogue, along with a superb performance by Denzel Washington as a rough and tough street cop. It is training day for a rookie cop played by Ethan Hawke, yet, instead of offices, coffee and paperwork, he is given a day with Washington and we the audience are along for the ride.  From the moment both characters meet, we immediately understand who is running the show.  Hawke portrays an innocent, honest, almost naive cop stern in the ways of ethics and laws.  Washington, on the other hand, believes in the law of the streets.  While both arguements for solving crime have been portrayed in a lot of other movies, along with the almost tired partnership of a Black and White cop and their differences, this movie actually works.  Hawke is quite honest and at times naive, but not naive to the point of unbelieveability.  Washington is fiery in his ways of cleaning up the city and his knowledge of 'real policing'. So we come to very much enjoy his presence on the screen because it's as if Washington himself relishes the part of being the bad and disliked character. A role that is refreshingly new for Washington, but you wouldn't know it watching him play it so well. There is a constant back-and-forth sharing of views on how crime should be dealt with by Washington and Hawke.<br/><br/> It is amusing to watch Hawke rationalize his views only to be quickly outwitted by Washington's sometimes outrageous antics.  Naturally Hawke must give in slightly because after all, he is the one being trained but also because Hawke sees this opportunity to move higher up in rankings and eventually become detective.<br/><br/>Training day is a test for Hawke, but by the end of the movie, it truly is a test on everyone.  A test of judgement, morals, ideals, values.  In other words, an overall test of who we really are as individuals.  And so by the end of training, we and Hawke both find out just that, who we really are.<br/><br/> Grade: B"

","'Training Day' is one day in the life of officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). It is his first day in training with detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington). Jake also wants to be a detective one day. Alonzo is not your normal detective. At first his intentions are not very clear but when Jake has to do very strange things you know Alonzo is not a good guy.<br/><br/>Basically Alonzo and Jake are driving around in a car, sometimes meeting people. That is why the performances are so important. Fortunately they are great. Hawk as the rookie does a very nice job and Washington, not the likable character he often is, creates a great evil character. The movie itself is not that great and the plot has some very predictable points, but because of these two actors the movie is elevated to a higher level."

","Denzel was totally over-rated as a corrupt cop in this middling tale of street life.

He just raises his voice and tries to ""out-act"" everybody else on screen. Ethan Hawke was also nominated, and is actually much more impressive and truthful as the rookie cop (whose first day on the job with Denzel lends the film its title.) Denzel is always competent, but his turn as the bad guy in TRAINING DAY never amounts to anything but a gimmicky career move. I suppose his Oscar win just goes to show how much the Academy loves an actor showing off, whether its Nicole Kidman or Charlize Theron uglying up for their Best Actress wins, or Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, or Dustin Hoffman playing handicapped for theirs. In this case, Denzel was the Biggest Showoff of 2001."

It was a well-structured, well-balanced cop-movie.<br/><br/>Training Day is about LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt, excellently portrayed by Ethan Hawke, and Narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris, brilliantly portrayed by Denzel Washington. Jake Hoyt is going to be a Narcotics Detective too, just like Alonzo Harris. He has a great sense of justice and honesty. But before he really starts to work he joins Alonzo Harris on a training day, meant to introduce new detectives to their work and their neighbourhoods. The only problem is Alonzo Harris is probably the baddest character ever portrayed by Denzel Washington. He's just bad to the bone, he steals, he cheats and he beats. He's in this line of work just to get rich. Because Jake Hoyt is nervous and new to this line of work he accepts some of the suspicious behaviours of Alonzo Harris but slowsly he starts to realize what he is doing and most importantly... He starts to realize that he is being sucked into it against his own will.<br/><br/>The story line makes up for a good movie, but if properly executed it could be great movie (as with all story lines probably...). Let me tell you this, this movie is executed properly! Alonzo Harris has some cool lines but when Denzel says they sound great! Put some mediocre actor in this movie instead of Denzel and this movie would have been good, but not nearly as good as it is now. He performance lifts this movie to a higher level.<br/><br/>Now we are completely forgetting Ethan Hawke. Ethan portrayes his character excellent too. He acts very convincing as the cop who only wants to do good and help people (isn't that their job? :)).<br/><br/>Scott Glenn's character Roger is nice too. He plays a bigtime drugdealer who is being betrayed by Alonzo Harris.<br/><br/>Musicians Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg also have nice parts. Especially Snoop Dogg's part is cool. A crackdealer in a wheelchair!<br/><br/>Although she didn't play a big part I want mention Eva Mendes who plays the role of Sara Harris. She is just drop dead gorgeous!!!<br/><br/>All in all this is a great movie. I recommended to anyone who likes crime/thriller-movies.

Ethan is his young trainee, Jake Hoyt, who wants to become a narc so he can move himself and his wife into a better home.  Throughout the day, we see Denzel battle crime with such hostility, that Jake cannot help but think that what Alonzo is doing is wrong.  At this point this is where the battle starts...<br/><br/>Alonzo Harris is not evil in the usual sense of the word, but he is simply a person who has become corrupted by his own means of justice.  The story of ""Training Day"" is that he has developed a sort of God-like persona and uses this image to put fear into the hearts of those who are against him. Despite all of this, there are higher forces who oppose his power.  This inevitably leads to his downfall.  Alonzo is a tyrant plain and simple.  He has people who do his bidding for him, but not for long now that Hoyt is on the streets.  Hoyt will lead the battle to oust Alonzo out of power.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Soo many critics of this film have talked about its plot holes and unexplained events, and its over-the-top action. First off, in my opinion, there were few of these flaws in the movie. I admit there were a few but no movie is perfect. I have watched the movie three times, not because it was the best movie I have ever seen, but to look for these giant holes in the plot and to watch the over the top action scenes. Nothing I saw and noted was that big of a deal to throw the whole movie into the crap pile which is what many people have done. I guess a lot of people don't realize that when these blockbuster movies are created it's not for the people who will look into every nook and cranny of the story and dialogue to find some piece of imperfection. They write it for the average movie go'er. This average movie go'er isn't there to look for the flaws they are there to, in a sense, be put into this movie.<br/><br/>If Ethan Hawke hadn't been beating so badly that he couldn't get up and fight back then the next scene of him being hauled off to the hospital would really make the movie less interesting. On the other side if he hadn't received those brutal beatings then his fighting back wouldn't be as enjoyable. Thats what people want to see a glorious fight back, or a tragic fall. In providing the audience with this the writer has to make some adjustments to reality.  Maybe the streets of LA are not correctly portrayed and maybe the way the they went about their police business isn't all realistic, but without these tweaks it wouldn't be a good in your face cop movie. I mean reality can't always be as entertaining as Training Day was.<br/><br/>Reading over this I kind of rant, its late and I should be asleep. I hope some who read this can see my point."
"Spleen","Null","3","14","16 April 2002"," Good material squandered
","Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>We're presented with a choice, between a policeman who's pure but ineffectual, and one who's corrupt but (as the cliché has it) ""gets results"".  I hope everyone will prefer the former.  (I hope, also, that everyone will realise that in real life, the choice is otherwise, and that the most corrupt police forces are also the most inefficient and useless.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Ethan Hawke's woefully under-described and thin character (the actor does what he can) doesn't have the guts to be pure.  TWICE his superior, who might as well have horns growing out of his forehead, offers him the chance to walk back to his old, honourable, by no means unpleasant job, at no cost or risk, without losing face before any third party - and the fool refuses, for no reason at all that we can see.  We can only presume he doesn't want to appear naïve.  It would only be possible to warm to a man this spineless if we knew something about him.<br/><br/>But the key choice he's offered is a bit less obvious.  Only a bit.  Anyone ought to be able to see that everything the narcotics squad does counts for nothing - for less than nothing.  For every drug dealer, large or small, that they put away, another will leap up to take his place.  But the market forces that make this the case do not apply in the case of, say, rape: and when Jake saw a rape about to take place, he had the chance to actually do some good, by dropping whatever shadowy nothingwork Alonzo wanted him to be getting on with and intervene.  He chose to intervene.  (Successfully  - but for some reason he doesn't actually arrest the rapists.  Why not?  Did he require the co-operation of his superior?  Was he merely caving in, once again, to moral pressure?  Are we meant to be able to work this out?)  And it's fitting that his one good deed turns out to be what saved his life - in fact, to have been almost the only thing that COULD have saved his life, given that he didn't have the sense to walk away from the narcotics squad altogether.<br/><br/>I liked this touch.  A pity everything that happens after the key scene with the bathtub is just standard revenge rampage wrap-up (so muddled that perhaps I'm being generous in using a word like ""revenge"", which implies a goal).  And a pity that everything leading up to the trap in which Jake is caught is just so flat.  Fluid, bold photography, a good sense of rhythm and strong performances can't breathe life into the opening third or the conclusion.  Nor can guns.  But there's real promise and fire in the middle bit."

","When I first saw this in the theater I was amazed.  I was so happy the day I heard that my boy, Denzel, was nominated for the Oscar.  When he won it, I was right there with Sidney clapping.  He deserved it!  He ad libbed a lot of this movie!!  I mean, Training Day was shot using real ese's and vato's from the Imperial Courts in LA!  No cameras have ever been allowed into that hood!  This is the best ONE DAY movie ever!  Ethan Hawke is great and should have won the award for best supporting actor.  However, his time shall come. The best parts about this movie were that everything Denzel said was true (the director points this out).  The tension with the ese's at the kitchen table is authentic.  I was surprised that the Vato Smiley, is the same dude as the WOLF from Collatoral Damage.  He is a New Zealander in real life. However, he plays a very good ese.  I bought this DVD and love it so much. This is the best Denzel movie since Riccochet!!   9 out of 10 stars!!!"
"Sisiutil","9","3","14","7 April 2002"," Not your typical cop flick
","I was surprised by an earlier user comment which stated that this film was a fun way to spend two hours ""...without having to think too hard"". This is NOT your typical cop/buddy flick with a happy, neatly tied-up ending. It had the necessary action and suspense elements, but it's also a dual character study as well as a sordid tour of America's drug and gang sub-culture. It's thought-provoking and disturbing.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington won the best actor Oscar for this, and I can see why--he's utterly mesmerizing as Alonzo, the senior street narc. He's Satan in gangsta clothes: charming, sexy, seductive, manipulative, and larger than life. Ethan Hawke deserves credit for holding his own with Washington; a lot of other actors would have been blown off the screen, but we keep identifying with Hawke's ingenue Jake right up to the end of the film. Great use of authentic locations and lighting, and terrific supporting performances too.<br/><br/>This was the best film of 2001 in my opinion. Just be warned that it's like watching a car crash--ugly, violent, and utterly fascinating."
"johnnymonsarrat","9","3","14","3 April 2002"," Jon Monsarrat review: deep & fascinating action film
","""Training Day"" is either a drama or an action story -- you can take the film for either, which is good because as an action film buff I normally don't get into dramas -- too arty, with melodrama bits that bore me, or overly subtle. Fortunately, Training Day avoids both extremes, being a fascinating police story with outstanding performances that won Ethan Hawke an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and Denzel Washington the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The story is gritty and real-world, with an ""edge"" that avoids campy entirely. Although it's quite violent, they avoid serious gore. And although the premise of the story is not new (what premise is?), how it's played out, especially at the ending, is original and satisfying. The film has both more drama and more action than the recent spate of Robert DeNiro drama / thrillers, including ""Heat"", which is similar.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action film buffs, even if you hate dramas, even if you<br/><br/>are only happy when stuff is blowing up constantly<br/><br/>-- Drama / arty types, unless you are turned off by what is<br/><br/>perhaps one notch too much violence (less than ""The Professional"" aka ""Leon"" (1994)).<br/><br/>-- non-action film types who might see one action film every<br/><br/>so often, and have maybe heard about ""training day"",<br/><br/>with the same caveat about violence.<br/><br/>I'll give ""Training Day"" an excellent 9 out of 10."

","I can't stop thinking about this movie. Yesterday evening I rushed to the cinema because something told me I just had to see it. Whatever it was, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!!!! I was blown away in the first few minutes. Denzel Washington' performance left me speechless and a day later I still can't find the right words to use. It was as if he'd been preparing his whole life for this role, building and forming it inside his mind but in the mean time also delivering some of the better performances seen on the big screen like the one in ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Devil in a blue dress""... I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's ""Scarface"", it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.<br/><br/>
A movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his ""partner in crime"". <br/><br/>With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.<br/><br/>Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.     <br/><br/>My ni**a!        10/10"

","I was extremely satisfied with Mr. Washington's performance in this movie. He made me believe he was a crooked narcotics officer with no regard for anyone but himself, yet I was mysteriously attracted to him and repelled to him at the same time!<br/><br/>The psychological and physical games orchestrated and performed by Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) on just about every character in the story were both believable and brilliant.<br/><br/>The story does teach a lesson, ""What goes around, comes around!""

","This film really got to me like no movie has in a long time.  After about the first hour, I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely glued to the screen.  The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.<br/><br/>Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking.  I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.<br/><br/>For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away.  And Denzel... was truly a surprise.  I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino.  The 'best actor' Oscar was deserved, imho.<br/><br/>9/10 (one point off for a weak ending)."

But is he a little dirty or very dirty ? Maybe he is only doing what is needed in a society gone bad ? Training Day has a brutal and serious atmosphere. The dialogue and acting is good, the pacing is rather high and there is some good violence and very threatening and suspenseful situations. U.S.A. sure seems to have some really dangerous neighbourhoods. Training Day is certainly better than most Hollywood cop movies. I also want to recommend 15 Minutes and The Negotiator. Rating: 9/10"

2) There are definitely some moments of prolonged tension
3) Denzel's erratic character does a good job of keeping you on edge; although it was a bit too reminiscent of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for me
4) It is rare for a film in this genre to feature so much character moments and dialogue rather than just being mindless action; the film should be commended for that<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>1) The film is so unrealistic and the two leads are so outlandish that at no point do they actually feel like cops; they're more like mob enforcers
2) It completely took me out of the film that Still D.R.E. plays in the film and then Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg actually appear
3) It rubs me up the wrong way that the Oscars deemed Denzel to be the lead actor and Hawke to be the supporting actor
4) It is definitely too long and there are multiple scenes that could be taken out and wouldn't change the story one bit

"rhefner2002","6","1","3","5 October 2019"," Keeps us interested, but the ending is silly
","Washington is phenomenal as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris. For the first half of the film, he keeps us wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy, in spite of his unorthodox methods. He's actually seems like both. Sometimes he's charming; other times, he's outright despicable. It take a skillful actor to pull off a role like this.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, Harris' white rookie partner on his first day as a narcotics cop, is convincing as he wrestles with his concepts of right and wrong--enforcing the law or stooping to the level of the criminals he's dealing with. Alonzo puts him through his paces, big time.<br/><br/>The second half of the film goes into dissipation. As Alonzo's actions become increasingly over the top and corrupt, Hoyt, finds himself descending into is own kind of vigilantism. In the ending of the film, his decision to ""do the right thing"" is not only misguided, but it causes Alonzo's demise. Ironic.<br/><br/>All through the film, I kept wondering how these two cowboys got away with all this stuff without any other cops or their superior officers knowing about it. Pretty hard to swallow. There's one brief scene with Alonzo having lunch with some high ranking police officials who are clearly indifferent to the law, but it's not enough to answer the question of why the two cops are completely unsupervised.<br/><br/>The film is fast moving and captivating and will keep you watching, but the final scenes descend into a typical violent Hollywood shootout that rivals Bonnie and Clyde. This movie could have had a better ending. It just ""drops dead,"" if you'll pardon the expression. And it doesn't answer the moral question that it raised in the first place. If the middle had been cut shorter, there could have been a better resolution at the end. What became of Hoyt? What about the investigation of the shootout? We get nothing but death and final credits.<br/><br/>Still, it's worth a watch for two good performances, excellent camera work, and the questions it raises about police ethics (or lack of them)."

","Training Day starts off great, but by the end, it's ultimately just a very average film. The last act in particular drags down the film even more. Washington commands the screen and blurts out his dialogue in the best possible way, but as good as he is he cannot elevate what is simply a weak script. This material doesn't deserve him. Hawke is also pretty good, but here's the thing. No, I don't really smile at knowing he got a nomination for the Oscar because he was in no way a supporting actor. I'm sure everyone in the Academy knew this, but because Washington is so good and in fear of vote splitting, they carelessly voted for Hawke in supporting actor, robbing a true supporting actor that year a slot. I'm sure they knew it, but once again it shows just how political the Academy can be. This film is ultimately only worth a look for the two leads, but even then I can't recommend it much."

To give 1 to a movie it means you didn't find anything good in it. Really, there is nothing which is good in this movie? The acting, the costumes, the haircuts, the soundtrack, the storyline ,..., none of this? The problem with this ratings on IMDb is that anyone can vote. Almost all the movies have one star ratings and also ten star ratings. I don't get why some people, only vote to give a bad rating to movie which is good. If you don't like a certain genre of movies you shouldn't watch them. Some time ago I only liked comedies and I didn't bother watching other type of movies, but since I grow up I understood that every movie genre has at least a one good movie. There are good dramas, horrors, comedies, action movies, science fiction movies and so on. So when I rate a movie, I don't let the genre of the movie affect my judgement. For example I'm not really interested in science fiction movies, but there are SF movies which I rated with ten stars because they deserved it. So, in my opinion people shouldn't let the bias affect their judgement when they rate a movie. Training day is a great movie and nothing will change this fact.

Nevertheless, a lot of people criticize the plot while underlining that ''Training Day'' is not too great a movie to deserve any other acknowledgment. From my point of view, those statements are false because especially Washington's and Hawke's performances make this movie worth watching, plus, the plot much more interesting. Additionally, director Fuqua did a superb job, which is characterized by a magnificent authenticity in the presentation of Los Angeles' suburban areas. Again, I recommend this movie heavily, if you love gangster movies, then you cannot afford to miss this one. Generally, Alonzo Harris' quotes are legendary: ''To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.'' - ''This s***'s chess, it ain't checkers''."

","This movie is not Donnie Brasco. It is isn't based upon truth. It is more in the spirit of Bad Lieutenant. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, insane cop. If you overlook the implausibility of this movie, it is still quite entertaining. The acting is great. Washington definitely captures a really insane character. Although his portrayal is fictitious, there is a grain of truth. It must be very difficult being a narc in 21st Century L.A. However, even as over-the-top as Washington's portrayal, you realize that a cop could be more dangerous than a criminal, if ""under the radar"". Ethan Hawke is also great as a very good cop, but a little naive. Hawke's character is manipulated and charmed into submission by the Washington's ""evil cop"". The ending of the movie was the best part. Despite having a certain fear of the evil cop's authority, in the end you find out that he was really despised. Hawke's good cop is actually saved in one scene by an earlier act of decency on his part. The evil cop eventually is destroyed and revealed as a power-hungry, sick individual that he truly is. In conclusion, don't expect believability. However, if you want to be entertained, this is a movie to see."

Hoyt is an uncomfortable, twitchy man when he meets Alonzo and Alonzo is just as uncomfortable when he meets the Wise Men. Their characters change so well it makes me feel great knowing they actually bothered to earn the awards they got.

","(Spoiler Alert in below review)<br/><br/>""Training Day"" desperately tries to achieve ""street cred"" and just winds up overshooting its target. <br/><br/>This movie would have been much more effective (and realistic) if it'd gone for a more low-key approach. The problem with today's Hollywood is that the first rule of movie-making is always MORE, MORE, MORE. <br/><br/>But the subtle, low-key approach has its advantages. It would have given this movie the street credibility that it so desperately tries to achieve. <br/><br/>Yes, there are rogue, out-of-control cops in America in real-life. It'd be nice if we could get a half-way realistic film about this problem. <br/><br/>But instead, we get this loud, over-the-top, ham-fisted movie that won't have any more real-world impact than the latest superhero/comic book movie. <br/><br/>A more subtle, low-key movie could maybe have shed a little light on the rogue cop phenomenon (and perhaps even let us relate to the rogue cops on some level and understand what drives them to act the way they do). In fact, it appears that this movie makes at least a half- hearted effort to achieve just that. But it fails. <br/><br/>Maybe some people in the audience related to why the Denzel character acted the way he did. But I thought he was just a one- dimensional jerk who was abusing the badge.<br/><br/>A lot of his dialogue was presented as being a lot more profound than it really was. Actually, a lot of it (along with his actions) didn't make a lot of sense (spoiler alert) starting with the premise of bringing a new guy along on a day of outrageous antics that would have shocked the most jaded, crooked veteran rogue cop.<br/><br/>This movie not only fails as a work of art, it is an insult to real- life police officers."
"christophe92300","5","1","4","21 October 2012"," Mixed feelings
","I have mixed feelings about ""Training Day"".<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, dynamic, basically spot on, as are the actors though one could be annoyed by Washington's performance but I guess this has to do with his character.<br/><br/>To me, the real problem is the script. It is dynamic, unfolds pretty smoothly, no overlong passages, but everything is predictable, and there are two big plot holes that completely annihilate the premises of the movie (read the board and you will understand what I am talking about).<br/><br/>Overall, Training Day feels pretty entertaining but you probably watched this type of movie a hundred times, nothing new here, and the plot holes mess up badly the credibility of this film."

","this movie is brilliant from start to finish with amazing acting and story.Denzel Washington was brilliant throughout with Ethan hawk eye loved the story as well defiantly a must see the story is about a rookie cop who moves to la to stop crime with a veteran cop to stop crime to get her and the veteran cop is giving him a training day to see how good he can really be for a rookie cop its like an hour or 2 hours long I'm not sure but this is probably one of the best films i have ever seen in my whole life its £3 at blockbuster in Kilmarnock i suggest u should go get it some time its a brilliant crime drama and thriller also the story's good acting amazing and scenes are good 10/10 defiantly go buy this"
"byungkeepark","9","1","4","27 November 2008"," Meaninglessness of Life
","In ""Training Days,"" I see life is meaningless and meaningless. What does Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) ""gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun"" (Ecclesiastes 1:3)? In the movie, I see everything is meaningless. Harris was chasing after the wind (1:14). Harris thought that he was the wise man and he must die. And he is forgotten too quickly. Life is like that. But in the Infinite, we find meaning and enjoyment in life. We are simply satisfied when we eat and drink. That's the gift of God. (3:13) Harris was wise in a sense, but he is foolish in God's eyes. Harris didn't seem to enjoy his work, and he looked sad all the time, even when he did smile. Solomon said, ""There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work"" (3:22). Who is like the wise man? I think Hoyt was the wise man. His wisdom ""brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance"" (8:1). His wise work saved himself. His saving work of Smiley's cousin changed the hardened heart of a Latino gangster. Hoyt was the one who really enjoyed his work as a policeman."
"thepods","6","1","4","22 June 2007"," A gripping yet shallow thriller
","I enjoyed Training Day on a few levels, first off, Denzel Washington is superb as Alonzo and the tough, gritty action sequences make this a very realistic and violent thriller, however apart from Washington's change from the good guy he usually portrays to a corrupt and vicious narcotics officer, I felt the film had no real clear story.<br/><br/>There is a story somewhere, a rookie cop on the force to fight the bad guys only to get a wake up call that it's not like that is an interesting idea for a crime film but the movie gets lost in its constant attempts at carrying many different moral themes. In the end this is a good versus evil action movie disguised by a career best performance from Washington and being marketed as a fast paced crime thriller, and if it had presented itself as what it really was I would have like it more.<br/><br/>Verdict: The cast do a great job, but it could have been a far greater film had it been directed by, say Spike Lee or Quinten Tarantino."
"classicsoncall","8","1","4","29 April 2006"," ""Let's suit up ladies, time to punch in.""
","I can usually fill a full page of notes regarding my thoughts on a film as I'm watching it, but this time I came away with only about a half dozen character quotes that sounded cool at the time. Looking them over now however, makes them seem cliché ridden, offered in an attempt to manipulate the viewer. That 'smiles and cries' explanation offered by Ethan Hawkes character was an eyebrow raiser, and how about it 'taking a wolf to catch a wolf'. The topper though was Denzel Washington's tattoo - ""Death is Certain, Life is Not"". That one prefaced the ending, since Washington's Alonzo wasn't a bad cop in a 'Die Hard' yipee-ki-yay sort of way, he was just a bad rogue cop.<br/><br/>Let's face it, if ""Training Day"" represents a rookie's first day in narcotics, then the bad guys have won. Alternating hits of PCP, beer, and who knows what else, it's pretty amazing Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) even made it through that day. That's not including guns to the head, rifle blasts through the 'office' car, introduction to a Latino bathtub and falls from high rise apartment buildings after being beaten to a pulp. Even with steely resolve and a strong constitution, there's got to be a better way to make a living.<br/><br/>Story semantics and odds defying coincidences aside, Washington and Hawke turn in strong performances as cops on opposite sides of the moral fence. It's not enough though to tone down the way over the top situations and confrontations the pair find themselves in and out of, all without a moment's rest. Try this while watching - take a deep breath."
"njw66","4","1","4","7 April 2006"," Disappointing Story Line
","While Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington each turn in remarkable performances, the story itself disappoints. I found the film overly violent for my taste. (I realize that I am in the minority in that regard. It seems that most movie-goers want the maximum amount of violence packed into their films and Hollywood has complied.) The film is successful in creating an atmosphere of impending danger and edginess. The script is good and the film is well shot. The story itself disappoints. The actions of Denzel's character in the second half of the film seemed out of character compared to the character in the first half of the film. While it provides for an unexpected twist in the plot, I found it unsatisfying. The overall effect of the film was very scary and very disturbing."
"chuchog","9","2","13","13 December 2005"," A magnificent depiction of a shady world
","The magic of the movies is that they allow us to see worlds and experience emotions that are sometimes distant from our own and our immediate environment. Antoine Fuqua in Training day brings to us a world of gangs, drugs and corruption that is alien to must of us, but which nevertheless exists, sometimes transcending its own borders and coming to us in the form of news (The rampart scandal) and no matter if we close our eyes and ignore it, it will not go away. In that world we have two police officers, officer Hoyt, a rookie just assigned to an elite anti narcotics unit, and officer Alonzo, a veteran of the force, commanding the unit. Each one of those officers has his own set of values and morality, but no one is completely good or completely evil as absolute evil or absolute good are inexistent (in humans at least), ultimately they just want to take care of their own problems. Hoyt wants to take care of his family, his young wife, his new born child, he wants to escalate positions (don't we all) in the force and this new assignment may be the perfect place to start and he will do anything to nail it. Officer Alonzo has a more complicated set of problems, he has to get a million dollars and he has to do it today; otherwise he will be killed by the Russian mafia, but he has a plan and the plan involves Hoyt (a virgin shooter above suspicion) and Roger (a drug dealer with a lot of money in his kitchen floor). Basically the movie unfolds as Alonzo's plan goes into motion showing us glimpses of a corrupt and disturbing world, a world with its own rules and twisted morality, Smiley forgiving Hoyt's life as a return for having protected his cousin's honor, gang members shooting indiscriminately to protect the sandman's property, Stan and his friends giving Alonzo carte blanch to basically kill Roger and steal his money so he can save himself, etc. Denzel Washington work was impeccable; a well deserved Oscar, showing us a man who has moved the line a little bit each time to the point that he doesn't know where he is now, a man who has moved to the edge in a desperate attempt to save his life. Is he really that bad? After all he is a father, a husband, a friend appreciated by his team (if you think you can get away with it, we are with you) and colleagues. Maybe we just caught him in a bad day...a training day. If we want to make a better society for every one, we have to know what are the obstacles we have to overcome, training day show us some of those obstacles and then some."
"dic_r","10","2","13","10 January 2005"," ""Training Day:"" The Film Is A Powerhouse!
","Denzel Washington's best acting performance since....""Glory."" No haahahhaha! I was just kidding! You thought that I was going to fall into that Oscar trap, huh? No, really, ""Glory"" was an excellent film, but between the time span of ""Glory"" (1989) and ""Training Day,"" (2001) twelve years if my mathematics are not failing me, Washington has done other top-notch films, namely ""Devil In A Blue Dress,"" (1994) ""He Got Game,"" (1998) ""The Siege,"" (also 1998) and ""The Hurricane"" (1999). This film just happens to have Washington as a completely wicked cop. To me, this film contained one of Denzel Washington's top-notch performances as villain F.E.S. Detective-Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Washington is completely wicked as he double-crosses everybody he knows to get the job done and then some. He holds nothing back. This film has heart, emotion, and adrenaline. It has something, a majestic quality, that Tony Scott's mean, tough ""Man on Fire"" (2004) tried to capture, but not quite as successfully. An incredible Oscar-nominated performance also for Ethan Hawke, who unfortunately lost to Jim Broadbent in ""Iris"" (2001). Probably most people Antoine Fuqua's best film to date, edging out ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) and ""King Arthur"" (2004). The storytelling never felt stiff in the joints and just moved freely pretty much the whole way through. By the way, was that Eva Mendez as Washington's wife in the film? JUST KIDDING! I knew that! The whole world would know that by now!"
"Angry_Arguer","Null","2","13","7 March 2004"," Daily Routine
","This is a tired genre and the method of storytelling here (character dominated) runs from an even drier well of inspiration.<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>On the surface, you could call this a fusion of 'French Connection', 'Se7en', and any third cop movie you'd like, but there's no need for that. True, Fuqua and Fincher stemmed from the music video world, but that's where the similarities end.  Fuqua's method is more Michael Bay and John Singleton.  Fincher has promise because he knows where to channel that energy.  Oh, well, at least Spike Lee is showing change...<br/><br/>Hawke does his 'Dead Poets' bit all over again playing a rookie--how ironic. What's really shocking here is the emphasis on Denzel.  He and Tom Hanks have so much in common that I'm not surprised that they were in 'Philadelphia' together.  Both rely on taking self-assured ""mr. right"" roles.  Both have lately tried to be ""mr. deep"", making some noble failures. 'Glory' marked a time when Denzel really tried.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this takes too many cues from the last 20 years of cop shows and two Cameron movies ('Strange Days', 'Point Break') to be anything interesting.  Rather than throwing us another ""bad cop"" cliche, Fuqua should have made false leads and layered backstories to make us think more often.<br/><br/>Then again, what do we expect from the director of 'Replacement Killers' when he's working with the writer of 'Fast and Furious'?<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"
"Ethel the Frog","Null","2","13","6 January 2004"," More training needed...
","I found this film a let-down from the beginning. I find it strange that Denzel Washington should have won an oscar for what is basically a one-dimensional character anyone could have played in their sleep. I found him very annoying throughout the movie, (which is partly the idea, I am aware) but when a character becomes so tiresome that you're tempted to switch off, you know that the filmmakers are in trouble. As for Hawk, he is given woefully little material to work with but in fact ends up giving a more impressive performance than Washington - I think he presented his own spiral into the seedy underworld or corrupt cops and his subsequent disillusionment very well (even if the goatee was a mistake...) On the plus side, I would say that the film's final act is genuinely gripping despite frequent lapses into mindless ""beat-em-up"" mode. It is, however, hopelessly macho in almost all respects and inexplicable cameos by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray reveal that this is a film about surface not substance. I can't see much in it to raise it above any other simple action ""good cop, bad cop"" fare."

","TRAINING DAY is a gritty, well directed, and (very) well acted look at the mean streets of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington (in his Oscar-winning performance) gives one of the finest performances of the year as corrupt narcotics detective, Alonzo Harris. Washington's performance is free, charismatic, scary, and loose. Also (unlike Russell Crowe in A BEAUTIFUL MIND), Washington never breaks character. His interpretation of a very evil man is flawless.He practically pops with theatrical sizzle.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is just as good as naive rookie, Jake Hoyt. Throughout the film, we can actually see Hoyt come into his own and become a leader (as opposed to a beginner). In my opinion, Hawke should have also won the Oscar.<br/><br/>

"mattymatt4ever","7","2","13","8 October 2001"," Overlong and uneven, but very well-acted and often engaging
","At times, ""Training Day"" seems like a photographed play.  Most of the scenes during the first and second acts take place within the confines of a patrol car, with Denzel and Hawke having their foul-mouthed interactions.  To be honest, I felt some of those scenes could've been trimmed or cut and didn't seem necessary.  The overuse of dialogue scenes dragged down the pace a little.  So you can say, the film could've used more time in the editing room.  <br/><br/>The performances are stellar.  Denzel is one of my favorite actors, and it was nice to watch him play a character much different from the upperclassmen he usually plays.  This time around, he's an uninhibited, foul-mouthed, sadistic, no-nonsense narcotics cop.  Like always, I was impressed by Denzel, but I was even more impressed by his co-star Ethan Hawke. Technically, the film focuses on him, but since Denzel is a much bigger star--he has to get first billing.  Sorry, Ethan.  Hawke, though a fine actor, usually gets the role of the pretty-boy love interest.  This is a much, much different role for him.  He plays a quiet, well-intentioned married man who gets called in for training (as a narc) by Denzel.  The two guys couldn't be any more different, like all buddy cop movies.  But unlike most buddy cop movies, this is much darker.  There's humor here and there, but dark humor.  None of that Riggs-Murtaugh chemistry we got used to in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies.  I have to admire Antoine Fuqua for not making the usual casting choices.  Another example of his original casting is Scott Glenn's role as a burned-out dealer, who Denzel befriends.  Of course, since Fuqua has a history directing music videos, we have supporting roles with such artists as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray.  Not the greatest actors, but they didn't have enough screen time to ruin the film. <br/><br/>
The climax is adverse to the film's harsh, realistic tone.  We're basically given the Hollywood treatment.  We have the usual dueling between the antagonist and protagonist, in which they beat each other to a bloody pulp. One of them gets away, the other returns--as a bloody mess--and they fight again.  I don't want to give away the ending, though there's no big surprises, but if an alleged tough guy is in the middle of a ghetto, gangbangers and dealers surrounding and outnumbering him, and starts telling them off--it don't matter if you're a policeman or not; those guys would blow you away in the drop of a hat.  That's when Denzel makes his ""King Kong ain't got s**t on me!"" speech, in which you're sitting in the theater trying to stop yourself from laughing.  And you know damn well those gangbangers and dealers would've laughed at him too--before he's brutally killed.  It's noticeable that the writer of this film tried to be realistic by injecting tons of street slang into the script, but some of the slang sounded more laughable (unintentionally) and preposterous than realistic.  Believe me, I live in an environment where I hear more street slang than I need to hear. I know the difference between real and fake slang.  <br/><br/>""Training Day"" is an overlong film that gets boring at times, but I found it mostly engaging.  The performances alone are worth watching.  By the way, that hot mamacita Eva Mendes plays Denzel's wife in the film.  And she has a brief nude scene.  Oh, man!  Is she hottt!<br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","A `bad cop' movie where the saving grace is a couple of excellent performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Otherwise entertaining enough but utterly unremarkable. The plot, a rookie who discovers his boss is not all he seems to be, is too well worn unless given a new handle. Having said that, it's got plenty of action and certianly not a flop."

","I went into this film relatively cold and was really enticed to go and see Denzil Washington playing against type. What I was treated to was a very good film.<br/><br/>It wouldn't surprise me if Washington was nominated for an Oscar in his role here as Olonzo, a Narcotics cop who is just a little bent. What? A bent cop? Surely not! Oh yes. There are loads of them in this film, and Olonzo is the most cunning, ruthless and fast talking one to be had!<br/><br/>The film's events all take place on Jake's (Ethan Hawke) training day. He wants to be on the aforementioned Narcotics team. He is very naive though, Olonzo shows him what it's really like to be on the streets etc. and things get a little bit dodgy to say the least.<br/><br/>Good plot structure and two very confident performance's - especially Washington, he is ELECTRIC on screen - make this a great thriller to watch. Hawke puts in a great performance (not a big fan of him, but this film might just make me see his other films!). The film also boasts some nice performances from Dr Dre, Macy Gray, and Scott Glenn too.<br/><br/>So, go and watch this film, and be treated to something that although does follow the rule book as far as thriller's go, but also bends the rules to achieve a nice twist to the story.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","I loved Denzel's character in this movie at first.  It wasn't until near the end that he started to become tiresome.  This movie just adds to the huge resume of Denzel that shows his versatility to play so many different characters.  It is unbelievable that he is the same guy who played in The Hurricane and Remember the Titans.  This guy can act, and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke did an excellent job as well, but Denzel is who made this movie so good.  Together though, they were superb!<br/><br/>My only gripe about this movie is that everything happens in one day. Jake (Hawke) meets with Alonzo (Washington) one morning on a ""training day"" to see if Jake is cut out to handle his new job as an undercover narcotics officer.  Jake has a laid back, shy and almost sheltered personality while Alonzo is completely over the top and in your face.  The things that happen in this one day are things that probably wouldn't happen in an entire career for most people.  However it is Hollywood, so what do ya expect?<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie.  There were many scenes which made you laugh, others which made you say wow, and then there were the ones which made you say ""yea right"".  However, even my girlfriend (who was expecting it to totally bomb) said she enjoyed it.<br/><br/>For a cop movie, it is very original and realistic in that it takes place right in L.A., no fabricated neighborhoods were used here.  However, it does start to stray from the realistic aspect as the movie draws on, which is why I only gave it a 9 out of 10.  But if you can get by that, then you'll really like this movie."

Yes, Denzel was at his usual best but Ethan Hawke stole the show in my book.  Considering his previous movies where he played characters who would have been better portrayed sleeping than speaking (Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, movies I didn't want to see in the first place), Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job as the moral guy.  I have a greater respect for him now.  And let's not forget Denzel.  I'm surprised he doesn't have half a dozen Oscars.  But what does the Academy know anyway? If they know anything (which they don't) Training Day will be nominated for Best Picture, ActorS (plural, for both Denzel and Ethan, who should at least get a supporting actor nom), screenplay, and director.

","November 12, 2001 was the day I saw the intensity-filled `Training Day'. Here is how my `Training Day' went:<br/><br/>3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.<br/><br/>4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained. <br/><br/>4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone. <br/><br/>5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row. <br/><br/>5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.<br/><br/>6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.<br/><br/>7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film.  <br/><br/>8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended!

"Dark Hellion","9","2","13","20 November 2001"," A Day you'll never forget
","A friend of mine and I have been waiting a very long time to see Denzel Washington in a role where his talent really shines. The best movie I've seen him in to date is Fallen, although I haven't seen Malcolm X, so can't comment on that. For me, the difference between Fallen and most of Denzel's other roles is an edge, a sharpness, a *reality* that just doesn't appear in movies like The Hurricane or Remember the Titans. To put it as my friend does, we wanted to see Denzel play a character that would 'kick puppies and step on kittens' for a change. <br/><br/>This movie takes what he brought to Fallen and puts it on steroids.<br/><br/>
Washington is Alonzo Harris, a corrupt cop. A man who believes he's part of the big time but, in reality, he's just a small-time criminal hiding behind his LAPD badge. As a member of a covert narcotics squad, he gets to cruise the streets of LA looking for his next big bust. He may have originally been a fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak and a notion that justice involved returning the streets to the community, but his thirteen-year tour of duty in the narc unit have left him jaded, disillusioned, and willing to do whatever it takes. <br/><br/>Throw young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) into the mix. Hoyt is that self-same fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak, a young wife, and a nine-month-old daughter. He's looking to make detective, and wants nothing more than to be able to provide for his family and take down the questionable elements of society that run rampant in downtown LA. Alonzo, however, has totally different ideas about Jake's future.<br/><br/>
Alonzo seems to have surrounded himself with a plethora of fools, and it's implied during the film that he's done it so that he can keep control. Because as long as Alonzo has control of the men in his unit, has control of the streets--which he rules with an iron fist--he has control of his life. As he gets to know Jake, however, he can see that there's something different about him...that he's not going to be just another follower. Jake has one single day to prove to Alonzo that he can cut it as a narc. Failure means he goes back to 'cutting traffic tickets' and maybe never gets his coveted job as detective. <br/><br/>MINI-SPOILER <br/><br/>However, an incident in Las Vegas with some nebulously defined and never-seen Russians suddenly has Alonzo in over his head. He has to provide a million dollars by midnight or his life is forfeit. His upper-echelon contacts (the semi-satirical 'Wise Men') are worried that he's not going to be able to find the money, and then they'll lose their man on the street, the guy who can be relied upon to get things done when the system can't. But Alonzo has a plan, and that plan centres around Jake. <br/><br/>END MINI-SPOILER<br/><br/>Washington turns in an incredibly driven and fiercely charismatic performance as Alonzo. Hawke, as his counterpoint, plays his role in a perfectly understated fashion, which only adds to Washington's impact in the film. Washington's character *needs* to be compared to a bland background, just so you can appreciate exactly what it is that's going on.<br/><br/>
But when the film comes to its resolution, we're still left with the question unanswered. Which view is the right one? Does Jake's initial idealism have a place in the warzone--the drug-fuelled hotbed of intolerance and violence that is 'the office' for these covert narcs? Or is Alonzo's brutal and almost fanatical version of justice the only way to catch--and kill--the wolves prowling around the edges of the flock?<br/><br/>
It's also refreshing to see a movie on this subject-matter that doesn't have a 'message'. Training Day simply explores the issues and puts them on the table, and whilst some people may believe it falls down on one side more than the other, I prefer to see it as giving the audience the option to make their own decision. <br/><br/>The real stinger though, is that despite his unorthodox methods, his disregard for due process, and his uncompromising, severe attitude, Alonzo shares the same ideals as Jake. Both of them want to eliminate the scum of the streets. However, whereas Jake wants to create his perfect Aryan-esque world where it's safe for a fourteen-year-old to walk through the worst parts of town in the dead of night, Alonzo is much more interested in landing the biggest of fish--whatever the cost. <br/><br/>Pros: Superb acting from Washington and a fine counterpoint by Hawke. A fast-paced character- and event-driven drama that assaults the senses and leaves you reeling from its mental impact. <br/><br/>Cons: The last ten/fifteen minutes or so may leave some unsatisfied.<br/><br/>
Likely Oscar nominations: Well, I'm going to forego my usual comical comment here. Seriously, Denzel should get _something_ for his performance in this movie. It's just a pity this is the sort of movie the Academy usually overlooks. <br/><br/>Verdict: A tour-de-force led by Washington that proves that violence and intelligence don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive in a modern movie. Go see if if you liked Fallen, or want to see what Denzel can really do when he turns on the afterburner. Plus the ins and outs of this movie can easily lead to lengthy discussions over coffee afterwards.<br/><br/>

"bob the moo","Null","3","25","24 May 2004"," A pretty standard cop thriller is livened up by a good (if not Oscar-worthy) performance from Washington
","After making his application to join a special unit within the LAPD, Officer Jake Hoyt is assigned to his new boss, Alonzo Harris for a training day on the job. Harris immediately shows Hoyt a way of work that is foreign to him  making him smoke drugs and drink at the very start of his shift. From this point onwards, Hoyt is taken on an eye opening training day that forces him to depart from his professional ethics and try to understand how things are done on the street. But is Harris really working for justice his own way or is he working for himself  and how far will Hoyt sink before he cannot justify it anymore?<br/><br/>When this film came out I wanted to see it as a thriller; after the Oscar for Washington I wanted to see it for another reason and eventually got round to seeing it on video. The plot starts on familiar territory and pretty much continues along the same road for the whole film  it is never really more than an average cop thriller but it still manages to be quite enjoyable. The film sticks to the 'ends justify the means' plot device for the first half but then pull back to reveal a wider plot that is more of a standard thriller. In the first half this is all stuff we have seen before and it sort of works but not as well as things like The Shield etc  Alonzo is too out there to manage to make me be for him and against him; unlike the Shield where you are constantly being challenged by Mackey. The second half is more dramatic and, although a bit forced, is necessary to bring the film round to a dramatic conclusion.<br/><br/>The Oscar for Denzel was not deserved in my opinion. Having now seen his performance I will acknowledge that he is a big part of this film working but he is not Oscar worthy here. Actually his performance is just par for the course for this type of film  yes he is a bit of a powerhouse and his tough delivery really makes the film move but it is hardly worthy of being called the best performance of the year even if it is really effective within the context of the film. Hawke is pretty good but obviously plays second fiddle to Washington's scene stealing performance; he is wide eyed as required and he serves well as our entry into Alonzo's world. The support cast features quite a few well known faces but mostly they are underused and play slightly worn ethnic clichés full of tattoos and 'mo-fo' dialogue  Macy Gray, Dre and Snoop represent the rap community while Mendes shows ass and Glenn, Yulin, Barry and Greene add recognisable faces if nothing else.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable but standard cop thriller that has gotten better reviews than it perhaps deserves. Although he doesn't not deserve his Oscar for this, Washington's performance still drives the film and is fun nonetheless and certainly livens up what is, for all it's stars and it's publicity, is still a standard cop thriller with bells on."

I also thought Snoop Dogg's performance woz funny but too short, i wasn't keen on Dre's performance. I thought Eva Mendes' look and presence was sexy and lingering.

","A seasoned narcotics officer takes a rookie out for one day of on the job training to determine if he's worthy of joining the elite undercover department. Is LA really this big of a mess? This movie makes Capone's Chicago look like Bedford Falls. But don't believe it. Thanks to your friendly neighborhood Liberal Thought Police media correspondent, a big city cop can't so much as clean his gun without being brought up on misconduct or excessive force charges. So the idea of Los Angeles being a modern day Dodge City with the cops shooting and beating up the street scum is about as far from reality as a Bill Clinton testimony. This is one of those films that is at times so over the top brilliant, and at others so patheticaly stupid, that you wonder if it wasnt a splicing of efforts by 2 different directors. But its all one guys work, and sadly the stupidity leaves a stronger aftertaste than the quality. Whats good is the entire first hour and Denzel's and Hawke's work throughout. Whats bad is the typical, utterly unoriginal and predictable ending. How can one movie go from so fresh to so moldy stale within the short span of two movie hours?

Hawke is an idealistic rookie narcotics officer who's just been assigned to a new unit; Washington is his twisted, maniacal senior officer out to give him an up close and personal look at the gritty L.A. streets. The young officer's morale is put to the test as he's given an in-depth look at both sides of the law, and forced to make a choice as he's plunged into the cruel world of police brutality. Washington is intensely believable and charismatically over-the-top as a seasoned veteran who doesn't play by the rules, and Hawke stands tall as his inexperienced but steadfast subordinate. Mostly good writing and direction falter at the climax—and require a certain suspension of disbelief—but overall the movie packs a powerful punch. ***"

","Training Day is a very well-done film.  I watched a screening copy of it at my apartment in Hollywood then had to walk down the sidewalk for some errands... that's when I realized the hard-hitting nature and true to life perfection of this picture in its portrayal of the LA streets.<br/><br/>
I laugh at the handful of negative comments questioning the quality of writing and/or directing.  Just on the surface (for all those non-film school kids out there), there is a scene where Alonzo and Jake are sitting in a Stan's (?) house when Stan remembers Jake being a great safety in high school.  Everyone who knows football knows that a safety is the lack resort to stopping a quarterback who gets loose.  Later Alonzo makes a comment comparing himself to a quarterback.  Nice writing.  Then there is the scene where Alonzo meets with the heads of the police who are portrayed like Mafia Dons.  It is lit very much like the Godfather with the single (low) light source and a yellow, almost Sepia, filter.  Beautiful directing.<br/><br/>Acting?  Coach Boone to Alonzo.  I think that about sums it up.  He does an amazing job and puts you on edge, not only with the lines, but his intensity in his eyes.  That's something that cannot be directed or written.  Ethan Hawke, very subtle but very effective.  Again, his delivery makes the lines jump off the page and turn them into anguish and fear that words just don't capture.<br/><br/>As far as just the overall presentation, no, it does not drag.  It's supposed to be scary/real, not over the top unbelievable like Warner Brothers has a bad habit of doing.  It makes you think of what actually could happen, what could go on if it is allowed.<br/><br/>Great effort people, keep these types of movies coming.  8/10"

Released right after September 11 (it's release even got delayed because of the latter), the movie stars Denzel Washington as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris, teaming up with rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). As this is a movie about the gritty world of crime, I shouldn't have to identify that it's pretty violent. By the time that the movie had gotten released, movies had been showing violence for over thirty years. But if in fact we did become more violent, then the movie might have been a look at the future. Movies about corrupt cops are nothing new, but they did an OK job with this one.<br/><br/>As for other aspects, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, making him the first African-American to win Best Actor (Sidney Poitier is actually Bahamian).

His performance is riveting, he's a scumbag yes, but who would want to watch this more than once?  Ethan Hawke's role was the tougher of the 2 leads, I felt, because he had to play a person who is all too rare in Hollywood these days: someone with a strong moral center. We feel all his pain and disgust and finally his anger, and we root for him, even with the cliched script. Hawke deserved his supporting nomination since he truly went thru an emotional gamut from beginning to end. Denzel pretty much stayed the same: remaining a scurvy villain in every scene, even if, one is apt to say, his job created his behavior as much as his own greed did. Feeling powerless to change society, he in turn becomes just as warped and destroyed as the people he's trying to put away. Too bad the screenplay takes the issue of powerlessness and turns it into an action picture. This could have been real compelling with a more careful writer. Instead we get Denzel as evil cartoon and an Oscar to show much Hollywood loves evil cartoons. Harvey Kietel excelled with more complexity in the Bad Lieutenant some years before in the 90's, with complicated religious overtones thrown into the mix to make a riveting but overlooked  film experience that was hardly given a chance at the box office. See that for a more realistic look at corruption and authority and view Training Day one time to debate why Denzel has the gold statue and Kietel does not."
"jboothmillard","7","2","24","13 June 2007"," Training Day
","I think the main reason I wanted to see this film was because of a great star winning the Oscar, and then I heard that the villain he plays is a cop. Basically Jake Hoyt (Oscar nominated Ethan Hawke) wants to become a professional LAPD narcotics cop, i.e. stop drug trafficking, and he is teamed up with veteran, swaggering and streetwise narcotics cop Alonzo Harris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) for 24 hours to learn and prove his mettle. But as they are searching and investigating the big drug case, along the way they clear the streets of other (possibly drug related) crimes, and Jake is finding it very difficult to cope with Alonzo's questionable and very rough techniques, particularly when the guilty should go to prison. As the film continues, you see what a genuine scum Alonzo really is, and why he does not deserve to be a cop, and he and Jake do eventually turn on each other in the concluding scenes. Alonzo does meet an unexpected death, being killed by thugs (most likely the ones he insulted). It is a dark, pretty engaging and very stylised look at American law enforcement. Also starring Scott Glenn as Roger, Tom Berenger as Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin as Doug Rosselli, Raymond J. Barry as Lou Jacobs, Cliff Curtis as Smiley, and hip hop stars Dr. Dre as Paul, Snoop Dogg as Blue and Macy Gray as Sandman's Wife. Denzel Washington was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Alonzo Harris was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!"

","Let me start by agreeing with those that hail Denzel Washington's performance as exceptional. Twisted and corrupt, at the end of the movie you can't help but hate this guy (a very foreign feeling to  attribute to one of Denzel's characters).<br/><br/>When I walked out of the theatre after seeing A Beautiful Mind, I was convinced that Crowe should take the Best Actor Oscar, though I reserved judgement until seeing Training Day. And my opinion now...I stand by my original assessment. Washington's character shows a ferocity and intensity of a man who long ago put to death any moral/ethical dilemma of how he enacts justice. There is no internal conflict here, and as such, the character, though being complex, is somewhat one-dimensional. He is what he is, a corrupt cop who has convinced himself and others that the ends somehow justify the means.<br/><br/>I think Crowe's portrayal of Dr. Nash, from graduate to eventual Nobel Prize recipient, shows the audience the extent of his illness and the inner turmoil he experiences as he pursues healing. You see the character change and develop and it is a remarkable feat that Crowe was able to communicate that so convincingly.<br/><br/>Loved the acting in Training Day, from both Denzel & Ethan Hawke. The second half of the movie seemed a little too convenient for a movie that forces some very key social/political issues."

","Slick, stylistic good cop/bad cop story where Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, 'Gattaca') must prove to Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington, who deservedly earned the Best Actor Oscar for this) that he has what it takes to become a narcotics officer - in a very shady part of town. He's got just one day. Training Day. As the two embark on a 24 hour rollercoaster ride through the rough streets, they will avoid death time and time again; bust, break and take down numerous 'bad guys'; steal money; kill somebody; and stab you in the back... and twist the knife.<br/><br/>The Hawke/Washington pairing is well selected - the unlikely duo share great chemistry and bounce off eachother covincingly (despite half of Denzel's lines being ad-libbed). Their performances are extremely strong, as are 'Collateral Damage' terrorist Cliff Curtis and also recording superstars Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. This movie never drags along at a slow pace - it's fast, furious and ultimately viewer-hooking with a believable storyline, plot and characters. The DVD also features an alternate ending - so for all of you out there who were disappointed at the climax (I'm not one of them) you can take comfort in the extra scenes. An inevitable sequel is probably being planned already - and that's more than O.K. by me!"

"kurt120","Null","1","11","28 May 2002"," An Oscar for Denzel?
","Denzel Washington was finally acclaimed as one of the greatest actors of his generation when he won this year's best male Oscar for Training Day. The question is would he have preferred this to be the role for which he was acknowledged with the greatest of all acting awards? Malcolm X, Glory or Philadelphia are probably the films that the actor himself would have an asterix by as defining roles in his filmography. Yes his performance is great, but the character is one that could have been played equally as well by Laurence Fishburne or Samuel L. Jackson, either of whom have enough suitable menace to be a winner as a narcotics cop gone bad. Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) is playing out of type as the beanie wearing bad narcotics cop who takes Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Unlike the majority of characters Washington plays, Harris has no redeeming roles. It is a day that is supposed to define whether Hoyt will make it as a rookie narc. Instead it defines the young police officer's desire to do the right thing, seeking firm but fair justice for the good of the community. From meeting his new take no prisoners tutor to toking marijuana laced with PCP, drinking on duty, destroying evidence and ignoring petty crime it is a day that tests the faith of the young cop. The ending is a little loose, leaving you to wonder if Hoyt remains true to character as the police officer his high ideals would wish him to be. A strong performance from both major actors keeps this film moving at breakneck pace, maintaining your attention as the sordid tale winds to its breathtaking, gunshot filled conclusion. Also features guest appearances from hip hoppers Dr Dre and Coolio, along with songstress Macy Gray. Weekly recommended rental: LA Confidential (1997). The best tough guy cop film of recent times. Stars Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey. Written by outstanding detective noir writer James Ellroy."

","Interesting moral dilemma.<br/><br/>About the first half way through the movie, the premise was bright.  A moral story.  A rookie who spends a day training with his new boss narcotics agent discovers that the ways that his boss roots out evil aren't exactly godly. This reminded me of Boiler Room, because in both movies the `rookie' is forced to make a decision between the morality he has and what is being presented to him as moral.  I've never seen Denzel Washington use such foul language.  But in the second half, it just fell flat on it's face.   NO SPOILERS, don't worry. - It looked as if Warner Brothers had forced Village Roadshow pictures to slap on the ending that they did because the moral fable just wasn't enough  that W.B. wanted it to appeal to lower brow audience, perhaps.  Maybe that's why there is such unnecessary violence throughout the movie.  In fact, the ending  no spoilers included  stylized as to look dramatic, but really it is just low-brow.  Should've been an independent movie without the financial backing from WB as WB messed it up."

","Denzel Washington took home a well-deserved Oscar for this performance. He seemed to absolutely relish the part of the brutal, corrupt cop. Tremendous job. The movie, however, left some things to be desired. My first thought, early in the movie, when Denzel puts a gun to Ethan Hawke's head to force him to smoke a bowl of PCP-laced grass, would have been to get out of the car, hitch a ride back to my precinct, turn him in, and go back to my previous patrol job. I would not have found that particular experience very acceptable. Just not very believable for me. Well, okay, I was willing to put that aside. Ethan Hawke's character is very ambitious, and he wants to be part of this narcotics unit, so he probably accepts this act as something that may help him in the mean streets ahead. Later, Denzel leaves Hawke vulnerable with a bunch of thugs who decide to kill him. Just as they have him in a bathtub, and a shotgun in his face, ready to pull the trigger, they go through his pockets, and find a pink wallet, which Hawke had picked up earlier in the movie saving a girl about to be raped in an alley. Of course, the wallet belonged to the girl and, wouldn't you know, the girl just happened to be the niece of one of the guys about to kill him. Pretty convenient, huh? Again, not very believable.<br/><br/>A movie about a brutal, corrupt cop training a young rookie just going about the every day work of narcotics officers may have been enough to make this an outstanding movie, but there were far too many odd twists, convenient coincidences, and weird peripheral characters (Russian Mobsters, no less) that made this a rather disappointing movie overall. Nothing can take away from the performance of Washington, though. He nailed his character right down the line. He was frightening, charming, inspiring, repulsive, brutal and charismatic, sometimes all at once. An exceptional acting performance."

","To christen my brand new PlayStation 2, I wanted to see my first ever film on the DVD format and I chose this one. I'm glad I did; Training Day is an outstanding film, even if it's a bit of a no-brainer.<br/><br/>What elevates this one from others is the acting. Denzel Washington, in his Oscar-winning performance, does a superb job playing Det. Alonzo Harris, a corrupt LAPD officer who is given the task of breaking in rookie NARC Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke, who was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar). As Hoyt slowly finds out that his cohort is the shadiest cop in the universe, involved in corrupt dealings with gangs, drug lords, and stealing of dirty money in conjuction with other renegade cops. Hoyt needs to bring him down to save his own bacon. Still, despite the obvious ending to the story, the ride is well worth it because the acting is uniformly excellent. Denzel plays against type, instead of the amiable types of people or rogues, here he plays a cruel, evil, cocky, SOB; but he doesn't overplay it. Hawke plays the good cop beautifully, but fortunately he's not a goody-two-shoes type, as he goes on his rounds with Washington in the inner-city of L.A. (some of the movie was actually filmed in Compton).<br/><br/>A supporting cast with Scott Glenn and hip-hop stars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, and Macy Gray will be of big interest to some. The direction by Antoine Fuqua and writing of David Ayer is first-rate. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, the usual documentary, and other goodies. While the debate of whether Denzel or Russell Crowe deserved to win Best Actor will last for awhile, I have no plans to see A Beautiful Mind, so Denzel deserved to win in my book. Highly recommended."

","I hate first days on a new job.  You're nervous, not exactly sure of what to expect and all too often not sure you made the right decision to take the job in the first place.  Jake Hoyt is having such a day as he starts a new job in the narcotics squad with his new bad-ass boss Alonzo Harris. Detective Harris is loud, bad and mean and knows the streets like he was born and bred in them.  Is he for real? Or is he testing Jake to see if he has the right stuff to make it down these mean streets of L.A., we shall see.wont we?<br/><br/>Training Day, the just released on video movie that I just got around to seeing, is a nightmare first day on the job film.  It's 24 hours in the life of a rookie who figures on making detective if he joins the narcotics squad and rids the streets of drugs and baddies.  Unbeknownst to him, one of the baddest baddies is sitting right next to him, in the form of the devil himself played by now Oscar winner Denzel Washington.  Denzel's Detective Harris is the devil incarnate make no mistake about it.  He is the tempter in the wilderness, the one who will offer you the world if you would just bow down and worship him.just a little.   Okay, just murder for him and he will grant your every wish and devour your soul in the process.  In the next day, Officer Hoyt will not know what to believe and will not believe his own eyes.  The ideal world he envisioned will disintegrate around him and reduce him to an animal just trying to survive.  Detective Beelzebub will show him that the world is a jungle and there is a fine line between good and evil that cops have to occasionally jump to and from in order to survive.  The lessons being dealt are tough and cruel, to the extent that the film goes from unsentimental reality to surrealism.  No one can be this bad, no one can withstand this kind of punishment and fury, can they?<br/><br/>
Being good is so much harder then being bad.  Being deliciously bad is so much fun and Denzel Washington is almost giddy reveling in the flesh of Alonzo Harris.  I could not take my eyes off of him, his line delivery and body language is razor sharp and he is truly one of our most gifted film actors.  Every scene he is in, and he is on camera for 90% of the movie, crackles with electricity, talking street jive and howling like a wolf. Detective Harris is the alpha wolf, the leader of men, the prince of darkness who rules hell because it is preferable to serving in heaven. The film is lifted and sustained by him to heights much higher then the pulp fiction it actually is.  His performance is mesmerizing and deservedly received awards and much praise.<br/><br/>Denzel's partner in Training Day, playing Jake Hoyt, is Ethan Hawke.  His job is much harder, he is the good one, therefore the boring voice in the wilderness expressing his concerns and unsure of what to believe and do through most of his grueling first day on the job.  Being good is hard work, and Mr. Hawke actually does a fine job delivering the goods.  In the past, I've found him too introspective to be exciting on the screen.  Too often he blends into the scenery and becomes good-looking Scandinavian furniture. But surprise, he actually holds his own beside the evil one and delivers a solid, respectable performance.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua's Training day is a fantasy disguised as a gritty tough street film about police corruption.  Is this really going on to this extent, I don't really believe it.  Are there bad cops playing both sides of the fence, sure, but the 24 hours on display here are movie hours. Nothing can be believed but it can certainly be enjoyed as a surrealistic trip thru Dante's Inferno via Los Angeles.  Fuqua, much like David Fincher's Fight Club, takes us on a trip through the heart of darkness and I went along for the ride and liked most of it, especially Denzel's turn being so good at playing bad."

","All of the buzz is true! Denzel Washington's performance in this movie is amazing. This marks his first time as a `bad guy' and he plays it so well. The film is about a lowly suburban traffic cop named Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), who gets his `break' by getting a chance to prove himself as a narc for a day under the supervision of Alonzo Harris (Washington), a shady vet cop whose undercover tactics are less than conventional. They drive around the rough parts of LA in Alonzo's low-rider Monte Carlo going from one questionable `bust' to another.<br/><br/> Alonzo sets up Jake by making him smoke some confiscated  PCP-laced marijuana that taints his blood, leaving Alonzo open to changing his story and having Jake as his pawn. Jake quickly sees that this is not the kind of law enforcement that he bargained for, but is stuck with him in every scary moment, at least for the `training day'. While Alonzo runs in a ring of rouge cops, he is not flawless in his procedures. He has some high-ranking city officials behind him, who quickly lose faith in him when he screws up a job in Las Vegas (which is never really explained too well). Jake must then try to get himself out of a bad situation, which only grows worse as the day goes on.<br/><br/> Director Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') does a great job of keeping the steady pace of the film and keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. Showing his music video director cred, artists like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray find parts in the film as well, but not as silly cameos. The writing is top notch and the good cop/bad cop angles are grittier than ever.<br/><br/> While Washington has Oscar buzz all around him, it seems unlikely that a movie like this would get nominated, even with his superb performance. It is not a perfect movie and it's not your `traditional' red carpet Oscar contender. But as usual, Denzel never disappoints. For the viewer, this is definitely worth the money to catch it in the theater. Although the violence may be sensitive for some viewers right now, most people should be able to take it for what it is: a good action flick with great acting."
"FlickJunkie-2","7","1","11","10 May 2002"," Intense, powerful, implausible
","This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.<br/><br/>One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'.  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'.  In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.<br/><br/>This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10."

","We've all seen the corrupt cop flick done before, and done well.  But it is not so often that we get much more than the standard good cop/bad cop affair.  Training Day often goes beyond the limits of Hollywood with its careful dissection of the moral and ethical dilemma cops face when dealing with ""the streets"" while still remaining a Hollywood flick.<br/><br/>What works so well is the combination of faced paced drama that we and our Rookie cop, Ethan Hawke, are thrown into and the intellectual debate that rages today over ""the streets"" and ""what to do about it.""  Hawke's ethics relate closely to that of MLK while Washington takes more of Malcom X's position (fittingly so). <br/><br/>Denzel's character may be corrupt now, but the film hints at a change from earlier views, almost as if ""the streets"" showed him that there was no other way of functioning as an effective Narc.  Understanding the value of being ""real,"" he believes to be most important in getting things done.  A ""naive, wanna save the world"" rookie cop, in his mind, ain't gonna cut it out there. And he tries to get Hawke's character to understand his views.  But while this is happening we are then shown how by being so closely related to ""the streets,"" and even living there, what it has done to him. <br/><br/>
Who is more right in dealing with ""the streets,"" Hawke or Washington? <br/><br/>
There we have the foundation for the story.<br/><br/>We are pretty much thrown into Ethan Hawke's position of constant wonderment of Washington's character.  And for the most part it works.  Is this how things get done?  Can one be a ""good"" cop and be effective?  Is there no hope for the victims of the situation?        <br/><br/>And the dilemma plays on to a fast beat.  Very good stuff.<br/><br/>The only surprise was where was all of the hip-hop music from the soundtrack?  the moody score was effective, but they could have added more than one or two tracks from the soundtrack."

"smakawhat","8","1","11","29 October 2001"," See it for Denzel
","What can I say Denzel is the MAN.  He just steals the show.<br/><br/>Training Day focuses on Ethan Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt), a young LAPD cop.  He is on his first day to start off in a new position to work in the narcotics division.  Jake is eager, he tells his wife how excited and nervous he is for this assignment comparing it to first day of high school football tryouts.  Jake plays by the book, is intelligent and strong, but his world is about to be turned upside down by a hardcore veteran named Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>Alonzo takes Jake on a ride of insanity through the drug plagued worlds of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in gritty Los Angeles.  Alonzo is hard, he is succesful and good at what he does, but he does things differently. Alonzo is essentialy a cop who makes his own rules, and this of course creates a conflict for Jake.  After a few minor routine assignments it's easy to see that Alonzo is dirty.  In short Alonzo's attitude to fighting crime is simple, to beat the street you have to be harder than the thugs and pushers who inhabit it.  But Alonzo has been doing this far too long and is in a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>This movie COULD have been a bad exercise in good cop bad cop shlock.  But what evolves is a very well acted character study of 2 men with different views on how crime should be fought (in fact 2 polar extremes).  Denzel is masterful as Alonzo playing one of the most feared dirty cops I have ever seen on film, and Hawke as Jake does what he does well in most films, playing tormented characters caught in a bad situation and looking very shocked and perplexed.  There are great scenes of dialogue between the 2 such as when Alonzo asks why Jake wanted to join the squad.  Jake replies that he wants to get drugs off the streets and give something back to the community, and Alonzo only replies what is the real reason you joined narcotics?  Jake then says, ""Cause I want to make detective"".  It is this line that is the basis of Training Day.<br/><br/>With that, director Antoine Fuqua's work of pictured gang plagued LA is masterful.  Black distraught neighborhoods, Hispanic tatooed thugs sitting around a card table,  Fuqua creates hell and shows it brilliantly.  There is some good cinematography and a good score (but used too infrequently) creating a nightmarish uneasyness.  It's also wonderful to see Denzel play a bad guy for a change and play it sooooo well.  When Alonzo is interogating suspects you can't help but squirm in your seat while you watch him on screen.<br/><br/>The film tries to tie in a plot, so that it can create a conclusion in the end.  It isn't that distracting or even neccesary but it only shows the inevitable of Alonzo's work.  The film ends unresolved and this is good, because the film isn't about the good guy winning and the bad guy getting his just desserts, it's about how 2 men of different moral belief try to survive and do what is right.  There are no heroes in this film, just great characters.<br/><br/>While the use of placing 2 well known rap starts in cameo rolls, 1 Snoop Doggy as a wheelchair pushing crack dealer [good acting], 2 Dr Dre. as a cop henchman for Alonzo [bad acting], was really unnecesary.  While Snoop holds his own in the spotlight Dre's acting is just so canned.  Minor points, but I'd EASILY recommend this for Denzel's performance alone.<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10."

","What Denzel Washington does in this movie is similar with what<br/><br/>Sean Connery did in the Hunt for Red October, or Al Pacino did in<br/><br/>the Scent of a Woman; he simply outnumbered other casts.<br/><br/>From the beginning, like Ethan Hawke, we look at him with a full<br/><br/>awe, such charisma and control and logical reasons towards all<br/><br/>the violence and crimes he does. And sitting on the third seat with<br/><br/>these two characters later proven to be a joyride between realism<br/><br/>and idealism flick, similar like what Gene Hackman and Willem<br/><br/>Dafoe fighting in Mississippi Burning.<br/><br/>The mean streets of Los Angeles are well presented, we simply<br/><br/>look at the violence and somehow, with Denzel Washington<br/><br/>charm, suddenly we're wondering what kind of life Ethan Hawke<br/><br/>live in, which puts him in such idealism... he's a pure hero<br/><br/>schoolboy plunged into a pond of hell which he supposed to know<br/><br/>all the time.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the sympathy and charms which supposed to be<br/><br/>drawn into our growing pains towards Denzel character remains<br/><br/>there. That's the beauty of it, we are so deep with this character<br/><br/>and we can see his madness and his end with some understanding and acceptance.<br/><br/>Indeed this is one of Denzel Washington's excellent-steady<br/><br/>performance. His stare, his goove, his move, indeed casting him<br/><br/>in this movie is the best thing the producer have done. And for Ethan Hawke, okay, he's there the way he's suppose to be,<br/><br/>the usual boyish purity and idealism. I just hope he can deliver<br/><br/>more developing characters as he have done in Alive.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, the basic frame is nice, and blend nicely in<br/><br/>everyday's violence, but the pure luck of the rookie somehow blew<br/><br/>it up... followed with somehow-a forceful ending.<br/><br/>Training Day starts with a realistic starts, but later ends with<br/><br/>idealistic standard scripts... but still it's an incredible movie to<br/><br/>watch.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for evening movie."

","*** o/o **** ""Training Day"" is a Drama/Thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killers) and stars Oscar winner Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans, The Hurricane, Glory) and Ethan Hawke (Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, Great Expectations) It is released by Warner Bros. at a running time of 120 min.  It is rated R for brutal violence, persuasive language, drug content, and brief nudity. <br/><br/>The basic story is as follows: Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a husband and father who has been a cop for 18 months.  He is training to be a narcotics officer.  On his training day he is assigned to Alonzo Harris who will show him the ropes.  Alonzo at some times is bitter but at other times is fun.  But Jake is surprised when he finds out how Alonzo is corrupt and conniving.  And soon Jake is intertwined in Alonzo's plan to deliver a large sum of money after a mistake made with the Russian Mafia. <br/><br/>First of all this movie is performance based... the script doesn't give it any oomph and neither is the direction anything special.  It is simply wonderful performances by Washington and Hawke (though Hawke will most likely be overlooked by Washington).  The movie is paced very well at the beginning with Hawke waking up and meeting Denzel... then we get the intensity point as they go from bust to bust.  There are surprisingly impressive cameos by Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray that also push the movie along.  Scott Glenn also gives a worthwhile performance as Roger, Alozo's ""supposed"" friend.  1 hr. 40 mins. in I was thinking, whoa that was one of the best endings I have ever seen!  And then the movie continued.<br/><br/>
This is the movies fatal flaw... it should have quit when it was ahead... hell, I might have given it an extra half of a star if it had ended then but it all boiled up to a rooftop jumping and then loud ending. <br/><br/>Academy Potential: I am deeming this much too violent for the Academy to choose Denzel for a Best Actor nomination.  It's just to much of an action flick to be considered... it would be like nominating Stallone for ""Cliffhanger"". <br/><br/>While the film has a horrible flaw... it's still enjoyable to watch the stars in brilliant performances.  So the movie isn't completely wasted, just less than expected."

","From the moment I sat in my seat until the end of Training Day, the ride was unbelievable; absolutely incredible. There were those first few quite and terse moments before Ethan Hawke(Jake Hoyt)meets Denzel Washington(Alonzo Harris). SPOILER!!Hoyt's at home with his wife and new baby and is excited at the chance he's been given to join an elite LAPD narc unit. Hawke(Hoyt)meets his would be mentor and it's off the hook from then on. The Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg song is most appropriate as they begin their adventure through the streets of LA. Adventure or nightmare, good cop or bad cop, are questions you ask yourself as the movie proceeds. All the while you watch Harris play serious mind games with Hoyt, encouraging him in one breath and literally punking him out in the next. You should enjoy the breakneck speed of this movie and if you're a fan of Washington's acting as I am, you'll enjoy watching him take it to another level."

","I looked forward to Training Day because of Denzel Washington (Alonzo)and I was well rewarded by his excellent, in-your-face acting. In fact, all the acting was excellent. However, the movie grew more and more violent as it moved along, I thought overtaking the suspenseful first half build-up. By the end, I was sorry we took our teenage daughter. More importantly, the movie's plot doesn't stand up to the plausibility test. Alonzo's driving motivation seems to stem from a hazy, out of the movie run-in he had with Russian gangsters in Las Vegas. Coincidentally or not, the day he must resolve this issue is also an orientation day for rookie Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Over the course of the day, unlikely yet critical events tumble over one another toward a predictable violent climax.

","TRAINING DAY goes for broke. Everything about it is over the top, and that's why I loved it so much. It's not a gritty, realistic portrayal of a corrupt police officer, but a story of a man so far over his head that there is no way he'll ever get out. It reminded me of Brian DePalma's SCARFACE, about drug dealer Tony Montana. Realistic? No, but tremendous movie making. Denzel Washington outdoes himself here. He goes over the top so far, but still within the limits of the movie. Director Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS and BAIT) is not exactly known for his subtley, and TRAINING DAY is anything but subtle. It's like a freight train of a movie. The violence is strong, persistant and off putting, but then again it's supposed to be. (WARNING SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD). The final scenes with Denzel in the street screaming at all the people he thought loved him so much, are great.

"Dignan_Tenenbaum","Null","1","11","18 October 2001"," Finally, a good movie from Antoine
","I knew that Antoine Fuqua had a good movie in him.  Let's breakdown his career: He directs music videos (most notably, Gangsta's Paradise) then he gets tapped to do an American version of the Hong Kong action film.  The Replacement Killers was alright, I suppose, but it certainly didn't live up to its predecessors.  Then he gets stuck directing a movie with Jamie Foxx in the lead.  That had disaster written all over it (Jamie Foxx is absolutely great in supporting roles).  But with Bait, you really could tell that Fuqua had talent, even if the material wasn't good.  But now, with Training Day, he's given a prime opportunity to show us what he's made of. And it's clear that he's got a good career ahead of him.<br/><br/>This movie is a real treat in this time of what seems to be one bad movie after another.  It's very funny at parts, but not to the point where it's a comedy that gets all serious at the end.  Denzel is, of course, great.  I really don't understand why people keep making a big deal out of his performance though.  Sure, it's the first time he's played a bad guy, but I honestly can't think of one time when he's given a bad performance.  He's always great, so this shouldn't be a surprise.  What is a surprise is Ethan Hawke.  For once he's not playing the brooding, misunderstood guy.  He plays this one like it should be and that was the big acting surprise (not seeing Dr. Dre as a cop).<br/><br/>Normally, when a movie has a revelation towards the end, it changes your whole viewpoint on what happened earlier.  But, without giving away anything, with this movie, it just makes you uneasy about the events that are to come.  I've also read a few people talking about how the very end is a little hard to swallow.  It makes perfect sense if you really paid attention to the rest of the movie.  And I'm not talking about ""if you blink, you miss the key point of information.""  This film is about setting a certain mood and state of mind.  Both from the director and from the characters.  If you let yourself get into it, the whole movie is a really great experience.<br/><br/>Like I said before, this movie is very funny.  But the action in it is some of the best in a while too.  It's not all about special effects and messing with your visual perspective.  Most of the action is shot in a way that allows you to follow it from start to finish.<br/><br/>I loved the cameos too: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Macy Gray, Tom Berenger, and that guy who played Redbud in The Usual Suspects.  They were fun, but not distracting.  Overall, I guess the movie does have it's flaws; it does seem to drag a little in parts.  But it is still a great movie worth watching. While this is Antoine Fuqua's first really good movie, I hope he now has the ability to get better and better projects.  I've never ended a review with a pun before so I won't call his first two movies training days.  That would just be wrong."

And then there is the vice that really gets Denzel Washington's character in trouble ... it just does not jive.

Now, sure, lot's of films make this mistake but what makes it so grating here is that the film would have been really good without it.  You see, Mr. Washington's character simply is too smart for this vice to be a character flaw.  It just does not work, and with the easy out ending, it cheapens the whole effect of Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, and Anton Fuqua's work.

Secondly, the characters are solid and believable. This is in no little part due to the excellent performances put in by Denzel Washington (hardened veteran Narcotics officer) and Ethan Hawke (the rookie on his 'training day').  Another reason for being refreshing is that Denzel is the bad guy - he plays the players to his own ends, and not just to put the criminals away.<br/><br/>The action flows nicely from a steady beginning to the fateful climax and, even though the film paints quite a bleak picture of what is required to survive and thrive on the streets, there are not a few moments of humour.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended."
"darkjosh","8","1","11","17 October 2001"," Searing Work From Washington and Fuqua
","Audiences looking for a big, mindless, action-driven cop flick in Training Day will be surprised by two things: director Antoine Fuqua, who made the dismally mediocre Jaime Foxx vehicle, ""Bait"", has molded an adult, tense, mature, and engrossing action-drama, and two, Denzel Washington has eschewed his good guy persona, playing a charismatic but unlikable rogue cop.<br/><br/>While the story of corrupt cops lurking in the police department may be done to death, a certain timeliness is present with such stories as the recent LAPD Rampart scandal.  Ethan Hawke plays a rookie-cop who hopes to work his way up the rungs of the LAPD to detective by working with seasoned undercover narcotics cop Washington.  Washington proves, however, to have questionable methods of investigation and procedure.  Hawke unwittingly is drawn into the sickly logical and charasmatic musings of Washington until he ends up unwittingly becoming a participant in a coverup.<br/><br/>Again, the story has been done before, but rarely has it been tackled with such a tense, uneasy, and guttural realism.  Director Antoine Fuqua injects the film with a searing authenticity: LA hasn't been such an uninviting. dangerous, ugly urban jungle in a while, with bleak, rainy shots of the city swimming in dirt, litter, and graffiti. The use of realistic looking and acting gang members, and also the cameo appearances of rap stars helps keep tensions high as well, and also adds striking resonance.<br/><br/>
Anchoring the whole movie is Denzel Washington, in a refreshing change from his usual upstanding, righteous roles.  As the corrupt cop, he gleefully goes for broke in a manic, antihero, larger-than-life performance so unlike his previous work that it will surely garner him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>

"giancarlorocks","Null","1","11","13 October 2001"," An intense, character driven cop film...
","The most salient component in Training Day' is the intensity that stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke bring to the screen. Director Antoine Fuqua presents his third and best film yet that weaves a simple yet effective tale of human tragedy and morality. Fuqua's first cinematic foray was the ill-received The Replacement Killers'. In the film he proved he was a student of the art in which he displayed his flair for John Woo style visuals in this Honk Kong-type action flick starring Chow Yun Fat.  From then on he went on to make Bait' a so-called action comedy that failed on almost every level. In this; his most mature film as of yet, he tones down his visuals and uses Washington's acting capabilities to the fullest capacity to create a rich, character driven film that is taut and tense. Training Day' is exactly what the title describes it as. The film unravels within the span of one full day and brings us into the heart of police corruptibility. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a former rookie uniform officer on his first day in the narcotics department. Heading this department is Washington who portrays Alonzo Harris; a deviant and ruthless corrupt cop who has crossed the line of morality. Within a span of one day, Hoyt is literally thrown into the fire' as he is exposed to the dark underbelly of the Los Angeles Police Department Narcotics Unit while being trained' by Harris.      Without spoiling the simple yet efficient script, these two men deliver great performances that catapult this otherwise regular film into a good film. Within the span of one day, Hoyt is exposed to massive gunplay, violent attacks, crooked drug dealers (such as Snoop Dogg), a loud-mouthed drug haven (Macy Gray) and plenty of foul language as Hoyt must come to terms with the disparaging image that being a cop is not all it was supposed to be. In terms of performances, this film packs it in mainly due to Washington's villainous turn as a cop who has crossed the line and who is attempting to  recruit  others with him. A welcome note is Hawke's turn as a young cop who holds his own against Washington in some tight and well acted scenes that add a certain level of intensity that completely captivate the audience. In addition to all this, a refreshing angle in this film is that unlike other films, we see the relationship between our hero' and villain' (notice the quotation marks) build up, blossom, and deteriorate before our very eyes. This leaves the relationship unmasked and we as the viewers get to experience  first hand the detrimental characteristics of this unconventional relationship.      As for the direction of this film, I mentioned it earlier. It is a substantial step in terms of Fuqua's respectability factor. Finally he won't have to be ashamed of one of the movies he has done. It is imperative to note that this is not an action film, nor a thriller. It is a pure dramatic piece that pits both antagonist and protagonist against one another that is highlighted by well-written scenes and great acting.      Screenwriter David Ayer creates a fairly decent script that allows the audience to view a first hand glimpse at the audacity and cunningness of Washington's character. Furthermore, those of us who have seen the film know that there is a subplot that pits Washington against a deadline that forces our villain to commit these protruding acts all within the span of one day. This allows the audience to also view what means he takes to achieve an end. Without saying too much, Hoyt is exposed to the easy way to making Detective and the normal, arduous task that is of the legal and rewarding manner. In terms of its' worthiness as a film, it surprises on many levels. Perhaps due to low expectations this was a surprise but make no mistake  this is a well-made film that tells  a tale with a surprising amount of intensity, tension and with an interesting graphic resolution.<br/><br/>

","This is the first movie in quite a long while in which I walked into the theater with high expectations and walked out completely satisfied. Denzel Washington is beyond a great actor. In my opinion, after watching this film, he is among the top two or three of his generation. If Glory introduced him to the masses, Training Day should cement his place in film history. Very few actors have the ability to be effective as both the hero and the villain. Kevin Spacey, Robert DeNiro, and Robert Duval come to mind also. Denzel was the perfect villian for this film. The atmosphere of this film is very gritty and realistic. Still, it does not move slowly, and every little vignette in the story seems pertinent at the end. The only flaw with this film might be that it was supposedly supposed to mirror the life of a rogue LAPD narcotics officer. Maybe it was a little too dramatic in the end, but again it was well worth my time and energy to see this film. 8.8/10"
"Rhino Rover","8","1","11","13 October 2001"," Dark and intriguing
","I've always thought that Denzel Washington was/is a wonderful actor. He's proven it time and time again but he has always played morally true characters or the typical Hollywood `good guy' so when the `Training Day' trailers first came out I was really looking forward to seeing Washington portray a completely opposing character. <br/><br/>Training Day literally takes place over the span of one day. A young patrol cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) gets his big chance to further his career goal of becoming Detective by working with the legendary Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). This man's reputation precedes him and has been responsible for over 15,000 man years of incarceration based on his investigations and Hoyt is now getting his chance to work in Harris's squad. Hoyt finds out that Harris is as tougher than his reputation and quickly begins learning the ropes of street justice but to the contrary of everything he's learned and devoted his life to. `To Serve and Protect' now takes on an entirely new meaning.<br/><br/>You know I really hope that Denzel Washington does more of these types of roles. I'm always amazed at his acting skills but he always plays the same type of character. Whether that was a career choice or not, it was very refreshing to see him finally play a more `evil' character per say. In this case, the role was even more amazing in that Harris isn't so much evil but that he has his own outlook on how justice should be handled. In some instances you actually begin to agree with his outlook and root for him. I have never seen Washington give a poor performance. He acts with an intensity that very few other actors have and dives into his character with reckless abandon.<br/><br/>What surprised me even more was Ethan Hawke. I've never been a huge fan of his and I sometimes find his characters hard to believe because of his boyish looks. But in this movie they seem to work. He comes across as a young ethical patrol cop trying to make his way to Detective. Throughout the movie he has his morals and ethics challenged by Washington's character and frequently he caves into Washington's dominance. This worked very well and made the movie interesting but more importantly Hawke make his character believable. I was impressed by his performance in this movie.<br/><br/>There was a nice little scene with Cliff Curtis (Smiley). I saw this actor in `Blow' and really like his performance there. Hopefully he doesn't get typecast but he was very good in the character he played here. I guess if there's on thing to get picky about was the storyline. It seems a little extreme to have only one day to make or break making a new squad but in the context of the story, this works. Especially when you know the motives behind Washington's character. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a dark entertaining movie. If for nothing else, see this movie to see Denzel Washington play a bad character. You'll be surprised and impressed."
"spazierganger","7","1","11","13 October 2001"," Great acting, pretty good story
","""Training Day"" is a film which features great acting by the two leads, and a story that's very good, until it slips a bit at the end. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, veteran narcotics cop who's training Ethan Hawke, a young cop hoping for a spot on the unit. Both of the leads, especially Washington, are great. Washington's portrayal of Alonzo Harris will, I think, end up being one of the best, if not THE best, performance of the year. Definitely Oscar-quality material. And Ethan Hawke more than holds his own. Washington has been getting more praise, probably deservedly so, but Hawke does a great job playing Jake Hoyt, totally the opposite of Alonzo, thus making Denzel's performance stand out even more. Aside from those two, there really aren't any big parts, just lots of little ones. Most of those are good as well. Surprisingly, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg do nice jobs in their brief appearances.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua does a good job directing, which is a bit of a surprise, considering that his previous work isn't really worth mentioning. I didn't know he had it in him. His directing isn't quite as good as the acting, but he does keep things moving nicely and does a good job of building up tension as the film goes on.<br/><br/>The script, written by David Ayer, is the only complaint I have. ""Training Day"" starts off with a great deal of promise, but then loses it a bit at the end. At the beginning, Alonzo doesn't come across as a horrible person. He makes some interesting statements that could make you think, and he has decent reasons for what he does. He doesn't always follow the laws, but he can make you understand why he breaks them. But by the end, he's a completely corrupt, totally evil villain. And then the film is no longer about these choices that he makes, but about Hawke trying to stop a madman. Don't get me wrong, the ending is still exciting and fun to watch, but I was a bit disappointed to see the film abandon the moral complexities that it hinted at earlier. But, with the acting, it's still a very thrilling film, even at the end. Washington and Hawke could have been fishing, and I still would have been on the edge of my seat. So despite my minor issues with the story, the quality of the performances is more than enough for me to recommend ""Training Day.""<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"
"CarpenterKen","8","1","11","10 October 2001"," Good cop / Bad Cop
","`Good cop/bad cop.'<br/><br/> The police interrogation technique of partners ganging up on a suspect has long been a cinematic staple, but in `Training Day,' the new film from Warner Bros., the competition between good cop/bad cop goes on inside one cop.<br/><br/> Narcotics detective Alonzo Harris, played by Denzel Washington in a spectacular performance, is the schizophrenic combination of a streetwise law enforcement crusader and a vicious leader of a police wolf pack that preys on bad guys and good guys alike.  He is funny and likeable, ruthless and despicable, hero and outcast.<br/><br/> `There are some profoundly evil people walking these streets,' Alonzo says as the film begins. Will good prevail over evil?  That is the simple dramatic question director Antoine Fuqua poses here, but the route to the answer weaves erratically through crime-infested neighborhoods and sizzling plot twists, jumping from one spellbinding scene to the next.<br/><br/> Harris spends a single `training day' working with narcotics  division recruit Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke).  Hoyt is a veteran ofuniformed traffic duty in the suburbs, but Harris sees enough in him to offer a chance to make detective on the mean streets of Los Angeles.<br/><br/> The two spend most of the day riding around in Harris' `office,' a vintage low-rider Monte Carlo, as the grizzled but suave Alonzo explains the nuances of working undercover and making the big arrest.  Harris convinces his protégé to smoke PCP-laden weed, saying refusal on the streets would cost him his life -- `If I was a dealer, you'd be dead by now.'  He tells Hoyt not to wear his wedding ring to work, saying suspects would seize on it as a sign of weakness, a vulnerability to exploit.  They drink malt liquor like so much bottled water, and even stop off for a few belts of `the $300-a-bottle good stuff' with Harris' shadowy friend (played perfectly by Scott Glenn).<br/><br/> Harris boasts of the `15,000 man-hours of incarceration time' that his investigations have led to, but he allows several small-time criminals go free after Hoyt is ready to make busts.  `We're not racking up arrests today,' Harris says. Hoyt asks, `Just let the animals wipe themselves out?' And Alonzo replies, `God willing.'<br/><br/> Fuqua, who made a mark directing music videos for Arrested  Development, Henry D & The Boyz and Coolio, distinguishes  himself with his third feature, after `The Replacement Killers'  (1998) and `Bait' (2000).  The pace of the film never slows, even when the two main characters are simply riding around in a car or sitting in a restaurant.  The action sequences are interlaced with driving rap music and feverish editing, and Fuqua keeps the viewer guessing about what will become of Harris and Hoyt to very last.<br/><br/> Even with a scraggly mustache and goatee, Hawke still has a hard time shaking off his boyish innocence, but he comes of age as an actor in `Training Day.' With solid performances as a teen-ager in `The Dead Poets Society' (1989) and `A Midnight Clear' (1991), Hawke started landing some starring roles, including the overlooked lead in `Snow Falling on Cedars' (1999).  A Best Supporting Actor nomination would not be a surprise, given his stellar work as the tormented Hoyt.<br/><br/>As for Washington, he has never been better on screen, and we're talking about an actor who has mustered four Academy  Award nominations in his career.  He earned his first nod for a supporting role as South Africa's Steve Biko in `Cry Freedom' (1987), and then won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1989's `Glory.' He followed that with Best Actor nominations for `Malcolm X' (1992) and `The Hurricane' (1999). (He should have  won both statues, losing to Al Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' and Kevin Spacey in `American Beauty.')<br/><br/> Some wonder whether Washington took a risk by playing a rogue cop in `Training Day,' but other than the upbeat football coach in `Remember the Titans' (2000), his past characters have not exactly been choirboys.  For example, Reuben `Hurricane' Carter was a ruthless boxer and enough a product of the streets to be convicted of manslaughter, and Malcolm X made enemies of both whites and blacks before being assassinated.<br/><br/> No, playing Alonzo Harris was not career suicide for Washington. In fact, it's very likely he'll finally win the Best Actor Oscar that his body of work so richly deserves."

The movie portrays how some officers find themselves in the ""underworld"" environment, without ever planning to enter it.<br/><br/>The scene in the car, after they do the felony stop on the teenagers, shows how a seemingly strong-minded cop might be manipulated and it all starts there.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by the realism as far as police work.  The way the suspects refuse to cooperate, the artificial respect of the dealers with the cops, the drug sell hunting, the drug swallowing, the language, etc.<br/><br/>If you're a law enforcement officer, especially a patrol cop, this is a REQUIRED viewing.<br/><br/>Let's remember that as extreme as the film might seem, most of it happens regularly in the big cities.

Right from the beginning it breaks down every Hollywood cliche involving the genre, and makes very interesting observations on the dynamics between police and criminals in the LA underworld. The good cop bad cop metaphor is taken to new territory in this film.<br/><br/>In the movie, the idealism of rookie cop Jack Hoyt (Hawke) is violently juxtaposed with the Machiavelian cynicism of the veteran detective Alonzo (Washington).<br/><br/>(In my opinion Washington gives the most stunning portrayal of a jaded cop since Gary Oldman in ""Romeo is Bleeding"".)<br/><br/>I will not delve into a plot summary, however, I will note that Antoine Fuqua's third film is by far his most truthful and memorable. It stands so far above the entertaining but pointless 'Bait' and the just plain crappy 'Replacement Killers', that I cannot believe that they were made by the same man. In the previous two films it was as if Fuqua was trying to make movies that were to seem that they were autered by more prominent directors (John Woo and Michael Bay to be exact).<br/><br/>However, in this film, the director has garnered his own voice, and he has some very important things to say about race, right and wrong, cops and criminals, and about the lines that blur between them all.<br/><br/>The true brilliance of this film, however may not be the message that Fuqua wants to convey, but rather the sheer mix of subtlety and outright vicery though which he does convey it. This film is not perfect (which films are?) but it is very important, and it is very ballsy and that is what counts.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

","[possible spoiler]<br/><br/>
If you ever ask yourself if one performance can make a film, all you need to do is take a look at ""Training Day."" Denzel Washington delivers one of his very best acting jobs ever, as what must be the most corrupt law enforcement officer portrayed by a leading actor. The character is not unlike Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle; at first he walks a *very* narrow line between sanity and madness, and to his credit he does a fairly good job (up to a point) in barely keeping himself on the right side. We may not like him, or approve of his actions, but we accept him as he is, as well as the fact that he has reasons for what he does that seem perfectly logical and sensible to him.<br/><br/>Some critics have been hard on Ethan Hawke, probably because Washington outshines him. That's missing the point. The Hawke character's purpose in the film is to provide a foil, a contrast to his partner's insanity. They are complete opposites, and it's interesting to notice that while Hawke is more idealistic and ""upright,"" he's also a bit naive, and tends to see things in black and white. Washington, on the other hand, perceives the world in shades of gray. While that's probably the more accurate and balanced outlook, he simply goes too far, and pays the price.<br/><br/>Is the ending a bit overdone? Yes, it is, but no one will deny it's effective. It was inevitable that his actions would backfire on him. As the film proceeds, he descends further and further into his self-created morass. There is a point in the film where it is immediately apparent that he has finally reached critical mass, and there's no turning back. I was reminded of the Biblical proverb, ""He who lives by the sword dies by the sword."" The wisdom of that statement is all too apparent when applied to the character.<br/><br/>*** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Warner Bros."

Perhaps something to the effect of the ending of the Sixth Sense. I thought that the alternate ending added nothing to the movie.

And then we just get a straight up black vs. white (racially and idealogically) battle of good cop against hopelessly corrupt cop who has to be taken down.  I was expecting to have my views of justice challenged only to have them confirmed in an annoyingly simple manner.  <br/><br/>Sure, the film was skillfully crafted.  The performances were great (though I still think Tom Wilkinson was robbed considering his great performance in ""In the Bedroom"" and the fact that Denzel seems to be having a ball hamming it up in this part having done MUCH better work in earlier films), the direction energetic and the overall production was very solid and effectively gritty.

If you like movies with Denzel Washington because he is such a nice person and such a good actor, then stay away! You will hate him in this movie. But you will be able to relate to Ethan Hawke in many ways. If you like strong brutal violence and lots of language throughout movies, then this one is for you.

Washington plays an undercover cop teaching his rookie protégé Ethan Hawke the ways of dealing with the vicious streets of Los Angeles within a single day.  As expected, Denzel is an amazing onscreen presence, but something is quite different here from his previous roles: he is the BAD GUY!  Its quite refreshing seeing him stray off from the usual by-the-book-goodie-two-shoe guys I've seen him portray in his other movies.  Washington has brilliantly acted any character from a freed Civil War era-slave, a South African anti-apartheid leader, a dedicated Gulf War colonel to a tenacious FBI anti-terrorist agent.  Being a crooked officer in ""Training Day"" is a welcome addition to his fine resume of cinematic acting.  <br/><br/>
Denzel's cop is an intriguing exploration into the mind of a seasoned law enforcer bent on utilizing extreme and unorthodox methods of keeping the streets crime-free.

You may loathe his character, but you have to admit that Washington never lets up in keeping the audience entranced in the film.  <br/><br/>Had Denzel failed to win the Best Actor Oscar for his awesome performance, I think the Academy should have been sued!

Warts and all, there's still something about unsung, neo-noir cop thrillers like 8MM, RUSH, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. and FORT APACHE: THE BRONX that stays with you.  This may not necessarily be a good thing, but unlike something as insipid as AMERICAN PIE 2, for example, at least they make an indelible impression.<br/><br/>Add TRAINING DAY to that list. What makes the movie different from others of its stripe, is no brain-twisting mystery whatsoever. What could've been your usual, by-the-numbers, good cop/bad cop thriller, not worth a hot minute in theaters and even less than that on the video store shelf, is elevated by a ferociously good performance at its center. And that performance, of course, belongs to Denzel Washington, taking his career of noble, high-minded ""saintly"" roles and giving it a welcome, vigorous shake.<br/><br/>To say that undercover narc Det. Alonzo Harris is a bad man, is like saying that Bluebeard could've used a little marriage counseling. There's no way to simplify it in such pat terms. Somewhere underneath the layers of street cred that have hardened over the years into a thick, nearly impenetrable shell, a blue knight who has given over to the seductive darkness of thug life is buried alive. The young idealist who once wanted to ""protect and serve"" is still in there. You can catch glimpses of him, but less in the eyes of Harris, than in the face of his anxious but ready-to-please ""street virgin"" partner, Jake Hoyt, well-played by Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>Jake thinks he can do whatever it takes to gain entry into the narc squad, and use it as a stepladder to reach his ultimate goal, which is to someday make Chief, and actually have his own precinct. But young Jake has got to survive his initial trial-by-fire first, and nothing he's learned in the academy has prepared him for what it's like to roll down the streets of South Central, with a truly original Bad Man.<br/><br/>The Oscar controversy has left a taint on this picture that is prejudicial and unfair, and the truth is that if Russell Crowe had won, the clamoring din of critics who would've screamed about how it would've been a consolation prize YET AGAIN for his astounding work in THE INSIDER, wouldn't have been quite as loud as the naysayers are now regarding Denzel.<br/><br/>Both actors are remarkable craftsmen, and both have never ""phoned-in"" a performance in any of the movies I've seen them in, regardless of what the genre is.  If Denzel didn't deserve the award for this movie, as many have whined, then I say that he should have it for the simple fact that he has been doing great work LONGER than Russell Crowe. Bottom line.<br/><br/>Am I biased? I would say yes. Did the Best Actor award smack of a popularity contest? I would say definitely to some degree, but when HASN'T the ""you-like-me-you-REALLY-like-me"" factor not affected the Oscars?  Regarding nomination of the best performance given, let me just say this. Russell, just in terms of acting ability, hits one out of the park as John Nash in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. High profile project, A-list director, a storyline that is virtual catnip to any Hollyweird producer. Personal ethics and public behavior aside, looking at Russell's past body of work, THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE. This was a sure thing, a SAFE thing.<br/><br/>Considering Denzel's past achievements, the very last thing you would count on, is to see him give a Class-A performance in what could've easily been a grade-Z movie. If TRAINING DAY had come out at the same time as BOYZ 'N' THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY, SUGAR HILL or NEW JACK CITY, with a star like Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhames, there wouldn't have even been a debate. Don't get me wrong; these are both two fine actors, but Alonzo Harris is the kind of part we've seen them both play before. Nothing new there. But Denzel has NEVER played a villain before, let alone one as complex as this. And he did it BEAUTIFULLY. For that, he now has gold for his mantle. Case closed.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke holds his own with Denzel's riveting presence, taking what could've been the cliched, fresh-faced rookie role and putting just enough spin on it, so that when Jake Hoyt is a little more wary, battle-tested and world-weary by the end, we can completely buy it. Very few of today's crop of ""youngsters"" could have believably pulled it off.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua (REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) has been down this road before, and the gritty, jittery, paranoia-laced uncertainty of the streets deposits a ball of tension in your gut from the opening frames and winds it ever tighter throughout the movie. South Central has never looked meaner, and it reminds us that for all the glamour we see on TV and in magazines and, yes, in the movies, L.A. has the same kind of scaly underbelly that all major cities have, and because of cops like Alonzo and Jake, good or bad, you might be lucky enough to never have to experience it first hand.<br/><br/>So if there is anything faulty about TRAINING DAY, it lies not in the performances of its award-nominated leads, Fuqua's sure-handed direction, or the almost three-dimensional photographic style of the excellent DP Mauro Fiore. TRAINING DAY'S main downfall lies in the factor that bears at least 75% importance in determining whether or not a movie will get made, even before the budgeting: the casting.<br/><br/>For that ""extra touch"" of street cred, not to mention guaranteeing the attraction of a certain demographic, no less than Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre stroll through in cameos, as a disabled crack dealer, a ""ghetto-fabulous"" hoochie, and one of Harris' men, respectively. All these performers have either lived or seen ""the life"" in one way or another, and none of them have to go 'Method' or 'find their motivation,' so you expect them to be good, and they are. The problem? Their presence, no matter how fleeting, is a jolting reminder that you are watching a movie, and that is what keeps DAY from being more than just a good film cemented by two great leads.<br/><br/>Even more distracting, though, are the other supporting players, all of whom are at the top of their game here, but their appearances toss the hard-won realism right out the window.  Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry, Harris Yulin, Cliff Curtis and Raymond Cruz are among the well-meaning culprits, a who's-who of the type that we used to see a lot of, back when Clint was still busting heads as Harry Callahan. However, to the credit of the casting director(s) and the producers, I think we, the public, are savvy enough by now to know that without these vets, replaced instead by a bunch of no-names, no matter how talented they were, TRAINING DAY might still be a script sitting in the bottom of screenwriter David Ayer's desk drawer.<br/><br/>That said, this is no feel-good romp, no buddy-buddy cop thriller where an Eddie Murphy or a Chris Rock will cut the tension with a well-placed, profanity-laced quip or two. Even with its obvious drawbacks, TRAINING DAY is still better than most films of its type, and more than worth your dime and your time."
"dfranzen70","8","1","11","2 April 2002"," Commanding Denzel
","Denzel Washington won the Oscar for this role as a corrupt narcotics cop. That in itself is an unusual sentence - not the Oscar part, but the ""corrupt"" part, as Washington rarely plays bad guys. But his Alonzo is most certainly a bad guy, out on the streets not for the greater good but to further his own interests. Even so, while Alonzo's not the most moral of characters, Washington makes him so multilayered that you almost root for him to persevere. Ethan Hawke plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt. Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.<br/><br/>
Alonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. <br/><br/>The events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? <br/><br/>The crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.<br/><br/>The one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too."
"gbrumburgh-1","8","1","11","30 March 2002"," Grim but riveting cat-and-mouse cop flick with a flashy central performance by Denzel Washington.
","A total downer from beginning to end, `Training Day' reeks with immoral, unredeemable characters while filling the screen with unavoidable bloodshed. Yet what keeps it from being just another standard tale of urban terror is its sharp, imaginative direction (Antoine Fuqua), an ultra-tense and engaging script, a jaunty pace, and knockout performances by Denzel Washington as an L.A. narc with dirty hands, and Ethan Hawke as his straight rookie partner learning the ropes.<br/><br/>Interesting shakeups begin right off the bat as Washington plays a  corrupt black cop and Hawke an honest white one.  Jake Hoyt (Hawke) dreams of elevating his young family's lifestyle.  He's given a plum opportunity when he's placed in the hands of hotshot veteran Alonzo Harris (Washington) for a trial run as a narcotics cop.  Hesitant because of the escalated risk but buoyed by the inevitable raise in pay and respect, Hoyt seizes the moment. If he can pass the muster, he's in. If not, he'll probably end up doling out speeding tickets or pushing papers the rest of his career.  But Hoyt is an action man and  seems up to the daunting task.  He learns quickly on his first day of training that Harris isn't your everyday, by-the-book officer. He's a fearless, arrogant braggart who plays hard ball.  Harris has developed his own survivalist style in bringing in the bad guys.  His methods are underhanded and he only plays for high stakes.  Intimidating, remorseless and just as terrifying as the street gangs he infiltrates, Harris exposes Hoyt to the money laundering and sexual favors, the crooked deals, the set-ups, the frame-ups.  Punk-ass thugs and rapists who turn informants are thrown back into the water as bait for bigger game.  And Harris is lord of it all, preening about his L.A. ghetto like a peacock, proud of the infamous reputation he's made for himself on the streets.  He's an avalanche of cocky confidence and streetwise cleverness out to win every drug game he plays, at any cost, at anybody's expense.<br/><br/>Oscar-winner Washington is nothing short of brilliant in a role that completely shoots down the upstanding good guy' screen image he's thus far cultivated.  What remains, however, is that undeniable Washington charm, charisma and quicksilver intelligence.  Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated) gives one of the best performances of his young career as a man caught between a badge and a hard place -- trying to fit in without compromising his code of ethics.  How far can he go?  How much can he endure?  His boyishly tough yet vulnerable cop gives the audience something to root for.  The character byplay between the two leads is strong, real, and fascinates as Harris draws Hoyt further into his dark world, playing some dangerous mind games along the way.<br/><br/>Ravaged, seamy locations and scary, menacing support characters capture the requisite feeling of urban paranoia and moral decay, and surrounds the film with an almost apocalyptical sense of hopelessness and doom.  Peripheral characters offered by Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and, particularly, Scott Glenn as an equally distrustful retired cop, add intensity and atmosphere.<br/><br/>In no sense of the term is ""Training Day"" an urban action flick.  On the contray, it is a taut, stark, ugly, complex character study that shows off some powerhouse talent.  Those who prefer mindless escapism will probably be turned off by its unrelenting grimness; those who prefer cerebral, realistic character studies will see it as a plus.  Repelling and unforgiving, I only wish the conclusion had been a bit more plausible and less grandiose.  It much too much for the realistic story presented.       <br/><br/>
Director Antoine (`Bait,' `The Replacement Killers') Fuqua, who began directing rap music videos for such artists as Coolio and Arrested Development has a promising future, at least in this genre.  It is an assured move into stronger film territory."

","Gosh, don't read this comment if you don't want to hear how bad I thought the ending of the movie was.<br/><br/>This movie seemed to have good energy at the beginning, and Washington's character kept Hawke's character and the viewer off-balance during the early scenes. But just when I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by this film, the ending plummeted through the basement floor and became ridiculous.<br/><br/>Washington and Hawke play intriguing characters -- the former possessing few if any standards of decency (aside from wanting to put away the big, big fish in the pond, by any means necessary), the latter showing blind ambition at first followed by an awakening of beliefs.<br/><br/>But then, to tidy things up, I guess, there is an outrageous climax in which the two main characters -- who by this point have become overblown images of themselves -- go toe-to-toe (or face-to-windshield, in one over-the-top instance) and ""good"" manages to prevail over ""evil."" With the support of the local urbanites, I might add. Sheesh.<br/><br/>Washington wins Oscar for this role? Malcolm X, maybe. I could listen to an argument for his ""Hurricane"" Carter. But for this caricature of a ""bad man""? I don't understand it -- or better yet, I do understand it. Pacino's ""Scent of a Woman"" nod was the foundation for this sort of award: We passed you by for better roles, so here's your chance. I don't like it, but oh well. I saw this movie before the Oscars, so I shouldn't let that add to my negative feelings toward this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line, in my mind: A good idea that became fatally flawed by the last 20 minutes (give or take a few)."
"Mario64","7","1","11","6 October 2001"," Good and could of been better.
","Training Day is engrossing, shocking, and powerful going three fourths of the way through.  Denzel Washington definitely has a possibility at a best actor nomination as a corrupt cop in one of the best performances he has given in quite a while. Ethan Hawk is also good as one who's just getting to know this corruption. It's over produced but still believable, that is until the last 20 minutes or so. The ending has some effectiveness, but is implausible and contains definet idiocy. The movie could have been great had the ending lived up to the rest of it. Still most of the movie is quite good. I give it a 7 out of 10."

","After seeing this film on DVD, I was truly satisfied with the film; yes, the whole film. There are no plot holes as far as I'm concerned, although I agree that one should see the film again to catch the crucial conversations that reveal some background plot elements -- but it is isn't too hard to catch on to the storyline. Denzel Washington's performance is incredible; viewers will forget his past ""good guy"" performances as they are absorbed into the dark depth of this crooked, but experienced, narcotics officer.  You will not look at the ""crooked cop"" idea in the same generic way after seeing this film. He deserved the ""Best Actor"" Oscar, but it's a bit disappointing (but not TOO much) that it was for a bad guy role, after all of his remarkable previous movie performances. Ethan Hawke's performance as the trainee was very believable as well, for his ""training"" was a true crucible in deciding whether ridding the streets of criminals took becoming a criminal. Though it's a rough movie in terms of language and thematics, the violence was not as pervasive.  The disturbing imagery gives the film a serious but effective tone in encapsulating street life and the moral clashes between Harris (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), and their dealings with real criminals.  Impressive and disturbingly powerful flick."

"eb03","8","1","11","26 March 2002"," Great Performances
","Training Day is a gritty character-based crime drama.  It focuses on a rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) hoping to make a strong impression on the leader of a group of LAPD undercover narcotics officers, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).  As Hoyt's training day unfolds he is faced with moral dilemmas with what he was taught in his past training and what Alonzo says and does.  Alonzo's policing methods toe the line between ""good detective work"" and ""illegal.""<br/><br/>The interaction between these two characters is really the heart of the movie, and Washington and Hawke play their roles brilliantly.  Washington definitely deserves his Oscar for this performance, as he constructs Alonzo as a very over-the-top cocky veteran who believes that his way is the only way of doing things.  Hawke's character is a perfect foil to this, as he's subdued and uneasy as he faces tough choices but also hopes to make a strong impression on Alonzo to advance his career.<br/><br/>The plot develops very nicely, and I recommend watching the movie twice because the second time around, there are small details that you notice which all tie in to the ""chess game"" that develops in the film.  Also watch the DVD for insightful directors commentary from Antoine Fuqua.  It provides interesting background on the acting of Hawke and Washington and the realism of the undercover cop and gangbanger characters.  Strong acting by musicians Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray in their limited roles.  Each created memorable characters.<br/><br/>To sum it up, great acting, great directing, and a great movie.  It's a shame I missed it on the big screen."

"not4me2say","8","1","11","6 October 2001"," What's wrong with this picture?
","There is only one reason why this flick will never have its rightful place in Hollywood history. With great anticipation, I watched Denzel Washington (who I believe walks on water) take on his first roll as a bad guy. Even though his performance was stellar, there was just something significantly wrong with this film throughout. While contemplating the thin line between art imitating life and its opposite, consider the following.<br/><br/>A Hollywood good guy who takes on the role of a bad guy is best served by pairing with someone who is also reputed as good. Remember the movie ""Heat""? Ethan Hawke is not that guy.<br/><br/>While the movie was set in the most notorious urban jungle, the good cop managed to do some things that simply can't be done by a white cop in a real environment of the same notoriety. Even people from the squeaky clean suburbs know that downtrodden minorities have no love (or trust) for white police officers simply because they are white (the oppressor). I could go on criticizing Training Day for other little quirks, but it really would not matter. There truly is only one reason why this potentially great movie (great like Gladiator) won't ever be regarded as such. Somebody made a fatal casting mistake. If Cuba Gooding Jr. had been the rookie, you can bet that this movie would have been in line for several Oscar awards. As fate would have it instead, Denzel Washington's first performance as a bad guy may go down in history as a forgettable moment. Imagine a sequel to this movie starring Ethan Hawke now as a veteran. Would you go see it? What a shame... Denzel did such an awesome job!"

","Finally, atlast...    Justice has been done. Denzel has won the much coveted OSCAR for himself for the LEADING ROLE after winning it for Best Supporting Role in Glory(1989).<br/><br/>   But I have One COMPLAINT : Didn't the Oscar juries notice Denzel Washington for his roles in movies such as Cry Freedom(1987), Malcolm X(1992), Philadelphia(1993), Crimson Tide(1995) and ofcourse ...The Hurricane(1999)? That's where my complaint lies: DENZEL WASHINGTON SHOULD HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR LEADING ROLE LONG TIME AGO.<br/><br/>
   Even though he was not nominated for his roles in Philadelphia(1993) and Crimson Tide(1995), his roles in those movies were significant ones. Both the movies were GEM of movies. Actually, my PERSONAL opinion is that BOTH Philadelphia and Crimson Tide should have been nominated in the categories of Best Picture,Best Director(Jonathan Demme/Tony Scott respectively),Best Actor(though Tom Hanks won for Philadelphia),Best Supporting Actor(Washington/Gene Hackman respectively. Gene Hackman has done a great job.)<br/><br/>
   Denzel Washington had actually proved from the very beginning that he was here to ACT and not only to ACT, but ACT in very MEANINGFUL roles. And it was clear from the very start of his career when the movie Soldier's Story,A(1984) was nominated for the Best Picture in which he had acted and was only his second movie AND he himself was nominated for the Best Actor for his role in Cry Freedom(1987) which was only his fourth movie for the big screen. Actually by winning it, Denzel has proved that Substance rules over hype-hoopla and favour.This was the reward he was toiling for, for the last fifteen years.Actually, Denzel Washington is an ideal example of a  GREAT FIGHTER/STRUGGLER.<br/><br/>
   The IRONY is that after playing the GOOD GUY for all these years, he has won it for the BAD GUY role. Anyway, a role is either an excellent  role or a poor role and not any other thing. Anyway now that he has won the Award, my only wish is that he doesn't rest and works only MORE HARDER in more MEANINGFUL roles. His roles are what attract me towards his performances.<br/><br/>    Anyway,Best of Luck ,DENZEL for your future ..."

From the second the movie began, I was confronted with some of the worst American action movie cliches.  There was everything from frontal nudity during gun fights to gratuitously graphic violence that even had me (a very desensitized American movie goer compared to most) angry at the graphic detail in which some scenes were allowed to go into.  The way that the different races were represented in this movie gives me little to no hope of racism ever ending....especially when I see the way that Hollywood continues to portray ethnic groups.  This movie in particular painted namely females, Russians, blacks, and Puerto Ricans in a negative light.  I was disgusted to see all of the minorities being shown as ""the bad guys"".

"pvdugas","Null","1","11","20 March 2002"," Inner City Reality at it's Best
","Of the 43 or so movies that Denzel Washington has starred in, ""Training Day"" has got to be classified as one of the most memorable character's he has ever attempted.  Antoine Fuqua's direction and David Ayer's writing tell the true story of police corruption in the mean streets of Los Angeles.  Ethan Hawke's portrayal of Rookie Cop Jake Hoyt was convincing next to the larger than life stature of Denzel Washington. The movie is gripping from opening to close with sharp and realistic dialogue  between Washington's character ""Alonzo Harris"" and Rookie Hoyt. The film is one that should be viewed twice.  The second viewing helps to show the ""mind games"" that Alonzo plays with Hoyt throughout the movie, but also show what happens when manipulation fails. Ethan Hawke's supporting actor Oscar nod is rightfully deserved.<br/><br/>
Nomatter how you may feel about Denzel when the movie ends, it's a performance worthy of the Best Actor Oscar. Living in Southern, California and growing up in the Inner City, this movie delivers the harsh realities of police corruption by not all, but many L.A.P.D. Detectives. Pay close attention to the dialogue. It rings true. This movie is real.<br/><br/>
Snoop Dog (Blue)and Macy Gray (Sandman's wife)have small but worthy parts. Antoine Fuqua has come into his own as a Director with this movie. It only gets better from here. Training Day is a must see movie."

","Denzel Washington is a good actor without doubt - I've enjoyed his work ever since St. Elsewhere. But because his characters are always of such stong moral conviction I had a really hard time believing him as a badass. Because he doesn't disappear into the character - as did Al Pacino in Scarface or Morgan Freeman in Street Smart or Harvey Keitel in The Bad Lieutenant - I spent much of the movie trying to believe that Washington was this bad guy, and ultimately couldn't do it. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly good as the rookie, and the plot is good, though the Russian thing seemed underdeveloped and contrived - why exactly did Washington own them the money? I'd recommend the movie, but it won't be remembered as Washington's best work."

","Simply the great! Denzel Washington has done it again and this time he played a character which is altogether different from his all previous roles.Every time Denzel has played some new character he has set standards for other actors to follow.Here too he has lived upto the challenge of playing a bad guy like that of a corrupt,law-breaking sergeant Alonzo for which you could feel disgust,hatred,fearful respect and awe at the same time. Ethan Hawke too is simply brilliant in expressing the character of a cop on his first day of duty who is initially excited about and ready to follow the rules by the law-book but then gets shocked and subdued by the law bending and even law breaking tactics of Alonzo Harris. As far as the movie movie is concerned it a decent flick expressing corruption in the police force but has been made an affair to remember by Denzel Washington. Truly the best negative performance after Norman Bates(Psycho),Dr. Hannibal Lecter(The Silence of the Lambs),Keyser Soze(The Usual Suspects)and ofcourse after that of Alan Rickman in Robinhood and other movies. Finally,though not an Oscar deserving movie but an Oscar deserving acting."

","I rated this film 7 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it, but it isn't so great as to stick out above the rest of the films in the genre. Personally I often favour the bad guy in good vs evil flicks, and this one's no difference. Alonzo (Denzel Washington)is a real badass slick-talking-smooth-walking copper. He's got ""bad cop"" written all over him and his wrong car and clothes I liked it. And of course his counterpart Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawk) is the obligatory goody-two-shoes rookie on his first (and only, as far Alonzo is concerned) Training Day on the job as a narc. [SOME (a wee bit) SPOILING AHEAD, SO WANNA-WATCH-AS-A-VIRGIN TYPES STOP HERE] Believe you me, Alonzo really proves to be a bad number, and of course he tries to drag Hoyt along and prevent a way back to good coppers land. And of course this will not stick in the end. I would like a film on this subject where the bad cop is less obvious and the good cop is a badass himself too. I hate the goody 2 shoes types like Hoyt, it's so, emm well, obvious and thus boring. Enough complaints, it's a good flick, lots of badass action, junkies dealers pimps and ho's, and some no go neighborhood shots! Enough pace to keep you at the edge of your seat for the 2 hours it lasts, a great killing scene and mis-en-scene and a satisfactory getting-rid-of-the-bad-character scene.

","Training Day is what I would consider THE best movie of 2001, and the best Denzel Washington movie ever made. However the release of the film hurt its chances of being an Oscar contender by releasing it late summer. If it had been released during Christmas it would have been getting the rave reviews as A Beautiful Mind and Black Hawk Down have been receiving. It is without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2001.<br/><br/>Although, I am glad to have seen Washington nominated for Best Actor in the Golden Globes, hopefully the Academy will carry that over to the Oscars.<br/><br/>Acting is superb, especially with Ethan Hawke! With a supporting cast such as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg -- who were unexpectedly GREAT actors, despite their short screen presence (there are no small parts, only small actors.)<br/><br/>The realism of the movie makes you think that the director actually went out on the streets of LA and actually filmed the real lives of corrupted cops and druglords. This movie is a MUST BUY DVD or VHS."
"Aidan McGuinness","7","1","11","11 February 2002"," Highly enjoyable let down only by being a tad predictable
","I'll start by saying I really enjoyed ""Training Day"". It was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in this first month-and-a-bit of the cinema year. I'm going to recommend it, with a little bit of caution, and here's why:<br/><br/>Firstly big respect to Denzel Washington. Usually he's playing the underdog and we're rooting for him. He's constantly getting the nice guy role and so it's extremely refreshing to see him play the corrupt cop here. His character - Alonzo Harris - isn't necessarily evil, he's just deciding to do a delicate balance of crime and punishment. He takes freely from the scum he prosecutes and has no qualms about doing so. In playing this character Washington is allowed to show far more versatility than his works normally allow. He works well with his attitude to new rookie cop Jake Hoyt (played admirably by Ethan Hawke). Hawke wants to do well on his first day, his ""training day"" but can't stomach Harris' morale scruples. There is a great line of tension between the two that develops more as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>It is the plot, if anything, that lets the movie sag a little. For the most part it's predictable and Ayer, at one very tense moment, uses a poorly scripted coincide to back himself out of a sudden ending. The actual end to the movie is also foreseen and, for that, is somewhat disappointing. It might have been nicer to go a different route but I guess some elements of formula must be adhered to. Having said that there's some great lines of dialogue as Harris convinces Hoyt that the way the world *really* works is not as simple as Hoyt would like to believe and that there is a certain ""survival of the fittest"" element you must follow. The cop's corruption - in particular the first middle-of-movie-3rd-act climax - is quite harrowing and sharply executed.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua does a nice job of realizing the script he's working from. The fight scenes, for example, pack - pun intended - a lot of punch. You can feel the pain of the blows. The camera-work generally succeeds without having to be overly intrusive. The lighting is generally subdued even during high noon - adding to the movie's generally bleak outlook and feel and the score never over-plays any sentimental or aggressive moments.<br/><br/>Overall I really quite enjoyed ""Training Day"" and found it a cut above the average buddy-cop flick. With some good performances, a (generally) sharp script and some fine directing I'd give it a 7.5/10 which is well above average for me."
"WalterFrith","Null","1","11","7 October 2001"," Hard core nightmare for trainees.....
","It's a well known fact that the city of Los Angeles is going through its biggest corruption investigation in decades.  With 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' set in the early 50's and now 'Training Day' set half a century later in the early 21st century, we can see that people haven't changed one bit in all that time and have always been the same.  While the majority of police officers are honest and law abiding, 'Training Day' shows how one cop can do so much damage and that the crooked cop is worse than any criminal.  'Training Day' is designed to keep your stomach in knots from start to finish and features an Oscar calibre performance from Denzel Washington.  Ethan Hawke is the subject of Washington's training.  A veteran of the force, Washington takes Hawke in, trains him in the narcotics division of the LAPD and tries to justify criminal activity on the part of the police as a necessary part of nailing the bad guys and the film illustrates how corruption goes all the way to the top of the city's law enforcement officials.  'Training Day' has an exceptional look at street life with outstanding cinematography and editing and director Antoine Fuqua has crafted a film with exactly the right touch of violence and street smarts to match its intelligence and realistic look.  A brutally honest effort."
"gortx","Null","1","11","26 January 2002"," Great first half & performances/slips in end
","Denzel Washington performance has been dubbed Oscar-worthy since the film opened. It is that good. Will the Academy award him the Oscar for such a loathsome character? Probably not. TRAINING DAY opens extremely well. The first half is taut, well-written & directed, with the aforementioned top notch Washington performance. Hawke is fine for most of the film, although occasionally, he seems to be playing the ""rookie"" part a little too literally. One still has to believe that the character DID make it through the Police Academy and 19 months on the sometimes very tough streets of the San Fernando Valley (believe me, they ain't all dotted with Starbucks!). Around the 2/3 mark however, I think the film makes a wrong turn and becomes the kind of pro-forma cop/action flick that pervades the ""action"" shelf at your local video store. Too bad, it could have said something more profound about the state of police work in modern day big cities (and no matter how ""farfetched"" you might think some of the events are, just keep in mind that the LAPD has had just these kinds of scandals). Worth seeing for Washington and a terrific first half, though."

","I had not heard much of this movie but the storyline, so my expectations weren't that high. But I have to say that I was really disappointed! About 70% of the movie all you saw was Denzel and Ethan sitting in the car talking, not much of an action movie. I am not kidding when I say the guy next to me was actually sleeping most of the time, and I was close to nodding off too. Ethan was not very believable as ""the tough cop"" in the end, but Denzel was quite good. The film would have been better without the loads of talking, I think people got the hang of the problem within the first 10 minutes of the movie. No need for all that talking. If they cut it all out the film would last about 15 minutes! A lot of ""stars"" was in it, but they didn't really have much to give or say...the director could have made it more interesting if he had focused more on the environment than just the ""problem""."
"starlit-sky","8","1","11","17 December 2001"," An Excellent Cop/Action Movie
","Young police officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) tries to prove himself to a senior cop, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), to be admitted into his narcotic unit in LAPD in his first day. The whole story takes place in just one day but what a day that is! From the beginning to the end, they witness all kinds of criminal events as they cruise down the back streets of Los Angeles. Jake is a straight arrow and completely honest, yet equally naïve. Throughout the day, he desperately tries to handle the situations he encounters in his own naïve way whereas Alonzo, who is much more experienced in the field, has completely different methods of resolving issues. As a result, they often disagree over how each situation should be handled and Jake realizes that his views are mostly in conflict with those of his senior officer. However, since his objective is to get into narcotics department and since the only way is to impress Alonzo, Jake obeys Alonzo's orders. After all, Alonzo is the expert in the field so he should know better.<br/><br/>
The best thing about the movie is that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end about the actual morality of Alonzo. Is he really a corrupt police officer as inexperienced Jake suspects him to be or are his ways really how things are handled in the narcotics department of LAPD? Neither the audience nor Jake really knows the answer to that question for it is Jake's (and also our) first day in that field. Who are we or who is Jake to judge Alonzo's morality who spent many years in this field? Can we really say for sure that his methods are not practised in reality? After every argument, when Jake tries to rest his case, Alonzo comes back with a stronger argument and convinces him that his methods are the best. Of course, you don't know the answers to these questions until the end unless you haven't read the complete plotline. I honestly think whoever is responsible with the publicity of this movie doesn't know anything about the art of movie making. The same goes for the person who is responsible with the plotline which gives away everything about the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DO NOT READ ANY reviews (especially the plotline in the ""Main Details"" page) which give away the whole story. <br/><br/>Possible Oscar Nominations: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both deserve Oscar nominations (Best Leading/Supporting Actor) for their excellent performances. Antoine Fuqua has done a very nice job as a director by capturing the ambience on the streets and with his depiction of criminals' lives, especially of those in the black neighbourhood. Each scene is nicely done and the suspense is so authentic. I was especially impressed by the tension in the scene where Jake sits down at the poker table with the guys waiting for Alonzo to come back. You can find a similar tension maybe in a horror movie.<br/><br/>What I didn't like (***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***): I didn't like the publicity of this movie where Denzel Washington was openly declared to portray a corrupted cop which probably is the biggest movie spoiler that I have ever encountered in my life. The best part of the movie is the puzzle it creates over Alonzo's real character because it is not possible for the audience to decide whether or not issues are handled in Alonzo's ways in special narcotic division. Given his real character away is to kill the joy of the entire movie. Even at the end of their day, during their conversation in the car, Alonzo's explanation is very convincing and makes perfect sense. Only thing I didn't like about the movie itself is the scene where Jake jumps from the terrace of the building to the Alonzo's car after beaten up pretty badly. This scene was not realistic."

If the world is or might become really like this, especially in my town, well, we'd be in big trouble.<br/><br/>Bad, vigilante cop movies aren't rare.

","I saw the trailer for Training Day last June and put it at the top of my must-see list for the Fall.  Well, it's been in theaters for over a month now and I just got around to seeing it yesterday.  What the hell took me so long?  Anyway,  I'm sure that most everyone bothering to read this knows the basic plot of this brilliant action movie (a rare breed) but I'm gonna do a quick rundown without spoiling anything.  <br/><br/>Rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is starting his first day on the job with leather-clad, veteran, city-reknowned all around badass Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).  Things start off uneasy and the director does one hell of a job at making you feel the rookie's nervousness.  In fact, you're sitting there wondering why in the hell this baby-faced nice guy wants to be a narc so bad.  It's really simple;  he wants to protect and serve and be one of the good guys.  That's all.  Needless to say, throughout the course of the day, Mr. Hoyt may very well decide that being a narc just isn't his cup of tea.  But things aren't going to be that simple.<br/><br/>You see, Hoyt is about to get way more than he bargained for.  Alonzo Harris is one badass, crooked, filthy and downright mean guy, but yet he has an irresistable charm that makes you want to like him. Through him, we learn along with Hoyt, that everything he previously learned about being a cop is wrong and ""to catch the wolf, you must become the wolf"".  This is one of those parts that I SWEAR had to have been written with just one actor in mind.  I say this because I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled the part off, except maybe for Samuel L. Jackson.  <br/><br/>This is, in my mind, the best and most challenging role that Ethan Hawke has ever played.  He does a damn fine job at showing all the right emotions and the transformation from vulnerable do-gooder, to hardened-vet over the course of 24 hours (!) is made wholly believable.  <br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays TOTALLY against type and gives one hell of a knockout performance as the ruthless badass who may have once been a good cop.  (I know I keep using that word a lot to describe him, just see the movie.)  I really loved the wolf-metaphor that he kept using it was perfect. <br/><br/>I give Training Day A perfect 10 here and I will be getting the DVD.  Let's see Mr. Washington in more roles like this.  One more thing. I was really glad to see Scott Glenn.  He's highly underrated."
"the apostate critic","Null","1","11","11 November 2001"," iron will vs. iron fist
","I would have thought that every possible angle on the good cop/bad cop treatment had been exhausted.  I would have thought Denzel conquered all the risky roles early in his career, opting now for more subdued, sympathetic, and audience-friendly characters like those in `Remember the Titans' and the inappropriately named `The Hurricane'.  I would have thought that Ethan Hawke had an open clause in his contract about never appearing without facial hair.<br/><br/>But Antoine Fuqua's gritty and sobering `Training Day' breaks all the rules. Having developed his craft early on directing music videos and television commercials, he emerged boldly into the box office limelight in 1998 with `Replacement Killers' and then fizzled with last years' disappointing and forgettable Jamie Foxx action yawn `Bait'.  He returns this fall, taking the reigns of a virile and invigorating script by David Ayer, a young writer whose career is still in it's infancy but is already well-established in testosterone-wielding fun with last years `U-571' and Universal Studios summer paycheck `The Fast and the Furious' ($144M at last count).<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke birthed his reputation as the quintessential slacker, apparently living in a world where combs, razors, and clothes that fit are luxury items.  Dissolving the typecast, he stars (though less brightly than Denzel) as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic straight-edge officer on his first day in a covert narcotics unit headed up by Denzel's Alonzo Harris.  Hawke's character quickly learns that his initiation into the squad is a one-way street, and he has one day to iron out the ethics of either turning dirty or fighting dirty.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington, as the bad-ass deep-undercover corrupt cop, revamps the powerfully watchful and angrily militant guise that he first debuted in `Malcolm X', extending something remarkably spiritual and endearing to the prospect of a police officer playing vigilante or dipping into confiscated drug money.  He maintains the sanctimony and passive aggression that built his career, this time laced with the Tourette's-induced, crazed paranoia that first surfaced in his cop-over-the-edge in `Richochet'.  His role here makes you forget that he previously lent his eponymous notoriety to such self-gratifying box-office fodder as `The Bone Collector' or `Virtuosity' and makes you remember that he once took center stage at the Academy Awards (Best Actor 1989, `Glory').<br/><br/>This movie also contains notable cameos from Macy Gray and Dr. Dre, the former displaying the most impractical, keyboard-frightening manicure to grace the big screen since Lon Chaney's Wolfman, and the latter serving up the irony as an L.A. police officer (for more information, see N.W.A.'s 1988 release `F*** the Police').  Snoop Doggy Dogg also had a small but all-too-believable part as a junkie, despite a hectic schedule starring in four releases this year, as well as any movie from the last three years with misspelled titles.  See `Hot Boyz' (1999) or `Tha Eastsidaz' (2000).<br/><br/>At first, the mood leans toward that of philosophical street-smart police discipline, but eventually vents it's energy in the struggle between the main characters, with each pushing the other to unrehearsed limits.  The ending feels somewhat like the beginning of a saga - the two battle to a completion that seems eternally incomplete, as the hero and villain confound one another's personalities and seem naturally entwined.  This is a must-see for Denzel fans, and a potent oak-hearted battle of wits, might, and morality that can be appreciated by anyone who thinks that society still has much evolving to do.  Good movie."

","After watching all the special features on the DVD, I gained a better appreciation for this film. Both the director and the writer are ""graduates"" of project areas in the USA (Director: Pittsburgh, Writer: LA). The cast and crew spent a lot of time researching both the gang situation in east-central LA and the lives of undercover narcs. The film was pre-screened to gang members and the police to ensure its authenticity. <br/><br/>This is a gritty, not pretty film. It has not been hollywoodized to appeal to the masses. It doesn't have a happy ending, the good guys don't always win...much like real life. The movie projects a definite shade of gray, so please don't look for black hats and white hats. For Ethan Hawke's character, it is his journey into the Heart of Darkness, with Denzel Washington, as his Kurtz.<br/><br/>For those who complain that Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best Actor; perhaps you should ask yourselves why he was not nominated for Malcolm X, and why he failed to win for The Hurricane. You may find a answer to that question, if you choose to view Training Day."

Most viewers aren't used to seeing him in bad guy roles where he's the one everyone's rooting against. He pulls off the performance amazingly, and when I watched the film I was just shocked.<br/><br/>Not only was Denzel's performance great Ethan Hawke's character Officer Hoyt was also well written. Ethan and Denzel had a kind of chemistry during the shooting of the film that was just excellent.

","I'm amazed to see so many comments here, based purely on moral opinions and disliking of street language. Maybe those commentators should ask themselves why they see a movie? Just to hear words that no one in the real world is speaking? First look at the performances, which are great, not only by Denzel, but by Ethan Hawke too. Movies are not made to be judged morally, they should be judged on their artistic qualities. And the films' qualities are evident: good acting, unexpected plot turns and impressive camera-work, half the movie being filmed from inside the black Monte Carlo. It bears thriller and action components, which are both believable and do not stand in the way. It's enough to convince me."

","If you are a cynic and desperately need to find a movie that will confirm your cynicism, then this is the movie for you. This movie offers a frank and graphic portrayal of a corrupt police officer. The police officer in question, played magnificently by Denzel Washington, is both a terrifying and pathetic character because he is a man who projects a facade of strength which is a caricature of the social misfits who abound in his universe. For the Denzel Washington character, rules of ethical conduct are utterly meaningless and are to be ridiculed and ignored. The problem with this movie is that it glorifies the corrupt cop who is portrayed as being tough and all-knowing when in fact his thinking and perceptions are completely distorted. Accordingly, his behavior becomes maladaptive and can lead only to disaster. As a result, he is ruined, both as a police officer and a man. Sad."

","Wow. That was the feeling at the end of watching this film. I was greatly pleased after seeing it. It was a very easy movie to watch; the dialog went smooth and fast, the clips of gangsta rap and mood of the music was spot-on, and the acting was as bombastic as the characters were written. Also the directing by Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Tears of the sun...after Training Day) couldn't have been more brilliant and full of visual changes for the audience.<br/><br/>Basically, Ethan Hawke plays a new NARC on the beat. He doesn't know what to expect out of Denzel Washington's character except that he is his trainer and an experienced detective. Denzel meticulously plans his real-life curriculum for Hawke to learn, and since Denzel's character is known in the surrounding neighborhoods as a detective who cuts deals with potential rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, he pushes buttons all throughout the neighborhood, brandishing Hawke as his protegé. When Hawke continues to see shady deal after shady deal, he begins to suspect that Washington is up to something but cannot place what it is. It comes down to the end when Hawke must choose what he was taught in the ethics training of the other policemen or what Denzel's character allows him to get away with on the street.<br/><br/>There is not enough praise to give the actors and actresses, including Eva Mendes as Washington's girlfriend stuck in the ghetto with her son. I'm not particularly fond of Ethan Hawke in the action roles (to me, he looks kind of fake and unbelievable), but in this movie, there seems to be plenty going on to forget this small mirage. And Denzel was spectacular; he had this character down pact. He loves playing the same types of roles, but this one was almost written for him because of the delivery and positioning that he displays every time the camera is on him.<br/><br/>The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre appearances didn't need to be there, but there's no doubt about the power of being the director's friends. Snoop was better than Dre, I think, mainly because he was given more of a character to portray (while placed in a wheelchair of all things for the most notable cool-cat in rapping business). But other than their puzzling cameos, the movie does great to entertain and keep you guessing every bit of the way.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7/10 because it doesn't have the look about a classic film and to constantly watch it, it would get tedious, but the feel and look of the whole thing keeps you entertained for a few watches. It's worth the buy, but rent it first to get a deeper story to see if it's your type of action/cop drama movie."

Before, it's just like hey, let's go here and beat this rapist, then this druggie, etc. This movie is the type of film that I would typically abhor to see because the script in my opinion was too redundant at times.<br/><br/>If anything saved this film, it was the casting. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke gave the best possible performances in this otherwise crappy film. They fit their characters' roles perfectly and you can see it in their eyes. <br/><br/>I am wondering why Ethan Hawke wasn't nominated for Best Actor along with Denzel Washington, instead of Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as I think Hoyt is also a main character. Nevertheless, this acting duo is what has made a film with a horrible script viewable, because Training Day is the worst script with the best possible actors. This is definitely shown because Training Day had two Oscar nominations, for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, and nothing else. Denzel Washington of course won the movie's only Oscar, but I don't know if this was his best performance ever. Nevertheless, Washington deserved the Oscar in 2001, and he is finally recognized as one of THE premier actors in Hollywood."
"s0308080","Null","1","12","5 May 2004"," Training Day Review
","'One of the best thrillers from Hollywood in many a year'. A comment from the Daily Express which is stated on the back of the Training Day DVD box. This comment is not far from the truth. This 2001 thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua and staring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, provides a fast paced, action packed, twist occurring experience. Jack Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is a (white) rookie LA cop who is on his first day of training to become a narcotics officer. He is teemed up with veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) whose task is to put Jack through tests which will either make or break him. Jack begins to get suspicious about Alonzo's attitude towards crime and it soon becomes clear that Alonzo is in fact a rogue cop. Once jack is confident that this in fact, is the case, he goes about standing up to Alonzo and tries to counter his misdealing. Washington pulls off the dodgy underground cop brilliantly so much so that he was awarded an academy award for best actor in 2001. His acting in a way has the same effect on the audience as it does on Jack, you can't help trusting him when you really know you shouldn't. His performance really does suck the audience in. Hawke plays the naïve rookie white boy cop in a way that compliments with Washington. You cant help but feel sorry for Jake who has been put in the middle of this street gang warfare. The totally different styles and attitudes of the two characters help to create a good versus evil tone to the film. On more than a few occasions, we are treated to fast moving scenes of gunfire and general violence which helps push the story along with great ease. There is never really a dull moment in the film and the gradual increase of suspense helps keep audience attention. In my opinion this would have to be one of the best films I have seen. The fact that Washington's character is so unpredictable, means that you are always trying to suss him out, which then has the effect of holding your attention and almost includes you in the storyline. The plot is not straight forward either. We are treated to a twist in the story which makes us re-evaluate the film. It makes you want to watch the film again so as to fully understand the story. I think that any film that makes the viewer want to see it again is a success in its own right. If you are wanting a straight forward, easy watching film, then Training Day is not for you. If however, you want a fast paced, twisting action movie, this is a must watch. Another Quote taken from the DVD box sums this film up: Training Day is a gritty, tough and realistic cop thriller, which will have you gripped from start to finish."
"cedrickroberts","10","1","12","24 March 2004"," Tremendous Acting!!!!!!!
","Is this really the way things are?  Does it have to be like this?  These were some of the questions that I asked myself as Alonzo (played by Denzel Washington) explained his brutally harsh behavior to his young drug-unit recruit, Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke).  What a wonderful performance by Mr. Washington.  He has been truly intense in many other movies but I personally feel that he stepped it up a notch while playing this character.  I thoroughly believed that Denzel was Alonzo.  This feat, not to be confused with great storyline, developement of characters, and other movie characteristics, is not acheived by all actors.  Robert Dinero, Al Pacino, and a few of the other great actors have at least displayed this skill once or twice in their careers.   If you can understand the difference between overly-hyped Tom Cruise and the actors that I have listed, then we see eye to eye. The intensity with which Denzel delivered his lines in this movie makes it a must see for any inspiring actor that wants to one day be a leading man. As Ethan Hawke stated on David Letterman, Denzel Washington is one of the best leading men in Hollywood, and I personally concur.  Highly recommended for serious crime-drama fans.  Watch language for young children though."

"Anonymous_Maxine","7","1","12","31 January 2003"," Amazing performances, great action, good film, but it should have been better.
","There are a few actors in Hollywood that create a huge stir of interest and gossip anytime they come out with a new film. Tom Hanks is probably the biggest of these actors, but this group also includes tremendously talented actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, and of course, Denzel Washington. All of this almost automatic hype is not, however, entirely accurate at all times, and Training Day is a prime example of this. Now before you click on my name above so you can send me some hate mail, I should just point out that I am not pretending that Training Day is a bad movie, I am just saying that there are a lot of things in it that should have been done differently or not at all. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the part of the scary Detective Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke plays Officer Jake Hoyt, a new white officer on the force who is to learn the ways of being a tough cop from Harris. The most powerful part of the film is, of course, Denzel's performance as the hardened narcotics officer in Los Angeles, and the interaction that he has with the inexperienced Hoyt, who really only wants to get a nice promotion so he can provide a better life for his wife and kid. Harris has a way of doing his job that really makes it interesting, he's not just a guy running around arresting guys who sell drugs or are doing drugs, he plays his job almost like a chess game.<br/><br/>One of the more surprising examples of this is the way that he forces Hoyt to smoke PCP laced marijuana as one of his first lessons, explaining to the incredulous Hoyt that if he were to turn down a similar gift out on the streets, he's be dead. No further explanation is given, and none is needed. Harris knows that he has to be intimidating on the streets or he'll get killed, and he knows that he has to be as familiar as humanly possible with the very thing that he's trying to stop. These people are his people, but he's on the other side of the law.<br/><br/>There is an interesting way that the movie explores the possibility that many of that civil laws that police officers must follow only hinder the true delivery of justice and their efforts to stop crime, because Harris is an officer that pursues the bad guys in any way necessary, whether legally or not, and he looks much deeper into the situations than just getting the guys in cuffs in the back of his car. The scene where they see the two guys trying to rape a woman on the streets comes to mind. Hoyt is ready to throw these guys in the car, take them downtown, and throw them in jail, case closed. They witnessed the crime, it was that easy. Instead, Harris beats them both stupid and lets them go right in front of the astonished eyes of Hoyt, inspiring the famous line, `Let the animals weed themselves out.' God willing.<br/><br/>The real problem that I have with this movie is that, for one thing, it is entirely too violent in places where it doesn't need to be. One of the things that I hate to hear the most in a review of an action movie is that it's too violent, just because it sounds so much like something my grandmother would say, but take, for example, the scene where Harris and Hoyt are fighting each other hand to hand. This scene is excruciatingly violent, but the only problem that I have with it is that it should have been maybe a third of the length that it was. MAYBE. I am a serious fan of good bloody, violent movies, I even enjoy Steven Seagal films and Van Damme films, but even in the most hardcore action films and for the most die hard action fan, there comes a point where you think, `Okay, I GET it.' Training Day either does not believe that this point exists, or doesn't know where it is. <br/><br/>Besides that, I know that this is an aberrant role for Denzel Washington, who does not very often play villains, but even as the character that he played in Training Day, there are certain things that you simply can't do to an actor like him, and gunning him down Godfather-style by a whole row of machine guns is one of them. No matter how bad the guy is that he's portraying, you just can't do things like that to him, the man's LOVED! I am not usually one to complaing about issues of violence like this, but there is a place in the movies for excessive violence, and it is in Van Damme films and Seagal films, not in movies like this. Training Day had entirely too many real world connections to be dumbed down be excesses like that, and if these things had been reduced to a more realistic level at least slightly, the quality of the film would have increased enormously. Just a little change could have done a lot of good."

","I personally have to say that Antoine Fuqua is an outstanding director. This is the better of the two ""action"" films I have seen (The Replacement Killers is the other). He has a great eye for film when it comes to directing and even his music videos are entertaining.<br/><br/>This film caught me off guard. As I'm sure many other people than I have felt going to see it, I thought it would be horrible. When the first 10 minutes or so went by, I could tell it would AT LEAST be entertaining. When the story began to unfold, I was actually into the movie.<br/><br/>
The character development in this movie is great. Denzel Washington played a great anti-hero and I would not be surprised if he won some awards for his performance. Ethan Hawke also played an immensely convincing role.<br/><br/>
The director, perhaps, was the best part of the movie. Fuqua has a magnificent eye for setting up scenes. The drug hallucination part was a brilliant way of showing it.<br/><br/>I gave this film 8/10! If you have a chance and you like action and good plots, GO SEE IT!"

","Training Day is a bold and amazing experience. This film goes beyond painting the picture of a bad day as an undercover cop; it draws you into a world that is both frightening and intriguing. Denzel is perfectly cast. He does not just make this role better, he makes it possible. The fact that most of us can not conceive of disliking Denzel Washington is precisely what makes Alonzo Harris ( his character ) compelling. The evil of this crooked ""wolf"" is so plausibly wrapped in charm and humanity, that the decision to dislike him is painful. Denzel causes us to empathize with Hoyt's ( Ethan Hawke's ) gut wrenching dilemma - the audience is forced into the same, brutal indecision. Hawke skillfully plays his part, and is totally believable. I could identify with his character in every hesitation, and each surrender. All in all, a brilliant film.

Washington plays a great bad good guy. In Glory, he plays a racist black soldier for the Union, who eventually comes around and loses his prejudice. In Training Day, he plays nearly the same role, a disillusioned cop who makes the system and his role as an undercover narcotics cop work in his favor. However, in Training Day, he does not come to his senses. The contrast and conflict between Hawke and Washington is stellar, and the action and suspense is unbelievable. This is a must see for anyone who likes cop/military action movies. Don't miss it."

","Denzel Washington plays against type effectively--he's evil--but in the end this is just another in Warner Brothers' long-standing tradition of earnest socially conscious dramas; the problem is that rather than addressing social ills, it just ends up patronizing its target audience, namely urban minority moviegoers, by delivering the notion, through a series of absurd coincidences, that street justice is more effective than law enforcement. Washington is relaxed and entertaining as a corrupt undercover cop who shows his new partner (Ethan Hawke, way out of his league) the ropes in south central L.A. but he plays into the conceits set up by screenwriter David Ayer (he wrote the slick `The Fast And The Furious') and in the end Washington's in cahoots with the film's stodgy finger-wagging, becoming little more than a stick figure. The director is the talented Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') but this time he's reined in his talent for flashy color-driven visuals for the usual cloudy, bleached-out images we've come to expect when the subject is down-and-dirty L.A. Special note should be made of the cameo of singer/songwriter Macy Gray: she makes the most of her brief appearance, using unsteady hand movements and a fair amount of sass to create a vivid portrayal of a woman who knows she's being used by the police and who has no compunction about letting her feelings show--she has the best moment in the film and you end up wanting more."

Formula, formula, formula!  (At least in most blaxploitation movies, the hero gets to be black!)<br/><br/>Fantastic performances and a high budget help it to stand above other films in the genre.

"tfrizzell","Null","1","12","1 April 2002"," Denzel Washington's Oscar-Winning Turn Saves the Day Here.
","""Training Day"" is an intense cop flick that tries to show the mean streets of Los Angeles through the eyes of a young cadet wanting to be a detective (Ethan Hawke in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance). Of all the cops to have a day with, Hawke gets to ride with the fiery and out-of-control Denzel Washington (in an electric Oscar-winning turn). Washington is a rogue cop who runs everything everywhere he goes. However, Washington has a hidden secret that could cost him his life by the end of the day. The film could best be described as ""The Los Angeles Connection"" (ala ""The French Connection"" 30 years ago) and Denzel Washington makes Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman in ""The French Connection"") look like an eagle scout. Washington dominates the action and is the much-needed ""fire"" in ""Training Day"". On the opposite side of the coin is the equally riveting Ethan Hawke who acts as the ""ice"" to counter-act Washington's heat. Hawke is trapped in a situation where he sees all, but what can he really do about what is happening around him? Overall the film is a near-miss and really should have been a pure mess. Denzel Washington finally got a role where he could do what he wanted and more than anything ""Training Day"" is just an exhibition for Washington's out-of-this-world talents. With that said this is not Washington's greatest performance (I am partial to ""The Hurricane"" myself). Washington has made himself great by playing somewhat quiet and sympathetic characters and this role is the exact polar opposite of that. Ethan Hawke is super and this film truly put him into a higher class of actors. The research of this film is pretty impressive as the film-makers shot in real rough neighborhoods in Los Angeles and many real-life gang-bangers and thugs are prevalent throughout the film. Cameos by musical superstars Macy Gray, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really some of the strongest scenes as all three do fine jobs in limited screen-time. Too many coincidences, a somewhat ridiculous confrontation between Washington and Hawke near the end and Washington's side-story are the main things I found a bit out-there. But in the end the film served its purpose: getting Washington the Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5."

Going into this movie I had expectations (another bad habit I have) of seeing a ""best picture nomination, and best supporting for Ethan Hawke.""  Not too smart of me.  Hawke's performance was good, but nothing close to oscar caliber.  If there are going to be any oscar nods for this movie (a far shot) would be for Denzel as best actor.

"nqure","6","1","12","3 February 2002"," Trite ending mars a film with an interesting theme
","Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting. <br/><br/>The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, & the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film  loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes & dialogue where Alonzo & Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves & sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.<br/><br/>Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good & evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself & question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!<br/><br/>The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.<br/><br/>An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down."

Ethan Hawk plays the new guy who is all dreams and ideals, Denzel Washington plays the hardened street cop who is all realism and street vibes. If he were retiring in a week the cliché would be complete.<br/><br/>We learn very early on that the only way to police the street is to become the street. Essentially by being less of a cop, and more like a teacher to the hoods and gangsters. While you may take them out for selling drugs to kids, stealing from the rich to feed you family is ok. Why break up a rape in progress when all you are going to get is a lot of paper work at the end of the day? Slowly Washington removes hawks' ideals, breaking him down to be one of the team. This starts with hawk being tricked into smoking a PCP laced joint, which inevitably leads him on a downwards spiral as things get more and more surreal throughout the day.<br/><br/>The story is nothing particularly new. There is the buddy element, the cop turned crook element and the will he/won't he element of doing the right thing. The script has already dictated who should come out on top by navigating your sympathies in the direction of Hawk's plight. Hawk himself carries himself very well in what is essentially a stock role picked from the Hollywood book of stock roles. And if you turned to the next page you would see Denzel Washington's character. Washington was very good in the role, but it was certainly no Oscar performance.

I mean Harris has only known his partner for a few hours at the most while the other cops don`t know him at all so why would they trust Hoyt to keep his mouth shut ? I guess that`s to show how evil Harris is and how morally upstanding Hoyt is at the climax , another bit I found faintly ridiculous . I mean if you`re a home boy would you side with a corrupt black cop who`d let you walk away from a crime if the price was right or would you side with an untouchable white cop who will see justice done at any price ? Yeah that`s what I thought too . <br/><br/>I don`t want anyone picking me up wrong thinking I hate this film because I don`t , it`s very well acted by all the cast and even after the plot twist halfway through it still held my attention , especially when Hoyt is in the latinos` house . It`s just that it seemed the studio decided to treat the audience as fools at the last moment which is a common fault with Hollywood movies for the last few years . I was going to give TRAINING DAY 9 out of ten up untill the halfway point , so overall the movie gets 7 out of 10<br/><br/>
Seeing as everyone else has brought up the subject of who deserved the oscar I will say some days I think Washington deserved it while some days I think Crowe deserved it , but 2001 wasn`t a vintage year for performances and if the Oscar voters had put Jim Broadbent in the best actor category he would have deserved to have won it for IRIS"

The range of this actor and his ability to change his character portrayals is no doubt why he is so much in demand. You would be hard pressed to find two more diverse performances than those he has recently given as the decent, hard working family man John Q and his portrayal of a rogue cop in Training Day.<br/><br/>There are a few good, solid cameo performances here, ostensibly by  Scott Glenn. Harris Yulin plays yet another bad guy role but I must admit that I have always found him totally compelling on screen. Tom Berenger on the other hand is wasted in his bit part.

Alonzo used the humanity rules he understood to pyramid the justification of attacking poison with poison, and used the means of walking on the edge of the law to express the greed of humanity so ""reasonable and reasonable"". It should be said that this is mainly due to the male director Denzel Washington's three-pointed, incisive acting, absolute film-level performance."

"ferni-tierni","10","0","1","20 April 2020"," Best Crooked Cop Performance I've seen thus far.
","Training Day is a fast paced maniacal, dirty, crude whirlwind that will leave you reflecting on how you would deal with the ambushes and immorality that Hoyt faced. Are you a wolf or are you a shepherd? Only a wolf can catch wolves. Alonzo's philosophy justified many of the actions he made, but clearly understood the type of person that he was and what he had become. We never knew if Alonzo actually was a good cop at the beginning of his career, but his personality is so crass, vulgar, and duplicitous one can only conclude that he was the crooked cop all along.<br/><br/>Ethan as Hoyt gives a good performance as the rookie cop that is hopeful and morally driven. We get some slight instances of character development at the beginning of the movie that solidified his character, but he was largely able to carry himself the persona of authenticity and naivety that was needed for that role. He was continually manipulated by Alonzo and walked the fine line between being submissive and not being weak, excellently. The gestures offered by the movie were brilliant. Hoyt fought and restrained two homeless people that were attempting to rape a teenager, stark contrast to Alonzo just watching and then releasing them after giving them a severe and savage ""street"" lesson. We were reminded repeatedly the temperament and value structure of both Alonzo and Hoyt.<br/><br/>The street smart is a recurrent theme in the movie. It was clear at the onset that Hoyt had to forget everything he heard in the academy and adapt to Alonzo's philosophy to be able to survive. I would say that the ability to connect with people on the streets gave Alonzo some needed advantage to be able to infiltrate the circles that he needed to police, but the clear issue was to not transform into those criminals, but, as he mentioned, he needed to become a wolf like them to be able to catch them. The fascinating part about this movie is the complexity and ruthlessness that the streets conditions are displayed for people that want to make a meaningful change. A clear quandary is presented to the viewer where we are invited to reflect on complex and innovative ways to understand the sadist, vicious, uncertain dynamics of the streets.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the message sent by the movie is that corrupt cops will eventually get punished for their decisions. Alonzo was playing too many people and ended having no people he could trust or depend on. Hoyt was saved by the sole just action that he did the entire day, providential or maybe unlikely, but the movie teaches us that if anyone aims to construct any change, it cannot be done by a single person, and no one will trust to take that path with you if you continue being duplicitous."

","I'd been aware of Training Day since I was around 15 but finally 3 years later I've got round to watching it and it's fair to say my expectations were matched. I've seen others of Fuqua's filmography and the likes of Southpaw were extremely entertaining and it seems he's had a long career of hits. Back to Training Day this is a masterpiece, straight from the get go you can relate to/empathise with Hawke's Jake Hoyt and he feels like a well defined and crystal clear character from the very first second, not a doubt in anyone's minds he's the hero of the film. A story of corruption is naturally interesting and I must say the performance by Washington deserves all the praise it gets as he falls into the group of villains which you truly despise, testament to his performance and the quality of the writing/directing. Baring some parallels finally to Se7en the grim depiction of the criminal underworld is full of life and looks realistic and dingy. As the titular 'Training Day' ensues and develops with Hoyt dragged into the shady dealings of Alonzo the tension ramps up and the stand off occurs, feeling organic and natural the division of our protagonists is understandable and feels genuine leading to the neighbourhood shootout and chase between the two leads, at times a little far fetched it's still gritty and heart pounding, concluding with Washington's iconic monologue and his exile from the neighbourhood. Boasting a cast of notable faces such as Cliff Curtis and Eva Mendez as well as a couple of celebrity cameos from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg who aren't actually bad actors this is a masterclass in conflict, tension and character, a true great of cinema"

"mkm-hermanjnr","8","0","1","7 April 2019"," A solid crime movie with a great villain
","Training Day is a 2001 cop drama/thriller starring Denzel Washington as veteran Narcotics cop Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt, an LAPD newbie auditioning himself to Alonzo for a job on the Narc Squad.<br/><br/>The film's most immediately obvious strength lies in the personal, documentary-esque way we follow the two officers throughout their day. We start with a mundane breakfast scene in a roadside cafe to introduce us to the characters and their eccentricities, transition to Alonzo's car and from there we ride along with the characters on the whole seedy and sordid affair.<br/><br/>Hoyt acts almost as an audience surrogate, reacting to Alonzo's antics with confusion, admiration and alarm. Ethan Hawke does a great job of conveying a rookie cop's naivety yet combines this with strong morals and sense of honour and duty that makes his character likable.<br/><br/>Washington steals the show, however, with his portrayal of Harris. Alonzo is a character who mutates constantly throughout the movie. Washington flicks effortlessly between being charming, cold, amusing, intimidating, sinister and friendly. Harris is just as at home smiling warmly at you as he is blowing you away with a shotgun - and when he decides to pull that trigger, he's already worked out exactly how it's all going to play out in court afterwards.<br/><br/>I'd say keeping Alonzo's nature ambiguous until the very end of the movie is another strength of the tight script. Just like Hoyt, we are never 100% sure whether Alonzo is merely a maverick or a flat out corrupt scumbag right until he crosses a very specific moral line (the murder of Roger for money). Even then, Washington's acting is so good Alonzo almost makes the killing seem reasonable!<br/><br/>The movie has a brain to it, and features several things that really stand out on repeat viewing. In particular, the scene in which Harris is smiling and laughing on his phone and says ""Make sure you clean the tub out after..."". He then shares a seemingly heartfelt conversation with Jake, making that line particularly chilling once you have seen the movie once and understand what the phone call was referring to...!<br/><br/>Weaknesses of the film precluding it from a 9 or 10 star rating from me include a somewhat limp ending and some extraordinary coincidences.<br/><br/>At one point Jake's life is saved because it turns out that a girl he prevented a sexual assault on earlier in the day is the niece of a gangster about to kill him. This seems like a big long shot. Since the guy is the head of a large gang, it would have perhaps made more sense to make the girl the sister of one of his gang members or something. Those odds would at least seem a little less ridiculous.<br/><br/>As for the ending; after a brilliant performance, Washington's character is gunned down with almost no fanfare by a bunch of oft-mentioned-but-never-seen Russian gangsters. It's not a terrible idea and is fairly satisfying, but I think it would have been better to simply have Harris murdered outside his girlfriend's house by the gangs during the standoff with Hoyt. It would have really highlighted how he was no different (even worse in fact) than the criminals he was manipulating. It would have also added an interesting angle regarding whether Jake would have kept quiet on the murder or not, showing that maybe in a way he ""learned"" to bend the rules from Alonzo.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite these minor flaws the film as a whole is well acted, well written and enjoyable to watch or re-watch. 8/10."

How many times can Ese, Holmes, Homies, vato, and then another ten more Ese's be really that necessary. This was suppose to be a serious movie? hmmm. Not even close.<br/><br/>The idea of this movie was interesting but terribly done. One dimensional boring or unlikeable characters and violence, cussing, and a few ""gangster"" scenes. There are much better movies of this genre thats thought provoking and doesn't come off cheesy and unrealistic. I highly recommend HARSH TIMES. Its not a good coop bad cop movie but its a very well done film about two friends who are the opposite when they grow into men and have different goals and problems. Christian Bale is outstanding in it too and unlike training day, harsh times has real gut emotions and believable scenes. Also even the unlikeable character has some depth and humanity and we get to see different sides to them unlike Training day where alonzo was awful from start to finish just a bad guy no real relatable traits. I give Training Day a 4/10. Denzel and ethan are amazing actors but i thought the script was bad and made no sense. The story is moronic and the characters are caricatures. Stinker.

","""Training Day"" is an action thriller, but that is not the end of the story, because it is much more than that. Before I elaborate further, first of all let me highlight the fact that this movie features stellar performances by Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. These two actors take the viewers on a journey that entertains and thrills, shocks and mesmerizes, and it will feel very real.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, ""Training Day"" is an action thriller, but it is an excellent one. The reasons that it feels very real is because we all know that a certain level of corruption exists in cop work, that seems unavoidable at times, due to certain reasons. I said reasons, therefore, I would like to mention that it also feels realistic because of Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington ' s genuinely outstanding, mind-blowing performances.<br/><br/>Hawke plays a rookie cop who is being ""trained"" by a senior cop that Washington enacts. As the movie progresses, viewers will realize that this is definitely no ordinary training day in the life of a rookie cop ; there is definitely a mystery behind the action and procedures that Washington is instructing Hawke to do. The movie is full of surprises and excitement, suspense and mystery, and ""garnished"" with good action sequences. David Ayer has written an excellent cop-thriller story, and director Antoine Fuqua has presented it on-screen brilliantly, and almost flawlessly. ""Training Day"" will always be remembered as one of the best cop-action / crime thrillers ever made in the history of cinema."

"grantbullert","7","0","1","19 May 2018"," Intensely Dramatic Throughout, but a Weak Close
","""Training Day"" is a high energy film filled with difficult moral dilemmas. It delivers on drama, but doesn't deliver much meaning.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The pacing and drama is excellent and powerful in this film. The film is two hours, but it only feels an hour long. There are some nice callbacks that pay off pretty well. The story is set up wonderfully for an unforgettable ending. The disappointing thing is that the ending is truthfully quite forgettable. We leave the film feeling as if the final ten minutes were unplanned. Despite a weak ending, Antoine Fuqua commands an exhilarating story with absolute skill. Tension builds all throughout the film, and Fuqua gets the most out of his actors while having them do the least. The drama is in the story not the characters' actions, and Fuqua understands that. *Cinematography/Editing: The work of Mauro Fiore is greatly executed. He doesn't do more than he has to. This is a grim film about a hardened cop clashing against an eager rookie, not an artistic voyage of cinema. His understanding of what the story is about gives him incredible power in his visual storytelling. He doesn't get flashy, rather he presents the information to us in the way we need it. He makes excellent use of darkness and shadows contrasting with dim lights in tense scenes. The editing is mostly unnoticeable, which is what it is supposed to be in a film of this particular type. There are some well cut scenes of tension, especially towards the end. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue draws us further into the characters for most of the film. It is realistic and informal, but sometimes it seems as if the film tries too hard to be philosophical. Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington provide good performances. Hawke doesn't seem to have much range in this film, but his moments of calm are the most powerful of his performance in the film. Washington does enough to carry the story, but does not impress as much as he is capable of. *Music/Sound: These are among the weaker aspects of the film. The score is mediocre and does not do much to change the mood. The most intensely powerful scenes were typically without music. Other than a few queues the score hurt the film more than helped it. The sound was lackluster. There was not a dynamic range and it did not do enough to draw the audience into the world that Alonzo and Jake live in. *Production Design/Special Effects: The location, sets, and props were believable enough. They were not totally engrossing, but once again the film is all about the story so the production design is not as important. The special effects were passable. Some shots of people being punched or hit with items looked a bit weak. But it stayed real enough for us to stay invested in the story.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Training Day"" is a decent film that is sure to entertain and cause people to think about law enforcement. It may not have provided a clear path of what to think, but it did at least succeed in starting a conversation."
"soranamicooper","4","0","1","8 August 2017"," It's a thriller rather than a drama
","I watched it due to its high score and 'drama' billing, suggesting there would be something by way of character complexity. in fact, I found the lead role portrayed quite stereotypicalIy, lacking depth or dimension, and that's a problem when he's pretty ubiquitous. Did DW really get decorated for this? Some of the support roles are more convincingly played, lending a greater sense of motive for their actions, and perhaps more focus on their stories might have raised the interest level. Ultimately, it's a watchable but pretty anodyne and forgettable film that, despite the 'drama' billing, sheds little light on the human condition."

","While I always knew that Denzel is one of the very best screen actors of the modern age, it was a revelation to see what a great villain he could be. That said, he was still Denzel the charmer as Alonzo in Training Day. We even began to believe that he was redeemable after he shot the Scott Glenn character as he explaining that that sort of thing was a necessary evil. I was annoyed that Eva Mendes was nominated for an award for an appearance that lasted seconds over all. Also cameos from Snoop, Macy and Dr Dre were totally redundant and distracted this viewer. They really do not have the chops for parts like that. Ethan Hawke was terrific in this film too and was the perfect foil for Mr Washington.

","Training Day (2001): Dir: Antoine Faqua / Cast: Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Tom Bergenger, Harris Yulin: Action thriller about the faults in the justice system. Ethan Hawke prepares for his first day of training on the narcotics team with a meeting with Denzel Washington who plays by his own rules. He begins by forcing Hawke to smoke pot then Washington proceeds to dish out his own brand of justice on the guilty. Hawke can sense trouble as corrupt law caves in leading to an extremely violent climax. Director Antoine Faqua previously made Bait, which contained similar themes. It observes corrupt justice and plays out many scenes with uncertainty. Flawless performance by Washington who is of the law at first appearance before true nature emerges. This is a very different performance from him and that is what render this film viewable above the violence. What is interesting is his downfall right after he yells, ""I am the police. King Kong ain't got nothing on me!"" Hawke is superb as a cop wanting to do right but forced to comply with wrong. He will be placed in a difficult position in the third act. Unfortunately Scott Glenn and Tom Berenger appear in flat roles leaving only the two leads to carry the film.

"ElMaruecan82","7","0","3","24 July 2015"," Fantastic premise, but too much 'bad-Denzel' for the film's own good ...
","Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular ""Training Day"" of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, « Training Day » has been remembered ever since as the « Bad Guy Denzel Movie ».<br/><br/>Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.<br/><br/>Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.<br/><br/>The problem with « Training Day » is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. ""Training Day"" tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.<br/><br/>God, that whole first hour of « Training Day » is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.<br/><br/>You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural à la ""French Connection"", it ended like ""Scarface"". I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel."

","Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke star in this 2001 crime drama. This takes place in L.A. where we meet rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Hawke) who is about to be trained for 24 hours by narcotics detective, Alonzo Harris (Washington). When Harris shows Jake the ropes, Jake begins to question his methods and discovers he's a crooked cop into drugs & money. Jake lets Harris know that he's not going to become like him. Tom Berenger (Platoon), Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs), Peter Greene (Pulp Fiction) and Eva Mendes (Hitch) also appear. This is a good film, Washington and Hawke are great together and Washington plays a good villain. I recommend this."
"niqstar","7","0","1","12 January 2015"," Clash of Characters
","What looks like a classic cop/gangster scenario at first glance is much more fascinating when boiled down to the interactions of two very distinct character types. The hardened, loud-mouth, streetwise detective (Denzel Washington) against the quiet, nice-guy rookie, who seemingly has a lot to learn (Ethan Hawke). <br/><br/>I'm sure most, if not all, know the type of person that easily and consciously draws attention to themselves. Sometimes they are seen as obnoxious and loud, sometimes as lively and entertaining, but they are always at center stage. And weaker characters, be it due to personality traits, social standing or whatever other reason, are often swept away in the wake of such persons. The prolonged exposure to such a character and the struggle to overcome him is what elevates this movie beyond the standard fare of the genre. The other driving point is the old-fashioned standing up for what is right even against the odds, and while those two unfold nicely, the logical integrity of the actual story may become questionable at times. <br/><br/>The gritty portrayal of police work and the urban scenery strive to offer a good amount of realism and are indeed successful if one is able to look past the classic police thriller at the surface (and the display of questionable morals that could be too readily decried as wildly unrealistic). The acting and the technical aspects of the movie, as well as the good pacing, help to enable a good amount of immersion.<br/><br/>Overall Training Day is a solid movie whose merits lie beyond an entertaining storyline. It is definitely worth a watch, at the very least to relish Denzel's performance."

","""Training Day"" is Denzel Washington's master class in dominating a movie. He's compelling, explosive, magnetic, all of it. In the hands of someone less daring, Alonzo Harris could've been just a cardboard bad guy. But Washington handily makes the role his. He owns this movie. <br/><br/>And up until the pivotal scene with Scott Glenn, this movie is a kickass crime thriller. It's here (sadly) that things start falling apart. Til now, Ethan Hawke's internal struggle gives the movie its dramatic weight when Denzel's not on screen. But at this point, the movie's about a thug with a badge buying search warrants with stolen money, and the rookie being asked to shoot someone dead with no provocation. There's nothing left to the character of Alonzo Harris, seeing as he's just a criminal trying to buy his way out of a screwup with the Russian mob. All the b.s. he'd been spewing to Hawke is nothing. And everything from then on (Hawke's miraculous salvation from execution, ridiculous fistfight on rooftops, etc.) is just absurd. <br/><br/>The brilliant first half crime movie gives way to the typical contrivances of a David Ayer script. It's all still worth the watch just for Denzel Washington's riveting performance. It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't live up to that incredible talent.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Clockwork-Avacado","5","0","1","7 October 2013"," The Reality Paradox
","""Training Day"" is an intelligently produced police/corruption movie, which presents us with some very realistic, and very scary situations, showing us that in the big bad world, there are no laws, no rules - only the dictates of angry mobs, and guys with guns. And the environment of menace, and grimness is created expertly. <br/><br/>And yet, having appreciated this movie for what it is, I could never bring myself to watch it again. That's because, as good as the acting may be, it's very difficult to enjoy this film overall, not because of its' content, but because of its' approach to the subject matter. To be brutally honest, it compromises its' own integrity, in a way that superior ""realistic""dramas, like ""Taxi Driver"", and ""Get Carter"", would never dream of doing. All of which raises the main problem about the movie: something which I like to refer to as ""the reality paradox.""<br/><br/>Basically, it goes something like this: If a film presented a totally realistic account of street life, or police corruption, then it would not be an entertaining two hours of your life. Real life is devoid of dramatic incidents, of heroes and villains, and of moral boundaries, as well as of generally insightful dialogue. Therefore, to be ""realistic"", in that sense, means to be dramatically lacking. Realism is often attempted, but more often than not, the writers realise the need to spice things up with those old Hollywood clichés: in ""Training Day""'s case, there's car chases, a rooftop fight of ridiculous proportions, in which both Alonzo and Hoyt would definitely never walk away from, and a last half hour which totally dissolves the powerfully mature atmosphere which had been built up. That's why I cannot consider ""Training Day"" to be a realistic film, although it is peppered with insightful moments.<br/><br/>What it is, is a tour of a really nasty city, presented in an extremely threatening and scummy fashion. I cannot fault Denzel Washington's acting, and even Ethan Hawke (whom I rather dislike as an actor) gives a good account of himself. What I can fault, is the narrative of the movie itself. The world of ""Training Day"", IS believable. It is nasty, and unsanitised. But the story which the movie tells, is flawed considerably, because of its' self conscious theatricality, and rather perverse logic twists. Hawke would not have lasted nearly as long as he did in this neck of the woods. When he's about to get shot in the bath, I sincerely doubt that one lucky coincidence would stop three sinister nutcases from killing him, and it is at this point, that the movie starts to collapse. Hawke has been easily manipulated by Washington's cop all the way through, so his sudden desire to hunt him down seems ludicrous. To be fair, when Roger is killed, I'd find it equally hard to believe that the rest of the cops would not kill Hawke, in best ""Serpico"" fashion, even if Denzel wants to keep him alive as his master fall guy - which seems a touch Machievellian to be taken seriously. Hawke may be reluctant to kill in cold blood and smoke weed, but he doesn't seem principled enough to risk his neck to take down Alonzo, just to satisfy his own sense of justice. <br/><br/>The ending is far too clichéd, and out of touch with the more visceral realism of the rest of the movie. And, I'm sorry, but why would the neighbourhood scum not just gun Hawke down in the final confrontation? Stretching reality too much, for a downbeat ending which makes you wonder whether or not the whole two hours was worth your while, and Alonzo's death seems to be a big, clichéd full stop to a film which, if it had the courage of its' first ninety minutes, would not have had a proper ending, and would definitely have seen Hawke dead by the time the end credits roll. <br/><br/>So,is ""Training Day"" a great movie? It's well made, by a director with a brain, and a sense of the macabre nature of everyday street life. But, it's far too afraid to go all out, and be really realistic. Just enough to make you scared, but not enough to really make you think. As a piece of entertainment, as a story, as an imaginative vision, ""Training Day"" is definitely lacking, and it's bolted on thriller elements clash with its' grisly realistic moments. <br/><br/>Did I enjoy it? Honestly? No. I didn't. But I respected it. An ""A"" for effort, but a ""C"" for content."
"thebrightwhite","5","0","3","20 August 2013"," an Oscar?, what were they thinking ?
","I think that I have spent too long watching this film so I do not intend to make this take up more than 3 minutes: I like the director, I love the lead actors, I love the genre, and I have been advised by many to watch this accordingly. But This film was incredibly dull, offensive in its blandness, and predictable and more than anything else what surprised me it has absolutely no intelligence on any level at all. Gee when I think what we got from for example 'the inside man'. Now there was a film: smart, slick, engaging, unpredictable, characters I could believe, and the feel of New York. This movie at most may offer a slice of the dark side of corruption in LA told by a relatively convincing palette of actors but there were far too many problems here that sank this movie for me: Denzel Washington was too self-conscious in many places, Ethan Hawke was oddly more convincing than Washington all around. This emphasis on ''nothing is as it seems'' was played out for me by the first 40 minutes when there just seemed to be no plot other than here is a typical ''non typical'' training day: whatever!!! It was insulting! Surely this film cannot grab anybody with any imagination. I'd prefer to watch sly Stallone or Steven Seagal any day if I wanted mindless dross like this, at least those alternatives can be funny or amusing on a certain level. My time is up, or rather its time is up, and I wasted too much time tonight on this already. Happy to kiss this one off guys (btw I rarely make a negative review but I had to let this one out despite the Oscar for Washington), what were they thinking!!! :)<br/><br/>Good luck!"
"linkinpark45","10","0","1","1 June 2013"," Very good performances from both actors!
","This was a very good movie for several reasons: it dealt with many things police officers have to go through on a daily basis; showed that some people can accept and live with corruption, while others will try to stay true to the badge, and the most important: it shows how unreliable some people can be in certain situations. Washington plays an experienced, but corrupted narcotics detective and Hawke as a rookie, but a very loyal detective. Both did very well in their roles, especially Washington which got him an Oscar. Besides the main themes of this movie, it also shows how people change because of corruption and unreliability, therefore portraying the film very realistically. I also liked the fact that despite differences, Harris and Hoyt got along throughout the movie and during the last part, turned against each other: another lesson to learn - money can break anything, even friendship. Good movie, 10 out of 10, i recommend it, a lot of lessons to be learnt."
"Marc_Israel_365","9","0","1","25 April 2013"," It's not what you know. It's what you can prove
","This Police drama is among the best of the genre you'll find that manages to always take itself seriously. The David Ayer script, the Antoine Fuqua direction and the Denzel Washington evolution, as self run will cleverly run riot over L.A. Detective Alonzo Harris, are one of the finest I've ever seen. The training day of a rookie cop (Ethan Hawke) yields a seasons' worth of confrontations, revelations, implications and ethical questions about law enforcement and the ""nature of the business"". There are a few avoidable clichés that I could take aim at but Denzel gives his greatest performance ever with his triple balancing act between both good cop/bad cop mentor and arrogantly commencing his intricate maze of his life saving mission."
"tieman64","Null","0","1","25 December 2012"," The films of Ayer
","This is a review of ""Street Kings"", ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch"", three films by David Ayer.<br/><br/>Ayer's best film since ""Harsh Times"", ""Street Kings"" stars Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow, a burnt out cop who spends his days dodging bullets, taking down bad guys and dealing with a corrupt law enforcement system rife with scumbags in uniform. Sounds clichéd? Ayer's film moves like magic. He captures the tone and tempo of sleazy pulp fiction, revels in the genre's trashiness, writes in a baroque, pulp-prose style and volleys dialogue back and forth like Howard Hawks on cocaine.<br/><br/>Ayer, who started out as a screenwriter, also has an ear for snappy noir dialogue. His characters don't talk, so much as they play ping-pong with words, prose hurtling along with staccato intensity; like drumbeats. It's trashy, but it knows it's trashy; 1950s B movie sleaze filtered through a modern prism.<br/><br/>The film's all hand held cameras and snappy cuts, pausing now and then only to capture noir infused, sun drenched shots of California. We get convenience store shootouts, foot-chases through LA's Latino quarter, ominous nighttime skylines and the bloody haze of downtown ghettos. In Ayer's films, California's a war zone.<br/><br/>The message here is also less problematic than that of Ayer's other work. Here Keanu plays your typical loose cannon of a cop. He's a modern Dirty Harry, a fascist with a badge, a ruthless authoritarian who breaks the law and shoots up punks, all in the guise of doing the ""greater good"". To eliminate evil, Keanu believes, you have to employ risqué tactics, perhaps even the mendaciously immoral and outright illegal. The ends justify the means. Deal with it.<br/><br/>Only they don't. Keanu eventually realises he's a messed up dirt-bag who's been used as a violent blunt object by both the good guys and the bad. Ticked off, this little pawn visits his king, a chubby Police Chief who's house, in a nice bit of symbolism, literally has money, drugs and blackmail tapes leaking out of its walls; the up-scale veneer can barely hold back the corruption.<br/><br/>Ayer also wrote the screenplay for ""Training Day"". Another cop thriller, it stars Denzel Washington as a vicious LAPD narcotics officer who takes an ambitious rookie (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Washington's a criminal and crooked cop. Ethan, in contrast, is our great white hope, representative of Good, white American values, family and strong morals. Faced with the multi-ethnic criminality of both LA and Washington, Ethan opts firstly to simply walk away. Let the animals kill themselves. But Washington won't allow it. He attempts to corrupt Ethan – first with marijuana and later with harder vices - before provoking him into righteous violence. Even then Ethan refuses to deliver the kill blow; its up to the people of the slums – Latinos, Russians and blacks – to finish off their own kind. Ethan's hands remain clean. Whilst the film's first hour is thrilling, it becomes increasingly racist and stereotypical as it progresses.<br/><br/>Racism and stereotypes are precisely what gush forth from Ayer's ""End of Watch"". The film finds actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena playing a pair of LAPD cops. They're young, macho cowboys, high on testosterone and hungry for action. Much of the film juxtaposes the goodness of our virtuous heroes, their family lives and desire for peace, family and domesticity, with the wild savagery of LA's underclass, who actively hunt our heroes and violently intrude upon their private lives. It's your typically racist Cowboys vs Indians story. Our cops are a fraternity of hazing, backslapping, well-meaning frat-boys (they shoot and kill only in legitimate self-defence; yeah right), who hold the line against the savage chaos that is the Other. It's a jungle out there, which Ayer fetishizes and salivates over, his cops finding black kids tied up in cupboards and butchered limbs hidden in basements. You can find similar scenes in early films which demonized those pesky Native American Indians; monster's gonna getcha.<br/><br/>As this is a millennial police drama, two generations removed from Rodney King and a bevy of other scandals, Ayer's cops are more thankless grunts than boys in blue. They're soldiers. The film, with its pseudo documentarian shaky cam aesthetic (which, bizarrely, makes the film feel manufactured and fake rather than ""authentic), as a whole mirrors ""Saving Private Ryan"", the poster boy of modern cinematic fascism, which likewise masked bigotry, blood-lust and hatred behind patriotism and seemingly wholesome values. ""Black Hawk Down"" for cops, the film's a love-letter to the thin blue line, a blood-and-guts glorification of ""those who keep the savages at bay"", which is to say, it's total propaganda and trades in bogus mythology.<br/><br/>Crime films routinely demonstrate no social understanding, and routinely ignore the systemic causes of the appalling, violent conditions underprivileged minorities find themselves in. Others focus on ""corrupt policemen"" and ""rotten apples"", which itself misses the larger point that all law enforcement is systemically corrupt. The police/polis has a repressive function, its goal is to make politics disappear, for as long as there is no politics, a hierarchal distribution of power remains intact. The police, including disciplinary institutions and their various ideological components, are there to uphold the status quo and make sure that equality doesn't interfere with the hierarchal distribution of power; these social institutions are inherently inegalitarian. Today people have no problem accepting that the thin red line, the armed forces, does not act in the interest of You or Other, but it's the same with the thin blue line. Indeed, the dollar value of crime stopped by police infinitely out-weights that caused by the same. Borne of the desire of the wealthy to restructure society, to manage the urban poor and potential workforces, the law doesn't exist to prevent injustice acting upwards (the old notion that police protect the happy middle classes from the crazy, lazy lower classes), but largely to promote injustices acting downwards.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

It engages from the first scene and confuses you at various moments leaving you mystified as to what exactly will the next scene be (something i assume that every movie buff loves - unpredictability). Denzel Washington like always delivers an incredible performance. But its Ethan Hawke who stands up and delivers a performance equally good as his co-star.

","I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.<br/><br/>Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you?

","Much like Nicole Kidman in To Die For, this Training Day was a Denzel Washington vehicle. Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.<br/><br/>This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting – he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: ""He better both be nominated and win."" On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans – he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed ""OSCAR!"" without acting much.<br/><br/>But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.<br/><br/>Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. I don't want to spoil much more than that, and the fact I brought up The Shield, which covers pretty much the same ground. That's pretty much itfor the plot. Watch this fantastic performance from Denzel who, up to this point of his excellent career, hadn't played a true baddie. And he does it in spades. It's worth the Orientation Day for him alone."

","Training Day is, as you already know, set in only one day in Los Angeles and is about a rooster (Ethan Hawke's character: the rookie cop Jake Hoyt) and a wolf (Denzel Washington's character: the experienced big narcotics detective Alonzo Harris). Is as simple as this: the film begins and is sort of having the experienced big detective who certainly knows how is that world opening the eyes of the rookie who just wants to track down big drug dealers, who just wants to do a good for the society. The transition we have is that Jake stops seeing Alonzo as the type of dude he has to learn a whole lot from to can deal with the new type of world he is entering and be successful and starts seeing Alonzo as nothing but a criminal that well tried to kill him, if at one point Jake smoked some weed because Alonzo said to him, in other things, that a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics at one point Jake will go for his revenge. Saw bits of the making of documentary from the DVDincredible level of reality? Unforgettable minor characters? Not quite (the part with everybody turning their backs on Alonzo is like from a kids movie!); the acting of both Denzel and Ethan is good of course, pretty much their acting is the very best thing of the film, I mean I didn't found unforgettable and memorable characters in the ones played by Snoop Dog, Dr. Dree and well anybody else. It's a watchable film that once is over, well let's see, recently I bought the double feature DVD with both Training Day and Fallen (also with Denzel Washington and directed by Gregory Hoblit) just because I wanted to see again Antoine Fuqua's film again after many years (I remember seeing it when it was brand new as a rental). In that DVD Training Day is pretty much the main attraction and Fallen the bonus, minor feature (I never heard a thing before about Fallen), the Side A with ""Day"" has much more extras and stuff. Now that I saw Fuqua's film pretty much Fallen has all the chances to become the only reason for me to say something like ""well, buying that DVD was a great choice"" since basically by the end of Training Day I was like ""that's all?"", certainly for me now Fallen has not a really good contender for being the best out of the two films on the DVD but I will see."

Through his character, we learn that not only good intentions are needed to fight against crime...<br/><br/>So ""Training Day"" is in my opinion one of the best cop movies ever made because it doesn't follow the typical ""cop features"" and goes further and insert sub-plots that satisfy the new millennium tendencies.<br/><br/>Please watch Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance. Also, there are many interesting cameos like from Snoop Dogg."

","I love movies like this and Im sure Denzel Washingtons enjoyment of acting in this movie greatly assisted him in achieving the Oscar for best actor. The movie is intense and I can't pass on a picture about a corrupt police officer and who better than Denzel. I was gripped to the screen the entire time. He has always done a great performance with movies involving gangsters and the ghettos, the violent sides of society. His being a police officer added a bunch to the movie and really increased the interest. He is actually a gangster at heart yet is a cop so feels he has power over people and may do whatever he wishes."

","This is a good movie, but not perhaps for the same reasons as a lot of people will give merit for. Denzel Washington is on form, won't deny that. The film is well shot, a look at the darker side of LA.<br/><br/>I think watching this again, that it does look a little silly and stereotypical sometimes. Blacks and Hispanics and college kids. Also, some of the events or shots or scripting does seem a little 'theatrical' and 'staged', rather than flowing in such a way that we can 'buy' the story. That being said, it does deliver the goods. <br/><br/>Training day is one of these films that is not really escapism, it is just a fictional story. The real world of law enforcement can be and is (within reason) a dirty and corrupt empire. It's easier to have a Black or Hispanic scapegoat, or somebody to pull over just for kicks or for another notch in the Detective post.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable watch. I'm not sure how I would feel about it if the two leads were not who they were. Washington rules the roost, and the camera. Hawke plays the honest, determined and somewhat under confident rookie very effectively. <br/><br/>I like films like this, and No Country for Old men, and Traffic simply because they help remind me that I do not live in a a perfumed world, and sometimes it is merely sugar coated."

","I could not have picked a better time to watch Training Day as I am going into a career of Law enforcement my-self. From the beginning I understood the situation which a new recruit faces from his superiors and what the pressures are of being a cop as it is. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job of being a stranger and making us take the ride with him and when he meets Alonso Harris who is unforgettably played by Denzel 'American Gangster' Washington. Training Day is an account of life both for a cop working the rough streets of LA and also if you do your research you learn that it also involves real crips,bloods and various other gangs with their input which means that you get an authentic taste of what life is like for those living and growing up in one of these rough hoods. What makes Alonso Harris scar your mind is that he is not your average Dirty Harry wannabe but he is more like a resourceful , intelligent street wise cop with his Jekell/Hyde tendency's which makes him a joy to watch and no one could of carried this of in style like Denzel. The most shocking thing is that to all of them this was everyday life but unlike us who will be completely blown away by its power . My only problem with Training Day is that it just skips up a notch too fast and misses out some important factors but the stand out performance all the way through are what save this movie. To conclude Training Day is a movie that offers an experience which is hard to put into words , it offers an experience which has to viewed to be felt but all I can say is that this proof why Denzel Washington is one of the most talented black actors to have graced the silver screen , A MUST SEE !<br/><br/>TRAINING DAY : 8.6 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THE ONLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE LINE BEING CROSSED, IS THE COP WHO WILL CROSS IT..."

Denzel Washington is superb, mean looks, nasty bad reactions seeming so natural, I cannot believe he isn't a real filthy cop! Ethan Hawke's character is somehow naive, doesn't know what really is going all and cannot adjust to the rhythm Alonzo is accustomed to. Alonzo sets the rhythm, as a matter of fact, so we just ground for Jake (E.Hawke) to survive his rough trip.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" is rough, a good movie that counted on the budget to tell a raw story, with a great cast and some neat narrative skills.

","I just watched the movie for the second time. I wasn't impressed like the first time, but still liked it. This movie hasn't got any depth beyond the plot, this is not Fight Club or Sixth Sense, where watching the film second time around, reveals some details you didn't see before. Here the second watch didn't add anything new to me (except of finding new holes in the plot), but I still liked it and haven't got any disgusting feelings about it as others did. I wasn't bored either.<br/><br/>First of all I liked the plot.I liked the idea of the whole movie taking place in one day. And most of all I liked the acting of the leading roles. Specially of Denzel Washington (and I really don't care about the award). <br/><br/>I really don't understand most of the complaints people have about this movie. It's not perfect and there are some plot holes ( which most of the complaints don't even touch), but even though it's entertaining. And definitely not the worst movie like some say. Of course there were movies about ""bad cop - good cop"" , but not in this scheme. I think it had even some originality in it. And if you don't like Violence in movies - don't see it. But don't say you hate this movie because of the violence. Training Day's genre is violence. Finally to the character of Alonzo. I honestly think that Russel Crow should have the Oscar. He had a much deeper character to portray (in Beautiful mind), and did an excellent job with it. Nevertheless, the character of Alonzo was about one of the worst kind of people that there are on earth ( and if you see some documentary investigation, you understand that such people exist). Don't complain that you didn't like the character, I hated him either, that's why I think Denzel Washington made a great effort. Some credit to Ethan Hawke also.<br/><br/>Some holes in the plot: 1) I think the most visible one, and the most annoying is the one-to-million coincidence of Lisa being the cousin of Smiley. What chances that Lisa's wallet would save Hoyt? 2) Hoyt isn't used to narcotics and we see it on the effect the drugs have on him. But so strong of an effect should have take longer in time to recover from it. 3) After Smiley releases Jake he immediately goes to Alonzo's house. How did he remember where Alonzo lives? He couldn't remember it from one ride being on narcotics. 4) At the end of the movie Hoyt got serious beating from Alonzo. He was face smashed through the window, got hit with a chair, kicked and punched and after all that he managed to stand back and ready to fight again in a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>As I said. This movie is flawed, but still entertaining."

","Let me try and explain my feelings about this film. First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.<br/><br/>A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.<br/><br/>Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.<br/><br/>Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it."

"kevinmanf","6","0","12","9 November 2005"," A character driven
","Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.<br/><br/>Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.<br/><br/>The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict."

It was like Narc and Deep Blue, maybe? but w/ the obligatory non-actor rappers making extended cameos-Dr Dre, Snoop, etc. amidst the carnage and shaky cam.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing Cliff Curtis, considering how good he is in Three Kings etc etc it's fun to see him playing yet another hispanic though he is a Maori in real life. <br/><br/>I didn't quite buy Denzel's character being able to do this routine and get away w/ it for so long, I also thought that it made our police force out to be a pack of mercenarial rats, far from the folks I know who are in the force for real. That-ain't them.<br/><br/>I agree that the little 'wallet pic/call' scene was bogus, you def. had to let the disbelief suspension kick in bigtime for it.<br/><br/>Denzel is very good, focuses, believable. Ditto Ethan Hawke. You get nice turns by Scott Glenn and Eva Mendes as well. I am not so sure that this will hold up down the road, but for what it's worth, sure it's worthy of seeing. Ignore the whole Russki mob angle, clearly that was phoned in and not really thought out 100% in the developmental process.<br/><br/>*** outta ****, first half is better than second."
"supertom-3","8","0","11","23 July 2004"," Denzel makes this movie!
","This is a cracking cop thriller. The premise is simple, with Ethan Hawkes rookie cop taken on a training day with experienced and hardened officer Denzel Washington. He soon discovers that Denzel has let the position of power go to his head and that he is quite prepared to abuse his power. Hawke is excellent in his role as the rookie caught up in a terrible world of police corruption and he is deserving of his Oscar nomination, perhaps deserved of the win. Denzel is superb though. His character is meaty, with this guy almost being a personification of evil while also having other personalities to him, a character who is almost trying to delude himself into thinking that he is an upholder of the law. Washington is amazing, this is one of the greatest bad guy performances ever. Denzel is like a firecracker, one minute he is exploding and showing off an alarming attitude towards policing and the next he is talking Hawkes character round, convincing him that what they do is right. He is so good he almost talks the audience round at the same time. Of course the film may seem very exaggerated in regards to the police corruption in LA (ten cops from each precinct can be charged with abusing their privileges and the law apparently!). Overall this is a classy thriller directed with style by Antoine Fuqua. ****"

","Training Day is one of the few movies these days that stand out. Denzel Washington acted very well, doing his job by making his character difficult by the viewer whether he is just a good cop bending the rules, or a crazy cop that should be locked up. Ethan Hawke also did a great job playing a character that is a kind-hearted person who knows right from wrong. This is a dark movie that will leave you guessing, and will leave you on the edge of your seat. This isn't a fantasy movie that seems too unrealistic, but a true to life movie that is as real as it can get. Plus, you get to see some fine acting by snoop dogg and others. This movie is a must-see, and Washington earned that academy award."

","*Spoilers!* A lot has been said about how this film paints a bad picture of the LAPD, or how it depicts the worst aspects of humanity: betrayal, treachery, greed,etc. However, though it places its tale within a realistically urban environment, TRAINING DAY is actually a clever tale of how Washington's character sets up his scheme to get the money to pay off a p*ssed-off Russian gangster. THAT IS THE STORY. For the most part, the story works well, with good-guy trainee Hawke finding himself in ever-more compromising positions as Washington builds up to his money-acquiring caper.<br/><br/>The only weak part of the plot occurs when Hawke is saved (during a lethal poker game) due to the most far-fetched example of good fortune/coincidence seen in a movie for a long time. Maybe reviewers try to get more out of this movie than is actually there because Washington got an Oscar for his role."

The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads.

","Better than a typical out-of-line-cop action movie, Training Day delivers as a solid drama with enough action to keep things stirring.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke's naive character allows us as viewers to 'feel' the intensity & chaos of L.A.'s back alleys and neighborhoods, while steadily unravelling Denzel Washington's character as an increasingly crooked narc officer who seems to know no boundaries.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest success of this film is it lacks the predicatability of many other cop movies where the 'rogue cop' does have ultimate limits (i.e. The Negotiator, Bad Boys, etc), because he's really deep down a good guy. In this movie you really have to wonder if, for Washington, that good vs. evil line is ever drawn.<br/><br/>I feel the best part of the movie, and most suspensful, is the poker game scene.  It makes a viewer truly identify with the vulnerablitity of being completely isolated, and defensless, amidst a den of cold-hearted strangers.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie, if for any reason to see a slightly different angle to the traditional Hollywood-cop-movie formula."
"prem13","Null","0","11","23 February 2004"," Could have been truly great
","SPOILERS COULD BE CONTAINED HEREIN!<br/><br/>The problem with Training Day is not that it's an ordinary film. Far from that, Training Day is a great action film that takes a brutal look at the drug scene and how cops can get lured into its seamier side. The problem is that it could have been a lot lot more than just that.<br/><br/>The way I see it there are two threads operating in this film. One is the whole angle of the Training Day. Which is essentially Ethan Hawke's presence in the film and the dynamic of his interaction with Denzel Washington as a rookie cop on his first day. The second angle is that of Denzel Washington as the unconventional cop with the unconventional methods, who finally goes corrupt in a system that's too big and ugly for him.<br/><br/>My issue is this - while it can be argued that the first (the training day angle) is nothing more than a plot device, I personally found that it became, at many times, an unnecessary extra storyline.<br/><br/>I wish for this - I wish, in some manner, the film had stuck to the downfall of the cop, and not cluttered it with Ethan Hawke's character's presence (no issue with his performance, just his character). I wish it had reduced his presence to a narrator, a fly on the wall, in some way. I wish they'd moulded his character to be like a little man in the big world of drug crime, watching and trying to make sense of what's going on. I wish, in fact, that they'd stuck to the main story - that of an unconventional, yet corrupt cop caught in corrupt world and doing desperate things to cope with it.<br/><br/>I feel if this had happened, the film could have been something else altogether. A niche tragedy about a particular profession. A story of the downfall of one powerful man. Perhaps (at a stretch) a bit like how Wall Street is a tragedy about the business world and how it can eat up its very own. Training Day could have been an awesome commentary on the meaning of survival and the sometimes difficult choices one has to make to survive. It could have had us empathising much more with Denzel's character, even while loathing it for his flaws.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film doesn't entirely play upon this aspect, and in trying to be one too many things, seems to loose its way. No doubt, some elements of greatness are present, or I wouldn't even be writing this - but unfortunately by showing us how good it 'could' have been, the film ends up leaving you unsatisfied. It, of course, remains a terrific action movie worth a look. Unfortunately, it remains just that."

","Training Day kicks ass. Denzel Washington turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and this movie never lags for a second. Some cop films make the mistake of getting too deep in the plot and leaving things like acting and action by the wayside. Training Day achieves the perfect balance. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke play well off each other and you end up liking each character. The supporting cast does well but it's Washington and Hawke that you are watching. Scott Glenn is good as a drug dealer that's a friend of Washington. The film takes place over the course of one day and what a day that is. From shooting it out with gang members to finding out just how dirty a cop Denzel is, Ethan Hawke finds that his first day on Denzel's beat is a very dangerous one.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I highly recommend this movie.

I felt like I'd seen it all before in various other 'bent cop' movies, but harder and faster. Hawke is put through an unrealistic first day which seems to go on forever (they didn't even stop for doughnuts and coffee once) and Denzel is a more than a little annoying after a while.<br/><br/>Maybe it's coz I'm a limey and don't really give 2 hoots about the Academy Awards, but there's no way Denzel's acting in this was better than Crowe in 'A Beautiful Mind'.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman should have had an Oscar ages ago as should Denzel, but don't just give 'em away for the sake of it!

Ethan Hawke does a pretty good job of playing the rookie dazed by the events of his Training Day, but even he can't rescue this script.  I'm surprised that Denzel got an oscar for this because his portrayal is so over the top, although I can't say he doesn't deserve it for his overall body of work.

His character was<br/><br/>scripted in such a typical way that all he had to do was put on a<br/><br/>convincing face, hold his gun right and say his lines.

It's not a bad premise, really, since we all want that kind of security for our loved ones.<br/><br/>His first day in the ""narc"" division is, shall we say, an eye opener.

You can't control how I feel!  Denzel being the boss, or not, if someone with Hawke's character were in the position to put me away for a very long time, I would make very sure that he was on my side.

Cliff Curtis is great in this as well as a gang leader with a heart. IF you want to see another great Cliff Curtis performance, check out BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. The supporting cast is great in this as well. Eva Mendez from 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is Denzel's wife (hottie), Dr. Dre and the guy that played Redfoot in THE USUAL SUSPECTS are members of Alonzo's unit. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch. And I don't even think this was his greatest performance. Denzel was superb in REMEMBER THE TITANS and in the Oscar-snubbed THE HURRICANE. I feel the Academy gave the Oscar to Denzel because they know they screwed him twice for REMEMBER THE TITANS (where he was robbed of the best actor award) and THE HURRICANE.

","The plot has already been discussed a thousand times on here, so I will not waste time describing it, but for a in a brief way: Denzel Washington (The Hurricane,The Bone Collector, Courage Under Fire) plays thirteen year LAPD veteran Alonzo Harris. The film follows a turbulent day as rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is taken under Harris's wing in a ""Training Day"". Pass the tough test he is presented with, and he becomes a narcotics officer, fail, and he goes back to the Valley. What unfolds is a carefully thought out and even more impressively executed plot, that has many turns along the way, and many underlying themes that can be appreciated more on repeated viewings. David Ayers' screenplay beats the hell out of his other two famous ones - The Fast and the Furious and U-571, and Antoine Fuqua's direction is some of the best work I have ever seen. Every scene has it's own significance, even if you only realise it later, and they are cut perfectly to display this.<br/><br/>I have heard accusations on here of Denzel being ""bad in some scenes"", and the supporting cast ""having nothing to do"". Let me clear that up with one word: Rubbish. Washington is on form for every second of screen time, showing us more and more of who he really is as the film goes along, but letting us judge for ourselves whether we like Harris or not, whether we agree with his principles or not. And as for the supporting roles, I would welcome anybody who can point out a scene in which actors are completely wasted. Scott Glenn (who also worked with Washington on Courage Under Fire) is solid as Harris's ""boy"" Roger, and Cliff Curtis of Three Kings fame is a joy to watch as a Mexican nicknamed ""Smiley"", even more so considering that he is a New Zealander and does his assigned accent perfectly. This film is brimming with talent, including the supporting cast. Although it recieved an Oscar for Washington's lead role, the whole film is virtually flawless. Hawke is fantastic as Jake Hoyt, and it's always good to see Tom Berenger pop up, even if its only for a few minutes. This film is well written, sharply directed, performed with distinction. The musical score from Mark Mancina deserves a mention too. And as for the so called ""disappointing"" ending, it really isn't. It caps off the whole feel of the film: Firstly, because it has ((Slight Spoiler)) Harris showing his true colours that have been coming out bit by bit all the way through. Secondly, because after the great (((((Spoiler)))) ""King Kong"" speech, the film is finished off in the same vein as the rest of it, with subtlety. It leaves room for interpretation, and, like throughout, it  doesn't over do on emotion. An original, gritty, and refreshing look at a side of street life you don't often see portrayed so well.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10"

And Kuhn used to say that conversion is an essential part of every scientific revolution.  Would the world go round without it?  <br/><br/>I love Training Day precisely because it's such a visceral foray into the art of seduction;  for example, when Jake, the trainee, is faced with a serious moral dilemma, Alonzo tells him that the game they're playing is chess, not checkers, and adds, with avuncular affection, that when he's able to match what's going on in his head with the `real world,' he'll feel better.  Only after he knows how to play the game, Alonzo adds, after he has become `wise' to real world, can he change things for the better.  But he must become part of the system, however corrupt, before he can change it. He must have some dirt on him before others can trust him.  From a pragmatist perspective, this is reasonable.  From a `strategic' perspective of a chess match, it's morally superior.  `They build jails because of me,' Alonzo boasts.  <br/><br/>And so, when the rookie makes his choice to challenge Alonzo's `official' construction of reality with that of his own, he's really challenging the entire system.  In the eyes of his peers, he's an egoist, a `choir boy' who's better suited for a different line of work.  He's a threat, not because he's ethically superior to his colleagues, but because he just doesn't understand the fundamental realities of the situation.  `It's not what you know:  it's what you can prove,' Alonzo says several times over to his protégé.  Alonzo has the social and political capital to `prove' anything he likes.  <br/><br/>The more times I see the video, the more I buy into Alonzo's perspective. And the more I wonder if he wasn't right after all.  The game is chess, not checkers.  Watch it again and see if you don't notice a subtle change in your attitude."

","For some reason, the word I associate with this film is depression.  Lots of the writing and the acting is solid, but are we really this bad?  Do we really live among people who are like some of the characters in this film? Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes.  No, I don't think there are cops like Denzel.  (But I don't think there a hell of a lot of 'em like Elliot Ness, either, sad to say).    To me, this film tells us something about where we are as a society, and it doesn't speak too prettily.  Every man is a bad ass(yeah, right), latino gangstas from the hood have no respect for life, and in just a little way, the movie seems to want us to think these people are cool.  I ain't buying it, but I suspect lots of people are.   I guess I would compare this movie to Goodfellas and ""No Fear"" stickers. It is partially in love with the idea of its own toughness and ruthlessness. It kind of makes me want to say, ""Oh, really? Wanna dance?"""

","Definitely a bit different this one.<br/><br/>For his performance, Denzel Washington received a best actor oscar as the narcotics officer who takes the naive Jake (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Constantly referred to as a rookie, Jake goes on a training day to see if he can handle the street as presented to him by Alonzo (Denzel), and cope with the way narc officers deal with the law.<br/><br/>It's a supremely well-told story, because nothing is given to the viewer on a plate. Every feeling you have towards the main characters is your own, and the movie never attempts to dictate your emotive response. This is a rarity in the sentimentally-driven industry Hollywood frequently is. The performances are utterly excellent, and Ethan Hawke does equally as well as Washington in my opinion - the only difference being that Washington's character has more scope and more of the opportunity to be dynamic.<br/><br/>
The movie is objective, never takes sides, and gives the viewers the chance to deduce their own feelings. That's how cinema should be.<br/><br/>Fine movie."

","If you doesn't know and understand the fact above; you can't possibly understand why Mr. Washington won. Training Day is an extremely artless movie. Put most simply, Training Day is the harrowing tale of a black stereotype (Denzel Washington) placed in a commercially proven genre. And, of course, the white everyman dogooder (Ethan Hawke), who, almost singlehandedly, frees the ghetto from Washington's offensive and morally bankrupt stereotype. The ""Ghetto People"" could never, never in a million years, have emancipated themselves from the Blackzilla of Washington's character, not until they had the assistance of the all powerful Whitey to start the ball rolling. Ethan Hawke's character is so diametrically opposed to Washinton's, so bursting with morality, that the film does not allow Hawke's character to deliver Washington's stereotype the ultimate justice. This film fulfills all the needs of the average movigoing public. White audiences all over America are allowed to leave the theatre blissfully aware that their moral superiority is intact, and their inherent responsibility toward unfortunate minorities completely absolved.<br/><br/>As for a comment atop this review I think any reasonable person can understand that when The Academy placed the little gold statue in Denzel's hands it was not for Training Day itself. It was for all the great films he made previously, and despite the extremely special performance by LL -- whoops I mean Denzel-- in these films, he was egregiously passed over. Obviously, a short list of these films would include: Carbon Copy, The Mighty Quinn, Heart Condition, and the incomprehensible Virtuosity. But the King of this unsung heap, is of course, Ricochet, a film so exceptional that it features an early glimpse of that great dramatic actor, Kevin Pollak. While it may appear, to the casual observer that Pollak is simply walking through the scenes, doing bits from his stand-up act, this simply is not so. Is it even conceivable that Kevin Pollak, the man who brought us the most realistic portrayal of a Rabbi since William Christopher's Father Mulcahy could be any less then outstanding in any role with which he chose to grace the celluloid."

","Many people on this site really don't like this film, and I find it hard to see why.  Is it because of  the controversy around Washington's Oscar glory? This film is one of the best cop movies since 'Heat'.  Gripping, exciting, and violent.  Quite superb in parts.<br/><br/>Hawke plays a 'rookie' cop, (and I use that term lightly) who is being trained by Washington to work the drug filled streets of LA.  What Hawke is exposed to is the highly corrupt world that is LA's (and even America's) police force.  The story concentrates on how Hawke deals with it - a coming-of-age, writes-of-passage drama in one sense, in which Hawke's innocence is lost.  There is only a thin red line between the police and the bad guy - a simple police badge.  Hawke's character remains a glimmer of hope for the system.  <br/><br/>All the performances are superb.  Washington at times is chilling, Hawke is brilliant as a terrified cop who grows stronger throughout the film.

","This movie is about a naïve cop Jake, played by Ethan Hawke, on his first day as a narcotic officer, being trained by the dirty corrupt guy who runs it, Alonzo, played by Denzel Washington.  His character is so evil, sinister, and every other bad characteristic that you could think of, he has it, including openly flaunting his infidelity.  It is to the point where if you want anything bad to happen to anyone on the film, it would be him instead of the guys committing the crimes.  But at the same time, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, believing that he is some sort of demagogue.  Denzel is very good in portraying all that in this character, that is, everything except for any redeeming characteristics.<br/><br/> Some other parts are a little more unbelievable, like Alonzo letting Jake in on his secret dirty dealing, not even knowing if Jake will be openly receptive to the assassination and looting of drug money that he and his gang regularly enrich themself with, then putting Jake on the quandary of coming on board or snitch and be blamed for the whole thing.  I would assume if they want to introduce someone into their inner circle, they should either be receptive or do not object to such dealings.  The other cops on Alonzo's team seem to be characters straight out of some illicit gang, with more criminal than law enforcement attitude and personality.  Others issues includes the cardboard cutout characters of the dirty politician and DA. They are like a pack of crooks who has nothing in common except for their corrupt dealings.  Looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, it was good of them to delete the last scene where they collectively go to Jake's residence for the loot that he took from Alonzo.  The ending is also over the top, with the faceoff between the two cops in the street, with Alonzo's street homies not coming to his aid, instead letting them two take it out mano-a-mano, including sliding a gun to him when he didn't have one.<br/><br/> I guess at the end, Alonzo knew it its over for him, having messed around with some people even above this demagogue's head.  So instead of running, he is accepting fate.<br/><br/> Despite the movie's flaws, it is still a gritty hard look at the dirty side of undercover police world."

","This film was most certainly an exercise in placing contemporary urban morality.  The tacit assumption about this film was that it was supposed to be some action filled, cops & robbers, kitschy cool look at undercover cops.<br/><br/> The real thing was an entirely different film.   We are introduced to Alonzo and immediately we see the dangerous, brutal charm and power he wields.  In many ways he appears to be what many men would strive to become; stoic, fearless, capable, clever, sexual, the list goes on.  At the same time that we see this kind of cruel side to Alonzo as well.  While we see Jack as a good man but very unexperienced and incapable.  This is one of the most pivotal ways it breaks from being another trite cops & robbers film. By the end of the film we see the cracks in Alonzo's philosophy and the narcissictic nature that made him attempt to be this uber-man.<br/><br/>As the viewer we are placed in the moral conflicts that Jack is.  He has to choose what is the appropriate answer to a bevy of morally broken scenarios. For the choices he makes are not simply right and wrong because Alonzo presents them in a much different light.  While he is manipulating Jack's character to a certain extent he is also telling him the truth of the system.  The problem with the choices that Jack has to make is that they are so easy to simply conform with what is wanted.  I truly feel this is one of the core messages of the film.  How difficult would it be for undercover agents to prey off of money from drug dealers and gangbangers?  The answer in the film is not too hard.  If money is seized who is to say that it is the correct amount.  If you have some dirt on somebody how is it for you to put them in your pocket instead of in jail?  This film is critical of police corruption but it also does not idealize the criminal aspect either.<br/><br/> Another point that was brought up was simple impression and respect.  The gangs that were dealt with in the film were not insane, gun-toting, violence driven people rather they were pragmatic, scrupulous, gun-toting people. They are not reduced to something less then human rather they are people doing very incorrect things.  The violent elements in their world are gotten rid of instead of being the mainstay of their organization.  When they deal with Jack it quickly becomes an issue of would they rather deal with Jack who is respectful of those around him or Alonzo who will sacrifice anyone for his personal gain.  Overrall I think this film is quite excellent but has a tendency to be judged on the outset rather then having a good hard look at what it is really trying to say."

","A SPOILER OR TWO:  If you get through some of the plot implausibilities and stereotypes, this is an entertaining and intense film.  Denzel's performance is riveting, not because of the performance itself (it's pretty one-sided as far as I was concerned), but because Denzel has always played the nice guy. Here he plays the bad guy.  It's simply interesting to watch this metamorphosis.  But that's also the test of a great actor:  being convincing in any role you play.  And he certainly is convincing in this role and in everything he plays.  So---bravo, Denzel.<br/><br/>But for the movie: well, some of it just doesn't work, but you have to overlook some of the implausibilities and go with the action, which is constant and intense.  And using famous rap stars in speaking roles is certainly a mistake.  They come across as wooden.  And some of the plot twists just become a bit too far-fetched: e.g. why does the young girl saved from a rape so willingly provide the information to her UNCLE!?  She starts off her telephone conversation hiding everything, but then almost unconvincingly spills the beans.  Why does the neighborhood in which much of the action take place change it's opinion of Denzel's character so quickly? Oh, yeah, he's a bad cop and he used them and they hate him and he's a pig, etc.  But it just comes as such a pat finish.  Was it dramatic license that forces the rookie into the ""fold"" so quickly on the very first day on the job?  We are cheated out of getting to see the wool being pulled over the rookie's eyes, really.  It all happens so quickly, forceably in the first hour or two on the job.  Pretty neat trick, but are we then supposed to believe that the rookie was that gullible in the beginning?  Yeah, he is pretty stupid, I guess, and green in the beginning.  But wow, very little leg work had to be done to get him involved.  But this of course is what adds to the intensity of the film.

","LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department.  To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes.  A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic! <br/><br/>Firstly.  The acting of the two leads is top-notch.  Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey.  90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.<br/><br/>Secondly.  The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it.  Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be.  Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'.  The film, of course, does nothing of the sort.  It's made in Hollywood after all!  No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man!  Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness.  The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!<br/><br/>It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing.  And for that - it is worth a few hours of anybody's time."

The performances are alright. Hawke is pretty good as the naive, new cop. Washington is believable as the expert, rough around the edges with a quick wit. But I don't think it's an Oscar winning performance. I do believe Russell Crowes performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was much stronger and deserving. No, I'm not biased because I'm an Aussie, but I think politics and personal feelings got in the way of the voting. I mean, ""Training Day"" was at the cinemas here for what, two weeks? Didn't even make the top ten here. When Washington won the Oscar, they brought it back to the cinemas.

At times, he is a believable bad guy, at others, he's just the type of guy who makes you think if even Hitler had kinder elements to him.  It's difficult to tell if that makes the film better or worse.  Personally, I don't think it made it better.  It made it just a tad bit less believable.  But in a way, that is necessary to show the badness of the streets and the ghetto/barrio neighborhoods that Ethan Hawke is left in to fend for himself.<br/><br/> There is a deleted scene on the DVD that would have, in my opinion, made Denzel seem more human.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Training Day"" opens strong. Here you had Jake, a guy who finds himself in this terrible situation. He wants to make detective and work narcotics, so he must spend a day in the field getting some real world' training with a hardened LAPD legend. You see this big brother/little brother dynamic develop between the two. Jake wants to impress this guy more than anything, but soon realizes he's in for more than he ever imagined.<br/><br/>Who was it that said, the audience doesn't want to see the second worst day of a guy's life? Well, what a day this ends up being for Jake Hoyt. Ethan Hawke gives this great multi-leveled performance. There's two main things he needs to accomplish: be scared of Alonzo and hide that fear from Alonzo. It's just one day,' he must be thinking to himself, I can get through this.'<br/><br/>The film does not build on this promise, but ends up being an unintentional sermon. I never like to feel like I'm being preached to while watching a film. ""Training Day"" claims to know the answers to the questions it poses. Films shouldn't do that. Make the audience think but let them make up their own minds.<br/><br/>The cause of this problem is the character of Alonzo Harris. I was disappointed that this guy ended up really being bad. This is a case of a plot twist gone wrong.  While it's admirable that Denzel didn't demand that the writers change the story so his character seems more heroic, the way many stars have, I almost wished they'd gone that route, if only just a little.<br/><br/>We're never given a reason to feel sympathetic toward Alonzo. First we think he's a jerk. Then we find out he's really an evil person. The plot features this double fake-out that starts with him going psycho on a couple of would-be rapists. At this point you're thinking, they're messing with our heads. Soon we're going to see that Alonzo isn't such a bad guy. But the story just keeps pouring it on: Evil, evil, evil. This translated into boring, boring, boring.<br/><br/>By the time the film got to the business with the three wise men and Alonzo's 'posse,' followed by the revelation that Jake's been set up the entire time, I was no longer involved. I was no longer relating to Jake's character but was just along for the ride, merely curious about what happened next.<br/><br/>The card game scene is great and could have saved this film's behind. It's ruined by a coincidence that asks more from the audience's suspension of disbelief than it should. I mean, his cousin? Out of how many millions of people in Los Angeles? Is that supposed to be ironic? It's not even the coincidence that bugs me the most; it's that the scene it's meant to be the payoff of, the scene that had been the most interesting and intense in the film, ends with a big thud.<br/><br/>""Training Day"" is another one of those films I wish had taken a different course. At the beginning you're thinking it's going to be about this wide-eyed rookie learning the hard lessons of the 'real' world. But not long into the story it becomes apparent that the film isn't based on any reality at all. It becomes this typical cop thriller with corrupt cops and evil Russian mafia guys. Isn't there enough moral tests in the real struggles of an undercover narcotics officer that they could have built a story around? It's as if no one involved in the film knew anything about narcotics investigation, so they had to resort to this theoretical crap that's straight out of ""Tango and Cash.""<br/><br/>Grade: C"

He took on a role that I had never see him try before and gave such a multilayered performance that I was riveted to the screen throughout the entire movie. You never knew exactly what was Alonzo Harris' true motivation in his actions towards Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke)until the final act, and it takes superb acting to pull that off with the sincerity and believability that Denzel did. Ethan Hawke does a good turn here also as the rookie cop Hoyt who struggles throughout the movie with the apparent ""realities"" of narcotics investigation offered up to him by Alonzo. Just how much ""dirt"" is Hoyt willing to take on without becoming untrue to his ideals?<br/><br/>I never judge a movie by how ""original"" the story is. ""Being John Malkovich"" was hailed as an ""original"" story, yet I found it only mildly interesting. If Training Day has been ""done"" before, I can't recall seeing it. I judge movies by how well they tell the story that they are telling. This one is told quite well.

But I thought the whole movie was nicely restrained, right up until the climax (is this review beginning to read like a write up for a high class porn flick?).<br/><br/>Yes, yes, so Denzel Washington spends MOST of THE film TALKING like THIS (!!!!), his eyes continually twinkling with a mixture of mischievousness and raw insanity. But if there's one actor who you don't mind over acting, then it's Denzel. Imagine Al Pacino in the same role - although Al would definitely have looked even more ridiculous than Washington going round calling everyone his ""DAWG"" and Ethan Hawke his ""nigga"". Did Washington deserve the Oscar for this film... yeah, kind of... well, no... he just deserved the Oscar that he didn't win for Malcom X.<br/><br/>Yet the whole time I was watching Training Day I just knew the final scenes would spoil it. I knew that Hollywood conventions would dictate that the film had to end with Washington and Hawke beating the living be-jaysus out of each other, sustaining several gun shot wounds and facial injuries in the process.<br/><br/>Yet the final fight was really well staged, not asking the viewer to really believe that scrawny Ethan Hawke could really batter big buff Denzel. I mean, earlier in the film they asked us to believe that Ethan Hawke (a man whose eyelids look like they're on loan from Droopy Dog) had never schmoked the demon weed before... C'mon.<br/><br/>Training Day is an interesting study in nihilism and is largely about, as another user has already commented, how important a set of rigid set of ethics should be to the public servants sent out to protect us. Yet the film never really resolves this issue - Ethan Hawke's character is shown to be deeply principled but largely unable to do his job because of his lack of street savvy and pragmatism, while Washington's Alonzo is shown to be resourceful and charismatic but ultimately careless and evil. So who does the screenwriter think should be patrolling the streets: Ethan? Denzel? Dr Dre (who's actually not as bad as you'd think)?<br/><br/>Needless to say, I won't be signing up to join the LAPD just yet..."

Knowing that Washington's character wasn't aware of this coincidence made me think even less of his character, basically he was watching out for himself, only himself and didn't give a thought to anyone else or their lives. Fascinating, violent and recommended."
"jhclues","6","0","12","4 April 2002"," Washington Makes It Worthwhile
","A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--'  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.<br/><br/>	Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--'  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever.<br/><br/>	Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on.  Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle.  As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.<br/><br/>	As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.<br/><br/>	Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.  6/10."

","I went to go see Training Day and I was expecting a somewhat scary movie. Instead i got the exact opposite i got a good well thought out movie, though hard to follow at sometimes it made up by getting back on an easy to follow basis.  I would and do recommend Training Day as an almost must see I personally thought it was a very good movie."
"hsticker","Null","0","11","31 March 2002"," Good performances but flawed movie
","Denzel and Ethan are indeed excellent in this mostly taut, well paced drama. Denzel's performance as a corrupt cop beautifully rubs against the possibility of excess, but bever crosses the line. Ethan playing an honest cop, looks increasingly bewildered by his unexpected wild ride, but he never loses his footing. Still, Training Day is one of those infuriating movies that could have been much better if the writer and director had trusted the audience more. The movie is seriously undermined by the ""motivation"" provided for Denzel's corrupt actions on this day, namely, his need to obtain money to pay off the Russian mafia. Denzel's character has already been set up well to have the mixed motivations of ridding the world of major drug figures and, at the same time, enrich himself for the risk he is taking. His complex character, and the tension with Ethan's character, drive the plot. The extra motivation undermines the drama, making it a more standard shoot 'em up. So for most of the film, the tension and drama is high. But the last few scenes undermine the drama."
"comquest","8","0","11","1 April 2002"," Right actor, wrong film
","There's no doubt that Denzel Washington deserves AT LEAST one Oscar for Best Actor.  I've watched him turn in so many Oscar-caliber performances, then go unrewarded.<br/><br/>So, now that the Academy finally decides to recognize his acting prowess they pick the wrong film.  Don't get me wrong ... Denzel is great in 'Training Day' ... but he has been better in at least a dozen of his earlier films where he played more complex, meaningful characters.<br/><br/>'Training Day' is a routine good cop, bad cop street epic.  Exciting? Sure. Packed with action?  Indeed.  But it didn't deserve mention at the Oscars, let alone any awards.  Movies and TV series like this are a dime a dozen.<br/><br/>My guess:  the Academy finally realized they should have recognized Denzel's work years ago and chose this film simply because it was current and eligible."
"cottrellpj","7","0","10","30 March 2002"," Denzel Does Kingsley
","I write this in the post-Oscars afterglow of Denzel Washington's victory. Pity the movie wasn't more worthy of honours on its' own. I greatly enjoyed the first hour, Massa Washington chewed the scenery with a relish reminiscent of Ben Kingsley's Don Logan in ""Sexy Beast"". But the filmmakers kept upping the ante past the point of ridiculousness. The pretence of realism gives way to a Hollywood shoot 'em up near the end and cost it a point or two in my estimation."
"Eltredor","7","0","10","28 March 2002"," A hard day
","This movie with Academy Award® Winner: Denzel Washington, and Academy Award® Nominated: Ethan Hawke, is quite good, but as for me, not  a really Academy winning role for Denzel. Denzel is playing a corrupted special agent, who is doing it all for the money, because he screwed things up with the Russians. Ethan is helping him for the first day, but everything is planned to give Ethan a hard time."
"movie-man-76","8","0","11","7 April 2003"," DENZAL, Finally Plays a Bad A**
","Training Day is a great crime, drama, action, thriller, and cop/detective film. The screenplay is very rich and smooth, very free flowing. Great from start to finish. Training Day is one of my Top 5 favorite films to come out of 2001. The story is about a young police officer (Hawke) trying to make detective the fastest way, by being a narcotics officer for 18 months. He has one day to prove himself to his boss, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington). This becomes his Training Day. Through out the film he finds out that being a narc is more then he bargained for. The film is about wrong and right and making the right decisions under extreme pressure. Denzal Washington gives a fantastic performance as Detective Harris. He is a man that has no morals and is using the badge to perform crimes against the criminals he is putting away, or trying to put away, either by death or prison. Denzal's powerful performance earned him an Oscar for best actor in 2002. Ethan Hawke gives a emotional performance as Officer Jake Hoyt, the new guy in training. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. Another great cop/detective film that came out recently is Narc (2002). I highly recommend both of these films. I give Training Day * * * * (out of 5 stars)."
"camselle","Null","0","11","17 April 2003"," The film the LAPD does NOT want you to see...
","**SPOILERS HEREIN**<br/><br/>Living in the city of circling Ghetto Birds (police choppers), i must say that this effort was enjoyable if not a bit over-the-top. 1stly, i found it stretching the limits of credulity that the street-smart Alonzo Harris would expose his protege to his grizzly side so much all in ONE day, and then expect him to fall in so quickly and unquestioningly. Duh.. ""Okay, boss!!""<br/><br/>
2ndly, in an apparent shot at the LAPD, featuring three high ranking members of the law enforcement community as crooked as Harris, not to mention his own morally challenged crew (Dr. Dre & the rest), got a little tired. Is Jake Hoyt the ONLY honest cop in LA? This flick would have you believe just that. <br/><br/>3rdly, WAAAAY too ""Deus-ex-Machina"" for an ending. Students of ancient Greek tragedies will understand... ;-)<br/><br/>Incidentally, GREAT cameos. Props especially to Cliff Curtis and Noel Gugliemi.. ORALE!!!"

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>There isn't much of a cast to Training Day.It's mostly just Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke driving around in a car.But in crafting just these main two characters,it has constructed quite probably the best film to come out in the last 18 months,and which deserves to win oscars.It paints an unflinching,uncompromising account of life on the mean streets of LA,rampant with rapists,graffiti,gang members and mostly drug dealers.Hawke is certainly very impressive as the naive rookie cop,but the real star of the show is undoubtedly Washington,who delivers a breath-taking performance as the experienced,hardened police veteran who's just seen too much injustice in his career and has been pushed right over the edge.In between all this fantastic writing,directing and acting,there is also some brilliant action sequences (especially at the end)not to mention a thoroughly emersing hip-hop soundtrack.It really is hard to think of a single fault here,this is simply excellent.Cancel all other arrangements and see it.*****"
