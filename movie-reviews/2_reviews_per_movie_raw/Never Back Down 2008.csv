"zachary-pruckowski","7","165","223","14 March 2008"," Much better than advertised
","The advertisements for this movie do it serious injustice. I was standing in the lobby of a movie theater at a free showing, and almost didn't walk in, because the trailers and ads had me convinced it was a complete waste of time. The advertisements portray the film as being merely a vehicle for shirtless boys to beat on each other and hot girls to wear bikinis. While there is no shortage of either, the movie has a strong underlying theme and a decent plot.<br/><br/>At the thematic level, the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions, controlling your emotions, and making good choices. It's as much about motivations as macho.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a teen-targeted movie. You've got rich kids running around in massive mansions driving expensive cars, but that's just the setting. You've got people beating the crap out of each other, but that's just a plot device. The heart of the movie is about personal growth and making choices. It's not an empty action flick or a taped brawl.<br/><br/>It's not the best film of the year, and it may well wind up as a late night cable movie in a few months, but it's nowhere near as bad as people expect. It's definitely worth the price of a rental, and worth the $10 to see it in theaters, if you've got no other plans. I blame the negativity largely on the advertising, which tries to sell it as ""just another fight movie""."
"Dragoneyed363","8","90","124","5 August 2008"," Although this has been done 1,000 times
",". . . Never Back Down was still a really great movie that I had a lot of fun watching, and I was surprised with how much I actually ended up liking it. Of course this film is really very predictable and was basically just a rip-off version of Fight Club, The Karate Kid, and movies like that in general that was basically aimed at 16, 17, and 18 year old boys, but it was really enjoyable if you just judge it based on an actual movie and not what audience it's trying to pull in.<br/><br/>It did get pretty annoying and downright unbelievable at times, but I have to give this movie it's props, because the acting was done very professionally for a bunch of model-body teenage actors, and it also managed to keep me so interested and entertained through the entire film with semi adroit and crafty, motivating scenes and material matter. It gets a bit mediocre, as I have said, and some stuff just falls flat, but they handle everything they lack so well with other interesting and appealing scenes and substance, excluding the featherweight dialogue, haha. <br/><br/>Overall, I was so happy with the outcome of this movie, because while being cliché, and certainly not worthy of winning an Oscar or anything like that, it was really enjoyable, and I had a great time watching it. If you lower your expectations and free your mind, I bet you will too. I suggest you see it if you can appreciate it for what it is. If anything else, there is Cam Gigandet and Sean Faris shirtless."

","Yes, it's just a revamped Karate Kid.<br/><br/>But with MMA, not just Karate, although I did have the occasional urge to shout ""Cobra Kai!"" when the bad guy came on screen.<br/><br/>Some cool action, basically just MMA (like in the UFC) that's been ""hollywoodized"" to be showy, ""underground"", and performed by supposed teenagers.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is wasted on this film, but does fairly well at being the token real actor, giving it some tenuous legitimacy. On the upside, probably a more believable martial arts instructor than Pat Morita... physically, at least.<br/><br/>It's a great movie to just turn off your brain to, and watch lots of girls in bikinis and guys beating each other up. Pleasant, mindless T&A/Action."

","This is one more film with quite good idea. Though, there are a lot similar films that we could bracket in one group with this one. Yet, it has something outstanding. It inspires me in a way. To strive for my life-goals, never back down, no matter how hard it may be, what sort of obstacles are ahead of you.. Maybe that's the real purpose of this film? To inspire one, to be confident and persistent. At least, I was affected in this way. I presume, that this movie is suitable for those, who have a very deep and grim times, who need some sort of wake up call to evoke positive feelings to what's life.. to make one be optimistic again..."

","I liked this film better when it was called the Karate Kid. Sure, there is nothing new under the sun and every film borrows something from other films that have come before it, but this is bordering on copyright infringement.<br/><br/>If I had to write a Karate Kid summary in 3 sentences, this is what I would write: Kid moves to a new town. Kid gets the living crap beaten out of him by the town bad boy. Kid starts some heavy duty Karate training so he can get revenge by kicking the bad boys ass while simultaneously winning the heart of the hottest girl in town.<br/><br/>Now, if I had to write a summary for this film in 3 sentences it would be as follows: Kid moves to a new town. Kid gets the living crap beaten out of him by the town bad boy. Kid starts some heavy duty Mixed Martial Arts training so he can get revenge by kicking the bad boys ass while simultaneously winning the heart of the hottest girl in town.<br/><br/>The plot is literally exactly the same. The only difference is that when it came to the soundtrack they replaced Peter Cetera with nu metal in the vein of Linkin Park and the most pivotal characters in this film were cell phones.<br/><br/>People have commented that the fight scenes were pretty good. I tend to disagree. They were pretty weak. Instead of watching this film just watch the Karate Kid and have a computer handy. When the fight scenes are on in the Karate Kid, just turn away and watch some UFC fights on youtube. You'll have practically the same film as Never Back Down, just much much better.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the lack of tits in this film. Usually a film with a script of this caliber has a heap of tits. This was obviously an oversight from the producers and I'm sure that will be fixed if they make a sequel.<br/><br/>I do respect the fact that they were able to jam every 80's film cliché ever into the little over 90 minutes. When writing a film review on this site you have the option of checking the ""contains spoilers"" box. This feature could easily be disabled for Never Back Down. It is impossible to spoil the content of this film as everybody has already seen it, at least 1000 times, just with a different title.<br/><br/>Will the good kid defeat the bad kid in a no holes barred fight? Who knows? Well actually everybody."
"oli_rawlings","9","129","205","8 April 2008"," a heavily under-rated kick-arse movie, albeit its flaws...
","Being a martial artist myself, i can understand why others may not feel the same way towards what i am about to say as this film is clearly aimed at a specific audience.<br/><br/>Never back down is a good teen-young adult film. Why is it rated so low? It contains and deals with many issues that are in our every lives. Issues of pride, of bullying, of prejudice, of commitment and above all respect. Its promotional campaign does not do it justice. If one looks below the surface, this movie has some depth to it.<br/><br/>Good things about it: fantastic soundtrack, good acting, great locations, professional fighting and pretty good story, albeit being a bit simple and predictable.<br/><br/>Bad things about it: a bit cheesy, mostly predictable, lack of character development apart from Jake (the main character) and Jean Roqua, the occasional bad technique (from my point of view) and a clear plastic feel to it due to the beautiful people.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a writter, all I'll say is this film is worth watching and is very empowering, particularly if you are a martial artist or have had a bad day.<br/><br/>overall 9/10"
"dukevega","3","64","99","14 March 2008"," Serious Case of Deja View
","If you weren't old enough to see movies and understand them back in 1984, this may seem like a pretty good movie. If, on the other hand, you were old enough, then you will see this movie for what it is: an updated version of ""Karate Kid"", a much better film. Before seeing this, I looked up the movie and read the plot, and that was the first thought that ran through my head; seeing it only proved it. By the time the movie was over, I counted over 15 similarities between the two films, and yet nowhere did I see any credit given to the original writers. Shouldn't they be suing for plagiarism?<br/><br/>1 Poor kid is star<br/><br/>2 Moves out to a coastal city<br/><br/>3 Meets pretty girl<br/><br/>4 Pretty girl has jerk boyfriend<br/><br/>5 Jerk boyfriend is local fighting champ (2 years running no less)<br/><br/>6 Poor kid knows a little about fighting<br/><br/>7 Gets into fight with jerk boyfriend and gets beat<br/><br/>8 Meets up with a teacher in the same style as jerk boyfriend<br/><br/>9 Teacher is foreign born<br/><br/>10 Teacher has experienced great personal loss<br/><br/>11 Poor kid and girl have tiff<br/><br/>12 They get back together after he apologizes for being a jerk<br/><br/>13 While jerk boyfriend is good fighter, has bad focus<br/><br/>14 Poor kid and jerk boyfriend face off in tournament he is champion of<br/><br/>15 In the tournament, poor kid suffers a serious injury<br/><br/>16 Poor kid wins anyway and earns jerk boyfriend's respect<br/><br/>There are some other plot holes which stretch the credibility of this movie even further. The main villain is in good shape, as he walks around half the movie with no shirt on, revealing some well-defined abs. I find it awfully hard to believe that a high school kid could achieve something like that.<br/><br/>The other plot hole which also made me scratch my head was the death of the lead character's father. He got drunk at a bar, got behind the wheel and wrapped his car around the tree. The lead was with him and I was wondering, ""What is a high school kid doing at a bar? Do they check IDs any more?""<br/><br/>And another thing: what are high school kids doing participating in full-contact fighting tournaments? Isn't there some kind of law against that?<br/><br/>The one good thing I did like about the movie was the villain. He had a whole smug attitude which came off as highly believable. But still, that isn't nearly enough to make up for this rip-off. I'm just glad this was a sneak preview so I didn't have to pay to see this."
"dee.reid","6","65","104","14 March 2008"," ""The Karate Kid"" plus MMA (mixed martial arts); by-the-numbers all the way
","Don't tap-out yet!<br/><br/>From reading the title ""Never Back Down,"" you get the impression that what you're about to watch will be something pretty macho and also pretty lame - a bad combination. The claims of this being a remake of ""The Karate Kid"" plus ""Fight Club"" and mixed martial arts is not undeserved or inappropriate. What it does aim to be, is a ""Karate Kid"" for the MTV generation and a generation of kids who may think that MMA is the future of the martial arts.<br/><br/>As a casual fan of mixed martial arts, the gladiator-style spectacle of this sport goes all the way back to the Greeks, with their sport Pankration (which pretty much resembles today's MMA). The idea of cross-training and mixing techniques of different fighting styles gained popularity in the 20th century with Bruce Lee and his theories on Jeet Kune Do (which when translated from Cantonese, means ""the way of the intercepting fist""). However, mixed martial arts, as we know it today in the Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC), PRIDE and other MMA organizations, gained widespread recognition when Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grappler Royce Gracie won UFC 1 in 1993. Since then, a revolution has been sparked in the world of full-contact fighting. (On a side, UFC president Dana White considers Bruce Lee the ""father of modern mixed martial arts."")<br/><br/>In ""Never Back Down,"" which seeks to promote MMA for the mainstream, Jake Tyler (Sean Faris, who looks remarkably like a young Tom Cruise) is a promising football player who is relocated with his widowed mother and younger brother from their home in Iowa to the posh surroundings of upper-class Orlando, Florida; they opt for a cramped apartment in suburbia away from the surf and bikini-clad babes. Right away, it's established that Jake's a born brawler and has a chip on his shoulder, so right away the filmmakers are attempting to remove themselves from the ""Karate Kid"" legacy.<br/><br/>Right away, he locks eyes on the pretty blonde Baja Miller (Amber Heard, uh-huh), and she invites new-kid Jake to a party later that night. At this same party, he locks heads with rich-boy Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet), a champion MMA fighter who gets the upper hand on Jake and beats him to a pulp in a no-holds-barred brawl.<br/><br/>All hope is not lost. On his first day of school, Jake had witnessed a fight happening under the bleachers, where an outcast kid named Max (Evan Peters) was getting his butt kicked by Ryan and his goons. It just so happens that Max is being trained by the legendary MMA champ Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou) and takes him under his wing. So cue the MTV soundtrack and training montage.<br/><br/>In terms of being a simple martial arts movie, ""Never Back Down"" is nothing new. Plenty of martial arts movies have been made about the bullied good guy who gets his butt kicked, learns to fight from a master, and tests out his newfound skills by getting revenge on his tormentors in the ring. The by-the-numbers script by Chris Hauty pays attention to a few of the details of modern mixed martial arts training, but doesn't really go into any real depth about it, even if some of the harsher stuff is only glossed over for the sake of trying to mainstream it. But I also guess that this Jeff Wadlow-directed vehicle has seen way too many better movies, and it's inherently self-referential toward them.<br/><br/>""Never Back Down,"" I guess, is a fun way to spend $7.75 (what I spent); at the very least, even if the plot is formulaic, it's still entertaining. The acting, writing and plot are decent, but still, the performances, acting and writing, like everything else, are by-the-numbers. Although we don't really wade grimly through worthless dialogue scenes, we do perk up for the fighting and training sequences. The best thing about these scenes is that they're authentic: what the actors are doing is so ""real"" you ""believe"" it. As brutal as they are (even for a ""PG-13""-rated movie), they're fairly exciting and there isn't a whole bunch of flashy camera cutting that takes away from the intensity of the full-contact punching and kicking. The camera stays put for the most part and isn't moving all over the place. It looks like the actors are really going at it, and it looks like it hurts. So you ""believe"" it in a way you don't really do for a lot of martial arts movies made in America these days.<br/><br/>And that's what no-holds-barred is all about, right?<br/><br/>6/10"
"guynaba","9","31","47","14 August 2009"," Surprisingly good
","This movie is quite predictable. The story of a boy that gets into trouble in school and starts fighting because of that isn't original, but between all the predictable movies with this theme, certainly this is the best.<br/><br/>Your attention is caught in every single scene. I think the best merit of Never Back Down is that it mixes a lot of types of movie. At the beginning, it's like one of that silly teenager's movie, showing the school, party and girls. Then the atmosphere gets darker and the world of fighting is showed, as well as family's problems, turning everything into a drama. And then... I won't tell the whole story, but I assure that you won't get bored.<br/><br/>The acting was very well done too, especially Cam Gigandet. He definitely knew how to be the typical bad guy; not like those annoying bad actors in teenagers movie, but a darker, more ""serious"" one.<br/><br/>Even with all these qualities that makes Never Back Down stands out, I don't think that older people will enjoy watching it... although the movie brings out a moral that fits in everyone."
"jhobdell","8","52","84","19 April 2008"," A new ""Karate Kid""
","Perhaps my descriptive summary is unkind to this film. I enjoyed it so much because it depicts a young man learning to deal with his emotions, rather than being ruled by his fear of them. It is quite remarkable, the strength of character he ultimately develops, and his interactions with his instructor are gratifyingly free of the childish morality one dreads in such a film, or the typical oriental platitudes that often hallmark them because of the origins of martial arts. At the root of this, I think, is the film's willingness to observe and comment on the 'problem' emotion of anger. Rather than leave it festering, or simply transform it 'as if by magic', the audience can almost see the transformation in the main character, through his physical exertion, which eventually leaves him free of its destructive role in his life. For most, if not all, these reasons, I enjoyed the film because it resonated with me quite closely, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>If nothing else, I for one will be researching the possibilities of training in mixed martial arts!"

","It's interesting how this movie seems to be a watershed for mma. Mixed martial arts really are making the transition from underground, extreme bleeding-edge expressions of combat sport to a mainstream and accepted pastime, and that shows in the commentary about this film. Those who have a clue about mma aren't saying the same things as those who don't.<br/><br/>I have no patience for critics, anyway. They're worse than academics, really, and nothing they say can be trusted. You want to know if a movie sucked? Listen to the people.<br/><br/>This movie didn't suck. Okay, it wasn't Cool Hand Luke, but is that really what you were expecting when you saw the advance poster? It went to great lengths to make a Classical reference from the Iliad significant thematically, and how often does a ""teensploitation"" flick do that? It even employed a little finesse in some of the on-screen relationships, and in ways that seemed to hold a little verisimilitude, even. If the filmmakers had made Jake Tyler a gay youth fighting for free speech in the school newspapers, the critics would have loved it. All they saw was scary teen violence, so theywell, less than loved it.<br/><br/>Truth is that the movie isn't really glorifying violence; it's glorifying the quotidian, although it does seem to consider violence an acceptable means to an end. If you like mixed martial arts and you're not too delicate to watch stylized violence, rent it when it comes out. If you'd really rather watch 27 Dresses (you know who you are) tell your boyfriend it's chick flick time."

","Wow, there is not one ugly person in all of Orlando, at least that's what this film wants you to believe. Do any high schools or high school students look like this, come on. What I love best is the quote on the back of the box "" A little Karate Kid, a little Fight Club and a whole lot of The OC"", WHAT? Is that suppose to make me buy it, please find me someone who loves all three of those, ya, no one. OK, so the film is not all bad, Djimon Hounsou is good as always, the look of the film is unique and the fight scenes are pretty darn good. Unfortunately the plot is predictable the characters are one dimensional, there is a girl cause there has to be, right and it attempts to send a message and fails horribly. I think the directors theory is fill the film with fight scenes and loud music montages and then you don't have to have character development or to much of their crappy dialogue. So I guess that helps the film instead of hurting it."
"joekammerman","8","48","94","25 January 2008"," Good Flick!
","I saw the movie at a screening in LA a few weeks back, and really liked it. I haven't really gotten into the whole UFC/mixed martial arts thing, but I thought the fighting in this movie was exciting. Very fast, very intense, and as movies go enjoyable. The editing and the stunts worked well. The story is cliché, but so what, as it never gets old. A coming of age fight movie has to have something going on between the fights, and Djimon Hounsou did an amazing job. The movie is definitely worth a look and Djimon is always clutch. The movie works for what it is a fun, action-packed and full of hot girls flick! I'd see it again."

","Now in the 21st century, the old school brawlin' movies are over with. Their fad has worn out. Now, we are shoveled crap like Meet The Spartans and other seriously stupid parody movies, and then movies where senseless violence reigns dominant and there is no point to the movie anymore. But the beat-em-up genre has returned with Never Back Down.<br/><br/>Most of you know the cheesy story line, which is the only reason that I have to give it a 9 instead of 10, a rebellious teen who gets caught up in some trouble which leads to the whole development of the movie. If you can set that aside and see what is being shown to you, it is easy to see why NBD is such a good movie. There is just enough action to keep the fans excited, enough drama to keep them drawn in, good plot development to keep you interested, a good mix of hot girls and for the ladies there are buff dudes, and the sense of morality and character.<br/><br/>Being a martial artist for 10 years myself, I was pleased with the fight scenes (although they cannot compare to The Protector) but since this movie wasn't starring people like Jet Li who dedicate every performance to fighting, the actors did very well and proved themselves.<br/><br/>The cheesy storyline and mediocre character development are the only things keeping me from giving this movie a 10 star rating. The critics gave this movie too harsh of a rating because they just didn't understand that this movie wasn't meant to win an Oscar or be hailed as the movie of the year, it was meant to give us a break from most of the crap movies now and do what movies are supposed to do, entertain us. Really worth a watch, check it out."
"borat_co","7","37","74","21 March 2008"," Good movie
","I saw this movie a couple of days ago and i was really impressed! At first i thought that this would just be another brain-dead movie but it was so much more. Solid acting, good story and nice fighting scenes.<br/><br/>The thing i don't understand are the bad review about this movie. Sure, it isn't something new, it's basically a ""Karate Kid"" clone but made in the 21th century. It gives you a nice story and is a solid flick, not a prizewinner or something but considering that it gives you what it promises then it's a great movie. Don't expect Fightclub or anything like that, this is something more ""simple"".<br/><br/>The story is about Jake Tyler, a kid who just has moved to Florida. He start school but before he knows it he gets beaten silly by another kid in school who is a really skilled MMA fighter. Now Jake takes up training to fight back but realizes that revenge isn't everything and also makes new friends and a girlfriend. It's a classical story, nothing new but it still works. The plot is engaging and you really want to see Jake succeed with his training and his emotional travel. The acting is good, sometimes it can get a bit over the line but otherwise it's good. The fight in this movie are well executed. One thing that is really bad in this movie is when they show Jakes younger brother, a tennis star. He is so annoying with his ""sweetness"" and the fact that all the kid does is act smart by mumbling up numbers and facts about tennis.<br/><br/>I recommend you to see this move, it will be much better then you think!"

","I wasn't sure what exactly to expect from this movie, but it ended up being very satisfying and entertaining. There is a lot more to it than you see in the trailer.<br/><br/>The characters have a good amount of depth to them, although you are never completely sure what role Djimon's character is to Sean Faris'. Is he a father figure, a mentor, or just a hardass? Either way, Djimon's acting was nothing short of impressive, and during a few very emotional scenes, you are reminded why you love this actor so much.<br/><br/>Sean Faris did a surprisingly good job too, I'm forecasting this to be his breakout role.<br/><br/>The dialogue is cheesy at many points, but the actors deliver it well so it works. Also, I've read that this is just a ""fight club/karate kid/rocky"" knockoff. There are definitely a few nods toward these classic flicks, but after seeing the movie, I can honestly say that this one stands on its own. <br/><br/>Oh, and be careful, many of the fight scenes will make you yell obscenities out loud, because they are awesome.

","This is the Casablanca of teen Mixed Martial Arts films for the year 2008. I went in with the lowest expectations, and was disappointed even more so, which makes for better movie. The writers should have done what Jake Tyler didn't do in one of cheesy fight sequences...that is TAPOUT! Plus, they picked the coolest name in cinema history, JAKE TYLER! You can't get any cooler than that. If my parents named me Jake Tyler, I would have gotten more muff than a 70's porn star. The fact that people actually went to see this film and took it seriously perplexes me. This is why the industry keeps making films such as ""Never Back Down"" because every ""TAPOUT"" apparel wearing barbarian thinks that plots, acting, and originality are things of the past. Two words to describe this film...""LAUGH RIOT!"" I was merely going for the sake of humor and heckling, but I believe I gave the American movie going public more credit by thinking they would watch something a little more credible and leave the theater empty for others such as myself going for the exact same reasons. Once again...I was mistaken. Fearing the repercussions of heckling and laughing out loud every time they mentioned the title of the movie in their dialogue would leave me pulverized by the 3 TAPOUT wearing tools in front of me, I kept my laughter at a reasonable volume. Calling this movie a modern day ""Rocky"" or ""Karate Kid"" is an insult to those writers who took the time to create something original for the public in the 80's. Pat Morita must be rolling in his grave....of laughter. HAHAHAHAH!"

Add just enough innuendos so that the kids will believe they are watching actually watching an R rated movie. Then do some final editing for the critics, and you have Never Back Down.<br/><br/>I can see how preteen boys will like this movie for the fights. Or how teenage girls will come to see sweaty male models showing it all on screen. But the overall movie is below standards, and definitely not worth the time or the money. This production is a disappointment from director Jeff Wadlow."

","I saw the film at a screening last night, expecting a hot, angsty white kid, teen romp with lots of inappropriate violence highlighted by super slow motion spit and blood after every shot to the face. I thought I would only be able to laugh at how seriously the movie takes itself. <br/><br/>And thats how it happened. Kind of.<br/><br/>This film is a success in the way that it allows itself to play both as a true fight-movie genre, sure to satisfy the 2008 Karate Kid fans, and a over the top camp spectacle, sure to excite the drunk-in-the-theater, ""Snakes on a Plane!"", hollaring at the screen crowd. It throws in just enough genre references to let the audience know it knows how ridiculous the clichés are, but maintains enough composure to avoid satirizing, leaving the Wayans brothers room to make the easier ""Just Another Fight Movie"". <br/><br/>There are some uncomfortable elements in the film for sure. The way the film takes advantage of class politics (poor white boy from Iowa without a father gets taught to fight by poorer Brazilian man to fight super rich white boy) is cheap, completely subverted by MTV Cribs-like glorification of wealth-- Jake doesn't have a car, but it never becomes more than an a badge of authenticity since new friend Max seems fine with lending him his hot little convertible for the entire story.<br/><br/>Violence is glorified, and the warnings from Hounsou's character never to fight outside the gym play the clichéd moralistic role you'd expect until the final fight scene demands something else.<br/><br/>None of this should be any surprise to audiences and in a way it seems hard to critique the film for them. If the genre is fight film, you've got to play by the genre's conventions and Never Back Down definitely does.<br/><br/>The more intelligent parts of the film occur with Wadlow's original take on the rumor mill, again showing his ability to capture super modern technology on film (remember Cry Wolf's AIM sequences?), this time utilizing viral video and DV camcorders. The fight scenes are well choreographed and shot like a more-than-competent music video. The soundtrack is as sexy as the cast and pace of the film.<br/><br/>In the end this is not a film that will last, but it is also not a film made by inept or unintelligent filmmakers. They know what they are doing, and whether you wish they had done it or not, I think you will be able to appreciate it on whichever level you might choose."

I started thinking that this might have been the worst 8 bucks I have ever spent near the beginning with the tedious overplayed high school drama, but didn't start all out laughing at how bad this movie was until the supporting male friend figure shot off the line ""But you can do what I could never do"" ""What's that?"" the protagonist replies.

The movie sets you up great, has an outstanding and somewhat surprising climax and always keeps you guessing until the very last scene.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this flick to anyone looking for a new twist on a classic genre of film, and if you are looking for awesome performances from a great group of new, somewhat no name actors/actresses.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are probably some of the best I have ever seen. New camera angles, great and surprising sound effects, and some pretty cool effects all play pivotal roles in making the fight scenes somewhat groundbreaking. <br/><br/>Go see this movie! it doesn't matter if you aren't even a fan of the genre itself!

They did a good job of making sure the stunts didn't look fake - it's all very realistic. The way they shot it literally makes you feel like you're in those fights. I was blown away - and exhausted! - by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The story wasn't all that bad - maybe a little predictable, but it didn't matter. It never dragged on or got boring. Djimon Hounsou was awesome, as always.<br/><br/>The camera work, along with the intense stunts and stylistic editing make this a great, fun time. If you like to have fun at the movies, be sure to check this out."
"DICK STEEL","5","4","6","14 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Never Back Down
","Donnie Yen's recent Flash Point provided action movie fans a glimpse of Mixed-Martial Arts, or MMA, where the best of breed techniques in taking down an opponent get gelled together to provide unpredictability in offensive and defensive response, coupled with the transformation of almost every part of the body into a well-oiled mechanism to dish out some serious punishment. But with Hollywood, well, you can bet your last dollar that the philosophy behind this brand of martial arts get dumbed down to 3 words - ""Mix it up"".<br/><br/>Like many movies starring teens and targeting the same demographics, Never Back Down follows a standard formula that most of such movies adopt, especially with taking things to the streets, like Fast and Furious 3, and the Step Up movies, which dealt with different subject matter like street racing, and street dance. Throw a misunderstood teen into a new environment, where he learns that his current skills (if you can call them that) pales in comparison to the boys in the big league. Add a beautiful lass to beguile the protagonist, and she'll either serve as motivation or fodder to get his butt kicked because she just so happens to the antagonist's main squeeze. So in a fight for respect / pride / to get the girl, he goes into training mode, and comes back in time for the finale with chick around arms. That's about it.<br/><br/>So don't go into this movie expecting a lot more. Touting itself as a new fight club, it is anything but, especially with everything cerebral removed from the plot. I also don't see how it won this year's MTV Movie Awards for best fight sequence, as most of it dwelled on grown men hugging tightly on the ground engaged in complex body grinding and twists. Action fans will be a tad disappointed with the quality of fights shown here, as this is not really MMA. I believe if you throw Donnie Yen into the mix, he would pawn everyone in the movie, even those who choreographed the supposedly deadlier moves, which boiled down to a series of boxing hooks and punches.<br/><br/>With the formula in place, everything else will just fall into its rightful position. Sean Faris stars as Jake Tyler, a teen with anger management and guilt issues who can't control his temper and flares up easily when his dad gets insulted. In his new school, he chances upon 2 things, an underground fight club, and hot blonde Baja Miller, who turns out to be the girl of his would-be nemesis Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet), who turns out to be the biggest baddest fighter in school. Losing both the girl and his pride in one fell disgraceful swoop, he undergoes training with MMA exponent Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou) whose rule is simple - you do not fight outside his gym. Expect rules to be broken, expect the two mentor-mentee to bond, expect some rationale to be provided to head to the fight we've been waiting for, and while the peer movies gave us a finale to remember, this one fizzled out with cheap moves.<br/><br/>But I've got to say something about the movie. Fans of Tom Cruise will definitely see shades of Cruise-like characters in Sean Faris. He's like a walking, talking Cruise clone, only that he's younger, taller and more muscular. In fact, if you take Cruise back to his teens, Never Back Down would probably be one of the movies that would fit into his budding filmography. Not that I'm gay here, but seriously, if you happen for any reason, choose to watch this movie, tell me if you agree with me. They shouldn't have billed the movie as the new fight club, they should have billed the movie as starring the next Tom Cruise. Though of course it remains to be seen if Faris can steer clear of crazy couch-jumping antics."
"anjobermudez","7","4","6","29 April 2008"," Decent at best, but definitely not as bad as made out to be
","While those who say that 'Never Back Down' is somewhat a rip off 'Karate Kid' are right on the money, I chose to see it in a different way. I remembered a movie that was fresher in my memory. From what the trailer showed me, and from what watching the film actually confirmed, 'Never Back Down' is actually is in a few ways similar to 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift', albeit substituting fast cars and races with mixed martial arts.<br/><br/>Yes you heard that right. <br/><br/>1) OK, so you have this young stud who always seems to get himself into trouble. <br/><br/>2) He moves into a completely different environment. (Orlando-Tokyo) <br/><br/>3) He meets, and flirts with a hottie who turns out to be the dissatisfied girlfriend of the local bigshot/champion. <br/><br/>4) The young stud knows a little about the sport (Tyler knows a little about fighting, and Sean knows cars), and is challenged by the bigshot. <br/><br/>5) He loses this first confrontation badly, but afterwards, trains to be the best. <br/><br/>6) Eventually, he gets the girl, and he earns respect by defeating the champion.<br/><br/>Now despite the obviously rehashed formula, I still give this 7 stars. Why? Because it is still a pretty entertaining film. Never mind the stereotypes, cheesy lines, and the predictable turn of events. ""Never Back Down"" still manages to keep you watching. The action is good, and although cliché, the substance of the plot is actually quite palatable. It certainly delivers what it is supposed to deliver, nothing more, and nothing less.<br/><br/>So is it worth spending a few dollars to see it in the theatres? I'd say, why not? I believe the reason why this film gets such harsh reviews is because people might have been expecting a little too much. It will definitely not get any critical acclaim, or anything remotely close to such recognition, but it never aspired to do so to begin with. It was never groomed in that fashion anyway. <br/><br/>Just like ""The Fast and the Furious"", it's probably not everyone's cup of tea. Depends on your taste (both these movies dig deep into their particular genre). Some people will enjoy seeing, and talking about cars more than others. In the same way, big fans of fight movies, and Mixed Martial Arts alike(such as myself) will enjoy this film a bit more than others. However, the same rule applies here. I say, just take it as it is, and you'll find that ""Never Back Down"" is actually an enjoyable movie. It's nothing half as bad as it is said to be."

","Yeah, that's how I felt after watching this movie. Granted, this features fighting instead of dancing, at least (yes, I'm ashamed to admit...) the choreography in ""You Got Served"" was pretty kick ass and made up for the watered down story. On the one hand, this movie is ""Karate Kid"" meets ""any number of dance movies we've seen in the last couple of years that all have basically the same story"" but on the other hand this doesn't have the excitement of anything else we've seen in the previous films. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED ""Fight Club"" but at least that movie had cajones. Basically this a rental at best. Three out of ten."

What is the world coming too? Somebody please throw me a good film to watch. I am still vomiting blood from watching this trash. I would pay somebody not to see it.

","Some filmmaker thought one day, since we are running out of ideas lets combine some 80's fighting films like The Karate Kid(1984), and Bloodsport(1988), and what you get is Never Back Down, The story of a teenager named Jake Tyler(Sean Faris, Best known from Yours, Mine, and Ours(2005) has just moved into a new town with mom(Leslie Hope) and younger brother(Wyatt Smith). Jake has a very big chip on his shoulder, and is estanged with his mother. One day after school, Jake is invited to a party, what he thinks is a way to make new friends, ends up turning into a UFC challenge, when Jake is lured into a fight by an antagonist named Ryan McCarthy(Cam Gigandet), although Jake puts up a pretty good fight, he is beaten down badly. In hopes to recover from this humilation, a new friend suggest a karate veteran named Jean Roqua(Djimon Hounsou). Althouh has doubts, he goes anyway. In hopes Jake will learn to exercise his mind and body. And thats all I'm gonna tell you. This film was not all bad, at times predicable, but still good.

"wkup","10","14","34","5 March 2008"," This Movie Has It All
","Before writing ""Never Back Down"" off as a retread of already covered territory: think ""The Karate Kid"" meets ""Friday Night Lights"" with ultimate fighting as a background, think of the elements that made those movies so great: fully fleshed out character who audiences can relate to and themes of pride and fighting for valor. Ulimately, this is what makes this such a winning film.<br/><br/>""Never Back Down"" centers on Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), a teen who has been in his fair share of trouble. When his family moves to Orlando to further the career of his aspiring tennis player brother, Charlie (played winningly by Wyatt Smith). Suddenly a fish out of water, Jake quickly befriends Max (Evan Peterswho plays the best friend/comic relief role perfectly) who is trying to get in with the ultimate fighting circle of their school.<br/><br/>This brings Jake into the eyesight of Ryan McCarthy, the big man on campus. Soon Jake has to make a stand to protect his pride and those he cares about.<br/><br/>Faris plays Jake with so convincingly and with great heart. Whether it's fighting scenes with Cam Gigandet (who plays Ryan with simmering rage and menace that you can't help but be afraid for Jake) or big brother scenes with Wyatt Smith (who plays the youngest Tyler) Faris shows the well-roundedness of this character.<br/><br/>Another great relationship is between Jake and his trainer Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou in another outstanding performance). Roqua, who has his own demons to battle, learns from his student as he teaches.<br/><br/>Aside from the intense and exhilarating fight sequences, amazing camera work and the most perfectly suited soundtrack, what this film has going for it is its sensibility. Unlike other ""teen"" movies, you immediately understand that the writer is not trying to create an idea that the teen life depicted is the norm, but reflective of these specific teens. It creates for a relatability that is usually absent from most teen films. <br/><br/>If for some reason this film does not find an audience in the movie theaters, I believe when it's released on DVD, it will become a cult hit."

","Karate Kid, Rocky and Fight Club all rolled into one!<br/><br/>I've gotta say I actually really liked this film! Had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised! It's well acted, has an interesting story and is full of action! And as eye-candy goes, there's something (or should I say someone) for everyone! <br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou makes a great Mr Miyagi character. And there's even a half decent message to the film too.<br/><br/>There's also an uncanny resemblance to Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the lead characters. I could quite easily have seen them doing this film 20 years ago...and I can see people looking back on this one as the film to break Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet.<br/><br/>If you want a fun, all action evening out, then this is actually worth a trip to the cinema for!"
"andell","5","4","7","18 March 2008"," What's the big deal???
","Okay, I have to admit that before I went to see ""Never Back Down,"" as I searched the myriad of opinions on this film, I was struck at the ranges this movie got. Some people loved it, others hated it. Then I began to notice...most of those who hated the film did so because they seem to believe the film ripped of ""Karate Kid."" Its easy to see that their position is certainly merited- after all, this film is about a young man who is more or less relocated against his will, and finds himself in a situation where someone who is tougher and more talented is putting a pounding on him. Of course as with any film about a 'young man,' throw in the obligatory hurdles and rewards- the pretty girl, the wise man, the single mother, the tragedy, and of course the finale in which he gets even.<br/><br/>Yes, that's ""Karate Kid,"" but its not unique or even original to ""Karate Kid."" And even if it had been, so what- ""Never Back Down"" captures the teen angst angle that ""Karate Kid"" captured almost 25 years ago. What this film has done is essentially recreated it so that a new generation of people can connect with the story- and the recreation includes replacing what was the 'exotic' art of Karate with MMA.<br/><br/>Of course the quality of the two films are not identical. Djimon Hounsou is more than serviceable as the MMA master Jean Roqua- his apparent poverty and mastery of his art conceal his pain and his compassion for his new student, Jake Tyler.<br/><br/>I think one point however has to be made: the insinuation of every kid in Orlando being apparently connected to a mansion and having lavish liquor fueled MMA brawling house parties gets pretty irritating after a while.<br/><br/>But that aside, this story is what it is, and the best advice I can give people who are pondering paying to see this movie is this: if you cannot stomach watching a teen angst movie, or if ""The Karate Kid"" is not a movie you could appreciate in spite of its obvious limitations, then you'd be better served passing up this film."

","This movie was mediocre in every way as far as production went, then I was somewhat attracted to the concept of a fight club (we had those when I was in High School), and it was just bad lol. The main characters don't even look like real fighters, and their technique is flawed all over, some intentional so as not to actually apply pressure on say a triangle choke or an armbar, and some just... weak lol. To be honest neither character looks like they could take a well timed body shot and keep going. I guess this movie was never meant to be beyond just fluff, but it was bad even for that. A waste of Djimon Honsou's acting talent in my personal opinion. What ever happened to getting REAL TALENTED Martial Artists with acting ambitions to star in movies like this? There are plenty of them around in Hollywood! Look at your stunt crew, ffs! Put Tony Jaa (Ong Bak) in a movie like this! That guy is awesome!"

","I understand the low rating for this movie, but I thought it was better than a 6.1, probably in the high 6. I had extremely low hopes for this movie before watching it, but it was way better than expected. I am a big fan of both the TV show 'The Oc' and the awesome movie 'Fight Club', this is a combination of both, but far too less effective. I know this movie is a big cliché, but I really enjoyed it. This movie had a TV show feel to it and I liked that. Sean Faris looks like a younger version of Tom Cruise, too bad he doesn't have the same acting ability level. But it might be because of the mole, it is very distracting.<br/><br/>Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) is a senior high school footballer who has daddy issues (his father was killed in a car accident) and blows off his steam in random fights: be it on the football field or on streets. He is moving to Orlando with his mother and little brother who has got a tennis scholarship and meets Baja Miller (Amber Heard) in class. He immediately has a thing for her, but it turns out she already has a super-rich, hot boyfriend Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). Ryan knows that Jake is a hothead who can fight really well. Being a good fighter himself and also the tough guy at school, he challenges him and kicks his butt, humiliating Jake in front of everybody. Jake's only friend Max Cooperman (Evan Peters) tells him about Jean (Djimon Hounsou), a professional who teaches Jake to control his anger while fighting a fight.<br/><br/>You know rich kids just create unnecessary drama to make themselves feel important. That is what I have learned in my experience. They show it in this and it is very boring in real life, but the movie is enjoyable. The fights were really awesome and that is probably the reason anybody could watch this. I like Cam Gigandet, he was probably born to play the role of bad guys. With his good looks and acting skill, he could easily play the lead role, but he still plays the bad guy very convincingly. I actually hated him for killing off Marissa in 'The OC'. The film succeeds because of him and he has a real story. I don't have any complaints about the script, except it was too predictable. That was not necessarily a bad thing as the director has tried his best to make this an entertaining watch. Baja Miller is simply a prop for Ryan and Jake, she has no character development (she leaves one hot guy for another hot guy). The background music was good and the locations were superb.<br/><br/>7/10"

","NEVER BACK DOWN is one of those movies you may happen upon while surfing the available films released on television and, out of curiosity or lack of better choices, inadvertently watch. The story by Chris Hauty seems to be a popular one, so many versions of this plot are floating around out there: angry lad meets his match in a high school kick boxing cum brutal fighting smooth ruffian and finds his way back to some semblance of normalcy by a dedicated coach. Jeff Wadlow directs this endless violence parade with some interesting faces - the angry young man Jake is portrayed by Tom Cruise lookalike Sean Faris, his 'underground fight club' opponent Ryan is Cam Gigandet - but the reason to keep watching this otherwise bloody mess of a film is the always fine Djimon Hounsou as the coach with experience and heart Jean Roqua. There is little character development and the dialogue is thankfully sparse, but if watching young men beat each other up is entertaining for you, then this is a film to sit through - unless you happen to locate a good book to read. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"Sonny_Darko","3","2","3","1 August 2009"," Never Watch This
","That would be a better title for this movie. I'm going to save your money and summarize the movie in two paragraphs. Let's see, where to start? Our hero, Jake, who has anger/violence problems, is at his high school football game when another complete a-hole kid taunts him that it was his fault that his own father died, setting our hero up in flames and totally hurting the other kid. Are you serious? Who would be an enough jerk to taunt someone with something like a parents death at a football game? Turns out that Jake let his dad drive home drunk after a night at the bar and got into an accident where he died (or something like that). Did I miss something? What's he doing with his dad at a bar at his age in the first place? Eventually he moves to a new school, where the HOTTEST girl (who just so happens to be going out with the BADDEST guy) becomes his love interest. She invites him to the coolest most unrealistic high school party, that neither Van Wilder, nor any of the American Pie movies could ever compare to, (and they've had some really unrealistic ones) where a bunch late twenty something year old models, who were supposed to pass of as high school girls, were walking around in a bikini all over the house and making out with each other in a hot tub. But THE GUYS are more interested in the full contact fights going on in the back yard. Which, by the way, look heavier than any MMA that you see in TV. Really. So at the party the BADDEST guy whoops our hero's butt, making him go train with Mr. Miyagi, I mean, Jean Roqua, where he learns to be a great fighter.<br/><br/>The bad guy has another unnecessary unrealistic party for no good reason other than to show more girls prancing around in their bikini. (not that I'm complaining, it was nice) And then we have the tournament, which the baddest guy happens to be the champ of, making you think, if he's a senior at high school, how old was he when he started fighting MMA in order to be a Full Contact, two year in a row, champion at his age? So anyways, they finally fight again. But it's so intense that they end up leaving the fighting ring and take it outside all the way to the parking lot, where everyone just so happened to park their car in the shape of a circular fighting ring, just in case that something like this would happen. Our fighters finish the fight with the headlights of the vehicles shining on their Hercules' abdomens, after who knows how many minutes of exchanging blows. Jake (good guy) wins, and practically a scene later, he and the bad guy are now friends, even after pulverizing each other, Jake probably sending him to the ER, and stealing his girlfriend. Because all the bad guy ever needed, to lighten up, was a good kick in his behind. Oh yeah, before I forget, our hero obviously won the heart girl with his sensitive side, which really came out of nowhere, being that throughout the whole movie he was a complete a-hole to everyone, especially his mom. We have the CRAZY best friend, who I guess was supposed to pass of as comic relief, but failed. Um let's see, what else? Oh yeah, Mr. Miyagi, er, I mean Mr Roqua, has some problems of his own, but nobody really cares, and at the end I think they get solved too. I'm not really sure, I didn't pay much attention.<br/><br/>So there you have it. This has to be one of the lamest, most unrealistic, predictable, full of cliché, movie I have ever seen. I'm glad I didn't pay for the ticket, being that a friend of mine owed me 10 bucks and bought it for me. Though now that I think of it, I would have rather him given me a 10 dollar bill instead.

","Young, rebellious Jake Tyler (Sean Farris) and his mother and younger brother move from Iowa (or Idaho, can't remember) to Orlando so his brother can get a start in the competitive world of tennis.<br/><br/>The first day he draws attention from the most popular girl, Baja (Amber Heard), and a d-bag of her boyfriend Ryan (Cam Gigandet), who apparently rules the school with iron fists of fury.<br/><br/>Jake quickly befriends Max (Evan Peters), who introduces him to the world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). Baja invites Jake to a party, where Jake is cornered by Ryan and forced to fight after Ryan insulted his father (whom passed away in a car accident that Jake holds himself responsible for). Jake gets the crap kicked out of him, and his ego is just as bruised as his body, and plans retaliation.<br/><br/>Max brings him to his trainer, Jean (Djimon Hounsou), who begins to work with Jake not just physically but mentally as well, helping him focus his pent up anger towards something more useful.<br/><br/>All of which leads to a final showdown between Jake and Ryan...I wonder who is going to win? Alright, I will be sarcastic a bit and say that the ending is none too surprising. It's a typical fight movie, but this one you really don't have someone to root for. Sure, you can support Jake, but he's pretty much a complete d-bag throughout 95% of the film, and the final small bit of the film where he suddenly becomes the un-caped crusader of the poor just doesn't make you want to root for him.<br/><br/>However, I will say that I found the film quite enjoyable, despite being two hours long, it didn't feel like it. And I felt that it was a complete movie, and it wasn't really lacking in anything. It wasn't the movie's fault that it had a predictable ending, 95% of sports movies have that required ending. Don't hold the ending against an otherwise practically flawless movie."

","As a big fan of the early 90's martial arts movies featuring such greats as Jean Claude Van Damme, Jeff Wincott, and Michael Worth etc, there doesn't seem to many great martial arts movies out there at the moment that really gets the blood pumping. There seems to be more focus on CGI, wire work and speed manipulation than some good old fight choreography - (with exception of the Undisputed series, and Blood and Bone - both of which were awesome).<br/><br/>That brings us to this movie. This gave me the same feeling I had as a child when I watched Karate Kid, and No Retreat No Surrender. The script is quite formulaic but everyone plays there parts exceptionally well. Sean Faris is a great lead, and plays off well against Cam Gigandet, both come in great shape for this film with Gigandet looking like he may have focused strongly on calisthenics (looks strong and functional).<br/><br/>The fight scenes are awesome, the acting is spot on, and the soundtrack does nothing to harm the film.<br/><br/>Overall if you like martial art films, then you should really check this out. Great film. One of only a few films that I can happily watch many times. 10/10."

","Lets not talk about the plot and acting beacouse the way I see it it's just an excuse for the fight scenes. (but hey , if you like that ""looser beats the jock and gets the girl"" ...) Fight scenes are pretty accurate : the moves are real and well executed, there is no stupid choreography or stuff like that , it's basically what you'll get in a real MMA match but more condensed. It's also the first movie I ever watched with realistic punch sound. From having been in a cage in several occasions, I can only appreciate the work done with the fight scenes and since it's the first MMA based movie I've ever watched , I'm pretty pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Give it a try if practice martial arts or fighting sports, otherwise you'll focus more on the dull plot and won't get the fights right."

"Haawwkzs","9","5","13","16 March 2008"," Good Movie ; Unfair ratings.
","First off, I feel this movie has very little resemblance with Karate kid if any at all. I Never Back Down a lot more entertaining. The Performances of Sean Faris and Djimon Hounsou were amazing, Oscar winning acting in my opinion. They really took the movie to a whole other level with them in it.<br/><br/>The main primary problem this movie is for most audiences is that not all people can relate to it. The movie is primarily targeted to teenage men and younger crowded audiences, and as you can see by the voting, younger crowds find this movie a lot more entertaining than older crowds.<br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023111/ratings Why? Misunderstandings. A lot of older people feel this movie is just a simple ""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"" in the cafeteria back from their old school days. It's not.<br/><br/>Think of it instead of MMA, it's football, basketball, or baseball. Any other sport. Suddenly a lot more appealing if instead of two kids fighting and ones looking for revenge that it's two teams and ones looking to get back at another, huh? What a lot of the older crowd doesn't understand is that Mixed Martial arts is a SPORT, and they feel it's a immature teen movie with teen drama. Not necessarily. I'm 17, I play football, wrestle and do ju-jitsu. I live in new york and in my school, theirs a small, but noticeable fan base to UFC. However, in Florida (I know this because i visit and plan on going to college there), Mixed martial arts is significantly bigger, and it's not hard to believe that instead of after school basketball games, or pick up football games at the park, that their might be instead a Mixed Martial Arts fight at someones in-house gym. That's what a lot of the older crowd doesn't get, that fighting isn't just a hate and bloodthirsty form of causing someone else harm, but can actually be a friendly but brutal competition, just like any other sport.<br/><br/>When you leave this movie, I can guarantee you tons of teens will be joking around and messing around and reenacting moves like little children. (I promise you, I didn't, but a lot of my friends did) Why? A movie like this gives you a adrenaline rush. The angles of the fights and how well executed the fighting and editing is done is mouth dropping. This is a movie you will occasionally hear cheers during.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very good movie that is likely to be misunderstood by older crowds but either way it will be groundbreaking for future MMA movies and MMA markets including UFC, Pride and Elite XC.<br/><br/>Just remember when you see it, the fighting in this movie is a sport, not a immature war."

","NEVER BACK DOWN is a disgrace. A brutal teen movie that is deliberately made to show handsome 20 somethings (posing as as teens) beating each other in teeth gritting bleeding fistfights as pretty girls cheer and ogle in glee. It is absolutely reprehensible in the way it is made: a cobbled-together story basically about the popular brutality of teens in school as some popcorn movie thrill. Like a perverts FIGHT CLUB this film is made by adults who should know better than to simply use revenge and social decay as an excuse to show fit and healthy guys and their bimbo girlfriends gleefully enjoying bashings. This sickening and frustrating formulaic high school flick wastes the talents and looks of everyone involved. Sean Faris as your hero Tyler is some Tom Cruise look-a-like with someone called Cam Gigandet as his Brad Pitt style nemesis; so obvious is the casting in this image that immediately the films contrivances become obvious. Hammy dialogue as drama, lame arguments between his Mom, misunderstandings that cause you to roll your eyes and moan, and some Karate Kid style gym antics with mentor Dijmon Hounsou just add to the irritation in their half baked imitative style of other better films. NEVER BACK DOWN was a bomb in Australia and it even failed during the school holidays as bright healthy happy Aussie teens ignored it and had fun at the beach instead. This is the fist-fight-porn version of the disgusting NAKED MILE: American PIE. NEVER BACK DOWN fails on every level. If all this is not enough to put you off, then please let me also advise you it is filmed by handy-cam, with idiotic closeups and wobbly picture. Terrible and offensive in every way. A contrived exploitive vicious mess. Even our hero's nerd pal is there and cops a beating to ensure the climax is about revenge.... This disgusting degenerative and derivative film is directed by someone who wants you to enjoy teenagers bashing each other, and the film as a production actually fosters the social blight of kids filming schoolyard fights for YouTube."
"shanestgermain","5","3","7","9 August 2008"," You know its bad when one of the quotes on the back of the box is from a critic who gave it a negative review...
","""Never Back Down"", or Karate kid vs teenage Tyler Durden at the O.C, is just as cliché and silly as it sounds. A ""tough guy"" teenager named Jake who looks like a cross between any guy in the O.C and Tom Cruise switches schools after his little brother gets a tennis scholarship. Now at this school, the kids see a youtube video of you beating up people within two days and all these kids straight out of the Hills care about is fighting. Jake is asked to a party by an overly good looking generic girl who seems to think it is nerdy to know what the English teacher is talking about and to wear a flannel shirt invites Jake to a party. At this party he is challenged to a fight with a teenage rip off of Fight Clubs Tyler Durden and he is destroyed because apparently overly good looking teenagers are also UFC champions. He then is trained by a Black version of Mr.Miagi and seeks guidance by his best friend, a Shai Lebouf rip off. This movie is basically a modernized rip off of Karate Kid. Its too bad that the modern ages suck and this cliché movie is complete with cheese ball lines, over the top fights, and a cast straight out of any teenage melodrama show. I give it 2 and a half stars because i loved karate kid and found this rip off to be so bad that its sort of entertaining just to see what silly thing happens next. See Karate Kid instead."

","I've been training MMA for years now. I started out wayyy before the MMA craze, starting with Muay Thai, adding boxing, and later down the road BJJ. I've been training at Ivan Salaverry's MMA for the past year or so, a gym filled with professional REAL fighters. I've trained with Ivan, Maurice Smith, Anderson Silva, Antonio Noguera,and more.<br/><br/>I can say with first hand experience that this movie is everything MMA and the UFC are trying NOT to be. It's chock full of cheesy, ignorant, wanna-be fighter b.s. that will only appeal to teenage boys that want an excuse to fight. Don't give me the flimsy ""but Jake didn't WANT to fight, don't you see?"", this movie is bulls**t Hollywood crap made for impressionable teens. It's plot line sucked, and was much better 20 years ago when it was called ""The Karate Kid"".<br/><br/>However, it's not only the plot that makes it terrible (although it doesn't help). It's that I can't imagine how many stupid kids are going to fight each other in the parking lot because they're dumb and don't realize that this isn't at all representational of what MMA is like or even really about.<br/><br/>Take it from someone who's fought, trained, gotten to know some of the best there is, and watches almost everything concerning MMA with no shame (I've been to every kind of event from small local shows to the UFC itself). This isn't MMA. This is: Hollywood+ 90210+ Recycled fighting movie plot= Never Back Down, the worst waste of time for anyone over 17 with an brain (even worse if you have fighting experience).<br/><br/>Skip it, no matter how much of a fan you are.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan?

"wolfclaws22","8","2","4","4 April 2009"," Not as bad as you may think...actually its down right pretty good
","Never Back Down was maybe the surprise movie of 08 for me. I went into it not exactly expecting much from it. Now to get it out of the way it is basically Karate Kid with a fresh coat of paint on it. But what made me enjoy it was the focus on MMA and how well its transitioned. Also unlike Karate Kid the hero in this case actually seems to be able to hold his own in fight. There was no way Daniel-San should have beat a legit black belt and he should have actually left in a body bag...at least a stretcher. any way onto the Goods.<br/><br/>I love MMA and they paid so much attention on showing the moves and techniques correctly. The story may not have been strong but there are plenty of fights that tell a story without any words being said at all. Especially the end fights which many seem to be overlooked by many. Pacing was just great as there are buildups that make sense. No big fights immediately but a great payoff. The acting by all the leads (Hounsou, Faris and Gigandet) were great and played their characters well.<br/><br/>The bad...the soundtrack, very generic mainstream stuff (Green Day, Gym Class Heroes, and Travis Barker mixes). The script could of used some work although I did love the line ""that old school boxing **** doesn't cut it anymore...ya gotta mix it up."" A line that speaks volumes. The camera work seems to be amateur at times. Very odd zooms at pan shots and all the acting by supporting cast was just hit or miss mostly on the miss side.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good flick. Lots of fun and although it wont make you run out and join a MMA team it does accomplish its goal of being a flick you can enjoy. Its finally getting looped on TV so if its on i highly recommend it."

You won't be surprised with an unbelievable plot twist... but still, there are many redeeming qualities here. The direction and the music are quite sharp.

I also liked how they postponed the fact that the lead had felt a sense of responsibility for his fathers death and the circumstances behind it.<br/><br/>This film looks good...sounds good... it's entertaining, and despite some VERY familiar moments, Never Back Down delivers.

","Seriously, this film could not be more 2007-'08. Not only does it feature a great soundtrack of many of the hit songs of '07 (including two singles by ""The Bravery"") but it also fairly encapsulates the rise of YouTube as well as the underground MMA fighting scene that also rapidly began to acclimate to the mainstream, as both services became public only two years prior in 2005 (Ultimate Fighter was the first non-PPV UFC broadcast).<br/><br/>However, I'll admit, the film may not be historians first choice to put in a time capsule. The camera work was a little bit claustrophobic for my taste, as you may notice most of the shots are very up-close and above the torso. On the acting and directing angle, Evan Peters' as Max Cooperman was a bit over the top. However, the writing for the character was redeeming, as he didn't turn out to be the ineffectual sidekick I assumed his character would be (I remember his face from ""Kick-Ass"").<br/><br/>The other acting performances are quite tame, but the meat is really on Djimon Hounsou, who plays an MMA instructor in the film, and his performance is very, very good here. The film also offered some cool visual effects and techniques to really emphasize the hard hitting/fast action moments during the fight scenes as well.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Never Back Down"" sets out on what it was supposed to do. It does it's job well and doesn't really hold itself back. 8/10 scores are safe recommendations and most likely re-watches from me. And did I say that the soundtrack is full of bangers?"

Of course teenagers have always liked these kinds of movies, about self-destructive behavior, which is all that it really is about.

The acting is pathetic, the photography, if you can even call it that, is so bad as to lead me to think that the people operating the cameras had never used cameras before, except maybe cell phone cameras. Not the very worst movie I've ever seen, but just one more movie of a genre that doesn't offer anything of any real value. I like Amber Heard, but not nearly enough to sit through this piece of junk."

","Jake Tyler is a tough kid who leads with his fists, and often, with his heart. He is the new kid in town with a troubled past. He has recently moved to Orlando, Fla., with his family who has relocated to support his younger brother's shot at a professional tennis career. Jake was a star athlete on the football team at home, but in this new city he is an outsider with a reputation for being a quick tempered brawler. Making an attempt to fit in, at the invitation of a flirtatious classmate, Baja, Jake goes to a party where he is unwittingly pulled into a fight with a bully named Ryan McDonald. While he is defeated and humiliated in the fight, a classmate introduces himself to Jake and tells him about the sport known as Mixed Marshall Arts (MMA). He sees a star in Jake and asks that he meet with his mentor, Jean Roqua,. It is immediately apparent to Jake that MMA is not street fighting, but rather an art form he wants to master. Roqua will take Jake under his wing, but it is up to Jake to find the patience, discipline, willingness and reason within him to succeed. For Jake, there is much more at stake than mere victory. His decision will not just settle a score; it will define who he is."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","0","0","19 September 2014"," Unoriginal and predictable film that has a real 'MTV feel' about it - not a total failure, but it's hardly brilliant at the same time
","Let's all be honest with each other this is a re-hash of The Karate Kid; OK let's look at it; troubled kid moves from Iowa to Florida, tries to stop a fight and then falls predator to local tough guy Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). McCarthy beats up the protagonist Jake Tyler (Sean Faris - who has a spooky resemblance to a young Tom Cruise) and thus setting up the plot. Tyler wants to get the better of McCarthy although initially it is merely because he envies his lifestyle and his girlfriend Baja Miller (the unbelievably hot Amber Heard), but as the film progresses, Tyler finds that he not only has to take on McCarthy, but he must also fight his inner demons as well.<br/><br/>Anyone who has watched this film and who has seen the Karate Kid will undoubtedly see the similarities; the weedy out of town kid, the necessity to fight for the women that they love (Shue in the Karate Kid and Heard in this film), at this juncture it doesn't particularly make it bad but it's hardly original and it kind of made me think that we've got a 'been there done that' kind of scenario. The romance angle between Tyler and Miller is exactly the same as in The Karate Kid (both protagonists get their asses kicked and then train to overcome their enemies with Mr Miyagi being the trainer in the first film and Jean Roqua in this film (played by the excellent Djimon Hounsou). The whole soppy romance between Miller and Tyler was completely predictable as was the way the film ended- although the way it fooled the audience into believing that McCarthy and Tyler would fight in the ring was moderately surprising it did cheapen the effect somewhat by giving it a Rocky V feel.<br/><br/>Where this film succeeds slightly is in the subtext and character development that it offers; we learn that Jake Tyler's father died when he drove back drunk when Jake was in the passenger seat. Jake knew that he could have prevented it and yet in his own words 'did nothing about it'. I think that this explains nearly every scene in this film - the initial involvement in the fight, his tenacity and desire never to give up. I think he was partly doing it to prove himself to his dad, but more importantly to prove to himself that he wasn't gutless which he ultimately shows in the end. This film had some great subtext if you're prepared to look for it, it's just a shame that it's something that we've seen time and time again.<br/><br/>One major problem that this film suffers from is that it has a real 'MTV' feel about it. I understand that a 'score' or 'music' can be used to evoke emotion, but in this film it felt like it was just there for no other reason other than to pander for the MTV generation. It was over used, not emotive, not moving.<br/><br/>The film's climax is predictable and is something that anyone with an IQ in double figures could have figured out after 5 minutes. The acting was generally OK by everyone (except Cam Gigandet's portrayal of Ryan McCarthy - my god he was awful). Djimon Hounsou gave probably the best performance.<br/><br/>Overall, this wasn't a complete waste of time, but it's hardly ground breaking and I thought when it ended that I'd seen it before and much better."

","Never Back Down knows where it is to cover, and knows its audience. All of this eventually leads up to the big showdown in an underground tournament that just so happens to take place at one of Orlando's hottest night clubs.<br/><br/>The fight scenes themselves are energetic and impressive, especially considering the cast involved. The film could have been helped by less shaky camera movements during these sequences, but fight choreographer Damon Caro deserves a lot credit for crafting brawls that stay fairly true to the MMA style.<br/><br/>Hounsou really stands out as the best thing in the film. both in terms of acting and fighting technique. During his training sequences he displays impressive speed, agility and fluidity. It's too bad we never get to see him in a proper fight scene. The story does have its moments, but for the most part it's a paint-by-the-numbers affair.<br/><br/>Never Back Down has been compared to several films which came before it, and for good reasons because it shares many similarities to other films. It takes parts from the Karate Kid, Fight Club, You Got Served, with several other elements from The O.C.<br/><br/>Never Back Down is solid for what it is, as it entertains the audience but the storyline is far too predictable, and really not that interesting.
==================
As a rewatch (06/19/18') Never Back Down does what it was intended for and is a satisfying and enjoying watch. Although as mentioned before, the film is filled with many cliches and takes bits and parts from past films, Never Back Down is still quite entertaining. Rating changed from 6 to 7"

It's a bit of 'Fight Club', but it doesn't have the writing skills. The kids are OC wannabes. The setup of the story isn't quite good enough. The bully barely has to push him before punches are thrown. And Hounsou is no Miyagi. At least the bare bones are there underneath. It slavishly follows a certain formula without answering some basic questions. As always the characters need to call the cops. The message is corrupted by the need for the big final fight."

","Overall I found Never Back Down entertaining, although there wasn't anything about it that I feel was ""great"". The storyline has been used time and time again, but for fans of the genre it is worth your time to take this film for a spin. Some of the MMA action and training included some unexpected accuracy, especially how the training focused on position, functional strength with high endurance, and technique. Some fans of the sport will be disappointed that MMA is portrayed as an underground ring, and not as a fully sanctioned event however those same fans may also remember how MMA began at its roots. Fans of martial arts movies and/or action movies in general will at least appreciate the multiple fight scenes and pretty girls walking around in bikinis."

","Once again, like some mangy old dog who refuses to die, Hollywood regurgitates past 'feasts' to pick through the stew of ideas and pull aside the morsels it considers to be worth digesting once more. The offerings aren't even warmed over any more though, and the result is cardboard tasteless. This woeful effort updates those American movies from the 80s (which were themselves updates of Oriental films from the 70s) in which a young protagonist 'finds' himself with the guiding hand of a wise mentor and a talent for cracking skulls.<br/><br/>Sean Faris plays Tyler our outcast hero, living with a mother he doesn't get on with and a precocious younger tennis-playing brother. Tyler's carrying a lot of baggage because his dad died after he let him drive drunk (a fact demonstrated with admirable subtlety by the large number of cardboard boxes he never unpacks when his reduced-size family moves house). Tyler didn't do anything to stop his dad getting behind the wheel you see, and sometimes doing nothing is the wrong thing to do. Same as sometimes you have to be true to yourself, and you have to accept yourself for who you are; you have to know when to make a stand and when to give way, and you have to roll with the punches and realise that right is right and wrong is wrong.<br/><br/>Did I miss anything? Oh yeah – you must never, ever, under any circumstances, back down <br/><br/>Tyler's mentor, a black dude who lives in his low-rent gym and only accepts clients on the condition that they won't use their fighting skills in the outside world (yeah, right) spends all but the last ten minutes of the film banging on about how violence is the solution to nothing before changing his mind. Turns out violence is the solution after all. (How stupid does he feel?) <br/><br/>The violence has to be Hollywood hot, though. You know the sort of thing: it must be performed by (and perpetrated upon) tanned and sculpted bodies in such a way that any resulting bruises will blend tastefully in with the owner's golden-fleshy hues. These injuries might cause a few stiff movements but won't prevent their owner from springing into retaliatory action the split-second their opponent leaves an opening. No blood, other than an occasional trickle at the corner of a mouth, must be seen, regardless of how many times we see a fist hitting its off-screen target with mechanical, piston-like ferocity. In short, it has to be sexy, surrounded by busty bikini-clad high school girls, and have all the nasty sights and sounds excised for the sake of the sensibilities of its mid-teen audience (judging by the aforementioned sanitisation and lack of expletives).<br/><br/>Everything about this film – other than the bad guy, who makes an impression – is very ordinary and totally unoriginal. Every now and then a few cheap philosophical platitudes are thrown into the mix in an attempt to add a little depth, but that's really just the writer going through the motions. The only difference between this film and its countless ancestors is the use of the internet"

","Well what do we have here? A latent homo-erotic MMA film about pretty boys who love to fight. If you people by that, whats next? A hard-boiled crime thriller starring Zach Effron??? Being a student of martial arts for 10 years of my life and a fan of martial arts cinema for most of my life, it baffles me when people say how 'realistic' the fights were. If you mean glamorised by loud rock/rap music playing, slo-mo and sped up action at the same time, and quick editing to hide the inability of the stars... i guess you don't know much about martial arts movies.<br/><br/>The story is of some pre-puberscent high school kid who moves to Florida with his family and falls for the school hottie. But a metro-sexual bully feels threatened by his presence, so he offers a challenge in a MMA fight. He loses, you know the rest, he joins a school, bonds with his sensei, kisses/sleeps with the girl/wins a few fights and ends up victorious in the end.<br/><br/>If you've watched the 80's movies 'The Karate Kid', 'Kickboxer' and 'Bloodsport' (which are a lot more better) you know what this film is about. The fight choreography is possibly the worst I have seen in years, none of the lead actors possess the ability to kick ass with style as you would expect. It's kind of hard to believe such trash was released at the cinemas, it deserves to be straight to video schlock.<br/><br/>If you seek a decent underground fight movie of recent years, watch 'Fatal Contact' (2006), the fight scenes are better and much more convincing."

A young Steve McQueen.<br/><br/>And the film-makers show due homage to the U-Tube/mobile phone generation; and a hilarious line in the film re using X-Box must be amongst the best of the worst for an attempted pick up. <br/><br/>Mind you the enthusiasm for violence in the play sends completely the wrong message as the injuries and damage which will result from the type of fights shown is never properly dramatized, indeed quite the reverse it is minimized and portrayed erroneously. But surely whoever sees the film can appreciate that?

","This is one of the most masculine-positive films I have ever seen in my entire life! Sure there's a lot of sweat and hot muscle everywhere you look! But that takes a big back seat to genuine character development - with the primary focus being on the muscle on the left side of your chest (Your Heart)! What an incredibly intelligent story! If only Hollywood could have the courage to do this more often - A ""Fight Club"" type movie with zero, I repeat, zero exploitation or gore! This rare, one-of-kind movie is even suitable for older children to watch! It is so sophisticated, in fact, I would even recommend it as an excellent resource for Anger Management classes! <br/><br/>The fight choreography is mind boggling! It certainly looks like full contact! If you watch closely you could even learn some very good moves!<br/><br/>It also made me reflect on my own High School experience! Where there were certainly a lot of aggressive and vicious bad guys, but very few good guys to stand-up to them. It amazes me to this very day how some teenage boys develop powerful, man-like bodies at an early age, but have the emotional maturity of a turnip! Is this a universal in American society? All this aggressiveness and malevolence to those physically weaker than one's self? Where does it come from? Is it some sort of malfunctioning biological drive? Or learned at home from an abusive parent? If only we could find the right physical trainer as our hero did! Wow! It could move mountains for so many people who are constantly bullied by their fellow, physically stronger classmates!<br/><br/>Never Back Down is neither maudlin or trite! It discusses real issues we all will face at some point in our life - like making a big mistake, relocating to a different community, falling in love, defending one's self from physical or emotional harm, dealing with the loss of a loved one, submitting to someone wiser than yourself, and learning to manage anger, regret and grief!

Ryan was a bit scary he loved to hurt people for know reason and Jake did not want to fight but he had to at the end and the fight with Ryan was intense. I did not know what was going to happen. But at the end the good guy won and got the girl and never had to fight again. I think of the movie as a Step Up on steroids or a really really great Karate Kid movie.

","All i have to say is WOW. This movie is actually very good compared to what i thought it was gonna be. The title itself is enough to say how powerful this movie is. The action NEVER BACKS DOWN, the intensity NEVER BACKS DOWN, and the whole damn movie NEVER BACKS DOWN for a single second. <br/><br/>One thing that really caught my eye was the amount of action that was pumped into this movie. Nearly every scene that involves fists and bodies flying never strays away from the term ACTION. <br/><br/>Some of the acting is sublime, but it isn't totally bad as in Uwe Boll style acting. More like Paul W.S. Anderson acting, which isn't entirely bad. <br/><br/>The drama carefully crafts itself into the movie without destroying it. The drama isn't sublime, but it's moderate to almost half-over average.<br/><br/>The fight scenes will probably catch the most attention from the movie (of course). Every single fight scene looks so perfectly fleshed out, even if you can't fully see whats going on at times. The climax is what really caught my eye. There are some pretty intense moments in the climax, and lets just say that ""what goes around comes around"" and leave it at that. <br/><br/>The only true problems I had with this film is its lack of originality. There are a few clichés from Fight Club and Rocky, but they don't get in the way that much. Another problem would be its story. It isn't all that complex, and is quite simple to understand that even an 8 year old could probably figure out. Not to that its too much of a bad thing, its just that it could of had a little more kick to it. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie was rather enjoyable, and definitely the best movie I've seen so far this year. It's definitely not Fight Club, and sure as hell isn't Rocky, but it will do amongst all the other awesome fighting movies out there."

So has Jeff Wadlow.<br/><br/>The glorious strands of one-dimensionality, based off of slavish devotion to those three films, course through Never Back Down, a plodding, braindead rich-kid hybrid of the three that, had it not occasionally gotten so amusingly boffo ludicrous, would have been damn near unbearable to sit through.<br/><br/>We have a myriad of types on display for you to enjoy, including Our Hero, Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), a pugnacious prodigy who is, of course, damaged goods. His father died in a car accident when he drunkenly wrapped his junker around a pole with Jake in the car. Jake was like 16 and probably should have driven that day, something that haunts Jake unceasingly, and something with which the folks on the football gridiron use as ammunition while Tyler is omnisciently slaughtering them (the film gives us several minutes of football footage, and not a single person other than Jake makes a tackle, despite being one of eleven guys and the plays concluding all about the field). He ends up roughing up a dude on the field, which, thanks to YouTube, follows him to his new school in Florida, where he DOESN'T WANNA FIGHT ANY MORE! But he is induced to by our second type, Cockyrival McDouchebag, aka our very own Cobra Kai, Ryan McCarthy (the ridiculously-named Cam Gigandet) He's a impossibly proficient mixed martial artist, and he goads Our Hero into fighting him at a party after kissing his girlfriend, the preposterously-named Baja (Amber Heard), aka Love Interest, whom Our Hero has struck up an acquaintance with (in an amusingly artificial classroom scene where he expounds on the anti-war intricacies of The Iliad), and is a bit smitten.<br/><br/>Also in this class, he meets our Annoying Sidekick, Max (Evan Peters), who saw him on YouTube and invites him to train with this film's Miyagi, the mythical Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou, looking like he really wanted the paycheck). Roqua warns him that his class is not to be used for fighting in the real world. Our Hero agrees, and thus begins this movie's peculiar sense of morals, most succinctly personified by a pivotal late scene. Let me set the table here: Cocky McDouchebag, to get Our Hero to fight at a secret underground Totally-Not-Fight-Club fight club, assaults Annoying Sidekick, putting him in the hospital. Our Hero informs Love Interest that he's going to the fight club and fighting him. Love Interest, rightfully, intones that this is exactly what Douchey wanted him to do, to desire revenge. Our Hero screams that what he's doing ""isn't about revenge!"", then proceeds on a course of action that can directly, 100% ONLY be defined as ""revenge"" (by doing exactly what Cocky wanted him to). The film seems to believe that ""to exact punishment and take vengeance, retaliation to avenge for injuries or wrongs"" somehow does not equal ""revenge"", and by this point, both his mother (who was vehemently opposed to him even training in a gym not three scenes prior) and Djimon Miyagi (who has his own retarded backstory for not fighting) are totally down with doing exactly what he had planned to do the entire movie, except now because the script told them it wasn't revenge, I guess it's okay.<br/><br/>The film is far more tolerable than a lot of the crap this year, mostly because it's so gosh darn silly, and my recommendation would be to rent this with a large group of your most boisterous friends, revel in the bone-crunching action, and mock the rest of it. I promise, you'll have a great time.<br/><br/>{Grade: 4/10 (C-) / #41 (of 62) of 2008}"

The action was pretty good, and the movie was visually pleasing. However, most of the plot was predictable. Actually, about half of the things that an average person would predict didn't manage to materialize. The few moments with supporting characters felt like last minute edits to the script. The main story-line didn't hold up too well. However, the action was pretty intense. The fight scenes don't stress your eyes out. The soundtrack is slightly annoying, however. The film did manage to balance an abundance of shirtless guys with a decent amount of attractive females. The 'love scene' actually was more tasteful than most movies like this.

Director Jeff Wadlow and Writer Chris Hauty's ""Never Back Down"" is set in the world of mixed martial arts, perhaps its solely inventive aspect. The movie is derivative of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Rocky"". Sean Faris, who looks like Tom Cruise-- only tall and much younger, plays Jake Tyler, who is also the classic Cruise character: the brooding loner with an incomplete relationship with his dead father. In ""Never Back Down"" inspired by the presence of Djimon Hounsou's Jean Roqua and Faris's Jake, one trains very hard so that one never has to fight. But when one has to fight or take a stand, it's about honor-- not revenge or pride. Roqua reminds Jake, ""It's your responsibility to control the outcome"" An eloquent interpretation is: You must be at cause in the matter. ""Never Back Down"" is shamelessly pedantic at times. Then again what is often trite has a familiar resonance. Roqua tells Jake, in whom he sees greatness and great anger, ""Everyone's got their fight."" That fight may be against a powerful opponent or against oneself. Therein lies the characters' catharsis, and Hounsou and Faris are very strong. The mixed martial arts are flashy and bloody, and the romance is a formulaic afterthought. That being said, ""Never Back Down"" gets it right for honor and family.<br/><br/>We first see Jake (Faris) as the devastating Iowa high school linebacker, who literally takes out five other players when one of the opposing team players taunts him about his father's death. Jake's football career ends. Jake, his brother Charlie (Wyatt Smith) and their mom Margot (strong Leslie Hope) move to Florida. Charlie has a scholarship at a Florida tennis academy. Apparently, Jake has been in persistent trouble since his father's death, and something remains unresolved. During the move, Jake stores his Dad's belongings in a box labeled ""Useless Junk"". Margot is at a loss for what to do with Jake. She too may hold him responsible for his father's death.<br/><br/>In English class Jake rescues beautiful Baja (Amber Heard), by pointing out that the shield of Achilles in ""The Iliad"" represents the alternative to war. Okay, this is little heavy handed on Writer Hauty's part. Baja invites Jake to a party. Jake smitten by her, accepts. However, this is a set up. Jake's football brawl on YouTube made him a celebrity, and also a target for Baja's boyfriend Ryan McCarthy (arrogant and totally ripped Cam Gigandet). Ryan is a rich kid and an expert mixed martial artist. Although he is all heart, Jake gets his ass kicked convincingly. However, his spirit attracts the attention of Max (geeky Evan Peters). Max tells Jake that he should train with his mixed martial arts instructor Jean Roqua (Hounsou), who learned from the Gracies' in Brazil. Reluctantly, Jake begins training. Roqua sees the great anger in Jake, but he also sees a great young man that will emerge. For Roqua it is all about training, discipline, and character. His rule is: You fight outside; you don't come back. Predictably, treachery and tragedy arise and Jake must choose his path in the realm of an underground mixed martial arts tournament. Jake comes to the realization, ""So it's on me?"" And it always has.<br/><br/>The major weakness of the movie is Amber Heard as Baja. Heard is very pretty and charming. However, her Baja is reprehensible. This is more a failing of Hauty. Baja may have been Ryan's pawn, but she still initially set Jake up. Clearly, she could have figured the consequences given what an arrogant jerk Ryan isshe is not stupid by a long shot. Baja is only forgiven, because Jake mans up and accepts responsibility for that particular outcome. Otherwise, the other performances are solid. Gigandet is a surprise, particularly at the end. He is charismatic and cocky, but is no coward underneath it all. Hounsou is powerful and compassionate as mentor Roqua. Sean Faris has star presence. He is a great looking actor with amazing intensity. He has also displays a wry sense of humor, and a natural vulnerability.<br/><br/>""Never Back Down"" is cheesy, predictable, and derivative. It also has some amazing mixed marital arts action, and strong performances. ""Never Back Down"" really surprises with its story of honor and courage. Take a chance on ""Never Back Down""."

","My wife and my friends did not want to see this movie last Saturday, and I wanted too. So sad! We saw a awful movie instead. On Sunday my wife and I went to the movie, and it was great. The movie had a great theme were one fights in order to have peace. The antagonist fought for the wrong reasons glory, and attention. The mix of mixed martial art, a love interest, and the kid who got over his anger is a great story. Never Back down also show why the characters act the way they do. I hope the antagonist learned some humility from his defeat. 6 out of 10. Decent Karate movie. I love those movie and the crowd which attends them even more. 6 out of 10. PS I will never grow up."

","Apart from the predictability of the plot and the representation of the Rich Kid lifestyles, I actually thought that the film was pretty damn good.<br/><br/>The choreography of the fighting in it was expertly done. Also I thought that the message the film was trying to convey was good, it shows that family and education is important and worth fighting for, and is put across in an easy to understand way.<br/><br/>Also it sort of shows that violence is a bad route, believe it or not! But basically I think that the film is just an easy to enjoy Action movie, that doesn't require any thought. And I would recommend it to anybody that has ever enjoyed any action or martial arts movie."
"vanneero","1","1","2","9 June 2014"," A reprehensible piece of fetid, noxious sludge
","Putrid, awful, ugly, exasperating, moronic, insufferably boring, terribly written, terribly acted, morally reprehensible and completely rotten to the core, Never Back Down might just be one of the worst films ever made. It is one of those films that is all about trite clichés, and such films can often be made very well, but Never Back Down is so lazily made that you can almost hear director Jeff Wadlow yawning in the background. The film's message is old and familiar: if you're a boring nobody who is constantly bullied by tough guys at school, don't ever tell about those problems to anyone, because you can start studying martial arts instead and beat up the tough guys, after which everyone respects you and even get to date a hot chick! Yuck. The acting is laughably bad across the board, with Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet delivering the most charmless and bland performances you'll ever see. Amber Heard is very pretty (which is the only positive thing you can say about the film), but she's awful as well, and even Djimon Hounsou, the only qualified actor here, is completely wasted in a clownish role. I don't think even the most die-hard fans of mixed martial arts get anything out of this piece of crap other than a bad temper. Never Back Down is a film that I not only utterly loathe, it's a film that I disdain."

","The film begins with a game of rugby in which Jake has a fight with one of the opponents after he talked bad about his father, who is deceased. He then moves to a new school where he is the witness of a fighting between some students and intervenes to split them and in this manner is seen by others as a potential combatant for the champion there Ryan, undefeated in a famous beating competition. He is punched in the face by Max the guy who need help. Then he knows Baja the school sensation, one of the most popular and beautiful girls in high school and ironically she is Ryan's girlfriend. She invited him to a party at which he comes only to find out that in fact it was brought there to fight with Ryan. He beats Jake even more he humiliates him in front of all the other guests there. Is upset on Baja for bringing him in this trap, then with the help of Max, he meets a good martial arts trainer from witch he will take lessons and will work out as he prepares for the great contest where champion Ryan awaits. What I didn't liked about this movie:<br/><br/>The fact that although his mother does not agree that his son to fight, she is the one who goes to the gym to pay the instructor.<br/><br/>How does Jake beat three guys much bigger and more massive, stronger than him and may overcome? <br/><br/>Max that the whole movie given a single fist and that one in the face of Jake, everything he does is to shoot every battle and post it on the internet and to boast in front of the girls as he is the one that trains Jake.<br/><br/>At the party teenagers there when they saw that one of them doesn't want to fight they were beginning to boo and thumbs down but when the battle began and the two gave themselves punches started to applause and were very happy, encouraging and enthusiastic.<br/><br/>Instead of measure their muscles to find out which is the best, better would measure their brain and play a game of chess.<br/><br/>Rather than feeling rage with Jake in this movie better listen for two hours of chill-out music so your head will not be nervous but will be relaxed."

Jack it's a good guy but he have problems with emotions because of his father's death and reacts badly to provocations and the other things. He decides to learn to fight seriously to get back at Rian (a fighter who won the BeatDown twice) because Rian gave him a big beating. Oseu coach does not accept fights out of the gym and during the film, Jack ends up messing up but eventually get back to the gym and when you try to leave things well, Rian ""forced him"" to enter the BeatDown to fight.

","Many users said it best when they said it is a rip off of the Karate Kid. I will admit the movie has some entertainment value and I will probably watch it again at some point. Here are my problems with it: 1- So you are telling me that a mom that is struggling financially is going to move from Iowa to Orlando where the cost of living is higher because her 10 year old son plays tennis? This was one of my biggest problems with the movie. The writer should have come up with a much better reason for the move.<br/><br/>2- The kid sucked at tennis. The scene it shows him playing in, he has no skill at all.<br/><br/>3- Max is laughing and having a good time while getting his face beat in and bloodied.<br/><br/>4- Max does not even know Jake, yet googles his name and finds the fight he got in in Iowa. The whole school stares at Jake as he walks the halls. That shiz just doesn't happen. Sorry.<br/><br/>Weak plot, weak character development, bad acting by ""Ryan"" and every cliché in a movie you could ask for."
"billy_bob_stapel","4","1","2","1 April 2010"," Never Back Down aka MMA Kid...
","Well this is a basically a run out of the mill, average Martial Arts movie with some novelties thrown into the mix. A great actor like Mr. Hounsou wasted his talent in this one, though I was surprised and happy that some of the action scenes and especially the training segments made this predictable junk rather entertaining. There is also a lot of eye candy here to be seen, pretty girls in tight dresses and shirtless, built men who clobber on each other, if that is your kind of thing. <br/><br/>Like I mentioned earlier some of the action scenes are pretty OK. We got rolling cradles, arm bars, triangle choke holds etc. I love jujitsu and traditional wrestling so I thought the filmmakers indeed did quite a good job in showing those techniques on the silver screen, It is quite overdone of course, It is a Hollywood movie after all. However the story lacks, most of the characters are downright dumb and annoying, you have to suspend your disbelief quite a lot to swallow any of this. <br/><br/>Now, many people are arguing about the spirituality this movie lacks and I agree there is none. It is a prime example how the American media butchered the truly graceful arts of VALE TUDO etc. It has been botched for a mere violent circus attraction. I never agreed with cage fighting in the first place, at least there are some rules in it these days. Back in the day when the UFC was in its baby shoes, it reminded me more of a bloody gladiatorial challenge then anything else. <br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, I was also caught in the mix and watched UFC, PRIDE every now and then. There are also a lot of fighters I have respect for but some are just knuckleheads that enter the cage for a beat-down and to let go of their violent tendencies. At least better in a cage then on the streets. <br/><br/>This movie emphasizes on the knucklehead factor quite a lot. Its even a bit scary. The movie wants you to believe that brawling is the coolest thing on earth, a real chick magnetizer and the answer to all our problems...reality is much harsher and unforgiving. Youngsters these days group on you and at least in this movie we have one on one fights which seem to be fair for the most parts.<br/><br/>Nobody takes knifes or guns to the fight so maybe that is the spirituality the director wanted to express. It is not realistic but pretends to be, I just hope that young males and females do not get the the impression that if you train for a few days you can become the next UFC champion. With every form of martial arts it takes years of dedication and discipline even more so in this sport because it emphasizes on so many applications such as grapples and strikes.<br/><br/>I repeat it is still just a movie so just sit back and enjoy the action for what it is worth. If you look for a realistic, spiritual outlook on martial arts better watch the Japanese movie black belt. That is a true martial arts movie. If you look for entertaining Kong Fu flicks, well as a fan you should know. Check out the jet Li's, Donnie Yens etc.<br/><br/>As appendix, if you are into MMA and there are not many action movies that promote this sport, I can recommend flash point with Donnie Yen. the last fight makes totally up for the lacks that we find in that movie. Red Belt deserves a mentioning too but it suffers all too much from the same problem this movie has, it pretends to be something that it is not."
"tylerneely","8","1","2","9 November 2009"," A little different...
","So, although Never Back Down would seem like your standard OC, High School fighting movie (where the high school students look like they're in their third year of college), I found it to be a little different.<br/><br/>First of all, I am a proud Djimon Hounsou fan, especially after seeing him in Blood Diamond, and seeing him in this just added to my support for him, he is ever intriguing as the poor, forgotten, wise fight instructor.<br/><br/>Also, I enjoyed the way Cam Gigandet's character comes off. I know he is supposed to be seen as the bad guy, but he doesn't start out that way (ie the beginning of the party and the end of the movie) which I liked as a step away from the stereotypical.<br/><br/>Overall, I found NBD to be a great fight movie, definitely no Fight Club (and personally feel they could've gotten someone better for the main character) but still completely worth a view.<br/><br/>And besides, Amber Heard? i mean, come onnn."

","When I saw the trailer for this in the cinema ages ago, I thought it looked like just the sort of film I fancied watching and relaxing to - I'm really not a major action junkie but I can appreciate well co-ordinated stunts and fight scenes. However, when I heard terrible reviews about it, I was really disappointed and decided against going to see it in the cinema (the IMDb rating was much lower than it's current 6.something when I first checked).<br/><br/>I did, though, buy it recently for £3 and thought I'd give it a try. I gotta say it's just what I hoped it would be.. Look, there's obviously not gonna be any incredible, unpredictable storyline in a film like this, that's just not what it's about. Anyone who watches these types of films should know that the HUGE likelihood is that you'll know the entire plot before you've watched 2 minutes of it. But in this sort of movie, it's not about what happens, it's about how it happens and watching it unfold in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just because I was expecting it to be awful after the reviews I'd read, but I honestly was very happily surprised by it. The fight scenes (which is what most people will watch this for - other than the bodies on show, which are also pretty top-notch) are really impressive. The storyline, while predictable, is capable of carrying your attention through the film without just waiting for the next big fight scene. The Martial-Art instructor guy adds a welcome second-dimension to the film, even without having as much screen time as we might hope for from an actor with such screen-presence.<br/><br/>Realistically speaking, if you're gonna watch a film like this, there are only a few things that you're really hoping for. I would say that this film pretty much delivers on all those things. It's fun, fast-paced and offers some really good fight scenes.<br/><br/>If you usually hate films like this, you'll hate this. Don't bother with it. If you, like me, saw the trailer and thought it looked just up your street, it probably is."

","i absolutely loved this movie, i watch it all the time and it never gets old. at first i only decided to watch it because of Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet cause i'm in love with both of them. Cam is such a great villain, and this movie is no exception. i loved the relationship between Max (Evan Peters) and Jake (Faris) it kinda reminded of a Seth Cohen - Ryan Atwood friendship. the plot was actually really good, a lot better than i expected. it has a lot of really good action and i think the fight scenes are so good! Djimon Hounsou was really in good in this movie, the character was perfect for him. I also though Amber Heard and Sean Faris had really good chemistry in the movie. i think this movie is so under rated i thought it was amazing. If you thought you loved Sean Faris before you saw this movie, you will love him even more after you see it. he's so gorgeous and i think he is great actor. this movie is for every type of person, if you like action movies, love stories, drama, family, it has everything so go watch it!"

","When I saw the trailer for ""Never Back Down"", I didn't seem too impressed.It looked like a lamer version of ""The Karate Kid"" and I was not interested in it one bit.I watched it on the movie network on Friday.It actually exceeded my expectations! Once you get passed the un-realistic ness of the movie, and the fact it is sort of like a UFC version of ""Karate Kid"", there is a fairly decent film.It's about a teen who's father was killed right in front of him in a drunk driving accident.During a football game, someone on the other team mentions this, which starts a fight.This is right before the family moves to a new place and he attends a new school.However the fight made it to youtube and everybody has seen it.He gets invited to this party by this pretty girl and everything seems to be going fine.However, this one person who enjoys fighting, wants to challenge him.He does and the other guy brutally beats him.Here is an unrealistic aspect, no high school party has girls making out while naked in a hot tub(as depicted in the film), and how many teens have planned fights at their parties? Anyway, he decides to train at a UFC-style gym so he can beat this guy.The rules of the gym are if you fight outside, you are out.So he starts training and forms a small friendship with the owner.However, one day his temper gets the better of him and he gets into a fight with four guys in a hummer.He gets kicked out of the gym but begs to come back, he lets him and decides against fighting him again.He also forms a relationship with the girl who invited him to the party.He also learns more about the owner of the gym.This movie is much like the Karate kid(almost a remake), it may be unrealistic but it actually is better than the trailer shows it.The acting is fairly good(despite having a cast of mostly nobodies). Overall a fairly decent film."

Yea, people have been comparing this to the Karate Kid, but these two movies are two completely different movies. Yea, they are kind of similar, but this is more for todays generation. The acting overall is very well done, the cast is likable with the exception of the character ryan who is very annoying and throughout the whole movie, you want him to get the snot kicked outta him. This wont win anything besides maybe an MTV award, but it's still a very entertaining and good movie. Don't be so critical on it, go rent/buy it. It's worth the time. 10/10"

","The Plot: Jake Tyler is a troubled kid, reliving the death of his father, by letting him drive drunk, and not taking the key's and driving himself. At a new high school he is lured into a fight against a ultimate fighting champion and gets the hell kicked out of him. Trying to play it off like it didn't matter, his new friend Max informs him of a Ultimate Fight trainer who has trained some of the best in a pound and ground style known as Jean Roqua. Then what ensues is a splash of karate kid and fight club.<br/><br/>My Spiel: I have to say I really related to this movie. Granted it was very easy to know what was going to happen, but I liked how it all fell together in its sweet beat'em up style. It was something I could really get behind. I have to say I have watched this quite a bit. I like the sweet fight scenes from where Jake get his ass kicked and bounced back from it. To the hot Amber Heard as Baja Miller in the movie. But what really set this movie apart from other basic fighting movies was having the actor Djimon Hounsou as Jean Roqua. Also I need to mention the sweet soundtrack this movie had I really enjoyed and made my own version of the soundtrack. Now for the bad of the movie granted these kids are suppose to be in high school, but to really make this believable they would need to be in there college years or older. To really compete at these fighting levels. But I ignored that because the 2 main characters are obviously older then high school. To get technical the two main characters are 2 years older then me making them 26 years old.<br/><br/>End Result: This is your newer age beat'em up movie with a spice of that fight club style and plenty of ultimate fighting. Also a sensational soundtrack I could truly get behind. This movie isn't for everyone but for me its one I can watch again and again! Never Back Down (2008) Review: 9/10"

Jake isn't the only person who becomes more than what he was over the course of this movie. <br/><br/>THE EMOTION CALLED : ANGER<br/><br/>We all deal with this emotion.

Because that way they won't be hurt anymore, and they won't have to be afraid anymore.<br/><br/>The movie has true respect and insight for this fact. Jake is full of pent up anger and rage over his Father's Alcohol problem and the subsequent death it resulted in. <br/><br/>By making himself truly strong, by proving to himself that he could become so strong that the death of his father no longer felt like his fault, Jake found the peace in his heart that no longer required fighting to appease his feelings of guilt and shame.<br/><br/>THE TEACHER TEACHES THE STUDENT, AND THE STUDENT TEACHES THE TEACHER<br/><br/>The theme of Fathers is a vital one for most young men.<br/><br/>The inner peace Jake finds with the memory of his own father, inspires the teacher to seek out reconciliation as well. <br/><br/>It is the human connection forged between teacher and student, the bond made as a result of opening up to one another.<br/><br/>The student needs to acquire the knowledge the teacher needs to teach.

","I would call this a good ""B-grade"" movie, but since I was expecting a total failure, this was a very good surprise.<br/><br/>The story is straightforwards, with lots of sparring, grappling, and other fighting-type interaction. Without getting into the plot, well, there's not much to spoil, anyways... it reminds me of what I imagine Rocky is about, but I never watched a full ""Rocky "" movie because I found them rather slow-paced.<br/><br/>Never Back Down isn't at all slow paced, but it isn't rushed, either. It carried the story well and never drags, and slowly manages to explain the back story, develop the plot, and then of course, there is the climax at the end...<br/><br/>Although they are a lot of fights, they focus on realism and using the fights as a plot device... so, not that they were bad, but, they weren't ""stylistic"" like most movies. They suit the movie, though, since the characters are into UFC (which focuses on realistic fights).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'd recommend it as a good ""popcorn movie"" or rental, and from there it depends on taste if you'd want to own it, I probably wouldn't buy it but that's just me."

"robertallenandersonjr","10","2","7","10 April 2008"," Nothing can describe how amazing this movie was
","Never Back Down was my new favorite movie of all-time. I loved this movie so much. I would go see it over and over again. I would even pay full price each time. This movie had so many great messages. It was a great fighting movie. It makes me want to take up mixed martial arts. This movie proved to you that you fighting isn't to show you that your stronger or better. It's to show your opponent that you don't want to fight him again. I think that you should get respect for even having the guts to stand up for yourself and fight. This movie title pretty much explains it all for this movie. I thought that the story behind this movie was so great. It wasn't just one little story. It had way more than you think to the story. In lots of movie you see where their are bully's, it is usually because of them getting abused when they were a kid or their father. That's how it was in this movie. I can't stand bully's myself and that is one of the reasons I had to see this movie. The acting was very good all around. Sean Farris was very good and I loved how he was never going to give up. Amber Heard and him were a perfect couple for each other in this movie. The romance fit right in with this movie perfectly. The ending to this movie was very powerful and kept you right on the edge of your seat. This movie was very inspirational. I think that everyone should see this movie you won't be disappointed. It was so amazing with some great messages. Some of the visuals were very cool as well. This movie was a 100 out of 10 in my opinion. I will see it plenty of more times. Their were no flaws at all in this movie. One more thing about the acting I thought that Amber Heard could have used a little bit of work. All the haters on this film don't know what they are talking about. It was especially made for mixed martial arts people. Their was also some awesome music that went well with this movie. I think anyone can really enjoy this movie. I sure did times a thousand. 100/10. Best movie ever."
"jjlabare-1","10","3","13","16 March 2008"," great movie
","I thought this was an all around well done movie. it takes the classic underdog story and makes it more modern with a sport that is becoming huge. the fight scenes were way better than i had expected, this movie is a straight up guy flick, full of intense fight scenes, hot babes, nice cars, and a pretty sweet soundtrack. the movie also has a pretty good plot, every character has their own story that they can all relate to the main character's. this movie is easily the best fight movie I've ever seen, definitely better than fight club and even the rocky movies if you like action, than this is a definite movie to see, i was very happy with the film. definitely worth the price of the admission ticket"

","Im totally in love with 'Never Back Down'! Ever since I saw it all I can think about is this movie and Sean Faris! I have never seen so many guys with 6 packs in a movie before. Besides the camera shaking during some of the fight scenes, all the fights were awesome! It shows there is another way to fight: the difference from normal boxing versus using their whole body to fight and to not give up just because the fight is getting tough... hence the 'Never Back Down' title. Throughout this 2 hour movie I never once looked at my watch... it went from a fight right to another adrenaline junkie fight or practice. It was a fight/comedy/and a little romance thrown in there movie. I'd see it again and again!!"

","The summary really says it all.<br/><br/>When i saw the previews for this movie, all i thought was Step Up with fighting. It looked like a cliché bad movie, but was to many peoples surprise a good movie. The movie is a lot like Fight Club, but with mediocre acting, and a lesser plot. Although it is not as great as fight club it still can easily hold most people's interest without boring them one bit. Very fast paced and action filled. <br/><br/>Also very great date movie, as well as family movie. Still this was a very good movie i recommend it to anyone who is looking for something to do on a Friday night."

Step Up 2 did that! <br/><br/>Also the ending was copied. How the took it to the streets. Then everyone came out and watched. Then they turned the car lights on.

"rara2007","8","2","9","15 March 2008"," Great!
","It really is a mix between The O.C. and Fight Club, which are two of my favorites. Cam Gigandet is absolutely gorgeous and a great actor. Sean Faris is a lot hotter now that I've seen the movie. Djimon Hounsou is an amazing actor and has a great character in this film. The fight scenes were awesome!! Some the camera shot were crazy!! The storyline actually isn't too bad. It makes you feel for characters and you even have a moment where you feel kinda sad for the bad guy. Yes, it is predictable but that is not a reason to not see this movie. Take all of your friends and your boyfriends to see this because this is one that everybody will love!"
"kurciasbezdalas","10","1","3","22 November 2008"," Unique fighting scenes
","The plot of this movie is very similar with some of the 80's American martial arts movies like Karate Kid or No Retreat, No Surrender. This movie has all those annoying things like martial arts trainer who always repeats to his students that they shouldn't fight (then why the hell do they study martial arts?), parents always moralizing that fighting is not an answer (or something like that) and of course the bad guy, who is always stubborn and rude with everybody, but becomes very friendly after getting his but kicked. But the plot is not important in this kind of films. What is important is fighting scenes, and there was a lot of unique fighting scenes. It wasn't those kind of fights which you could see in Jackie Chan's movies, but it was very realistic and impressive in it's own way. The sound effects, choreography and direction made boring wrestling techniques look impressive. I'm glad that someone is still making films of this kind and putting some modern ideas in it."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","4","1","3","31 August 2008"," I feel like I wrote the script, I literally predicted every single scene and the plot
","I was kind of curious what Never Back Down was about, so I rented it, but after the rental I was thinking ""Lemme guess... a new guy in a new school likes a girl... but she has a boyfriend... the boyfriend kicks his butt... boy is angry... boy goes to a street smart black guy who teaches him when to back down and fight well... a friend gets hurt by the big villain... boy fights guy once again with the big villain... boy gets girl... the end"". Well, I hate to spoil things for you, but I was exactly right. These are beautiful white people who shouldn't have any problems since they're gorgeous and rich and powerful... but somehow have to create drama just to get some form of attention. This was an episode of The OC meets Super Sweet Sixteen trying to be the teenage form of Fight Club. This is a movie for the teenagers whose parents don't allow them to watch Fight Club, even then, I don't see why anyone would punish their child by seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Even though I spoiled the movie, I'll do the best I can to make it sound entertaining. Jake is the new guy in a new school, his father was killed in a car accident and his mother and littler brother are trying to get back to normal. But Jake has anger issues, at his new school he meets Baja, a cute girl who invites him to a party where he meets the school's tough guy, Ryan, who is also Baja's boyfriend. Ryan kicks Jake's butt and humiliated, Jake's only friend Max tells him about Jean, a professional who teaches Jake to control his anger while fighting the good fight.<br/><br/>Never Back Down is one of the most predictable movies I have seen and it's honestly stupid. The only reason I'm giving this movie a fair rating is because I think they did try, I don't think the director had bad intentions, but honestly, this is a trashy script that is just not impressive and is just another feel of popular TV shows that all those teens go crazy over. I wouldn't really recommend it, even for the teens, because I'd say that fighting movies are more for the adults... or at least the intelligent people who know better than rather how the fighting looks cool, let's imitate it and get severely hurt. But I'm going to be fair, I think a four should do it this time, but next time I may not be as generous, because these movies are getting more and more predictable.<br/><br/>4/10"
"Robert_duder","8","1","3","25 March 2008"," A next Generation Karate Kid for the sassier youth of today, an entertaining movie!
","Certainly Never Back Down will never take home any film making accolades but if the idea was to entertain it does that and does it solidly. There are the obvious comparisons to Karate Kid for those of us who grew up the classic eighties series but ultimately Never Back Down has only one message or moral...Never....Back...Down...and I'm not sure it's all that much of a moral really. So it doesn't quite have the life lessons that Karate Kid bestowed to us. I think Never Back Down was made to entertain and show off hot bodies, cool locations, and some kick ass fighting techniques for the latest fighting crazy, that being Ultimate Fighting or mixed martial arts or whatever you want to call it. The choreography for the fight scenes is intense and definitely makes you cringe to watch them get hit and beat to a pulp. Still the whole Rocky, Karate Kid type genre recipe is there in full force. Kid rough around the edges meets his match, meets the girl, trains with the best, comes back to kick the mean guys butt. But hey I think that genre is not done to the degree of decency that it used to be in the eighties so I quite enjoyed Never Back Down. One of the truly unique things about the film is that even though much of it might be seen as a little materialistic, shallow even...the characters have a surprised amount of depth.<br/><br/>Sean Faris, looking strikingly like a young Tom Cruise, plays Jake Tyler. He's a brawler new to the area that gets caught up with the wrong people at the wrong time. Faris is terrific and really lights up the screen and to echo some other reviewers on IMDb I think this will be his break out role. He does a really good job in this role. Despite the film being about no holds barred brawling, there is some serious emotion here to his character about his past and his father and you do really get attached to the character. Amber Heard is just...well...she's drop dead sexy as the new object of Jake's affection Baja Miller. She is the stereotypical eye candy and they use her as such throughout the film shamelessly having her show up in a bikini or low cut top BUT they actually use her as a character too!! Her character goes through some big changes in the film and her and Faris are electric together and really make a great team. She's talented and hot so bonus for this film because they were able to use her as more than just eye candy. Cam Gigandet I had already come to despise (but in a good way) as Volchok on The O.C. but he was the perfect bad guy in Never Back Down. He just has this smarmy, sleazy tough guy bad boy thing going on and he was the perfect adversary to Faris' good guy. I hope this opens up some roles for him as well. Evan Peters is a good addition to the cast as Faris' new found best friend Max. I wouldn't say he was quite as strong an actor as the rest of them but he fit in well as comic relief and as an underdog sidekick type character. In a small role Leslie Hope is terrific as Faris' mother who is suffering from depression and struggling for her family. She really is great in a small role. Wyatt Smith also does a decent job as Faris' little brother. And finally Academy Award nominated actor Djimon Hounsou is brilliant as the tough as nails fighting instructor Jean Roqua who tries to tame Jake's wild skills. He's not quite as profound as Mr. Myagi or quite as determined as Mickey (from Rocky) but he's still an amazing actor and presence and definitely does a great job in the role. He has good chemistry with Faris as well and gets his own sub plot that helps his character.<br/><br/>The story could be described as predictable perhaps but the characters are really well done which is impressive. And the fighting style is different from most films so it keeps you riveted. Director Jeff Wadlow is fairly new to the big screen although I thought he did very well directing the slasher flick Cry Wolf (see my review.) This proves he is a versatile director who can really tell a story and that's exactly what Never Back Down does. Not only is there the surface story about the brawling but actual sub plots from Jake's character to Roqua's story and even Jake's family. I think this might be one of the best predictable stories I've ever seen. It's well worth seeing...I think it's unique and very entertaining!! Check it out. 8.5/10"

","Never back down is one of my favourite films, it's about this guy who moves to Florida and is the new kid on the block, he goes to this collage where the popular kids take a dislike to him and happen to be the number one mixed marital art fighter, Tyler takes a liking to his girlfriend and has to fight him at the beat down, Tyler has no control or doesn't know how to fight, he goes to a martial class where the guy teaches him how to control his anger and to fight for the right reasons. My favourite part of the movie is when Tyler had the fight at the end in the beat down towards the end of the film and wins over the girl and becomes the most liked guy in school and end up with the girl of his dreams."

","""Never back down' is a movie we've all seen a million times before. This one fails to veer from the formula of ""Karate Kid' and a slew of wanna-be's. Sean Faris headlines and is faintly reminiscent of a young Tom Cruise. His co-stars are Cam Gigandet, a muscled (yum!) Blonde guy who steals the show and Djimon Honsou who is the only actor allowed more than a one-dimensional character. Maybe he's just the better actor. The script is clichéd and the dialogue clunky. The movie only comes alive during the fight sequences which should satisfy any action lover and the girls are gorgeous. Essentially this is a teen version of ""Fight Club"" for the MTV generation, but it's okay, if you're not too discerning. Just don't expect any real acting."
"photodork52","10","1","4","27 August 2008"," it's eye candy, and that's okay
","Basically, this is ""The Karate Kid"" with men who are in phenomenal shape and Mr Miyagi is played by Djimon Hounsou. The plot is simple of course but it's entertaining nonetheless. New kid in school lusts after hot chick. She invites him to a party where her boyfriend hosts parties where the major entertainment is people beating the crap out of each other. The protagonist gets his rear kicked by hottie girl's boyfriend. Protagonist is upset so he goes out and finds someone to train him. Wisdom is gained, another fight between protagonist and (now ex) boyfriend. Protagonist does well and is respected by all. The end<br/><br/>The major highlight of the movie and the reason I bought the film is shallow...the men are ripped, sweaty and yummy.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for fluff with a few fun fights and men that are easy on the eyes...this film is for you...if you're in for a serious film about fighting, go elsewhere."

","As a fight fan, I had hoped for some good fight scenes, but instead it was all fast camera cuts, peppy music and unbelievable action.<br/><br/>Say what you like about Bruce Lee, but at least he (or Chan) could actually fight - even if the films glammed it up a bit. It's kind of insulting when all three stars in a film about fighting have no actual fighting ability, depending instead, completely on camera work to create the illusion. I know it's acting, but couldn't we find someone who could actually fight.<br/><br/>That being said, you'd be hard pushed to find any fighter with the ability that these high school kids supposedly displayed.<br/><br/>I have a limited knowledge of MMA fighting, but it seemed to me that most of the non-revenge fights seemed to go to variations of the same lame arm bar. Ironically, not one that seems to finish many UFC or Pride fights...<br/><br/>I realise that a critique of the film's fighting authenticity is somewhat narrow, but that is its raison d'etre.<br/><br/>I could criticise the farcically throw-away quality of the sub-plots involving the lead's deceased father, or adoring kid brother, or mother who seems a bit short on understanding given their situation.<br/><br/>The villain has enough texture to avoid complete stereotyping, and in spite of its many shortcomings, Never back down is far from unwatchable."
"SidelinePictures","3","1","4","27 July 2008"," Lame Version of ""The Karate Kid""
","This movie is almost exactly like the ""Karate Kid"", but in a lame, rip-off sort of way. It just wasn't good, and for many reasons. It was like a terrible cover of a good song from the '80s, if ""Karate Kid"" was the good, original song, and ""Never Back Down"" was the tasteless cover. The new kid in town gets beat up by the leader of some fight-club wannabee bullies, who has a girlfriend, who happens to falls for the new kid. And after his beating, the new kid trains and trains with a non-American fighting master and goes back to the leader of the fight club wannabees and guess what he does. Hmmm, sound familiar? <br/><br/>It's clear that this film targets the teenager looking for the practical slow-motion fighting scenes and a bad attempt at drama. If you're a teenager who is into non-stop cellphone use, over use of slow-motion, and the dated high-school house parties then this movie is for you, Teenager. But it just seems as if the writer watched ""Karate Kid"" and simply upgraded the story with new millennium cliché's involving cellphones, Youtube, and over-played hard rock songs.<br/><br/>The drama isn't dramatic, the comic relief isn't funny, the fight scenes aren't that entertaining, and the storyline isn't original. The only thing that looked in any way genuine were the training sequences. I like to say give every movie a chance, but with this one, don't expect to walk away happy and wanting more."

But there are some slight mix-up those are trying to bail, for example: Jake Tyler is already a sport man, then how is that he appearances that much weak specially when his father was also a boxing coach and Jake was a big guy when his father died as he was as big as to drive by car, if he is weak how is that he can come to a fighter only in one month and conquer Ryan who is two times Beatdown king."

When I was younger I really liked the movie.

For a real fighter movie you have to take music to let the blood flow into your veins and it makes you want to move you need metal, rap, hip hop or hard rock.<br/><br/>And not this shallow emo kack that just gives a completely wrong picture.<br/><br/>I'm a little bit offended by the character Max because he does not have that much wit but actually was one of the nice shadows and his obsession to film everything is personally offensive to me in two ways.<br/><br/>The film would have been a lot better if Jean Roqua had been the focus because apart from him there was no really presentable character and Djimon Hounsou is by far the best actor, everyone else deserves the guillotine.<br/><br/>Fighting has consequences, but doing nothing is the worst

"nims-1975","6","0","1","18 March 2018"," Just good, but not as good as Never Back Down 2
","This film is a good film with some great acting by Sean Faris, Amber Heard, Cam Gigandet, Evan Peters and Djimon Hounsou. Never Back Down is a film which does have some pretty good fighting, but the film is to over Glamorized. The film does have some great things about it such as Jake Tylers rebellious teen character, Max Coopermans friendly, confident, passionate and keen character, Baja Millers friendly, loving and caring character and Ryan McCarthys violent and malicious character. The acting by Sean Faris as Jake Tyler, Amber Heard as Baja Miller, Cam Gigandet as Ryan McCarthy, Evan Peters as Max Cooperman and Djimon Hounsou as Jean Roqua was very good. This film did lack things in quite a few ways though and one of the main things was that the violent and malicious martial arts champion Ryan McCarthy had a big ego and was a complete dickhead, thinking he's the most powerful person ever, but Jake Tyler proved him wrong and knocked the living daylights out of him. Compared to Never Back Down 2: The Beatdown, this film was no way as good as that film and Never Back Down 2 was a hell of a lot better than this film. Never Back Down 2 was a lot more tense than this film, the fighters were a lot better than these fighters and some of them were MMA Champions and the extremely powerful and absolutely brilliant martial arts film actor Michael Jai White was in the film not Djimon Hounsou and the fighting was a lot more tense, powerful and amazing compared to Never Back Down. None of the fighters in Never Back Down 2 had a big ego or were dickheads like Ryan McCarthy. Todd Duffee who acted as Tim Tim Newhouse is a MMA Champion in real life, is much more powerful than Cam Gigandet and would slaughter Ryan McCarthys arse to death. I'm not saying that this is a crap film, because it definitely isn't a crap film, it's just a good one and it has a few weak things to it that's all."

That's how great and inspirational this movie truly is!<br/><br/>To give a quick rundown of what the movie is about, think along the lines of a Disney Channel Original Movie or DCOM if you're up to speed with the hype lingo. Jake - a down-and-out guy - falls in love with Baja - the pretty girl at school - who is dating this mega-MMA fighter (Ryan) at the school. Jake and Ryan become bitter rivals over time due to Baja and they FINALLY settle their feud with an MMA battle. That's all I can tell you though because I don't want to spoil the whole movie for you! <br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? UH DUH, YES OF COURSE. There is a reason I am giving this 10/10 stars. My friends and I LOVE this movie! Please watch this movie!"

","I don't know about the critics but I love this film. the quality of action, and filmography is really great. I also loved the way its story progresses and gradually develop each character. also the dialogs between Jake and his coach is thoughtful. the interesting part of this film is that each moment is enjoyable, not for a single moment I felt that it is going slow. I loved the screenplay and the message that everyone has their own fight, you must carry on the struggle. the final action scene is really awesome and it gives us the message about having peace in the mind. The ultimate message that the film provides us is we can't hide from our problems we need to face those and fight. Finally the ending scene left me with an awe. I love this film. I am really surprised to see this that the film got poor feedback from critics who can praise films like ""hunger games"" so heart-fully"

","Never an original moment...Never great acting...Never again. This movie was so predictable from the very start to the end. It was a slightly older ""Karate Kid"" kind of flick. The main character was such an easy target. The antagonist may as well have called the main character ""chicken."" That was enough to bait him into a fight. Amber Heard's character was the usual ridiculous blonde chick love interest who is so vapid you could practically see ""vacancy"" signs behind her eyes. Djimon Hounsou is usually cool to watch, but his Mr. Miyagi was lacking and that whole story line of how this kid teaches him to re-connect to his family was utterly ridiculous. The only redeeming parts to this film were the fight scenes, even though they were heavily choreographed and had the typical hero- gets-beat-up-throughout-the-fight-and-despite-his-many- injuries wins in the end theme. So, there ya go."

","At least since Gary Grant, the movies where a rebellious teen attempts to prove something for himself and people close to him, have been flourished. The method has slightly varied, but fights, car chases, parties, beautiful girls and muscular men have all been included. Novelties have long gone, but movies with similar elements tend still to attract wide audiences. All this concerns Never Back Down as well. Is it really not cool for the young to watch a similar movie made some years before? I can't see any new angle or approach here (technology development is a parallel phenomenon), and the only good actors and ""adult"" ones, e.g. Djimon Hounsou and Leslie Hope (some additional rating from me thanks to their performances). Those depicting students are - apart from their looks - not inviting at all. <br/><br/>Well, my teen years were decades ago, but I can still assess a book, not its covers only. If you like to see time-proof movie with and about teens and youngsters, the keywords are - included but not limited to - Paul Dano, Ezra Miller, Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt."

","This film is about a rebellious teenager who gets into the world of underground fighting.<br/><br/>""Never Back Down"" is no doubt about fighting, but also a journey of personal growth and forgiveness. The plot is well written and the characters are well developed, which is a pleasant surprise. I was particularly impressed by Cam Gigandet's portrayal of his psychopathic character. His piercing gaze and his cunning smiles are spine chilling to say the least. In addition, his ultra fit torso shows that he is well trained to be the champion that he thinks he deserves to be, which adds to the portrayal of his narcissistic and egoistic personality. The camera angles and the action sequences are very impressive. There are shots from a first person angle, as if the viewer is engaged in the actual fight. The fight scenes are intense, and are well portrayed by great camera work. I really enjoyed watching ""Never Back Down"", and think it is much better than I expected it to be."

","Even though it isn't pleasant surprise, Never Back Down delivers what it promises. The film is never boring, because it's the encore and energy makes it in guilty-pleasure form. Some may not like this film unless you're a MMA or pro-wrestling fan. Rest assured, this movie may satisfy weekend viewers. <br/><br/>Enter Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), an Iowa football jock that was forced to move to Orlando with his family. As a grieving fatherless son, he became taunted by the past and became somewhat the rebellious man any. Upon moving, he became unexpectedly infamous for being the most popular brawler from his last home before Iowa. <br/><br/>With the voluptuous Baja (Amber Heard), she invites Jake into something which is unbeknownst to him. He thought it was just a party, but it turns out to be a pretty disastrous moment. With this, he meets his match, the anti-hero Ryan Mccarthy (Cam Gigandet). Ryan is the most popular fighter in Jake's new school, and is about to test how good the Iowa guy is. <br/><br/>But since Jake doesn't know how to fight Ryan, expect that he will be forced to seek the help of an instructor. For instance, Djimon Honsou as Jean Roqua, he will teach Jake how to prepare against Ryan. But Roqua has one rule, no fighting outside the gym. Otherwise, he's out. Expect rules to be broken. But I guess I'll leave the rest to you.<br/><br/>The role of Jake would've been suitable for actors like Dolph Lundgren or Mark Wahlberg, if the narrative wasn't casted for young actors such as Faris himself. Amber Heard wasn't such bad in this movie. She's good trying to be a what-not, from-bimbo-to-best-pal character. Her supporting lead is particularly intriguing, if not so good. And Gigandet obtains sarcastic, trigger-happy like attitude which is well executed. He's one of the best bad villains that gives cheap thrills and taunts. My personal choice to play Roqua would be Dwayne Johnson, But Honsou is preferable for the part.<br/><br/>Never Back Down takes its time to be inevitable, but it doesn't mean it's not a good movie. The bone-crunching fight scenes and martial-arts violence is a hit-and-miss. But I found myself thrilled and respecting it's time for stupidity. Fueled by Michael Wandmacher's soundtrack, the script by Chris Hauty and Jeff Wadlow's direction make a good combination on how to survive a dog-eats-dog territory. That's what I like about good cheap with B-picture grit. Think of this film as the modern Karate Kid. However, there's no wax-on-wax-off in the plot, there's only excessive breathing to remember."

","""Never back down"" a film directed by Jeff Wadlow in 2008, is modern day fight club, and a look at the vastly growing sport of Mixed Martial Arts. The movie quickly starts off with a brawl and shows that the main charter Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) has a very short fuse. Shortly after the incident the family moves to Florida to further his younger brother's tennis career. Struggling to fit in, Jake meets a flirty girl, Baja's (Amber Heard), and she is quick to invite him to a party. There Jake is lured into a fight where he is badly beaten by the high school bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). But a classmate at the fight, Max Cooperman (Even peters), sees hope in Jake. Max comes to check on Jake after the fight and tells him of a local MMA facility ran by a renowned Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou). And much regards against it fighting, he decides to give it a try and quickly learns of the therapeutic advantages and begins to master the art. As he looks to get revenge on Ryan he runs into other trouble and might lose his chances for good. But along the way he doesn't only gain the respect he wanted but learns about the man he really is.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be very good. It's full of action and suspense! I do wish the fight scenes were not so jumpy and steadier to actually see the fights. But overall I thought it was a great movie and I would recommend it to any adrenaline junkies or someone who just enjoys a good movie."

","I approached the movie with trepidation because I had recently seen Undisputed and was quite frankly very underwhelmed by the experience. However, my doubts were soon dispelled because this had what Undisputed did not have. A coherent story line and close to real characters. Sean Faris is an angry young man who has shifted schools because his brother is a tennis prodigy and has got a scholarship. At the new schools, he comes in contact with Ryan who is the local mixed martial arts champion. The movie moves along on predictable path towards a showdown between the two in the clichéd martial arts tournament but still there is a sincere effort at character development. Djimon Hounsou is pretty good as the mentor of Faris who teaches him the tricks of the martial arts. The acting is competent all round and the fight scenes are very well done. This is my guilty pleasure of the week. I could really relate to the lead and found myself rooting for him in the final fight sequence. 3.5 out of 5 for this. For those of you who haven't given this a try do check it out. It would be a worthy investment of your time."

","""Never Back Down"" is for all the guys out there who are trying to make something of their selves. I have watched this movie over and over and I have yet to get tired of it. I believe that the whole story captures our attention right away, especially from the first scene. As we sit there, we feel like we are in the movie and begin to feel the same emotions as the main character, Jake Tyler (Sean Faris).<br/><br/>The movie starts off right. The story begins with Jake Tyler living out in Iowa playing in a football game. A player on the other team starts smack talking Jake about his drunk father. Jake Tyler can't handle it and they start a brawl in the middle of the football field. After this whole ordeal, his family moves away to Orlando, Florida. Jake Tyler doesn't make the best first impression and gets into it with Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet), an underground MMA champion. Jake receives threats to his family and friends so he goes out to seek help. He gets help from a MMA fighting veteran, Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou), who helps Jake train his mind and body. Jake does this to enter the big elimination fight coming up to get back at Ryan McCarthy. <br/><br/>I believe that director Jeff Wadlow's critical intention of ""Never Back Down"" is the title itself. We can tell never backing down is the intention of the movie because every time we see a fight with the main character Jake Tyler, he doesn't give up until it is physically impossible to do so anymore. Another reason I believe this is because after all the threats he is getting about his family and friends, he doesn't leave town. He stays in town to train and to try to get back at Ryan McCarthy. <br/><br/>There are a lot of places in the movie that personally grab my attention or make me feel a part of it. The biggest scene that gets me is the opening scene. It starting off as a football game grabbed my attention immediately. This is because I am a football player and I can relate to the emotions going on at the time. I also really like the whole meaning of ""Never Back Down"". I can also relate to the meaning because whatever I do, I do my best and I never back down."

Good guy gets beaten down by bad guys, good guy learns to fight, good guy gets revenge. The thing I love about this movie is that Jake Tyler started out being fueled by revenge, but in the end, it was all about protecting the ones he loved. He didn't fight to prove he was the best, he didn't fight to get revenge, he fought to keep his friends and family from getting hurt. The fighting in the movie was extremely bad ass, the acting was superb,the storyline was original and very good, the music fit the movie very well.

","This is one of the most masculine-positive films I have ever seen in my entire life! Sure there's a lot of sweat and hot muscle everywhere you look! But that takes a big back seat to genuine character development - with the primary focus being on the muscle on the left side of your chest (Your Heart)! What an incredibly intelligent story! If only Hollywood could have the courage to do this more often - A ""Fight Club"" type movie with zero, I repeat, zero exploitation or gore! This rare, one-of-kind movie is even suitable for older children to watch! It is so sophisticated, in fact, I would even recommend it as an excellent resource for Anger Management classes! <br/><br/>The fight choreography is mind boggling! It certainly looks like full contact! If you watch closely you could even learn some very good moves!<br/><br/>It also made me reflect on my own High School experience! Where there were certainly a lot of aggressive and vicious bad guys, but very few good guys to stand-up to them. It amazes me to this very day how some teenage boys develop powerful, man-like bodies at an early age, but have the emotional maturity of a turnip! Is this a universal in American society? All this aggressiveness and malevolence to those physically weaker than one's self? Where does it come from? Is it some sort of malfunctioning biological drive? Or learned at home from an abusive parent? If only we could find the right physical trainer as our hero did! Wow! It could move mountains for so many people who are constantly bullied by their fellow, physically stronger classmates!<br/><br/>Never Back Down is neither maudlin or trite! It discusses real issues we all will face at some point in our life - like making a big mistake, relocating to a different community, falling in love, defending one's self from physical or emotional harm, dealing with the loss of a loved one, submitting to someone wiser than yourself, and learning to manage anger, regret and grief! This, and a lot more, is covered in this delightful, sheer joy of a film!"

","The tempo of the film is top notch. It flows so smoothly without relenting. That doesn't mean that every seen is filled with fighting: absolutely not. But the drama fighting or no fighting is excellent. The picture quality of the film is superb. And with a $21 million dollar budget- that probably aides in that, but its well worth it. On the whole i would like to say i didn't get bored 1 bit and the film didn't slow down at all. The acting must of been really good because i never questioned it . Everyone performed really great that you didn't focus so much on that you just enjoyed the film. On the whole a film with pace, class, determination and not 1 bit cheesy at all. This ain't no Karate Kid, this a great modern fighting film that is well crafted with underlying personal battles that don't become too emotional; which was a strength for this film. The little bits of emotion added in correct doses went down a treat. Too much and you slow down the film. A film that is always moving and going somewhere without singling out any one character. Yes the lead actors are key but its definitely a team effort. Watch this movie; and you will not be disappointed and you will feel like it is time well spent. You won't even notice the 1 hour & 53 minutes go by. The movie length allows you to enjoy the whole story & enjoy spending time watching a movie. Movie's like this should be more appreciated because how many times do you find yourself watching a movie and 2 hours fly by really fast end you enjoyed every minute of it."

","I never get tired of watching this movie. I can relate to Jake (the main character) because I've always been a loner. The movie does an excellent job of showing that even though he is tortured, Jake is a good guy at heart. His family troubles really hit home, because I've gone through some of the same difficulties. We all have our fight, we just have to make sure we fight for the right reasons. The scene when Jake tells Roqua straight up how it is, is one of my favorite scenes from any movie. The overall feel of the movie is great, and even the supporting actors did well. The soundtrack is phenomenal as well. I watch this movie whenever i need to unwind. Every review I read says this is nothing but a remake of Karate Kid. While they do share similarities, every movie deserves to be judged impartially and not just compared to past movies. Personally, I have always liked this movie more than The Karate Kid. Unless you are an ACTUAL movie critic, then just chill out and enjoy a movie for what it is, not what it isn't. Also, no one cares about personal feelings toward UFC or MMA, that just happened to be a theme of the movie. Anyway, its a great movie and I would recommend it to anybody."

And in most cases I am usually bored in movies by the time of climax and typically want the antagonist to win, however this time I felt genuinely attached and excited about the final battle, which was very surprising for me.

Since then i have watched this movie many times over. The reason I didn't give it a ten is because I take into account the many clichés it contains, and the cheesy dialog. The acting is fairly decent and the fight scenes were believable (mostly). While it doesn't leave a strong message, it proves to me that a movie doesn't need to be a masterpiece to be good. Movies are made to entertain, and this one does just that. Yes it shares the exact same story as the Karate Kid, but once your brain is turned off it's hard to get bored of this movie. Compared to most mma films this one is worth watching. Like I mentioned before, the acting is decent, unlike Beatdown, and there isn't a montage of pointless sex scenes like Never Surrender.

All of a sudden bad boy is evil and we hate him. We want to take him down. Good guy starts off shaky but of course has a natural talent that just has to develop a tad. He perfects his art and finds his inner self. Kicks bad guys ass, wins girl. The End.<br/><br/>The acting was a over dramatized. Maybe because some were new actors, but they tried way too hard to play the part. The best actor in the movie was a (at the time) 14 year old kid.<br/><br/>I especially didn't like that it copied a scene from Step Up 2.

I mean it's no Oscar worthy movie and it doesn't have a great story, which is why some reviewers might bash on this film. But I am just going to judge this movie on enjoyment, and it's entertaining for a movie about a bunch of teens fighting. The protagonist played by Sean Faris, is a guy that tries to learn martial arts for the love of the sport after getting a taste of it, instead of self defence although he does get bullied by the character played by that one guy from that one teen show. Amber Heard is also in this and she is fine as always, although not much of an actress. Sure a lot of it is immature, but it's still fun. And the goal is to show how no matter how difficult an obstacle is in your way, be persistent and never back down while being entertaining at the same time.

Secondly, the movie enters a new era, by showing the world MMA. Finally. I admit, I am writing this as not only a fan, but a fighter, myself, but the movie shows MMA at its finest. Of course, it is pg-13, of course some things are made to look more effective than useful, but it shows a great difference between a fight and... a fight.<br/><br/>The scenes of training are very well edited, shot and feature great music (not the score, but a perfect choice of popular rock/rap and other songs are the best thing in this soundtrack). The same with actual fight scenes.<br/><br/>The movie tells a predictable but e very enjoyable story, it is another American-teen movie and not really at the same time.

","Never back down follows a predictable and often seen pattern, but for me it had great entertainment value.<br/><br/>The movie looks great at times, if you like that O.C and C.S.I-Miami style sunset coloring. There's of course also a lot of hot looking girls and dangerous, testosterone filled guys with 6-pack abs and tanned bodies.<br/><br/>The story is predictable, but manages to keep you entertained, just don't expect it to be fight-club. Djimon Hounsou provides us with some solid acting, and the rest of the crew are good as well. Overall i would say that if you like fighting movies with that ""rebel vs. the rest"" kind of story this one will definitely entertain you for its 110min runtime."

","Never back down. Was definitely not brilliant, i'll explain why later. But it's still a great teen fighting movie. Packed with some great punch up's and cool fighting. The movies typicality may have just killed it from greater success, with a little more thought and extending some certain feature's the movie could of surprised many viewers. No real idea of the movie stood out, the plot was very simple and obvious, easily written script. But then what does make this movie so good?<br/><br/>It's simple, it's highly entertaining and keeps you occupied with watching some cool direct fight scenes. Everyone likes to watch a good fight, you will see plenty of that exploited in this movie. Furious punches, nice round kicks, tight submissions and explosive K.O's. It may help a little if your familiar with the ufc. The acting was actually quite impressive Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet had some nice bouts. Djimon Hounsou did a flawless job. He was strong mentality wise and physically. His script was the most effective and inspiring. Very impressed with him. What makes this movie 7 stars and not 9 or 10 stars is just like i said before. Yes the film was to predictable and a little weak with some scenes. But nothing major, the film was still very good.<br/><br/>I guess if you like watching a good fight or two, you will definitely enjoy this one. A great movie with impressive strong acting. Inspiring at times and fun to watch."
"evilresident097","8","0","1","12 May 2009"," Good ""Karate Kid"" moments + MMA = an enjoyable movie.
","A lot of people say ""Never Back Down"" is a lot like ""The Karate Kid"". I agree, but I think it grabbed the good karate parts and switched them with some nice Mixed Martial Arts(MMA)ones. The story is basic: bad boy Jake Tyler(Sean Faris) moves to Orlando and ends up stirring trouble with Ryan(Cam Gigadent), the best fighter in the city. Tyler then has to train with his own Mr. Miyagi, MMA instructor/fighter Jean Roqua(Djimon Hounsou), to fight back and show Ryan how tough he really can be. The characters are pretty much ""O.C.""-esque but they manage to still entertain. The soundtrack is also really good, with titles from My Chemical Romance, Rise Against, Limp Bizkit, and more. But the best part is the fights. From Jake's first bout with Ryan to the final match at the Beatdown, the film's underground fight tourney, the fights entertain every time. Don't let the goofy title fool you: this is overall a really good fighting drama."
"Buddy-51","4","0","1","27 March 2009"," uninspired Karate Kid knock-off
","""Never Back Down"" takes place in one of those only-in-the-movies high schools where the students spend so much of their time partying, brawling and posting videos of themselves on the internet that they have no time left over for studying.<br/><br/>Jake Tyler is the football hero with the stereotypical name who reluctantly moves from Iowa to Orlando, Florida with his mother and kid brother after the death of his father. Jake has trouble adjusting to life in his new school where the law of the jungle clearly predominates and where the favorite extracurricular activity consists of beating one another senseless between classes. That survival-of-the-fittest mentality is further reinforced by a sort of underground fight club whose existence is apparently known to everyone on campus except for the clueless faculty who seem utterly oblivious to all the black eyes and bruised faces that keep popping up in their classrooms on an almost daily basis. But then what can one expect from a school in which the girls all dress like streetwalkers and the boys are all granite-jawed jocks who are suffering from a major case of testosterone-overload? <br/><br/>This cheapjack rip-off of ""The Karate Kid"" even boasts its own version of Mr. Miyagi - a character-building mixed martial arts teacher who takes Jake under his wing, imparting two-bit life lessons while he instructs his pupil in the fine art of how not to get his butt kicked at school.<br/><br/>The movie adheres to every single cliché endemic to the genre, including an arch villain whose super hot girlfriend switches her allegiance to the sensitive, misunderstood hero when it suddenly dawns on her what an irredeemable cad her boyfriend truly is. And all this is done to a surfeit of fighter-in-training montage sequences backed by a generic rock soundtrack.<br/><br/>Sean Faris has sufficient charisma to make us care about Jake, and the always splendid Djimon Hounsou brings some much needed gravitas to the proceedings as the philosophy-spouting mentor. But the movie, as a whole, is just way too formulaic to engage our interest much beyond the ferocious and well executed fight scenes.<br/><br/>If you're hankering for a genuinely great teen drama, check out the latest installment of ""Friday Night Lights"" and skip ""Never Back Down"" altogether."
"MovieBuffMarine","8","0","1","30 January 2009"," A Revamped Karate Kid? Sure. . .
","But as someone said, as long as you don't think hard, it's entertaining and that's what you get. I agree that what you see in Never Back Down is nothing new, but to be fair with it, you have to have a story that is more in line with the style of the time, in this case it's Mixed Martial Arts. A bona-fide re-made Karate Kid (meaning the same characters with new faces playing them) would probably turn off fans of the original and would be hokey for today's audiences, even with MMA as the style. So in my opinion, it's fitting that this one was made with a whole new cast of characters. See this film and take it for what it's worth. If you want to be too picky about the similarities between this and The Karate Kid, then stick to that (which I am a fan of by the way, as well as this re-vamped take). But if you are open minded and want to see a different take, then by all means, check out Never Back Down!"

"jonbroster","7","0","1","15 January 2009"," American Pie with fighting
","Think of American Pie, or any teen slasher movie, then take out the sex (or the slashing) and add in a liberal dose of mixed martial arts (cage fighting). The result is Never Back Down.<br/><br/>It is not meant to be high-brow, it is a disposable movie, but it is really quite good. The action is quite well staged and for those viewers who don't have any knowledge of MMA style fighting, there is even a geeky character who commentates on the fights at times.<br/><br/>Some reviewers note that this is almost like an updated version of the Karate Kid, but it avoids most of the posturing and scowling by the villains - principally by making the villain an excellent fighter who is also the most popular kid at school.<br/><br/>Anyway, in the end they all live happily ever after and they avoid Karate Kid's cheesy closing line: ""You're OK Larusso!"""

","The way of remakes never end , and this new never back down is the bright example , I've expected a more different story at least about the main character life , instead the more I was watching the more the script and the whole plot resemble karate kid , with just a touch of modernity and style due to the "" ultimate "" style of martial arts , as i'm a big fan of that , I do appreciate and after i saw the movie I felt a deep nostalgy for the past .. it made me reflect how the times change and run , furthermore Im also a fan of Djemond Hounsou which is one of my favorite actors and idols at 44 years old he has a physical shape and conditions incredible for a man of his age .. unfortunately hes part is not very well shaped as him in the movie , but it can be enough to capture another generation of karate kids ! or Randi couture !? in this case :) entertaining energetic and the good soundtrack support the lack of originality of the entire film , good for kids around 14 16 but also for a little older guys in search of some good memories ..."
"prtyjedi","4","0","2","28 September 2008"," What was the point again?
","This is a movie you can watch if you're your basic teenager dreaming of winning big fights and hot chicks. If not, you can watch it one time and almost enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>The acting is on the level. It's not bad, but it doesn't particularly impress either. What really frustrates is how pathetic the story is. The idea is nice enough. The movie's basic idea is that a guy has been trained to box by his dad. He tends to get into fights, though he tries to avoid it. He winds up in the latest school and decides not to get involved in anything. However, this school has an underground fight club going on, led by a rich kid who is also something of a sadistic sociopath. The main character gets his ass kicked because he's just a traditional boxer. So he goes to train MMA at a gym, owned by a man of principles. In other words, if you train at the gym, you can't fight with strangers.<br/><br/>Anyway the middle bit is just foreplay until the Big Finale where the main character crosses the line and fights the bad guy. What's really sad is how most of the movie keeps parading the ""violence isn't the answer"" slogan, which is nice, but in the end all problems, and I do mean all, are solved by kicking the baddie's ass. So in the end it ends up depressingly hypocritical. And also pathetic. The movie has the potential to make a good point about violence (and teenagers). And everything else in the movie is just a teenage boy's wet dream: fights and glory, expensive parties and a hot chick."
"bob the moo","Null","0","3","11 September 2008"," Superficially slick in a attempt to cover the cardboard characters and obvious plotting
","Teenager Jake Tyler has been trouble ever since his father died DUI with him in the passenger seat. Physically fit and driven, it doesn't take much for him to lose control  a quality that has seen his family move house several times. Their most recent move takes them to a new high school where Jake finds a healthy culture of backyard fighting amongst the most popular students. Invited to what he thinks is a house party, Jake finds himself goaded into fight with the cocky local fight champion Ryan McCarthy in which his @ss is handed to him. Determined not to back down, Jake is taken to the school of fighter Jean Roqua.<br/><br/>For some reason I had it in my head that Never Back Down was a tough, adult action movie of sorts  probably due to the hyper-content of the trailer. The rather bland reality is that the film is a generic twist on Karate Kid, with a form of cage fighting (I don't care enough to phrase it correctly) taking the place of karate. We all know where it is going and the film offers nothing in the way of surprises or real interest along the way. The characters are paper-thin and their various stories are nothing more than lip-service to the idea of plotting rather than a genuine attempt to layer the film. The fights are so-so but not that exciting, although I did like the convincing and relevant use of phone cameras, you-tube etc. The delivery is endlessly frantic and full of music in an attempt to create life where none exists. Amazingly enough it works and the visual style, editing and wall-to-wall soundtrack does give it an energy and presence that nothing else about it warrants.<br/><br/>The cast match this approach by being incredibly good-looking; we have the ""geeks"" of course but otherwise everyone has bodies that I would kill for but will not get off the sofa for! Otherwise though they are pretty bland  Faris in particular having little beyond his abs. Cigandet enjoys himself as a cocky w*nker and plays it convincingly even if he has nothing else. Heard is another in the endless parade of cookie-cutter starlet-wannabes in the cult of youth that is Hollywood. Hounsou is better than the film deserves and is he only person who really does a decent performance  but his is still an easy character and an obvious one.<br/><br/>Never Back Down is nothing special whatsoever, although the effectively slick visuals and packaging will be enough to disguise this for many viewers. Think Karate Kid for the MTV generation and then take it down a few notches and that is what this film is. Will maybe suffice for fight fans and teenagers looking for something like the music videos but for the casual viewer it is just basic across the board."

","Hiyah! Never Back Down as a MMA movie is weak, flat out. For anyone who's done any sort of MMA training and has decent taste in movies, you should easily realize this is just MMA MTV style. There's nothing about it. Show hot chicks, show flashy cars, show lubed up dudes, and the melodramatic back stories that everyone is pretty much bored with by now.<br/><br/>The movie isn't completely awful, the dude who plays the ""badboy"" actually has some decent charisma. He reminded me of Paul Walker and Brad Pitt combined. Obviously Djimon(sp?) can act, so that's no surprise, but one thing he can't do is fight. His form was very amateur. And that's another thing that was poorly done with this film; the training for the actors. The kicks for our acting stars were beyond bad. Whoever trained the stand-up for this movie should be laughed at. I can't really make fun of the grappling, since the editing was so ridiculously fast. One second no submission, the next a knee bar...what? Huh? <br/><br/>With what I said above with how flashy it is, it's by far the biggest reason you'll keep watching. Not a single person is ugly in this movie, not a crappy car is seen in sight, and I think I saw a dog take a turd that was CGI'd with ""bling"" on it....I think. I was hoping it'd be so bad that MST3K would one day bash on it, and maybe they will, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's just a movie that was made for the MMA craze, predictable and hip as humanly possible. Check out Red Belt instead."

His vicious past of violence attracts the local bad-ass Ryan, who specials in mixed martial arts.

","At first i was skeptical, and thought i was seeing another Jean Claude Van Dam movie like Kickboxer. I was almost disappointed that such a great actor like Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator and Blood Diamond)would have thought of doing a cheesy version of Fight Club. Then i saw it and it all worked. The plot made sense and is semi-realistic considering all the teens obsessed with the whole UFC thing. The negatives were that High school kids aren't that organized to put together such an elaborate fight party like in the movie, and the actors looked way to old (and there real life ages both 26 for the two stars) but thats how movies are. Dijimon Hounsou did a great job and and it wasn't a bad role as much I thought it was before i saw the movie. Sean Ferris as well has a lot of potential to be a good on screen actor.

You just have to look past all the stereotypes. <br/><br/>I thought the cinematography was great. In a film that contains such a fast pace the array of unsteady camera shots was necessary. I mean it truly helped me relate to the plight of the characters, not to mention they did a great job. Ryan, the conflicting character plays his part well constantly showing his six-pack and lack of character and morals. Max was a great addition to Jake for comedy relief and Baja truly was gorgeous. I thought she had some great emotion. <br/><br/>Also, the music was great. They added some good rap songs in the necessary areas and some great rock music in others.
