","Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. <br/><br/>Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. <br/><br/>Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"Le-Samourai","Null","694","789","20 July 2004"," An Amazing Achievement in Animation.
","'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. <br/><br/>What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. <br/><br/>Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.<br/><br/>Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works  but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. <br/><br/>The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality. <br/><br/>'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again."

","There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.<br/><br/>Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fairytale fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.<br/><br/>The world of Spirited Away is simply bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs, much like in Mononoke, is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, even fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.<br/><br/>The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline, to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams.<br/><br/>Prepare to be Spirited Away........................"
"Vapaja","10","329","400","16 October 2002"," Mystical, engaging, wonderful!
","Spirited Away is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn't completely focused. The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.<br/><br/>In a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.<br/><br/>There was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don't even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried. And you will too."

"Balibari","9","470","612","18 October 2004"," Dub or sub?
","Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. <br/><br/>BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking. <br/><br/>I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.<br/><br/>A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say."
"sailvane-1","10","428","575","12 January 2005"," I disagree with Gazzer-2
","Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.<br/><br/>e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.<br/><br/>Apart from that, did you ever notice that some ""camera language"" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the ""camera"" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.<br/><br/>There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.<br/><br/>I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with ""Spirited Away"" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of ""Ice Age"" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe ""Spirited Away"" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while ""Ice Age"" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one."
"supertom-3","10","214","291","2 April 2004"," Best animated film I have seen!
","This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.<br/><br/>This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.<br/><br/>The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****"
"minimeltheminx","Null","231","319","11 October 2004"," better than Disney by a long shot
","I really enjoyed this film-everything about it glows and shines in a gentle luminosity. This film, if you have seen some of Miyazaki's other work, is quite light. The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can't wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.<br/><br/>Miyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it's scope and serenity, along with it's fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful."

"kraley","Null","178","273","4 October 2002"," A Fantastic Film (most literally)
","Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to ""suit American audiences"". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.<br/><br/>OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).<br/><br/>The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange ""theme park"" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very ""wrong"" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.<br/><br/>This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).<br/><br/>There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.<br/><br/>This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."

","Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet.

"Buddy-51","Null","32","45","3 May 2003"," a minority dissenting view
","In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, `Spirited Away,' a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned `amusement park' that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la `Carnival of Souls').  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.<br/><br/>No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that `Spirited Away' might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.   The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?    The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that `Spirited Away' has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well. <br/><br/>
`Spirited Away' offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care."

At that point, knew nothing about it.<br/><br/>After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.<br/><br/>I went to see ""Spirited Away"" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.<br/><br/>I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty.

","The art work alone is worthy of the engulfment one experiences when watching the big screen, making me wish I had seen it on the big screen.  That is, unless the major release in the US was the English language version. <br/><br/>
We ended up renting the DVD and watching it in English.  The sound, the voice of Chihiro in particular, grated our ears like nails on a chalk board. After watching it, we played around with the DVD and found the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles. Far more subtle and simply put, an AMAZING difference.<br/><br/>So, I would suggest watching it in both languages.  English so that you can concentrate on the scenery (with the sound turned down low.  Really, the screeching and shouting in English is annoying). Then watch it in Japanese for the color and mood the dialog provides."
"Juggertrout","10","23","34","21 June 2005"," The best animated film I have ever seen
","Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.<br/><br/>The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it."

My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned. It's very... different."
"Matti-Man","10","53","89","24 January 2005"," The audience is even more interesting than the film
","That ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing ""Spirited Away"" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other ""children's"" masterpieces like ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic ""Something Wicked this Way Comes""..<br/><br/>However, in reading through the other comments for ""Spirited Away"" here I was struck by the huge chasm between the views of those who love the film and (the appropriately small minority of) those who don't.<br/><br/>Even more striking is the strident hostility of those who don't like the film towards those who do. Critics here have called fans of the movie, ""liars to yourselves"", ""gushing"", ""flat-out wrong"" and the movie itself, ""inane"", ""unwatchable bilge"", ""muddled"", ""nonsensical"", ""gibberish"".<br/><br/>Now I'd be scratching my head in puzzlement even if these commentators had blandly stated that this film wasn't for them, but this outpouring of venom had me completely perplexed.<br/><br/>Another viewer states, ""The girl basically had to suffer for something even her parents didn't do wrong, they just wanted to explore things."" And here lies a glimpse of some possible explanations of why some folks don't get this movie. <br/><br/>The whole point is the parents *did* do something wrong. They greedily ate food that wasn't theirs. Apart from being just plain rude, it's stealing. As another commentator here pointed out, you have to look at ""Spirited Away"" against the context of the culture that produced it. The Japanese are very concerned about the erosion of their traditional values, the lack of respect kids have for their elders, the breakdown of family cohesion and other ""negative"" ""Western"" influences on their traditional, polite, family-oriented culture. Perhaps we in the West have trouble with the concepts in ""Spirited Away"" because the influences that the Japanese audiences fear are the Western ""values"" that are being thrust upon them, values that we've grown up with and forgotten how to fear.<br/><br/>Another critic commented ""I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people ... (though) my brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall. That was pretty funny, I must say."" This made me think back to when The Simpsons first started on TV - my daughter was three years old and she thought the funniest joke ever was when Maggie fell over. Now my daughter's a (very bright) 14 year old and these days it's the razor sharp satire of dysfunctional family life that makes her laugh out loud. QED. <br/><br/>If someone isn't sensitive to the morals that are being examined in this film, then of course the film is going to seem pointless. However, as the film plainly does have more than one good point to make, perhaps it's just that these critics aren't capable of grasping any of them.<br/><br/>But really guys (and you know who you are) don't take your frustration at not understanding ""Spirited Away"" out on those of us who do. It's not our fault you don't get it."

"jediknightcub","7","52","96","8 November 2002"," The word ""masterpiece"" is over-used
","The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.<br/><br/>While I found myself stunned by the visuals in Spirited Away (particularly a magnificently realized train ride across the sea), its lackluster story - little more than a rip-off of (or homage to) Alice In Wonderland - keeps this film from being a classic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Some of the ideas were extraordinarily imaginative (the spirit bathhouse, Haku's transformation into a dragon, Yubaba's transformation into a bird, the boiler-room operator), others were just downright ridiculous (No-Face's regurgitation, the bouncing disembodied heads, the baby, an evil twin sister - what is this Days Of Our Lives?).<br/><br/>This is not to say that I was expecting literal-minded filmmaking.  I was thoroughly impressed by the director's previous film, Princess Mononoke, but I felt its story was integral to its success (i.e. a hero's journey; the forces of human industrialization vs. nature and the need to co-exist peacefully).  The ""story"" in Spirited Away is much more simplistic (girl overcomes her fears) and, as a result, leaves little in the way of narrative thrust or suspense (especially for a 2 hour movie).  Princess Mononoke's story was epic and its running time and pace justified.  Spirited Away is merely serviceable in every way except its visual palette."
"Nextwiggin","10","5","6","28 March 2006"," Advice
","I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!"

","As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!<br/><br/>However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves. <br/><br/>Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene. <br/><br/>In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show."
"pip-7","10","25","45","3 May 2005"," A Movie Where Many Childhood Dreams Are Reborn...
","It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.<br/><br/>The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).<br/><br/>Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.<br/><br/>It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time."

","I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection.

The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch this movie, not only do I find things that I didn't notice the time before, but I feel a sense of having already seen certain things in it before, somewhere else. But I haven't - it is just the originality, and the new ideas that other movies will build on from this one. Everything is perfect. The illustrations are detailed, flowing, and mesmerizing. The musical score is dead-on, and sneaks along in the background for most of the running. And the story takes on a form that I am attempting to do in my first work - complete layers. Two people could watch this, and come away with different ideas and plot lines. This is exactly what a movie should do, keep everyone that sees it thinking about it afterwards. There is no definite ending or beginning, it is left purely to the imagination.<br/><br/>The entire film seems like just a slice of someone's imagination, and when I watch it, I consider it mine."

","I, like most people, came to know Miyazaki's films by Princess Mononoke. When I heard of this film's release, I was beyond excited. I didn't expect it to beat Mononoke, but I expected it to be really good. I was mistaken. It is better than Mononoke. It isn't really good, it's an animation masterpiece. I was in tears, not because the movie was moving, or happy, but because I had never had such fun in a movie theater.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is brilliant and vibrant, filled with the characters that nightmares and dreams are formed from. The animation is eye-popping to say the least...not just in color, sophistication or texture, but in MOVEMENT. The film flows like water, not like the stiff stone-like characters seen in most anime films, such as Ghost in the Shell or Jin-Roh. The film itself is so magnificently well-played...nobody in the film is really evil, but every step of the way is exciting.<br/><br/>As for the dubbing, it was excellent...while ALL other anime films looked so silly in their dubbed forms, I think this film is nearly perfect...there were maybe one or two moments in the film when I was reminded that I was watching it in a different language than its original form.<br/><br/>As a lover of fine cinema, animation plays a small, but vital, role in my passion. Spirited Away is amongst the best films in the medium...Miyazaki has proven himself to be a film-maker of diverse talent, and has launched himself into the first decade of a new millenium with a movie that is nothing less than timeless."

","This is not a bad movie at all, but its really not that great either. I don't really understand what all the endless praise is over.

I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something. <br/><br/>Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?! <br/><br/>There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesn't really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times) <br/><br/>Also I'm not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I don't really know who this movie is for. <br/><br/>As I said not a bad movie, but the story feels all over the place and feels pretty pointless when all is said and done."

","Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.<br/><br/>The story starts with a young girl named Chihiro, and her family, moving to a new place. When they wander into what seems like an abandoned theme park and her parents start to eat prepared food (but with no one around to attend them), they turn into pigs. Chihiro runs and encounters a bathhouse for the gods and spirits. With the help of a young boy named Haku, Chihiro learns that in order to reverse the effects of her parents dilemma, she must work in the bathhouse. Life isn't easy, not even for the gods. She'll come across bizarre creatures & places. She will learn hard work, the sense of loss, greed, & the importance of friendship and love.<br/><br/>It's dreamy-like quality, it gorgeous scenes, and it's incredible list of characters (frogs that talk, a dragon, a baby that is 12 feet tall, a multi-armed boiler-room man) will keep you glued to the story. <br/><br/>Children will love this film, yet it is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy and relish in it's beauty. It does have it's scary bits and images, however, so very young children may be frightened. But this is still the type of movie that you go out and buy, even if you don't have children. So imaginative is the world that Chihiro falls in, thoughts of 'Alice in Wonderland' & 'The Wizard of Oz' may come to mind. But 'Spirited Away' ends up with it's own originality. It's a timeless piece, and will eventually be a classic that will no doubt be shown to generations.<br/><br/>In the DVD, Disney made sure that the voice acting for the English version is top-notch, but, even if you don't liked dubbing, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.<br/><br/>How could 'Spirited Away' become the first anime film to be nominated for, AND WIN an Academy Award? How did it gross $200 million before it even came to the states? The answer lies in mastermind creator Hayao Miyazaki. So well known in Japan, he is now getting the recognition he deserves internationally. With past hits like Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and his studio, Ghibli, have created outstanding features that very few animation studios can even match. Their movies are hand-drawn, without all the CGI that many studios are using. Amid the fact that Disney has distributed these treasures, I would say that there isn't much in the Disney vaults that can even come close to matching what Miyazaki and his studio have produced.<br/><br/>Do not hesitate to watch this magical, enchanting, and rare gem that we have the privilege to see. And if you have seen it, go out of your way to view the rest of Miyazaki's films, like 'Nausicaa', 'Castle in the Sky', & 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.<br/><br/>Undeniably a perfect 10 out of 10"
"Danherb","10","18","34","2 June 2005"," Wonderful coming-of-age story, beautifully pictured
","Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.<br/><br/>Granted the story about this fantasy world with all kinds of exceptionally weird creatures and situations takes needs getting used to at first. But very soon the spectator is totally engrossed by the magical story and overwhelming pictures.<br/><br/>In view of the diversity of bizarre creatures, the filmmaker's creativity seems almost unlimited. The beautiful pictures have a very soothing and at the same time enthusiastic effect onto the spectator.<br/><br/>But the brilliance of the movie doesn't only result from the beauty of the pictures, the story itself is very subtle and profound. In short, it is a story about growing-up. Chihiro and her parents are on their way to their new home in the suburbs when they accidentally step into a magical world, where Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. From now on, Chihiro has to manage everything by herself. She has to attempt to turn her parents back into humans and is confronted with situations and characters that don't coincidentally seem like metaphors of our world. Now, Chihiro learns how to solve problems herself and how to deal with the characters of the people she meets. At the end, Chihiro has turned into a almost mature person. <br/><br/>Although occidental spectator won't be able to understand all symbolisms that are conveyed by the characters, but there's is actually no need of it. The fantastic world and its creatures perfectly work as a scenery for a wonderful coming-of-age story. <br/><br/>The wonderful, as customary for composer Joe Hisaishi, music adds even more magical beauty to the scenery."

","NOTE.. THERE MAY BE SPOILERS.. I AM NOT TRYING TO RUIN ANYTHING FOR ANYONE, BUT A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS MOVIE MUST NECESSARILY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.. IT IS HOPED THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE, BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT, YOU MAY WISH TO JUST TAKE EVERYONE'S WORD FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS BRILLIANT AND NOT READ ANY FURTHER FOR NOW.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is a genius and a true creator of Masterworks. ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"" is a perfect example of that genius, subtle and very powerful messages couched in enjoyable and visually beautiful form. One thing: Please don't use the incorrect Americanized title.. it removes a key issue from the movie, that of Duality, and Miyazaki wanted it there, or he WOULDN'T have titled it that way in the first place. One more thing: Watching the dub ruins the movie. If you want Disneyesque storytelling without content, watch the dub. If you want Miyazaki's movie, watch it in the original with subtitles, please..<br/><br/>Miyazaki holds the same views in all of his work.. ecology is always at the forefront.. as it was in ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"".<br/><br/>Spirited Away (for short) is important because it is the DUALITY that is at the core of the movie.. Duality.. Sameness.. what it is to be empty and how the hunger of emptiness can come to become an all encompassing NEED to ""swallow"" all that is around one.. That is saying something very significant about us. Miyazaki said that there ""is a little of No-Face in us all"" -- and that aspect of us, that ""No-Face"" with its hunger and need.. must find resolution. In Spirited Away, it was found through Zenobia, Yubaba's twin sister.. who gave No-Face the ""place"" he needed.. who gave that need and hunger that IS no-face, surcease, peace, finally.<br/><br/>Greed is obvious, human greed, in simple aspects of the movie.. Chihiro's parents acting like ""pigs"" and in so, BECOMING pigs themselves. That's not overly subtle (although many miss it and thing it just a bit of humor), but it is powerful... ""be so, and you will become so"". Take what is not yours to take, and your punishment will be swift and unyielding.<br/><br/>This carries over the environment as well.. and ties in nicely with two other factors.. the ""stink spirit"" which was NO STINK SPIRIT AT ALL.. but a powerful RIVER GOD.. who was so full of POLLUTION that he'd turned from something powerful and beautiful to a lumbering, stinking, barely able to move, thing of filth. That's a powerful image.<br/><br/>When he is ""cleansed"" (by the small and innocent Chihiro who has done nothing wrong -- she is the innocent (yes, she's spoiled and a bit surly at the start, but she grows quickly. Painfully at times, but quickly.. almost losing her identity (again the duality theme.. She is both Sen AND she is Chihiro.. that's why the Japanese title referred to them BOTH as being ""Spirited Away"".<br/><br/>When the River God is cleansed, you see what he REALLY is.. and he flies away, leaving Sen (for she is Sen at that time) a gift... a rare and powerful gift.<br/><br/>Then we look at Haku.. Who, in the scheme of duality has LOST his other side, his true and other self.. you may recall that he was described as having changed and since he become Yubaba's apprentice, he has become ""more and more pale and steely-faced"" -- in other words, losing more and more of ""himself"" -- and yet, Yubaba is willing to simply discard him once he is bleeding and dying and ""of no further use to her""... but Sen/Chihiro WON'T let him die.<br/><br/>Through the power of love, she brings him back -- only a love so strong could have saved him from the poisonous spell that was on the seal he stole from Yubaba's twin sister, Zenobia. But she over-rules that spell with her love, determination, and with the medicine, half of which she gave to No-Face to save HIM, and the other half of which she forces into Haku, to save HIM.. leaving her nothing to save her parents, but in the balance of ""whose need is greatest right NOW"" she acts correctly.<br/><br/>Saving Haku.. and then helping him recover his name (and saving him in a more profound way by FREEING him.. as he freed her by giving her back her clothes and her card with her name on it.. she had almost lost herself at that point.. she'd forgotten her name.. results in him saving her as well.. They save each other.<br/><br/>But WHY does Haku need saving? Because his river WAS FILLED IN. More Ecology.. we destroy, we pollute, we are GREEDY.. and the consequences are dire. Haku no longer has his river... the River God no longer can be clean due to our pollution.. and our greed turns Chihiro's parents into, LITERALLY, pigs..<br/><br/>We *are* the pigs. We are greedy, we destroy, we pollute, we even ""stink"" (remember the references to Sen as ""smelling"" bad and no one willing to work with her because of her human ""stink""? That's very much to the point.. we stink because the things we do literally STINK.. we turn to black everything we touch.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's message of duality, and ecology and salvation is very potent in Spirited Away... it's a very serious movie cloaked in the beautiful anime that makes watching it a pleasurable experience.. but if we just skim the surface and don't think about what is being said, we are as clueless and stupid as the parents who turn *themselves* into pigs.<br/><br/>That too is a subtle message.. ""miss the point, and you're doomed to repeat it"". And turn yourselves into pigs.. or worse yet, remain as pigs."

","About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.<br/><br/>
If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.<br/><br/>One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade. <br/><br/>However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.<br/><br/>I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.  <br/><br/>It's a masterpiece. See it."

","Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, or Spirited Away as the name is translated, is probably the best animated movie I've seen for a while.<br/><br/>Summary of the story: Young girl Chihiro is is moving with her parents, when they stop for a while at place, which her father describes as old amusement park. But soon it is visible, that this place is no ordinary amusement park. When sun sets Chihro's parents turn into pigs and spirits, ghosts and ancient gods start to roam around in a place ruled by old witch Yubaba. Chihiro must rescue her parents and herself from eternal slavery in Yubaba's bath house.<br/><br/>Not your typical Disney cartoon. And that is a compliment. No ready chewed, easy to point up moral codes, but more real grip from things. A line between good and bad is very vague line. Is Yuababa really a evil witch or is she just greedy old woman, who can learn from her mistakes? Do all bad deeds bring more sorrow, or can they sometimes bring something good? Chihiro grows, really grows during the story. She begins from a wimpy little girl and ends up to be brave, selfless girl, who ends up saving more --hmmm-- I think entities would be proper word in this case.<br/><br/>But Chihiro is not the only one growing during the story, there is also a nameless spirit named no-face, who ends up finding peace thanks to Chihiro.<br/><br/>There is also a young boy, Yubaba's apprentice Haku, who doesn't know who he really is. Yubaba is using Haku as a tool against her twin sister Zeniba.<br/><br/>It is rare, that a single movie contains so much material. It is even more rare to see animated movies with such depth.<br/><br/>Also for the acting, it's top notch, as is the animation. All backgrounds and characters are done with detail and passion.<br/><br/>I really feel, that this is one of those must see movies for all animation fans."
"codryfoundry","5","35","76","30 December 2014"," Chef Miyazaki forgets a few ingredients, and spoils his meal
","My sister lent me this movie over my winter break in December 2013. I had heard a lot of great things about it ever since I saw in it a Hollywood video store when was around eight or nine years old. On IMDb, it had an 8.7/10 back then, and the back of the DVD case had quotes like ""A masterpiece, pure and simple"" and ""Spectacularly inventive."" So, as you can imagine my expectations for this film were very high. I will start off by saying that I love anime and animation to their core. I grew up watching shows like Pokemon, Digimon, Avatar the Last Airbender, Dragonball Z, and cartoons on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. Many times the creators of these delicate experiences are able to submit excellent messages of friendship, honor, perseverance, bravery, physical and mental strength, etc. Mr. Miyazaki is well-known in many anime fans' minds as a ""master storyteller"" or ""brilliant animator."" Unfortunately, in ""Spirited Away"", the hype undershoots the expectations.<br/><br/>First problem: character development. When people in movies are not given enough background, emotion, and basic traits, the concern from the audience toward the characters tends to decrease or pique at a certain level. Sadly, the main character, Chihiro, is never really given any sufficient background outside of being the clichÃ©d, bratty, spoiled child that is moving to a new house. Granted, throughout the movie, she does grow out of that, but the story never gives her time to expand on why she was like the way she was. As I was watching, I kept having a feeling of being completely disinterested in most of the actions and decisions that were taken and made by Chihiro.<br/><br/>Second problem: plot and pacing. The story is not exactly the most original idea ever. The best way to sum up the story is like this: main character must persevere in order to get back home by using the power and strength they never knew they had. This plot hinders the overall message that is trying to be conveyed. Also, the story calls for plenty of problems and scenarios that seem very impeding to be solved all within a small time frame. In other words, they will all be dealt with in very convenient, rushed, unexplained, and ridiculous ways. For example, in a dream Chihiro has one night, she is in a barn screaming at the pigs (her parents), but she can't pick out which two pigs are her parents due to them all looking the same. Then, at the end of the movie, the antagonist gives her a test to pick out which pigs are her parents, and Chihiro is able to conclude in about ten seconds that NONE of them are her parents and, wouldn't you know it, she's right! This was the scene that made me pause the movie, stand up and say, ""Um, excuse me! Previous scene, anyone? She couldn't tell the differences between any of them in her dream. So, how is she just able to do the exact opposite after about a day or two?"" I guess this was intended to show how she's ""grown"" or ""matured"" since the beginning of the film, but it's really just a cold slap in the face of continuity and logic. In fact, many scenes don't seem to have any real bearing on the story or character development; they are just filler for any dorky fool out there looking for some eye-candy. It's almost like the movie is saying, ""Hey, we could delve more into our characters' stories, emotions, and motives, but we're just going to splash something pretty on the screen. It doesn't have to make sense or connect at all with the rest of the movie, so long as you are filled with a sense of awe."" Unfortunately, this leads into my next and final problem with this film.<br/><br/>Third problem: the logic of the spirit world and the human world. In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro and her family get stuck in the spirit world because they apparently venture in at the wrong time or when the sun sets and night falls. Afterward, Chihiro can't escape for some reason. But, this raises several questions like ""Did she ever try to escape during the day?"", ""How can humans wander into the spirit world no problem, but once the sun sets, can't exit at all?"", ""Have any spirits gone out and entered the human world if there is no clear gateway between the two worlds?"", and ""Why do the spirits only come out at night when Chihiro first enters, but they are all up and at it during the day throughout the rest of the movie?"" I kept feeling like the writers of the film sat down and decided to make a by-the-numbers anime film, or just hit the points they needed to hit. For example, hit the beginning, character does this and that, magical junk in between, bad-guy-is-bad moment, weird-thing-or-obstacle-protagonist-has-to-deal-with moment, more magical junk here and there, all-problems-somehow-wrapped-up-toward-the-end moment, and character-reunites-with-family-and-lives-happily-ever-after moment. There is no flow nor segue of story; stuff just happens the way it's either supposed to or how it's written. This was by far my biggest gripe of all with the movie.<br/><br/>To conclude, ""Spirited Away"" was alright, it wasn't great or terrible but average. The plot was incoherent, the characters were shallow and uninteresting, and the ""logic"" of the settings was completely ludicrous. It definitely won't be finding its way into my DVD/Blu-ray player anytime soon or even again, that's for sure. This movie could have been so much better if they had taken the time to putting thought in the right areas. It suffers so much from the reasons listed above and, in the end, fails to impress or even entertain at a decent level. It's a shameful predicament that will cast itself in the anime universe forever."
"cosmic_quest","10","16","31","6 October 2004"," A film Disney should learn lessons from
","My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.<br/><br/>'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.<br/><br/>Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting."

","Some slight spoilers<br/><br/>This was supposed to be the greatest film by Hayao Miyazaki.  Sorry, but that's not really the case.  Princess Mononoke and Castle of Cagliostro are both better than this one.  The animation is good, although creepy at times, but this is probably intentional.  The music's forgettable though.  But the main problem with ""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,"" is all of the plotholes.  These ruin the film.  No Face leaves a huge, convoluted mess. Why is it so interested in Sen/Chihiro?  Because she let it in the bath house when it was raining?  Listen people, you can avoid confusion by just a few lines.  Also, Haku's story is also a mess, but something I don't want to get into right now.  There are also some scenes that were utterly pointless. The scene in which the water god(when it's that mud thing) comes does nothing to advance the plot.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  A forgettable film that fails to have the same magic ""Castle of Cagliostro,"" did."
"Lady_Targaryen","8","9","16","23 January 2006"," The tunnel led Chihiro to a mysterious town....
","'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' is a cute story from a little girl called Chihiro, who is moving with her parents to a new place in the suburbs. During the travel,her father decides to take a shortcut along a lonely road. After getting out of the car and walking along a path for a while, they look to an abandoned city and stop in an abandoned restaurant full of food. Chihiro's mother and dad don't think twice and start to eat the food there, what Chihiro refuses to do. The night falls and that abandoned city become full of strange beings and spirits, and when Chihiro runs to her parents to go out of that place she discovers that they become pigs. A mysterious boy called Haku helps her and explains the situation to her,saying that she needs to get a job in the spa hotel for spirits and gods from Japan. The work is hard, but Chihiro does well. The problem now is to find a way to break the spell of her parents and go out from that strange ghost city...<br/><br/>This anime is very different from the animes I already watched. The story is very touching and truly unique, with another world inside the world we know. I would love to watch an anime series based in chihiro's life in the ghost's world. Hayao Miyazaki has my profound admiration, specially because ''Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi'''is not the only movie he did that I love: I also enjoy a lot ''My Neighbor Totoro ''. Of course that I think that this movie is totally worthy of the Oscar it received. By the way, the idea that Chihiro and Haku could forever stay in Yubaba's possession if they forget their real identities is very interesting to me,since it is a reality: if you loose your identity and forgets who you really are, your interests and your focus, you become lost in the world. The maturity of Chihiro is another easy thing to see, and adds another interesting understanding of the story."
"FilmOtaku","9","9","16","9 November 2003"," Miyazaki masterpiece
","I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.  <br/><br/>The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.<br/><br/>Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen."

I come from a background of loving many of the old Warner Brothers cartoons, and saw Jap-Animation as a threat, along side of Mtv, Nickelodean, and Cartoon Network, ruining children's cartoons. (I really prefer not to elaborate because I don't want to push any buttons on this board.) But this movie was phenomenal, its very rare that I am impressed by modern cartoons now days but this film dazzled me so much that I had to rewind the film and watch it again the next day. There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly."

Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.<br/><br/>Although Spirited Away is undeniably impressive visually, with stylish animation and imaginative design throughout, everything else about the film leaves A LOT to be desired, especially the trite story, in which a little girl, Chihiro, gets lost in a strange world and encounters a series of whimsical fantasy characters while trying to find her way home. It's The Wizard of Oz, but without the star quality of Garland, the amazing flying monkeys, catchy tunes, cute dog, and over-sexed dwarfs in garish outfits; it's Alice in Wonderland without the pungent whiff of opium; it's Labyrinth without the allure of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, the star power of Bowie, and the magic of Henson; it's Coraline, but.errr nowhere near as good (speaking of Neil Gaiman, it reminded a lot of Mirrormask, which also bored me to tears with its random, meandering narrative)."

However, in all aspects, (including the one that is most often in contention among anime fans, the English dub,) reached and then exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Chihiro is a little girl who is unwilling to join in with her gung-ho parents who are setting off to live in a new town. However, when her father's bad driving has them at a dead end in a forest glade, they discover a tunnel that leads into what seems to be an abandoned theme park town. However, when the sun goes down it becomes clear that this is a ghost town of a different sort, a place where spirits return each evening to relax and refresh themselves. Chihiro finds herself working at the towering Bath-house of the Spirits and trying to find a way of getting back to her home, encountering many incredible creatures along the way, including the brave water spirit/dragon Haku, gruff but kindly boiler-man Komaji, cranky witch/owner of the bath-house Yubaba and the mysterious wraith No-Face.<br/><br/>On the strength of the US English dub, it is an enjoyable and exhilarating film, with a well-written story, fantastic dialogue and, given the nature of the film, totally believable characters. Daveigh Chase is marvelous as Chihiro, and brings across her complex emotional states brilliantly. The supporting cast, including many Disney regulars, are on top form, and whilst it has no real stars on board, the skill of those involved proves it isn't necessary. I often found myself wondering if Wendee Lee was one of the cast members, but on discovering it was Susan Egan I felt like a complete dolt. David Ogden Stiers, the Peter Sellers of Disney, is a treat as Komaji, and Jason Marsden and Suzanne Pleshette are fairly engaging as Haku and Yubaba/Zeniba respectively. Bob Bergen and John Ratzenberger both make good cameos as well.<br/><br/>The visuals and sound are crisp and clean and unpretentious, the story is accessible whilst still being quirky and inventive. Whilst at the time of it's release I was repelled by the fact that it seemed a tad too Disney-ish, I now think I can safely say I was wrong. This isn't Alice In Wonderland; it's in a whole different class.<br/><br/>And by the way, my sister loved it too."
"aimeeluna","10","8","16","2 February 2005"," Miyazaki's Call : Please Protect the Environment
","Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a surreal, entertaining, and refreshing film for adults (not for kids who may find it weird). It portrays a very colorful cast with a simple plot line. It transports viewers to a dreamy land of super-natural, makes it a little frightening, yet because of the main character's innate innocence (she being a child), adult viewers are reminded how to be kids again...in another light. In the end, Miyazaki's constant message (it appears to be an ongoing call) prevails: protect our environment. :)Like all of Miyazaki's films, it is an expected hit, not only for its intricate plot line, but also for the name of the director himself. Attach Miyazaki's name, and Japan comes lining up. Too bad for America though, since they have yet to line up for a film that actually conveys a worthwhile message. Animations films in America are still equated for the kids' market, and it's a pity that it is still being marketed for them without considering animation as a distinct genre for all market groups."

","Chihiro and her parents are driving to their new house. She's upset to leave her old friends and school. When her father gets them lost in the woods, they stumble across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off and is sucked into a bath-house in a new world, a world of spirits. Chihiro is guided by Haku, henchman of the witch who controls the bath-house. The two of them work hard together to help Chihiro escape and rescue her parents. The youngster proves herself to be as independent as any spirit and fights through many distractions and inconveniences to return to her own world. Even though she's scared and upset, she makes some close friends among the eccentric characters she meets.<br/><br/>I've loved Miyazaki's work as long as I have known it but nothing compares to the experience of Spirited Away. I had not heard of the movie and had seen no trailers, so the unexpected animation was almost perfect. The characters were quite unique and no sane viewer would refuse the offer to follow the child in her enchanting adventure.<br/><br/>For years, I've always thought that one of the most important factors of a good movie is the way the title is presented at the beginning and there is no better example to prove my point than in this film. The music is completely overwhelming, especially the attractive sequence displayed at the beginning and repeated throughout.<br/><br/>There is very little criticism available, only that it's possible that the unique imagination of Hayou Miyazaki is not appreciated to the extent it should be by the viewers.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews and think it's unfair to compare the work with Disney's as the last thing I would call this feature is a 'children's' movie. The two styles are aiming at different audiences and both succeed."

","I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.<br/><br/>I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.<br/><br/>Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.<br/><br/>The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion."

","Here I find myself again reviewing another great Miyazaki movie. Spirted Away in my opinion is probably the second best Miyazaki movie to date with Grave of the Fireflies in first and Naussica in third. Spirted Away is a great movie for kids and adults alike. I found that it was not very scary, but some moments your kids might find more frightening then others. In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking. It is rated PG for scary image. I give it a 9.25 out of 10."
"benoitlelievre","10","7","14","10 May 2005"," So American yet so Japanese at the same time
","Remniscient of his fellow Japanese animator Satoshi Kon, Hayao Miyazaki offers us a good bath of Japanese folklore, suited in a well edited, fast paced, americanized form of animation. Miyazaki is more than a director, he's a writer. He's that kind of director that never leaves any kind of detail behind in quest to make a movie look over the top. This one was magnificent. Despite being billed as a child movie, well it ain't one, it's one of the most colorful audacious and creative anime ever made.<br/><br/>The setting of the plot, from the start, makes room for creativity. Trapped in a spirit world, Chihiro has to grow as a person to fight the dangers on her way back to normality and back to her parents. In an avalanche of obstacles that rivals any literary epic, Chihiro grows a willpower that will go beyond of what she every imagined. Spirited Away is the epitome of true cinema. It exploits the possibilities and the variables that cinema has to offer. Every choice Miyazaki makes for his movie is the good one. Truly astonishing.<br/><br/>So make the good choice too, buy this movie."
"meetjopeblack","10","7","14","1 February 2005"," Animation par excellance
","highly philosophical and deeply profound. I've seen this film for more than 5 times now and each viewing is still a new experience. It makes one reflect on family relations, growing up, embodiment, and one's name (so philosophical that it borders on not being able to be understood by the audience). If you're not in it for the insight, fill yourself with the beautiful graphics and display of colors. Spirited Away is a visual delight transporting you to a totally different world of spirits, spells, and magic. It is so realistic that one may get that spooky feeling after watching the movie (I did feel this because of No-name). The art complements the story; the animation gives life to the plot.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a wonder--the best of the best Miyazake animation films. With so many subplots, the film is able to sew together every bit of information and symbol it has solid tight. Every question answered, every character full of meaning. Sometimes, animation is better than real life. Spirited Away sure is a winner."
"jcye2001","Null","7","14","11 December 2004"," An absolute must-see. Amazingly fabulous!!
","I have seen many anime movies made by Hayao Miyazaki, such as PRINCESS MONONOKE, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND, LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY, etc. He's movies are all very meaningful and there's no word to describe how I feel watching these movies! He's just that good. While FEW PEOPLE may think it's not a good movie, it's only because they don't understand it. They have no clue about Japanese culture and they aren't very open-minded about it either. After seening all these anime movies, my desire to know everything about Japanese only increases.<br/><br/>All Miyazaki's films are wonderful and special, and each of them have deep meanings which only those who try to see it will understand the point of the movies.<br/><br/>Spirited Away has colorful, and extremely detailed arts in it, and the characters and their actions made them seem so real! It is a movie about how an immature, ten-year-old girl who, by accident, got into the spirit world with her parents, whom are turned into pigs because of greed. In order to save them, she must become a worker in the bathhouse for Gods. Throughout the movie, you meet interesting and fun characters, such as the tiny dust balls, they're just so cute! Chihiro, the little girl, must learn to be strong in order to survive and rescue her parents with the help of a dragon boy, Haku. The movie is really wonderful and I have seen it many times.<br/><br/>I'm really sad to hear from some people that he's not going to produce any of his own anime films any longer. (They are so good!) I really appreciated all his works, and I feel so lucky to get to see many of his movies! May Studio Ghibli live on forever!"
"Nearly_Headless_J","8","5","9","21 February 2008"," The older you are, the more you will love this movie...
","This film works well with childrenbut works wonders with adults. Much like ""Alice In Wonderland"", it revolves around a world which appears to be extraordinary  but at the same time reflects many aspects of our own society, and the human nature. Miyazaki's quality of animation is brilliant as usual, much like his vision to create something so creatively profound, entertaining and intensely symbolic. A perfect example of the latter is an appropriately named character called No-Face. To me he appeared to be a reference to the many socially insecure people out there, who stay in the shadows but secretly crave for friendship. When Chihiro behaves in a warm manner with him, he is so overwhelmed that he becomes desperate to seek her attention and to make her happy in any way possible. Another symbolic aspect I found towards the end of the movie, was when Haku strictly told Chihiro not to ""look back"", until she had come out of the cave. This instantly reminded me of a Greek myth I had read as a child, - whereby a man who had gone to depths of Hell to bring back his dead wife, was instructed to do the same, but failed to comply due to his doubtful nature. Perhaps Miyazaki wanted to imply that by ""looking back"", Chihiro would have unknowingly expressed a hint of regret and this might have enabled Yu-Baba to seize her back into the magical land. Of course, there is also the rather abrupt ending  which I had found a bit weird at first but when I thought about it I realised that it was most probably done on purpose, to maintain an element of mystery in the viewer's mind, as to whether Chihiro and Haku were ever able to meet again or not. All said and done, I did have one complaint with the movieconsidering the story involved an extraordinary, magical land there was an enormous amount of scope and although I found the movie to be very intriguing  I feel that it could have been even more adventurous and exciting. That's just me. On the whole though, I can't deny the fact that this is one of the most unique, enthralling animation experiences I've ever had. <br/><br/>My Final Rating: 8.5/10."

","'Spirited Away' is a Japanese film, and is available in the UK in dubbed & subtitled versions. I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving.

","All I can say about this film is. . . I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people.  Answer me this.  They take so much time to do detailed back grounds, which are beautiful, but are hidden by the grotesque characters that seem to all look the same to me, no matter what kind of anime.  I found myself being lost in the plot several times, with very poor character development, and apparently hyperactive dubbing.  What I mean by that is, how come everything they say, not matter what it is, comes out all in one rushed, messy breath.  Though, I did find this movie rather a comedy. My brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall.  That was pretty funny, I must say.  The only reason why we went to the movie in the first place was because my brother recieved credit extra credit for his college class for watching it. What a waste of over 2 hours of my life!  I could have been sharpening pencils, or making paper airplanes! Also, I found that there were characters that seemed to play no part at all.  Example:No face.  Ok, so he is the bad guy for about, 5 minutes, but then has no real purpose for being in the movie.  What is with that guy anyway.  Eeesh!  I have nightmares about that one. . . In conclusion, I just want to say, that through out this on going movie, I was ended up multipul times getting lost and confused.  My eyes also started to hurt after watching the choppy animation move across the screen.  I give this movie, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, I gets a big, fat 1, or maybe a zero.  No, one.

"beresfordjd","1","57","189","2 January 2010"," Eh?
","I find it hard to believe that anyone rates this film at all. Not one minute of this makes any sense. The animation is not as artistic as the fans of anime would have it. The story is ridiculous and the execution poor in the extreme. Anime is not my favourite form anyway but a good story is a good story especially if it is well executed. This garbage is neither a good story or well executed. It is as though some anime guy has just completed a bad LSD trip and committed it to film. There is no explanation of any happenings in the movie and all sorts of things happen surreal and otherwise and are just left to hang in the air. Pseuds would say that is the ""art"" in it. I say it's just daft and confusing for the viewer. There is little or no emotion in this endeavour either. Girl has parents turned to pigs-why? Maybe it makes more sense in the subtitled version than the dreadfully dubbed version but I doubt it very much. Another thing I hate about anime is the insistence in denying the ""Japanese-ness"" of the characters. They are drawn as westernised as any Pixar or Disney character. The only clue to its ethnic origin is the costume and backgrounds. All the kudos heaped on this tosh is a severe case of The Emperor's New Clothes. Avoid this rubbish , it is time you will never get back."
"mtgtuga","10","5","10","27 January 2005"," Great one
","Rightfully named the greatest Japanese animation director, Miyazaki delivers again. This movie is definitely his masterpiece. Every single aspect (at least the good ones!) that you could possibly imagine is present and accounted for.<br/><br/>After seeing Princess Mononoke, I sincerely believe Miyazaki to be gifted. Be careful in making wrong judgments just because it's an animation (hence a ""kid's movie"" according with the stereotypes); trust me, this movie will puzzle you beyond reason and it's much more effective in doing so than 99% of the so called ""real"" movies. Real life has never been so well depicted.. the story is pure fantasy, but the feelings, speeches, reactions are genuinely human.<br/><br/>Perhaps most of you don't know (or just don't care), but every great hero/leader had his doubts, disbelieves and moments of weakness. What made them great, was not the absence of such feelings, but the will power to move forward when every single bone in their body told them to run for cover...<br/><br/>And that, my friends, is exactly what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>See it.

"nabina-mitra","10","5","10","8 May 2004"," It really was good!
","The tale of the Chihiro, the small girl who finds her self in a strange and daunting spirit world working to save her parents and return them all to the world from which they have come. Not knowingly seen or heard of Miyazaki's work before ( although it takes a few times for a name to penetrate my consciousness), I was without preconceptions about the film apart from my friend's ""It's really good!"" as she handed the DVD to me as a birthday present. I have to agree with her. This film rocked. Appealing, I should say to many age groups, (I saw it with my mum and some 30 something year old friends), it in turn scared, startled, moved me, made me smile and laugh and warmed the deepest cockless of my heart. This has everything from adventure and mythology(Japanese of course) to friendship and love. I was with the little girl and her friends every step of the way. It is a bizzare film but very watchable and completely enchanting. The animation is much softer than the usual Japanese Manga style of cartoon, and the tale certainly not as bloody. (Barely bloody at all) I saw the American dubbed version and the Japanese, subtitled version one after the other, and I prefered the latter. A good film, when well subtitled, leaves you with the feeling of actually having heard the characters say the words in English, and this was the case with this film. The translation in the 2 versions were not the same and to me some of the subtleties in the Japanese version were lost in the American version were there was the added pressure of having to syncronise the words to(cartoon)lip movement. There were also some cultural adaptions from the Japanese version to better suit an American audience, which I prefered without.  Having said that, the American(English) version stands successfully in it's own right. My friends(& mum)who only watched the American version thoroughly enjoyed it. The DVD extras such as interviews with Miyazaki and the American director/producer? and the lead up to the Japanese release made fun watching too. Some of it just to get a little peek into the life/hard work/mad stresses behind making the film. I gave it a 10."

","A wonderful, wonderful movie! You don't often see movies that fill you with warmth and happiness. This is one of them though. I had not too high (but not low) expectations of an animated Japanese movie, but I was soon charmed by the brave little girl Chihiro and fascinated and swept away by her adventures. The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect. And with right: children do not need to see everything explained, they can enjoy a story just as much if it is mysterious.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 because it managed to transport me to a fairy tale world and bring me back happy and content. I still think of it at times, even though it was a while back I saw it."
"demondog2","10","5","10","20 December 2003"," Fun to watch and a fresh look
","Spirited Away is an amazing movie.  I've been getting so used to animation getting increasingly graphically detailed with computer-aided animation (Beauty and the Beast) or computer animation (Pixar stuff) that I forgot how good simple animation can be.  Like much Japanese artwork, a lot can be said with simple strokes of a brush.  Details here are applied to the areas they are required and not where they are unneeded.  This helps focus the eye and alleviates the nonstop detail that tends to numb you after an hour of a Pixar flick (although I love them all too).<br/><br/>I loved the creativity of it.  Since I'm a Westerner, it probably seems even more creative and new to me since I'm not used to dragons and spirits. Accordingly, the color palette seemed unique as well which made the movie seem fresh.<br/><br/>I'll agree with what others said about the movie being more of an uncontrolled wild ride rather than a plot, but that was OK for me."

I bought the DVD before I'd ever seen it (and didn't even watch it for a few days), but once I hit ""Play"" I've been hooked ever since. I have trouble going three days without watching it, and I'm enlisting my friends to watch the movie, but secretly so that I can have an excuse to watch it again.  I'll watch it dubbed or subtitled, it doesn't matter. I'm sick, and I don't want to get well.<br/><br/>Story?  Great.  Animation?  Stellar.  But that shouldn't be enough to enslave me to Miyazaki's vision.  What then keeps me coming back?  Well, I have one theory...<br/><br/>There's something about Chihiro that is utterly real, moreso than an in-the-flesh actress, even.  The way she runs, or cries, or sulks, or clings to her mother, I don't know how Miyazaki captured it all, but as Chihiro grows, I feel like I'm growing with her.  To me, that's why it's cheap to compare SA to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland; Dorothy and Alice are flat characters, while Chihiro is in my eyes a genuine 10-year-old child. My heart roots for Chihiro.<br/><br/>Yeah, maybe I'm lame, but I'll tell you this.  When I think about Hollywood's cookie-cutter punchline movies these days, I barely even feel temptation to attend.

Try to make the elements move, and you are greeted with the worst animation since ""Speed Racer"". It's a jarring thing, watching smooth CGI against badly animated characters and elements. That's something I'm willing to ignore - IF the story is compelling, that is.<br/><br/>Akira and this movie (and Ghost, to a lesser extent) share a terrible characteristic: they both can't make themselves tell a story with any consistency whatsoever. As in Akira, where the filmmakers were unsuccesful trying to tell a multi-volume story in 2+ hours, it seems Spirited Away tries to hard to tell a deep story - one that has so many dead ends you end up thinking either every small story is a metaphor about something the filmmakers didn't feel the need to tell you, or that this movie is just a collection of beautiful sketches.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As an example - why did Sen parents were turned into pigs? And why was she able to find them at the end of the movie? Why didn't she try earlier to do so? Why did Haku try to attack Sen? What was the importance of Sen knowing Haku from before? Why did Sen thought it was a good idea to return the seal to the witch' sister? And why was No-Face introduced as a character when he didn't add anything to the story? and...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, and the story does make sense once you think of it, or get to know the rest of the directors' output. As it is, I find it hard to understand just what the movie was all about. <br/><br/>Which is sad, since, in a way, I was really expecting to like this movie."

","What else can I say? It was such an enjoyment to watch. Everything was new, fresh, and surprising. The animation alone set an instant and unique atmosphere.

The characters were given an abundance of individuality which colored the story with further brilliance. Over all, a classic animation for all ages, which deserves every ounce of praise that is given to it.

","Spirited Away is one of those movies that leaves you with a lingering sense of wonder and happiness as the credits roll. It is one of a handful of movies that after the first viewing, I'm ready and willing to watch it again immediately. I am not an anime fan; I watched this simply due to the rave reviews, and I'm so happy that I did. The only problem now is getting others to watch it (""I HATE anime!"" they usually reply.)<br/><br/>This is not the anime I thought it would be... ie., no exclamation marks flying from characters' heads, or giant eyes or overly-dramatic reactions. It's much different from the Cartoon Network anime you might catch as you flip channels. It's a real art form. There were moments of beauty that I can't describe, like the camera soaring over the water-covered railroad tracks with the setting sun reflecting off the water.<br/><br/>I don't recommend movies on a whim; showing a person a movie is like giving them a gift, so I'm always careful about what movies I show to certain people; I can't think of a single person to whom I wouldn't want to show Spirited Away.<br/><br/>If you let yourself get caught up in the magic, it is a magical experience."

","I am baffled by how much people like this pointless and annoying movie. The protagonist is an irritating and uninteresting little girl, and the film has essentially no plot. It presents a series of weird encounters and situations, without ever a sense that it's going anywhere, and without ever showing an interesting way of dealing with them by the little girl. Rather, whatever she does happens for magical reasons to have been the right thing, giving the impression that we're watching her have one of those dreams in which she can do no wrong. For some reason people like this parade of strangeness without a plot or a likable protagonist enough to rate this film higher than Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, excellent films that actually have great characters, compelling plots, and in the latter case, also very imaginative encounters and situations."

","Up until the time I viewed this film, I equated the phrase ""Japanese animation"" with phrases like ""Pokemon,"" ""Digimon,"" and other ""mon's,"" that made me want to vomit. Hayao Miyazaki has really opened my eyes and made me realize just how wrong I really was.<br/><br/>The story opens with our hero, Chihiro, an apathetic, whiny little brat voiced brilliantly by Daveigh Chase, as she's moving to a new house. Her parents (Lauren Holly, Michael Chiklis) make a classic, horror-movie boo-boo by taking an alternate path. This lands them an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off. She then finds that what seems to be an amusement park is, in actuality, a bathhouse for the gods, and her parents, having helped themselves to the local buffet, have been turned into pigs. Left to her own devices, she has to give herself a personality overhaul in order to survive. Along the way, she meets colorful characters, such as Yubaba (voiced by Suzanne Pleschette,) her good-natured lackey Haku (James Marsden)and one of the cleaning girls (Susan Egan.) Miyazaki, who gave us films like Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso, has given us what could very possibly be the greatest animated film, ever. Complete with rich, well-rounded characters and breath-taking animation, this could aptly be described as a modern day Alice in Wonderland."

","I had only experienced Japanese cartoons with the mildly entertaining but ultimately terrible Pokémon and Digimon, but I have to say, I was looking forward more to this good looking film from Studio Ghibli, dubbed into English, from director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke). Basically ten-year old Chihiro (Lilo & Stitch's Daveigh Chase) is moving to a house in the suburbs with her mother (Dumb and Dumber's Lauren Holly) and father (The Shield's Michael Chiklis). They get out of the car to walk down a lonely dirt road, and end up in open country surroundings, and finding a café which the parents eat in. Chihiro wanders off, and briefly meets the mysterious Haku (Jason Marsden) who warns her to leave immediately, but she can't when she discovers her parents have become pigs, literally. Haku finds her and promises to help by by getting a job at the bathhouse working for Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), who has a nicer twin sister Zeniba (also Pleshette) and the thousands of God and spirit customers. Chihiro does as well as she can in this strange world, but she must find a way to break her parents spell and be able to return home. Also starring Hercules' Susan Egan as Lin, David Ogden Stiers as Kamajii and John Ratzenberger as Assistant Manager. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. It was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"

","Leave any preconceptions about this being a kids film at home, this is breathtaking. A simple enough story, told with such charm and imagination that it is hard not to love.

Every location is so full of life and spirit (pun intended) that a totally immersive atmosphere envelops the viewer at every stage. <br/><br/>The film is gentle, yet does not shy away from death and emotion. It's not over-sentimental in it's approach either, just perfectly balanced. It made me genuinely laugh out loud, and cry too - a film hasn't provoked this reaction in me for five years.<br/><br/>I have never seen such a brilliant animation, it surpasses the Bellvue Rendezvous and any other you care to think of.

You get a nice feeling when you watch it. It's a little bit dramatic, but you won't get down of it. It's some fantasy. There are creatures in it, like ghost. You won't see the difference between good and evil, 'cause the line between that is really vague. Some things look bad, but are good. It's a film who's loved by young and old. Even adults can enjoy the deep lying thoughts in it. I really recommit this. If you have watched this and liked it, but want some more action, you can try Princess Mononoke.

","Miyazaki once again demonstrates his clear perception of the child psyche in this excellent, beautiful, and almost haunting masterpiece of the animated form.<br/><br/>I first saw ""Spirited Away"" in Japanese, and then in English, dubbed by pixar, and i must say, both versions are excellent indeed.<br/><br/>The film begins with the journey of a small child, dragged along by her parents, waiting and watching and being what small children are. Then, as her excitable (and foolish) father is attracted by a ""theme park"" in the middle of a mysterious wood, the entire world changes in more ways than the viewer would have easily imagined. <br/><br/>The juxtaposition of expectation and result, fear and wonderment, awe and love... create an atmosphere, and a FEELING, that truly transcends any genre, stereotype, or precedent to the film. If you go into it expecting anime, expect the unexpected. If you go into it expecting horror, prepare to be swept away with the amazement of the ""revelations"" --if i may use the word tenuously-- which are at the center of this film's sweeping grandiosity. It is a wower indeed.<br/><br/>As for a more specific definition, This is a film based mainly upon the legends of the ""gods"" and ""spirits"" of Japanese legend and lore. It takes place mainly in a ""bathhouse of the gods"" a place where the spirits of the world (in this movie) come to relax, cleanse themselves of dirt and grime, and fraternize with other inhuman beings.<br/><br/>The entire experience is truly magical and not to be missed, so please, open your eyes, open your minds (at least a little), sit back, and enjoy the (marvelous) show."

","Spirited Away - Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi - 2001 Every year there's a handful of films that manage to take flight and cross international boundaries with massive success and translate to a truly international audience. In 2003 Hayao Miyazaki's Animated Masterpiece, Spirited Away, washed up on British shores to an audience who took it in and loved it as the beautiful ghost world tale it was meant to be. This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' like tale, of a young girl who's parents are turned in to pigs while exploring and enjoying the cuisine of a seemingly abandoned theme park. Chihiro remains trapped in this theme park, that after darkness, becomes a surreal world belonging to a collection of ghost and beasts. Chihiro settles down as best she can in this parallel word, as she befriends many characters, and searches for her parents. While the story line may be a little disjointed, the visual imagery of this film makes up for any faults. From the eccentric and eclectic characters, to the serene and stunning landscapes through which Chihiro journeys. This is thanks mainly to the fact that Miyazaki has combined hand drawn and computerised animation, to good effect. It successfully presents a film in a medium usually reserved for kids, but makes it encapsulating for both adult and child alike. Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen. 9/10"

","Some movies you just have to see to believe.  Spirited Away is one of them. Now I'm something of an anime/manga fan, but my wife is definitely not, and she LOVED this movie.  My young son also has become something of a Miyazaki fan, thanks to the DVDs of his movies.  (We now give a rousing ""Studio Ghibli"" cheer at the beginning of this and other Miyazaki films.)<br/><br/>My wife and I saw Spirited Away in a theatre, and unlike some japanimation I've seen, this does belong on a large screen.  However, it might be too intense for younger viewers.  It translates quite well to DVD, so no complaints there, but the amazing color pallete and generally high artistic quality deserve a vivid presentation.<br/><br/>I've heard and read complaints that some of the themes were too culturally-specific, that it would be impossible for an American unversed in Japanese mythology to understand the film.  Well, that suits me just fine; I rather like the sense of strangeness that comes with not quite knowing how all the themes tie together.  Perhaps it helped me identify with the main character, Chihiro, who as a young girl used to a technological society certainly isn't in a position to know the details of bathhouses for spirits.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the notion that if one goes just a little off the beaten track of modern Japan, one finds beautifully anachronistic spirit worlds. Fortunately, we didn't have to go too far afield to find Miyazaki's beautiful flight of fancy.  This film succeeds as a morality play on the pitfalls of carelessness and greed, as a comment on the persistence of deep cultural roots despite technological homogenization, and as an inspirational fairy tale of a girl who has to accept her extremely peculiar lot for the sake of her family.<br/><br/>Impressive. 9/10."

","While on their way to their new house in a new town, Chihiro and her parents take a short cut down a side road and come to a dead end with a dark passage way in a wall.  Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads.  They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park.  Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house.  As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls.  Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku.  He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.  However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.<br/><br/>The first I had heard of this film was when it won the Oscar (sadly this was the one part of my combination bet that I had got wrong and hence won nothing).  Since then the film has had world-wide promotion and arrived in the UK several years after it had first been shown.  Despite the worrying `Walt Disney' legend at the front of the credits, this is very much a Miyazaki film and the mouse has not turned it into something else.  My second worry was that the American team involved in the version I saw would bring out sarcasm in the same way as they (Lasseter) does in things like Monsters Inc etc.  I enjoy that style of humour but `Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' was much better than just that.<br/><br/>The plot involves the quest to recover Chihiro's parents from a spell that made them pigs, but the world in which the film is set is what makes it so enjoyable.  The world is imaginative and filled with all sorts of characters. Chihiro's journey explores themes of understanding, trust and friendship  all around the central quest, and in this way it is good that some parents I know have been taking their kids to see this film even if it isn't tied into a Happy Meal marketing campaign.  The characters are all pretty well developed and are interesting.  Chihiro is afraid but brings bravery from inside herself, Haku is a mystery but appears trustworthy, the mysterious noface could be a friend or foe.  What the film doesn't have is characters who do nothing  they all drive the story forward or provide the comic relief in some way.<br/><br/>The American cast do good jobs dubbing the characters.  Usually dubbed films are so poor that I always seek out subtitles, however here the job was as it were meant.  Chase is very good in one of her two Oscar nominated films that year and Mardsen has much more to do than in the X-Men films!  Support voices are all good and involve plenty of recognisable voices such as Chiklis, Holly, Ratzenberger and Stiers.<br/><br/>The film is a lot more accessible than much anime  sure there are still monsters and spirits but there are no major battles and way out visuals to deal with, kids can watch this (and should).  In fact I did quite like the simplicity of the tale.  Whereas kids movies recently tend towards the more sarcastic, cruel humour as much for adults, here the film is more about spirit (no pun) and moral courage.  It is also worth noting that, although there is magic, this is not some spectacle film like Harry Potter  Chihiro uses her brain and her heart to deal with things, not spells.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic  while CGI has been used, it never feels as totally computerised as Monster Inc etc does.  This isn't BETTER because it was hand drawn but it does fell a lot warmer and a lot more recognisable in terms of style.  The use of both techniques gives much to the look of the film.  As always the world and the characters come to life on the screen and are fantastic, creepy and beautiful all at once.<br/><br/>I don't mean to gush but I did enjoy this film for all it's simplistic plotting.  The quest is a straightforward plot device and would be a problem if that's all this film had to offer.  Happily the central story is supported by characters who are wonderfully drawn (both animated and developed) and set in a world that is visually impressive and imaginative. I looked at my watch and wondered where two hours had gone."

","Spirited Away is the latest in a string of incredible animated films by Hayao Miyazaki, the most renowned animator in Japanese history and most say in the best in world.  He takes a couple steps close to the best in the world title with this film. <br/><br/>It's the story of Chihiro as she is caught in a world where humans are not allowed: a world of magic, gods and a Japanese bathhouse.  As we meet Chihiro we realize that she is a bit spoiled and has never done anything for herself.  As her adventures progress, she matures in ways that she doesn't even realize.  This is a journey of self-discovery and a study in forced independence.  <br/><br/>Many have compared it to Alice In Wonderland, but where Alice, I thought, was a two-dimensional character going from adventure to adventure, Chihiro is well rounded.  She figures out how to be adaptable to an ever-changing world and discovers how to solve her problems instead of running away from them.  She is a `real' girl shoved into a world of Japanese mythology where she is ignorant of the rules.<br/><br/>And her problem solving is the best part of the film and the reason I liked this one better then Princess Mononoke.  Chihiro uses her kindness, courage and courtesy as her weapons.  Even when violence erupts all around her, she relies on her wit and intelligence instead of magic, swords or arrows. These are lessons that children should be exposed to instead of explosions and gore that make up a lot of cinema. If I had kids, you bet I'd be taking them to see this one.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong; this film is able to thrill adults, too.  It is so full of imagination the film seems barely able to contain itself.  While it is not as lush as Mononoke (it may have been the print I saw), Spirited Away is gorgeously animated and the dubbing work is almost perfectly synched.  In fact, after Chihiro is whisked away I didn't even notice anything out of place.<br/><br/>There were; however, about three scenes that I remember thinking that the score seemed out of place and became distracting, but that's my only complaint.  I can easily see why this is Japan's biggest moneymaking film of all time.  It's a story well told with visuals beautiful to behold.  It's simply timeless."

","I watched this movie at the recommendation of a trusted friend, but I am afraid I have to confess that this is one of the worst films I have yet come across. The animation technique is technically well executed, but the plot got spirited away in the process. At every instant new, completely unmotivated themes come up -- certainly ""imaginative"", but not ""creative"", as another friend put it very succinctly. The beginning is intriguing and raises high expectations, but I cannot help but think that the writer and director increasingly lost any sense of what the film should be about. Throughout most the second half, so-called evil 'stink spirits' run around vomiting non-stop (mildly amusing to watch), and towards the very end the film deteriorates into a sentimental, unoriginal story of true love and a misunderstood, wrongly resented witch. Oh my god, what a complete waste of time."

She goes from one weird place to another hardly commenting or expressing anything, outside of the stereotypical eye thing japanamation likes to do. It's full of monsters and ghosts doing vague and unusual things trying to be scary. I'm not for being spoon fed meaning in nice bite sized packages but this makes ""Brazil"" seem focused and straightforward. The film, like many of the charachters, just wanders and lingers around like an alztimer's patient trying to find his way out of a run down funhouse.  Visually it is pleasing, but so is my blender.

","There are a handful of movies that many people seemed to like, but I hated. This is near the top of the list of movies I hated. I found it to be nothing more than a long episode of Pokémon, with fabricated characters, fabricated scenarios, and no sense of logic, morals, or plot.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty good, and some of the creature/characters are visually interesting, but I found the plot, or lack thereof, to be just a progression through disjointed scenes with no story integrity.<br/><br/>I purchased it on DVD and watched it with my children who were 5 and 8 at the time. At that age they would watch videos they liked over and over again. But they never wanted to watch spirited away for a second time."

","As far as elegance goes, i believe this film has showed that and more. A truly enlightening and heart warming film, Spirited Away has brought me even closer to the fantasy and Japanese world. i very much enjoyed the music which sets the emotion of each scene. i've only seen the English version, and i must say that they did an excellent job on everything. I'm hoping that they come out with a sequel, because Haku (or Kohaku if you've seen the movie)promised they would see each other again. one flaw is that i believe that we should get a clearer background on each characters past. Little things in the movie like Chihiro falling down the steps when she was going to kamaji to ask for a job,her clumsiness while cleaning the 'big tub', and not being able to hold her breath the whole way across the bridge in the beginning of the movie have made her more human like and easy to relate to. This movie is truly a masterpiece and will remain one of my favorite movies of all time. I still hope they make a sequel!!!!! ^_^"

","I loved this movie. It allowed me to relive the wonder and edge-of-your-seat-excitement I experienced in my childhood when I watched another similar movie, The Neverending Story (Die Unendliche Geschichte). Watching Spirited Away awakened in my an almost insatiable appetite to see Neverending Story again. Although, unlike Miyazaki wondrous creation, it's German and older, although it's not animated and the special fx are a bit ""dated"", although it's about the coming of age of a little boy and not a little girl, the two movies are so much alike that when I watched it I had the feeling that Miyazaki's masterpiece is in fact the actualized Japanese version  of this movie... The escapist premise is essentially identical: 2 children find an exit door from the mundane, from the rollerink, one through a hallway in an crying citadel, the other through a book. Both have parents too absorbed by themselves and their problems who don't have enough time for their kids' problems. In both movies self-sacrifice is a condition for survival and return to the real world. And let us not forget the friendly flying dragon which appears in both movies and is in essence a spermatozoid with the head of a labrador golden retriever... ;^) Still, I have to admit that while the Neverending Story's symbols are quite accessible, Miyazaki's symbols are much more vague. German clarity permeates through Neverending Story, while the Japanese coexistence of sharp contrasts is prevalent in Spirited Away. Still, both are colossal monuments dedicated to imagination and creativity, and if that's what you like, you shouldn't skip watching this movie!"

","a morbid curiosity usually compels me to finish watching movies that are dull and pointless, but PRINCESS MONONOKE's lack of interestingness had me reaching for the 'eject' button halfway thru. after hearing some of the accolades heaped on SPIRITED AWAY, i thought i'd give miyazaki another spin, and, boy, was i sorry.<br/><br/>the movie's moral lessons veer toward the obvious--nothing groundbreakingly profound here--and are presented in an overly drawn-out fashion. here's an incomplete listing of SPIRITED AWAY's nice sentiments:<br/><br/>a) don't be a glutton. b) care about your friends. c) look after your parents. d) do not value money above human (or inhuman) relationships. e) work hard, despite the drudgery of it all.<br/><br/>now, the story is supposed to impart these valuable lessons by putting the protagonist in a dreamworld setting, where other, more twisted lessons are inextricably (and inexplicably) presented. whether intentional or not, the movie also implies:<br/><br/>a) one should trust strangers who lounge about, even if they eat people and later regurgitate them. jeffrey dahmer, anyone? b) one should make pacts with evil persons to get what one wants. c) parents are pigs, and children must will be their salvation. d) people who try to do good things for you now might have done good things for you in the past (perhaps even a past life?), so go ahead and trust them--your instincts will guide you.<br/><br/>well, so much for the beautifully inspiring movie everyone seems to be gushing about. . . .<br/><br/>speaking of beauty, i never found the animation that impressive: the same jerky, low-frame-rate presentation that plagues japanese anime is found here.

"SolidSnake86XX","9","4","8","28 September 2003"," Miyazaki's Latest Masterpiece
","Well, what a surprise; ""Miyazaki"" and ""masterpiece"" together in an affirmative sentence.  Spirited Away marks Miyazaki's first work as a semi-retired director, though the movie doesn't suffer from it in the least. Spirited Away is about a young girl gets lost in a world of ghosts and spirits and is forced to work at the bath house for specters.  Any fan of Miyazaki will instantly fall in love with this movie.  Don't be fooled by Disney's involvement or the fact that it's animated.  It's still very much anime, but not anime for anyone.  This is a good movie for young children and those who have a timeless love for movies.  If you're the kind of person who still loves Toy Story, for example, then this will become another one of your favorites.  People who are only into anime like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Beebop, this may not be the movie for you.  This is a movie for those who love anime of all kinds, like myself.  Spirited Away is a fanciful movie that most open-minded individuals will enjoy.  I'd have to give it a 9.25 out of 10."
"Nephilim-6","9","4","8","1 August 2003"," I didn't get it at first but then I saw it again.
","While Nausicaa is better this movie is a vast monument in animation. Therefor I find it an insult when people say something like Ice Age is better. sure Ice Age has pretty visuals but it does not have the depth and spirituality of Spirited Away.<br/><br/>However I cannot really blame most comments since most people don't really know Japanese culture other than Sushi, hightech gadgets,  Dragonball Z and Pokemon.<br/><br/>The thing with Spirited Away is that it delves deep into the spiritual side of Japanese culture. To Japanese people all things contain spirits. Hence all the gods and spirits in this movie. there's a lot of symbolism in this movie as well. And a lot of life lessons.<br/><br/>And what I find really important: it doesn't try to be a kiddy movie but more a family movie. Western people often seem to view animation as something only for kids. In Japan this is simply not true. Animation is for everyone. It provides an escape and a way to create outragious stories that would not have been able to be created through normal film.<br/><br/>i love it. I found it hard at first but after seeing it again all the puzzle pieces fell into place.<br/><br/>Still I do have some isues with the film. Actually only 1. the ending was too swift. It should have been worked out a little bit more.<br/><br/>
Other than that wonderful wonderful movie. <br/><br/>oh and btw (comment to one reviewer) watch the original japanese language version with subtitles. Chihiro does NOT have a high pitched voice. The whole ide of Dubbing in itself I find ludicrous."
"Spleen","10","4","8","29 April 2003"," I defy you not to be enchanted
","I was surprised when ""Sprited Away"" turned out to be every bit as wonderful as everyone said it was  one of the world's rare ""worth queueing for"" films  because ""Princess Mononoke"" decidedly wasn't. Yet behold! And my partner, who's somewhat harsher than me in referring to Miyazaki's previous film as ""Princess Monotony"", was as enchanted as I was.<br/><br/>I don't know how Miyazaki did it, exactly. He's created an altogether fresh fantasy world that doesn't come across merely as an all-too-laboured attempt to create an altogether fresh fantasy world. Describe it in words, and it sounds self-consciously quirky enough to put anyone off: it's a bath house for the spirits on the site of what appears to be a disused amusement park, presided over by an eccentric, mean-spirited old wizardess who's mother to a brat of an infant ten times larger than herself, the fires of which (the bath house, I mean) are stoked by a many-armed spider of a man who animates the soot particles to work for him ... and so on. It sounds like too much, too forced; but it unfolds on the screen naturally and magically, as though the world had simply been lying there, waiting to be discovered. And we discover it in exactly the right way (Miyazaki is a master story-teller, although I'd never thought so until now), through exactly the right protagonist: a girl who grows believably from a timid and clumsy outsider entirely reliant on the help and goodwill of others, to a confident (but still, no doubt, frightened) insider, able to help others in turn.<br/><br/>Since this seems to be an issue, I should say that it was the dubbed version I saw. But I don't see why this should be an issue. I think that all the anime fans, in whose eyes Disney can do nothing right, who moan incessantly about how awful the dubbed version is, are having us all on. Don't get me wrong: I loathe dubbing. I think that, in general, subtitles are much to be preferred. But I also know that none of the arguments against dubbing, good though they are in general, happen to apply here. Dubbing is bad because it prevents the actors from really acting, from projecting their own words with their own bodies and vocal chords; but this can't happen in a cartoon in any case. Dubbing is bad because the match of mouth movements to words is never quite good enough; but this isn't live action, and it isn't even a Disney-style cartoon, with every sibilant, every quiver of the lip, lovingly captured by the animators in 24-drawings-per-second detail: Japanese animation is not and was never meant to be detailed in that kind of way, and I'll wager that the English soundtrack matches the lip movements about as well as the Japanese soundtrack ever did. Dubbing is sometimes bad because it's possible to dub something into a language that just doesn't fit, which MIGHT have happened here had it been an important part of the story that it take place in, say, Tokyo; but in fact it's set in an uncertainly located, almost surreal fantasy bath house; under the circumstances it doesn't matter in the least what language everyone is speaking. In short: just this once, you can go with the dubbed version (which, I might add, has been dubbed with both love and skill), and you needn't feel embarrassed about doing so."

","Spirited Away makes Alice in Wonderland look like an older man's conceit -- Alice pokes fun at the adult world of an Oxford don, but Spirited Away brings us into the first person sensibilities of a ten year old girl.  I remember that world.<br/><br/>This is the only movie that has out-grossed Titanic at the box office in Japan, and it deserves more notice from all ages in the US and abroad.<br/><br/>Unlike his previous release, Princess Mononoke, this film avoids exposition, and simply immerses you in the same world of internal logic and magic that the heroine Chihiro must navigate.  This is the world of children coming into their own in the world -- the real world is equally an environment where they must discover rules, discover who holds power, discover their own virtue and honor.<br/><br/>Spirited Away simply gives us a fantasy setting for the reality of a child.<br/><br/>This is a visually lovely, imaginative, intelligent film that will please people of all ages (perhaps above six or so -- some of the kami may be too odd and scary for small children).<br/><br/>It is a favorite for me, and for my 9 year old son Joseph."
"FlickNomad","10","4","8","31 October 2002"," Spirited in So Many Ways...
","Hayao Miyazaki does it again, but much better then his previous Princess Mononoke. Spirited Away is a highly imaginative movie that does things that you can only find in the best children's fantasy books, but don't let that stop you if your an adult. At over 2 hours, it's epic-like, and requires a bit of attention.(And besides, there's a chunk or two of some scary parts that would give a 7 year old nightmares)<br/><br/>It follows the adventures of a young girl, Chihiro, in a spirit world, where she must fight to save her parents. Consequently, she must then look for work, as it is the only way she could survive in this other world. But the type of job that she will handle isn't going to be easy, and she will have to prove herself more then once. The characters she meets are so full of life, so amusing and colorful, it's hard to peel your eyes from the screen because you might miss something pretty amazing. It reminded me of Never Ending Story, Alice in Wonderland, and perhaps Time Bandits, and yet, it's completely original.<br/><br/>It's gorgeous to look at. Just as you think you will see the same thing on the next scene, it gets more dramatic, and the colors are handled beautifully. The dubbing is outstanding. And the movie stayed with me long after I saw it. It's a shame that Disney, who's distributing this in the US over from Japan, doesn't push this movie more. As of this writing, it's open in very few theaters, even though it's made millions outside BEFORE it came to the US. Regardless, this is a movie that you should hunt for and travel to go see. I await the DVD to become part of my library. Yes, it is that good.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 out of 10"
"Sinnerman","10","4","8","28 October 2002"," Hollywood Conspiracy to smother Asian films
","I don't get it. <br/><br/>Someone should forward the many positive IMDB user comments here to Disney. I can't help but feel there has been a blatantly mishandled distribution strategy for this film in the US of A.<br/><br/>Despite its near 100% critical praises and its massive US$200 million box office take even before its American release, Spirited Away is still playing in less than 100 theatres nation wide, which caused it to undeservedly languish in the lower reaches of the American movie charts even as we speak.<br/><br/>There has been much speculative criticism over Disney conspiratorial mishandling of Mayazaki's last film, the classic Princess Mononoke. It has since been disproved as an urban legend and the benefit of the doubt was given to Disney. How could it be possible that a company like Disney would willingly sacrifice profits for a greater aim of secretly smothering Mayazaki films for fear of adversely affecting its own vault of animated films?<br/><br/>Sadly, the present state for ""Spirited Away"" will definitely be re-surrecting this previously dispelled conspiracy theory. Unless the marketing/ distribution strategy for Spirited Away is revamped completely (i.e. a massive `Toy Story like' promotional campaign followed by a well deserved wide release relaunch), this lingering tainted image for the mouse company and Hollywood at large will likely remain. <br/><br/>You heard it here first. Expose Hollywood for what it is, a sinister oligopolistic business enterprise with hidden agendas of buying up distribution and remake rights of worthy Asian films, so as to smother them and minimise their chances of American success, thereby safeguarding their own selfish financial and market interest.<br/><br/>Its so disgustingly evil it makes me sick."

You'll leave the theater feeling eight years old.<br/><br/>Yet giggling at mystical creatures' cuteness doesn't begin to fully define this movie's depth. Those who prefer to keep their inner child under lock and key will still appreciate this movie's gorgeous animation, and simply unbelievable strangeness.<br/><br/>Like all timeless fairy tales, Spirited Away casts a spell on eyes and ears of all ages."

"kamikazeboy","10","4","8","3 January 2002"," Spirited Away is the crowning jewel in Japanese animation legend's career
","JAPANESE anime, with its stylish combination of post-apocalyptic visions, babes, violence and gore, has broken from cult status to mainstream outside of Japan in recent years.<br/><br/>But viewers expecting the usual dose of babes and bombs will get a surprise in Spirited Away. This animated movie, the highest-grossing in Japanese film history, is written and directed by the best-kept secret of Japanese animation - the legendary Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>His unique blend of restrained pastoral scenes, lushly rendered in traditional hand-drawn animation style, and stories flavoured with a strong social conscience, presents a more lyrical side of Japanese animation.<br/><br/>Four years in the making, Spirited Away is destined for classic status.<br/><br/>The heroine of the story is 10-year-old Chihiro. When the movie opens, she is sulking in the back of her family car as they are on their way to a new home. Things take a strange turn, however, when her father drives into an overgrown lane that takes the family to what seems to be a deserted theme park.<br/><br/>Chihiro's parents help themselves to some food, and are turned into pigs. And she finds herself trapped in an alternate world ruled by the evil sorceress Yubaba.<br/><br/>Forced to be independent, Chihiro survives by working in Yubaba's exotic bath house, patronised by Japanese gods. She is aided in her quest to cure her parents by Haku, a human boy who is Yubaba's magical apprentice.<br/><br/>The story follows the usual template of children's stories where a young protagonist learns resourcefulness in a crisis and matures into a better person.<br/><br/>Chihiro's plight is familiar to those who have read Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard Of Oz. The sorceress Yubaba bears a distinct resemblance to the Russian folk witch Baba Yaga.<br/><br/>But told in true Miyazaki style, Spirited Away unfolds like a magical carpet ride through the man's generous imagination.<br/><br/>The first lure is, quite simply, tactile. Miyazaki's hand-drawn style is lusciously detailed, providing a dizzying treat for the eyes.<br/><br/>The theme park boasts authentic architecture from various periods of Japanese history. The bath house brims with gorgeous interiors. And the lovingly-created, entirely charming gods and monsters who totter around this magical world put Pokemon's assembly-line crude scratchings to shame.<br/><br/>But above and beyond the visual splendour, Miyazaki is a storyteller non-pareil.<br/><br/>Chihiro's emotional journey is told with sensitivity and her character develops with an authentic ring of heartfelt truthfulness that would be admirable in a live action movie, and doubly amazing an accomplishment in an animated movie.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is often compared to Walt Disney by a Western press looking for a convenient soundbite introduction.<br/><br/>Although there are truly hilarious comedic bits in this movie as well as sidekicks aplenty, there is nary a singing teapot in shouting distance. The only music is a poetic folk song - just a voice with a samisen accompaniment worth sitting through the end credits for.<br/><br/>What has earned Miyazaki a loyal adult following is also the fact that his movies are thinly-disguised allegories. His last movie, Princess Mononoke, was a fable with an ecological message.<br/><br/>Spirited Away comments on everything from a forgotten Japan - the old world filled with gods, manners and more gracious customs - to the new materialism - represented by the No Face monster, plagued by insecurity and loneliness, who buys friendship with gold.<br/><br/>But these metaphors are handled with subtle delicacy, so that they can either be ignored at no expense to the story, or read for enrichment to the tale's already strong emotional core.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's movies are anchored in Japanese animist beliefs, flavoured by the culture and history of the country and steeped in its minimalist aesthetic.<br/><br/>
This last aspect has perhaps denied Miyazaki the mass appeal he so richly deserves. In a world brought up on the frenetic pacing and exploding shades of a Technicolored, Dolby-surround sound musical Disney world, Miyazaki's muted lyricism and gentle pacing takes getting used to.<br/><br/>But allow yourself to be spirited away, and there are great rewards in store. You will not regret this trip."

If Miyazaki's earlier films were less ambitious ( with which I strongly disagree - i. e.

And coming up with a nice set of actors to do the job though Daveigh Chase can be annoying at times ( I think Miyazaki meant her to be annoying at some times) she still plays the part of Chihiro well and the rest of the cast is great as well.<br/><br/>Either Way I would recommend you see this movie if you haven't already because it'll take you on one hell of Miyazaki's beautiful ride.<br/><br/>Overall 10 out of 10 stars."
"kennedrm","10","2","3","30 May 2007"," Deeper Meaning makes for a Fantastically Customizable film
","This is a film with a very simple plot but with very thick meaning. In short, Spirited Away is about a young girl, Chihiro, who witnesses her parents self destruction via a greedy modernist mentality. In order to save them from the self dug trap of modernity, Chihiro, later renamed Sen, goes into a magical world symbolic of tradition. That's it! --- Parents are sucked into modernity and are saved through their daughter's traditional experience. --- Now to get into the nitty gritty of the film. There is a plethora of symbolism for the viewer to ponder upon. Some of these symbols are quite obvious while others require a brief knowledge of the principles they represent. Here is a brief look at some of these principles:<br/><br/>1. Confucianism- the film is filed with Confucian references to a hierarchy and a respect given to elders. Without spoiling anything, look at the references to obedience found in the film and how Hayao Miyazaki presents this principle.<br/><br/>2. Buddhism- Buddhist believe in a life of nonattachment. This principle of rejecting attachment is one of the tools Buddhists are given to stop the cycle of suffering  An idea that is paramount to the understanding of the film. Also important to note with regard to Buddhism is the importance placed on the Middle Way  an idea similar to Taoist balance  this stresses not favoring one extreme over another  find the middle. The aversion to extremes is an important thread within the deeper meaning of the film. <br/><br/>3. Taoism- In inherent to Taoist principles is the idea one should follow their heart. Taoism also strongly values the idea of balance as represented by the Ying-Yang. This means that black and white, good and bad, warm and cold, all exist at the same time and when a good balance is found, there can be peace. Take this knowledge and apply it to the ideas presented in the film of following one's heart. Also pay particular attention to the balances, or maybe even lack there of, and what is happening when there is or is not a sense of balance.<br/><br/>Now that the basic knowledge has been established, watch the film and see how many different meanings are embedded in the picture. There are thousands! Every brush stroke that gives this anime life has meaning and this is what makes the film so fantastic. Aside from an entertaining storyline on the surface, the deeper meanings (which can be found by applying some of the principles above) are what make the film customizable for each viewer. The thought provoking nature of the film will leave an indelible mark on any viewer. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in being 'wowed' watch this film. Even with the deeper meanings aside, the artwork and flow of the story are phenomenal. The techniques used to give the picture life, light, texture, setting, have just as much if not more meaning that the contextual aspects of the film. And once again, even if you are not looking for a movie that requires a little bit of thought, everything which gives this film great meaning, are fantastically entertaining on their own without deeper meaning attached."
"Alli-Antar","10","2","3","6 March 2007"," This is a wonderful film for adults and children.
","This movie is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I was impressed with not only the creativity it must have taken to make this film, but also the strength of the female protagonist. The little girl Chihiro is the hero of the story (a modern fairy tale), and she must rescue her parents, who have been magically transformed into pigs due to their gluttony. Interestingly, and in contrast to many traditional fairy tales, none of the ""evil"" characters is completely evil - each character has at least one redeemable quality (even Yubaba, the ""evil"" sorceress, is nurturing toward her baby), making the film seem more believable and natural. The overall themes of the movie appear to be ecological awareness, identity (remaining true to oneself), kindness, moderation (avoidance of excess consumption), nourishing one's spirit, and resilience (persistence in the face of adversity). I came away from this film feeling inspired and refreshed."

It leaves me with a huge list of questions I cannot answer. Is it a real experience? Is it a dream? Is it a magical spell? What really happened? Are the characters symbolic or allegorical? (Should I study Japanese mythology to learn more?) Chihiro is moving to a new home. A spoiled brat, unhappy in the back seat of her parents car, she is taken, unwilling, into a strange world when her father takes what he thinks is shortcut that becomes a dead end. Tired of driving, he wants to explore. Chihiro is afraid, but she is more afraid of being left behind.<br/><br/>They find what seems to be an abandoned theme park, where her hungry parents come on a restaurant. They sit down and start to eat. Chihiro is too nervous to eat, so she wanders off. When she comes back, her parents have magically been turned into pigs. And so the magic begins.<br/><br/>You don't need to write a master's thesis on this movie to enjoy it. You don't need to answer any of your questions to enjoy it. In fact, this movie stays with you. Its scenes will wake you at night with insights and beauty. The music will haunt you, though I challenge you to remember a single musical theme.<br/><br/>I have experienced genius here.

","Out of all the Hayao Miyazaki films, this has to be the best one of all time. Sure, Nausicaa may be his masterpiece, but Spirited Away is much better. For starters, we have your spooled 10 year old girl moving to a new town and after her parents turn into pigs, she has to rescue them. Yeah sounds like a contrived plot, but its the way she goes about doing things, as well as splendid animation and music that make this worthwhile. She has to work for a living, and no kid will do that willingly, but she manages and makes friends who help her out along the way. The dub work by Pixar is excellent, it makes sense in Japanese or in English. There are no slow points: quiet scenes yes but nothing is boring, the screen demands your attrition with all the detail, hand drawn to boot. In fact, it might take 2-3 screening on DVD to see everything."

","I was amazed by this film. The stunning animation that Hayao Miyazaki put together, the characters made me smile, the storyline was well put together & the film has the right to all of the praise that it has got. Chihiro is my favourite character in the film, her attitude that progresses over the course of the film is great, from being scared & worried to a courageous & brave girl. The creatures freaked me out a little bit, but that's what you'd expect in a Miyazaki film. It's the best animated film ever made in the history of modern cinema, no animated film will beat it, if one ever does it will probably be made by Miyazaki himself. If you think this film is good, I advise watching Miyazaki's other work, his films combines fantasy with feelings, & easily sweeps Disney under the rug. Spirited Away is simply amazing, lovers of great animation. This is the perfect film for you."
"zerogirl42","10","2","3","28 December 2006"," Still a Classic
","Fun characters, interesting story, top-notch animation, and excellent music are just some of the highlights.<br/><br/>If you enjoy whimsical fantasy, run to rent this film. It's not just for children.<br/><br/>It was so nice to see a good, fantasy animation. I actually watched Spirited Away twice in the theater. The first time was with subtitles. I enjoyed it so much, I took some of my friends to see it a second time. This time I saw the English-dubbed version. I sat back and caught much more than the first time. I couldn't believe how much I missed without the dub. I could also get more emotionally involved and feel more connected to the film. The voice-acting was excellent.<br/><br/>I just saw Princess Mononoke which got me thinking about Spirited Away. I was told that they were made by the same people. Although they are both good films, I would say Spirited Away is better over all."

I'm not sure what that one little character is); the little black spider or bat; and Haku. The scenes where the dragon Haku turns back into his human form are really good, but I don't really think I can pick a favorite scene. I love the whole thing.

","After claimed-to-be-the-last Princess Mononoke, here came Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi by Miyazaki. I suppose the whole world is crazy about it, and of course it's worth.<br/><br/>The story starts with Chihiro and her family going on the way to their new house. They get lost and go through a gate to another world. When Chihiro's parents see the food in the market, they just sit down and eat but they turn out to turn into pigs. Chihiro is so scared but then when night falls, gods and spirits appear. Chihiro has no clue about anything happened but she keeps going. She gets a job in the bath house, finds out more and at last manages to leave this world after a series of events.<br/><br/>You must find the whole film is quite interesting and all the spirits and gods look really funny. We seem to be with Chihiro throughout her whole journey in the world of gods and spirits. She has a very pure heart and works really hard even when she's in trouble and doesn't understand the whole situation. When the Witch tries to take away Chihiro's identity and fool her around, Chihiro's belief really stands and gives her the way home. She's also willing to accept and help others, be them evil, strange, nasty, or greedy. Maybe the personalities she possesses are something we need but have lost. Of course identity is more than our names, but what the names mean to others counts most. Otherwise we'll just like No-Face.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's way to process the whole film may be a bit exaggerating compared with his previous works, but that makes it more enjoyable and more suitable for children. I've watched this film for five times, and every time I'll have some new thoughts. The inspiration brought by the film is of course subject to viewers, but I'm sure everyone will be fully satisfied with the film.<br/><br/>This is surely one of the best imaginative animations I've ever seen. Don't miss out!"
"Illyria2004","8","2","3","7 November 2006"," Outstanding vocal talent
","I actually admire Disney's moves to bring Miyazaki to the US. Purists will inevitably defend the authenticity of the original presentations but you can tell that Disney has invested significant effort into bringing great films such as ""Spirited Away"" to our neck of the woods. The vocal talent is amazing. I would probably like the subtitled versions just as much but I also have to give props to Disney for caring enough to pair this and other Miyazaki classics with distinguished vocal actors such as Gillian Anderson, Michael Chilkis, Phil Hartman, Suzanne Pleshette, and Christian Bale, just to name a few. I don't have a problem with subtitles and I would gladly watch the Miyazaki films as they were originally released but I beg to differ with anyone who has any qualms about Disney's dubbing. Whereas Disney's own animated films, sans Pixar, have been utterly mediocre (""Lilo and Stitch"" was probably its last best animated release), they seem to make up their failure through the incredibly successful importation of ""Spirited Away"" and its ilk."
"rh86","10","2","3","23 October 2006"," Be Sprited Away
","People call Hiyao Miyazaki the Japanese Disney but his work puts him on a far higher plane and Spirited Away shows this. The film starts like a fairly typical take on Alice in Wonderland or Narnia. A modern day girl is bought into a fantasy world and has to find her way back. But Miyazaki takes it even further. His heroine, ten year old Chihiro is a typically modern girl, upset about moving house and afraid of her new life. But after her parents take a detour into a strange tunnel she finds herself trapped and worst of all, her parents have been turned into pigs.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's fantasy world is quite simply jaw dropping. Strange creatures, some drawn from Japanese mythology others just from Miyazaki's mind populate this world and the bathhouse where Chihiro has to work. Just the images stay in your mind long after the end credits have rolled, an endless landscape of water, the cherry blossom fields.<br/><br/>But it's not just the fantastic images that make this film one of the best. The characters are utterly compelling and it's easy to forget when watching them, particularly the evil witch Yubaba that they are just cartoons.<br/><br/>Ignore any negative comments about this movie, an academy award, several million Japanese and countless film critics can't be wrong. Probably the best animated film since the early days of Disney (before it was all about the money)."

This feature was a surreal, magical journey for all ages (although the kids may be frightened in a few spots) that carries as many messages as you could care to search for. A nice touch is the amount of homages they have chosen to pay to other such fantasy films (Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, Neverending Story). Overall, a thrilling ride for the senses and a fresh breeze for anyone who is a little tired of the run of the mill fantasy crap that is being churned out by major American studios today.

","I'm not really the sort of person who sits through a movie with a list of mental check-boxes that I need ticked before I can say I enjoyed it, or would give it a ""10"". We all have these little checkboxes and are mostly unconscious of them while were watching a movie, but can become painfully conscious of them when the movie leaves them unticked (no plot... grrr NO tick in little box... patronising exposition... grrr, NO tick in little box) and a lot of people who need certain of these boxes ticked will be annoyed by Spirited Away. It's plot is meandering and ""join the dots"" at best and its characters, when viewed objectively, are actually somewhat skewed, either too peculiar or too saccharine to relate to.<br/><br/>But *I* don't care.<br/><br/>I'm the sort of person who can forgive any number of flaws if there's anything in the movie resembling genuine imagination, particularly if it's used in a meaningful way. Sometimes only one sublimely imaginative moment will satisfy me and make the film something that I will love and treasure forever however bad the rest of it is. For this reason, I love the whole of, for example, ""The Dark Crystal"", however dated it seems and stilted and wooden the dialogue, because it just DRIPs with dreamy originality.<br/><br/>*Every single scene* in Spirited Away seems to throb with a unique magic, it's a continuous *string* of these sublimely imaginative moments. To me, it has exactly the timeless wonder of Alice in Wonderland. And, amazingly, because writing a new fairy story is always very difficult, on an inexplicable fairy-tale logic level, it all rings true, hangs together and makes sense! Everything in this movie seems at once alien yet hauntingly familiar, like a particularly vivid and startlingly colourful dream. I felt, as the story unfolded, as if I had already seen it and loved it when I was a very small child, and had simply forgotten it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS My favourite sequences are: 1. Just after Chihiro and her parents walk through the archway into the sun-drenched Field of Smiling Stones and the music seems to lift off the ground like a dandelion seed in a soft breeze. I have spent many happy days on islands of the coast of Scotland in the summer that felt just like that, awake yet dreaming, bright and beautiful.<br/><br/>2. The water train sequence, which was strange and delightful. (That house on the tiny bit of land not much bigger than the house itself reminds me so *very* strongly of places I visited as a child on holiday in Scotland that I can hardly help but love it.)<br/><br/>3. The Cleansing of the River God, which was wonderful! SPOILERS END One warning, this movie might be frightening for very small children. My 5 year old nephew found it a bit too spooky in places (but loved it), even though he laughed all the way through even the scariest bits of ""Twilight Zone The Movie""...<br/><br/>Not *really* a kids movie, a movie for the kid inside adults..."
"rose_marwood","10","2","3","10 September 2006"," A must see!
","It doesn't matter whether you are a fan of anime or not - this film is a must see. It tells the story of a little girl who becomes lost in what appears to be an abandoned theme park when her parent stop for a break en-route to their new home. The reviewer who drew parallels with the Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland and Chity Chitty Bang Bang was spot on - it's the old favourite - a quest to return to ones own world brilliantly retold in cartoon form.<br/><br/>And what a cartoon! Chihiro and her parents are the only humans in a world of strange spirits and animals. Dragons and gods abound! Particularly spectacular scenes are those of the train crossing the never-ending lake, and the first view of Yubaba's oriental apartment, with her strange offspring entombed inside! One very important point - this film absolutely must be watched with the original Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not only to preserve the atmosphere of the original presentation, but because the American dub insults the audience by giving away plot spoilers. Do we really need to be told the use of the exotic building Chihiro is working in when it becomes blindingly obvious later in the film? Ten out of ten for an animation that will appeal to children and adults alike!"
"oschaefe","10","2","3","31 August 2006"," Second to none, Spirited Away mesmerizes
","I first saw Spirited Away somewhat 'in media res'; it was on HBO, and the first 10 minutes or so had already passed by. I had not seen any Miyazaki films previous to that, and didn't no quite what to expect as I saw a young Japanese girl wandering through a seeming ghost town. Now, most of the time I start viewing a film like this - missing, in this case, the initial exposition of Chihiro's journey with her parents from Japan to the spirit world - it takes a bit of time to reorient myself into the film's world, especially in a fantasy film.<br/><br/>It is to Spirited Away's credit that there was, in fact, no alienating feel - the environment, while somewhat abstract (little of the spirit world as a whole, or spirit world/real world relation is ever explained), is somehow familiar. Chihiro's journey is not complicated, nor overly sentimental, but endearingly earnest. Like Dorothy, she's just trying to get home, save her parents. The stakes are surprisingly small, yet for a girl of Chihiro's innocence, more compelling than contemporary Disney cartoons like Mulan and Hercules. Sure, the nation or universe isn't hanging on Chihiro's utterly personal quest, but to her - and I credit Miyazaki's subtle, uncomplicated animation of her character for this effect - it is everything.<br/><br/>Of course, Miyazaki's visual imagination knows no bounds, and Spirited Away is one of his most effective manifestation of encapsulating wonder. But it is not only the pleasingly sculpted yet somehow threatening spirits, or the way the character float through, not walk on, their world that give Spirited Away its texture; Other films, indeed, have more effectively conveyed a world in pictures, but Spirited Away has a pace that exposes the viewer incrementally to the festival, the baths, the spirits and the enduring myth more memorable than anything Disney has yet produced.<br/><br/>I am 21 years old, yet I felt like I was 6 when watching this film, as if the story was being read to me by my parents before bed. I was carried away by the pace of Chihiro as she travels along, and as she becomes ever more involved with this world - as the concerns of the parallel universe take over from Chihiro's single-minded objective - so did I. Why did this film have such an effect? Many reasons - the animation and the pacing, as I mentioned, as well as the strength of the voice acting (I unapolagetically recommend the dubbed version for an initial viewing; it is very compelling, and subtitles will distract you from the soft beauty of Miyazaki's vision), well-conceived non-human characters (Many of whom say nothing or almost nothing, but express themselves through incredibly well-directed mime) and a mythic realm worthy of novels.<br/><br/>Of course, the magic is probably only maintained because this is not a novel-like TV series, where every last corner of a universe is explored. Instead, Miyazaki gives us a bit of the world, just whetting our appetites enough without bombarding us with too much nonsense. But the effect isn't an oft-cited ""leaves you begging for more"", but a sense of fullness, completeness, in that this story neatly brings itself from beginning to middle to end, into then back out of again a world that is more peaceful, adventurous, entrancing, and lovely than the one in which we live - but, of course, ultimately where we do not belong."

","This is one of my favourite movies.<br/><br/>After watching the original version in Japan, I have come across with the English dubbed version here in the UK. I'm afraid the English voice of the main character is 'mismatching' at the best, compared to the original Japanese version.<br/><br/>It is clearly the problem with casting. Throughout the English version, the girl's voice sounds nothing but an innocent little kid, while the Japanese version gains certain strength as the story progresses clearly reflecting the subtle change within the main character.<br/><br/>After all I am very disappointed with the English version, and as Studio Ghibli could had have a say to it, I'd like to reflect it in my evaluation. However, the movie itself is fantastic and is not an ordinary pop-""anime"" but rather one of masterpiece films that is made with animation."

","In my opinion, ""Spirited Away"" is certainly the best animated movie ever. The quality of animation is obviously rousing and leaves no doubts who is the greatest master of contemporary animation. Hayao Miyazaki created fantastic, surrealistic world with great reverence. Every shot from this film can be regarded as a work of art as well as every single scene takes my breath away to such an extent that I can't even point out which one made the biggest impression on me. Nevertheless, the beautiful workmanship is not only virtue of this flick as ""Spirited Away"" provides also extremely coherent plot. It occurs that Miyazaki's imagination has no limits. The main heroine is entangled in a series of unexpected events having their roots probably in the mythology. The story develops through and extensively uses the main heroine. All characters are incredibly likable, which unceasingly attracts viewer's attention. ""Spirited Away"" is a very universal parable which works on many levels and offers, at the same time, a unique experience. Thus, I consider this film an absolute masterpiece and I highly recommend it regardless of age and any other factors."

Out of all of them, my favorite scene is the one in which Sen cleans the muddy spirit because this is where she really starts to take a hold of the situation and begin to rely on herself. I loved to see how innocent Sen was in the beginning and then watching her mature and gain courage throughout the rest of the movie.

","I think what the director has successfully done here for the first time since Lewis Carrol is that he created a true dream world. As friend pointed out to me, when you're having a dream, everything makes sense in the moment. Of course soot balls would come to life and bounce around, of course ten foot babies would turn into mice and witches into birds... Its only when you wake up that you realize the dream world's disruption of logic. And when you've waken up, your memory is shaken. While you feel the full effects of the fantasy, the sequence of events disappear as rapidly as you wake.<br/><br/>In Spirited Away, we can finally remember those dreams.<br/><br/>This film is full of vibrant colors and is rich in Japan's mythical history (all of the 'spirits' in the movie exist in Japanese storytelling). The score further takes you away from the real world, back to your childhood, into your most delightful and disturbing of dreams. The love story is underdeveloped in a tasteful but mysterious way.<br/><br/>From the beginning we identify with the heroine, Chihiro. From her grumpy moods and stubborn demeanor, to the smallest details in her movement and expressions remind us of our awkward childhood years. She is lonely, she is brave, she is loving and kind- the picture of innocent youth.<br/><br/>When the movie ends, you want there to be more, you don't want the dream to end. This director has captured something very precious on film, and it truly is a work of art to watch."
"monkeygirlliz002","10","2","3","4 January 2006"," A movie beyond my wildest dreams . . .
","Spirited Away won my heart over the first time I saw it. It's beautiful---that's all I can really say. No other words could appropriately describe the ingenious art of this Miyazaki classic. The backgrounds---eloquent. The animation---enthralling. The characters---captivating. The story---unique and completely original; a jewel among stories and plots. The character development is superb, and you truly feel as if you know the people you see. Miyazaki is a pure genius, and his movies are some of the most moving I've ever had the honor to see. Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away---his work is purely brilliant, and his enchanting and enrapturing movies have done naught but glow with his brilliance. I could watch Spirited Away every day for the rest of my life and never tire of it. It's undeniably one of the most beautiful movies of all time."
"Alan-40","10","2","3","27 December 2005"," The story and the art are in the detail
","There are numerous and inevitable comparisons of Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland but I think they all miss the mark. The vision that Hayho Miyazaki conjures up is so unique and quirky that many critics seem to reach for a comparison just to attempt to get their minds around what they have just seen. My view is such comparisons do disservice to both works.<br/><br/>Chihiro is something of a tiresome brat at the beginning of the story, an easy place to start that everyone can recognize. (Already we have diverged from the story of Alice) It seems that only her diminutive size renders her appealing. She needs rescuing, but not from the forced relocation she deplores as you might think, but from her own ennui and, possibly, the unintentional neglect of her own parents. This is a situation that most children can recognize or relate to, even ones who were children decades ago as well as those too young to recognize what is going on.<br/><br/>This is where much of the true art comes in, and what makes so worth watching. Chihiro becomes more real in each frame. Her story of growth is pieced together meticulously but with nearly unbreakable mortar. She starts out passive and rightfully afraid of nearly everything that is happening to her, but with believable resilience, some luck, and some help from odd strangers she graduates from simply enduring to actively engaging her challenges in a way that is truly inspiring.<br/><br/>One of the most important aspects to the story is that once Chihiro is in the spirit world, she is treated like an adult. She may not be cherished at first (actually actively despised due to no fault of her own), but she wins the chance to sign an employment contract, an act not common to 10 year olds. Once she does, she has made her own place and is accepted. She still must deal with derision from most of the creatures who populate the world (""not for a human"") and the unwelcome regard of her employer (sorceress Yu-Babba) but at least she finds a low rung on the social ladder. She must give up even her own name and take the name Sen, becoming someone else that must win Chihiro back, as well as the restoration of her parents.<br/><br/>A key insight of the artwork lies in the fact that Kamajii, the spider-like boiler room attendant, Yu-Baaba and Zeniiba the twin sorceresses with way over-sized heads, and Bou, Yu-Baaba's gigantic baby, appear the way they do not because that is the the way an adult would see them, but the way a 10 year old girl might. Miyazaki-san has managed to reach back in his mind to see this, helped with his observations of a daughter of a friend who was about that age. An overbearing old woman's face would dominate the field of view of a girl as small as Chihiro, and the busy workman's arms would seem numerous and far reaching.<br/><br/>One thread that I would have like to see played out more is the story of Lin, the hardworking and seemingly human girl who takes risks on Chihiro's behalf before she secures a contract, and then is delighted to take her as an apprentice, although she publicly hides it. (""Don't dump her on me!""). She is kind to Chihiro when she doesn't have to be, and looks after her. Rin has her own story that hasn't been told, in a respite moment she tells Chihiro that she wants to leave the bath-house where they work. Following Rin's lead most of the rest of the bath-house workers, who once despised all humans, are cheering for her to succeed. But Rin and Chihiro don't even get to say goodbye.<br/><br/>Much has and will be written about the fantastic paintings come to life, and the incredible attention to detail that makes the movie more lifelike in many ways than a conventional reel would be. This is probably better experienced than discussed, but there is no flaw or fault in any frame that you can find. I am completely floored by critiques of this film that have anything bad to say about the animation  don't listen to them. You will only be cheating yourself; it does not get any better than this.<br/><br/>Update: I got around to watching this again with the Japanese soundtrack, and as others have mentioned there are some fairly significant deviations between the Japanese and English versions of dialog. Further, the English subtitles to the Japanese track are not always perfect translations -- mostly pretty good. (When Chihiro says ""Hai!"" it can mean, ""Yes,"" ""Yes 'm,"" or ""right."") Unlike some other reviewers I think the English version is in many ways superior. In many cases dialog is not dependent on lip-sync, and the American writers took advantage of this to interject some things that would otherwise be unclear. I would recommend everyone watch both versions."
"rggcandy","10","2","3","14 October 2005"," There is one word that could be used to sum up this film: nice.
","This film is just a pleasure on the eyes to watch. The number of amusing characters like the soots (those little friendly comical squeaking black balls of ash). The art style used was brilliant as well, including great backgrounds. The music it self was the part that makes the film, I say. The tune that plays when they are in the train is the best. But mainly the music is so calm and can make you feel very relaxed, it could even bring a tear to your eye if you're that sensitive. First time seeing it, it is quite scary especially at the beginning when the sun sets and after they are off the train. The story is great as well and not so weird as to confuse you. Although saying these things the film is fantasy and if you don't like fantasy, you won't like the film which is a shame as it is so very good. The main plot (family moving to new home father wants to take a look around is turned into a pig along with his wife, young daughter has to save the day) feels as though you've seen it being used somewhere before. But that doesn't matter as the rest of the film makes up for it. Children Will love it as well as adults. The amount of clever ideas used never seems to end as a world where anything can happen (not to sound cheesy or anything) and unlike films you get here, the fact that the weird things are left unexplained as to what they are or how they came to be get rid of boring scenes of characters trying to explain these things and taking up good film time. Forget the nead to ask: why? and just sit back watch one the best films you will ever see."
"Dede1982","10","2","3","3 April 2005"," One word: Amazing
","I don't know where to begin describing a movie as powerful as this one. Well, I decided to watch this movie since I liked ""Princess Mononoke"". Normally, I'm not very much into animated movies but since they became more and more popular during the last years (e.g. ""Finding Nemo, ""The Incredibles"", etc.) I decided to watch this one as well. The result was just overwhelming. The artwork, the characters, the story, everything merges into one big piece of movie history. The most amazing thing about the movie may be the fact of its authenticity: I think everyone of us sees a bit of Chihiro in themselves. The struggle of growing up, being abandoned from ones parents for the first time, learning how hard work can be- only to name SOME of the problems Chihiro (and with her all of us) has to face. Miyazaki manages to combine all the morally important points with a great portion of humour and drama. Besides the story based perfection there is the great animation of the movie. In my opinion it's delivering the message better than the computer generated kind as it is presented in the movies I mentioned above. If you now think I exaggerated with this review, please, do me the favor and watch this movie. There are so many movies of utter stupidity and lack of intelligence nowadays. If you really want to see a movie that makes you think some longer than the 128 minutes you watch it, just watch it. This is not only a movie about growing up- it's also masterpiece that deserves some attention."
"deadend-2","10","2","3","2 April 2005"," Masterpiece from Miyazaki
","I guess spirited away is the best animated film i've ever seen. Only movies what can even compare with this film is Princess Mononoke (What is also Miyazaki's film). Spirited away is entertaining for every ages. Mystical Japanese feeling is outstanding! This is not the best animated film ever. This is maybe the best FILM ever made! Movie tell's story about little girl named Chihiro. She's has to move into new house, but she doesn't want to. While driving to the house Chihiro's father misses the road. The family arrives in front of strange tunnel. They goes in. After long walking they arrives in tiny abandoned village. Strangely family sees a lots of food on restaurant's table. Chihiros father and mother goes to eat. Chihiro doesn't want to. She goes to the bridge. There she meets boy named Haku. But Haku tell's her to go away. But it was too late...<br/><br/>Miyazaki has been named to Japanese Disney. Thats not right. Miyazaki's films has been much more interesting, beautiful and simply better movies. Watch it."
"JTurner82","10","2","3","20 March 2005"," A masterpiece of art from the Walt Disney of Japanese animation.
","As with Miyazaki's films, SPIRITED AWAY is a magical tapestry of sights and sounds filled with exotic creatures, mythical settings, and, for its heroine, a little girl named Chihiro who is cute and sweet and thankfully not a selfish brat or bad-tempered hysterical bitch (unlike some of the other Anime I was watching around this time period). She starts off as initially sulky, but mainly because of a situation we can all relate to: she is moving with her parents to a new home, and thinks that her new life is ""gonna stink"". She becomes understandably panicked and suspicious when her parents decide to cross through a forbidden tunnel to a restaurant-filled village where they gobble up food that is sacred and cursed. Yes, CURSED -- her parents are transformed into pigs! To free her mother and father, Chihiro must find work at the town's central bathhouse (populated with all sorts of bizarre and unconventional spirits). The bathhouse's contemptuous owner, a greedy sorceress named Yubaba (who has, MY GOODNESS, THE HUGEST BABY I HAVE *EVER* SEEN!), grudgingly agrees, and in doing so renames her Sen. Although our ten-year old heroine is at first frowned upon by many of the bath house workers, Chihiro finds true friends in Kamaji, the six-legged(!) boiler man, Lin, the gruff but loyal bath house woman, and of course, Haku, a mysterious pale-faced boy whom Chihiro seems to have a deep connection with....<br/><br/>To reveal anything more about this masterpiece would be a crime, but I will emphasize that the artistry is jam-packed with weirdness, imagination, and creativity, from the bathhouse's exotic-looking guests to a mysterious shadowy specter called No Face, who voices anyone he swallows -- and tempts people with gold. The sceneries also deserve special recognition; every location in the film, from the bathhouse's atrium to a breathtaking train ride across a glossy seabed (my personal favorite sequence in the movie) is painted with love and care... so stunning that one feels tempted to grab it like candy. Joe Hisaishi's music score, although not as memorable as some of his earlier works for Miyazaki, is a fabulous accompaniment for the picture; some of the tunes work better for the scenes than as a listening experience. The characters, as always, are believable, full-fledged, and multi-faceted -- there are no cardboard cut characters or caricatures present.<br/><br/>Under the supervision of John Lasseter, a longtime fan of Miyazaki (and creator of many PIXAR productions, most notably TOY STORY, MONSTERS INC., and FINDING NEMO), and Disney director Kirk Wise, the film was dubbed into English -- with phenomenal results that rank with Disney's previous dubs for Miyazaki's films. The cast is quite good, although Daveigh Chase's performance as Chihiro is a little too shrill and whiny at times (albeit excellent overall). Out of the performers who lend their vocals to the characters (including Jason Marsden in what is probably his best role yet, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, and even a cameo from PIXAR regular John Ratzenberger), it is Suzanne Pleshette who steals the show; she plays Yubaba's greedy, loud-mouthed nature, pampering maternal side to her baby, and her twin sister, Zeniba (who, by the way, is the opposite of Yubaba -- she is IDEALLY Granny!) to perfection.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it is the best Miyazaki dub, though. Practically all of them have been excellent (not counting WARRIORS OF THE WIND, which I haven't seen), and I am therefore reluctant to compare the Disney/Ghibli English tracks to one another as a result. But SPIRITED AWAY's dub, although a bit too overrated IMO, is absolutely well done, and I commend everyone involved.<br/><br/>SPIRITED AWAY received a modestly successful limited theatrical release in America, but it made many of the Top 10 Best Films of 2002 lists and even earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Animated Feature of 2002. Indeed, it is almost an understatement to say that if it were not for it's success in America, Disney probably would not have decided to go ahead and release a good remainder of Miyazaki's first-class, imaginative output."

","This movie is a very entertaining movie. From the beginning I didn't wanted to watch it but my friend forced me to come and watch this movie on DVD. I thought that I would only watch it for 5 minutes but the story was so interesting that I watched the whole movie completely. When Chihiro and her parents were on their way to move to their new house, Chihiro's dad thought that he could take a shortcut but the shortcut led them to a strange place, a world of witches and monsters but a great paradise place. From the beginning the place had no people but there were loads of rich food that made Chihiro's parents eat them. Later they turned into pigs and Chihiro didn't because she never ate her dish but she gets help of a boy (Haku)who promises that he will save her parents. Í even like Dragonball Z and what made me so happy that Haku was with. He have special powers like the characters in Dragonball Z have.<br/><br/>If you want to watch an animated movie, watch this, that got so many Oscars.

I thought this was a wonderful film that was different and well put together. The adventure that this girl goes on, was the farthest thing from normal, and all though childish at times, it made me want to be a kid again.

","This film is most definitely worth watching. <br/><br/>It starts with Chihiro traveling to her new house. Her dad loses his way and they end up in an abandoned theme park, which is actually the spirit world. Her parents are turned into pigs and Chihiro has to get work at the nearby bathhouse to survive, and later save her parents from becoming bacon. She makes a lot of friends on the way, as well as a few enemies here and there.<br/><br/>[WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW] all the way until it says ""no more"" - badly paraphrased.<br/><br/>After you watch the US version, make it a point to watch the original Japanese version. Let me tell you now that some of the dialogue is different (and in a lot of places, better). I don't understand why Disney wanted to add Chihiro saying, ""Haku...he's a dragon?"" It spoils the effect later.<br/><br/>Also, Disney added some dialogue when the two of them are walking through the garden. Silence between them both is very much more effective than unwanted lines. <br/><br/>And why on earth did Disney make Chihiro say, ""I'm going to look for Haku"" instead of, ""I'm going to see Kamaji""? Because in the US version, all she does is go on the balcony to their room. It doesn't make sense, especially since she cares a lot about Haku.<br/><br/>Plus, the voice of Haku (in the Japanese version) is a lot more bearable to listen to than Jason Marsden (US version). <br/><br/>However, the US version is good in some ways, especially when Chihiro says, ""I knew you were good!"" when she and Haku are free falling in the sky (towards the end). And Daveigh Chase is great as Chihiro, as well as the voice of Yubaba, Lin and Kamaji.<br/><br/>So, I suggest you see the US version (to get the story properly in your head) and then watch the Japanese version.<br/><br/>[END HUGE SPOILERS]<br/><br/>The music is also great - get the soundtrack! The animation is wonderful with no obvious bits of CGI standing out. And you can connect to the characters very easily. <br/><br/>10/10, or more!"

This movie shows what pictures and sound can do when a master is using them to let his soul speak..."
"sho32","10","2","3","3 June 2004"," Miyazaki has done it again
","Spoilers within.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie in theaters about two years ago. It was not a mainstream release, and I'm lucky that I have a theater nearby which plays small, independent, and foreign films. After I left the theater, I was stunned at how much the film had emotionally impacted me. I knew, however, that viewing such an excellent film only once was not enough to glean all the beauty that it has to offer. So, I awaited the April 15, 2003 DVD release date with eager anticipation. I bought the DVD as soon as it came out, and I have seen Spirited Away many times now.<br/><br/>One of the aspects that impresses me the most is the mood this movie sets. I am thinking particularly of the times when Chihiro is in between the human world and the spirit world. Scenes like inside the train station, where Miyazaki shows such details as sunlight streaming through a faded stained-glass window and an aged water fountain slowly dripping water onto the floor, coupled with Joe Hisaishi's eerie and erratic piano, showed me that Miyazaki pays close attention to detail and mood.<br/><br/>I am also intrigued by the insight Spirited Away offers into Japanese culture and mythology. I love learning about Japan, since its traditional culture is so distinct from the U.S.'s. It is cool to see even little things, such as removing the shoes before entering a house. This movie is another way of learning about Japan.<br/><br/>The storyline of Spirited Away also draws me in. It is so wild and unusual that it works well. I have never seen a movie with a story similar to this. Despite the wildly original storyline, the characters are easy to understand and become attached to. They are unique and full of life; they never become dull. Chihiro demonstrates moral values through her courage, and by caring enough about her parents to risk her life for them. The scene where she finally frees her parents from Yubaba's spell is particularly indicative of this.<br/><br/>Yet another reason why I have become so attached to this movie is the soundtrack. The composer, Joe Hisaishi, has created a wonderful and brilliant score of music that perfectly complements the mood and events of the movie (as I mentioned in the first paragraph). In fact, Hisaishi's score is so excellent that is works well as stand-alone music also, which is why I have the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The first Miyazaki movie I ever saw was Princess Mononoke. That picture was a masterpiece (musical score also by Hisaishi), but I think Miyazaki has outdone himself in producing Spirited Away. This film is a beautiful work of art, and I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate the subtleties of a movie that caters to more than the lowest common denominator. 10/10."

You are immediately 'drawn' into the story and remain there until the credits. The story, the voice acting, the animation, are all the best examples I have seen in animation. Anyone familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's work knows he is a genius story teller and I feel Spirited Away is his best to date. This show is extremely entertaining for folks of all ages. If you are new to Anime this is definitely a great introduction to Asian quality and style animation. This show is perfect on all levels, I could not recommend it more."

","This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since ""Akira"" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.<br/><br/>Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the ""Stink Spirit"" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also."

","Once again, Studio Ghibli has not failed to please --winner of countless merits from New York to Tokyo, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or Spirited Away, is a visual joyride, breathtaking in its imagination, and enchanting in its story.<br/><br/>Not unlike Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz in its own ways, Spirited Away is something of a fairy-tale about a young girl called Sen who is mysteriously transported into the world of the Gods.  In fact, the translation of the original Japanese title means 'Sen and the Mysterious Dissaperance of Chihiro'.  Sen's journey is what Americans would refer to as an unconventional look at a classic fairytale, and what the Japanese refer to as a spectacular view at history and religion.  It is, indeed, both simultaneously.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie for its innovation, its humor, and the sheer brilliance and color of its art.  As an artist, I certainly appreciate the ornate animation --from pants zippers to antique vases, no detail is neglected, no scene overlooked.  The music, composed by Jo Hisaishi, is heartfelt and expressive.  If I watched it for one detail in the entire movie alone, it would still be just as entertaining.<br/><br/>Spirited Away cannot be overlooked as 'just another anime'.  It is animated poetry, history, religion, comedy and magic in an hour and twenty-five minutes.<br/><br/>Take your kids, take your parents, take your dog for God's sake!  It's an amazing film that has lived on in my heart and will continue to do so for years to come."

","This is truly the greatest hand animated creation of all time.  The attention to detail, subtle nuances and complexity of the work are staggering.

"tord-1","10","2","3","26 September 2003"," Amazing film
","Miazaki's Spirited Away is a masterpiece in every respect and is a milestone in animated film by its warmth, complexity and richness - the old Disney films feels very feeble in comparison.<br/><br/>The basic story is not much different from many other animated stories, about a seemingly normal world that proves to be enchanted, where humans, occasionally, intermix with gods and ghosts, with unexpected results.<br/><br/>Compared to Miazaki's earlier works, like My Friend Totoro, Porco Rosso and Princess Monoke, it presents an even more complex and fantastic world than any of these, and yet they are closely related. In My Friend Totoro there are a few supernatural creatures, in Porco Rosso there is a man who has been turned into a pig by a curse, in Princess Monoke the gods battle with humans, while in Spirited Away we have a multitude of gods, ghosts, a few humans, like the heroin's parents, that like Porco Rosso has been turned into pigs.<br/><br/>Complex sagas about the battle of good and evil, and that the good can become evil and vice versa.<br/><br/>Spirited away just does it to the n-th degree.<br/><br/>a 10/10, without doubt!"
"sweavo","Null","2","3","26 September 2003"," Revisited, Dubbed this time
","I promised I'd post a comparative review of the dubbed version and, I hate to say it, the subtitled one is better.  The dubbing rather than being a faithful translation and interpretation actually changes the exposition and employs the hollywood lump-hammer to drive 'subtle' points home.  I can't give an example without spoilers, but what she says when she's on the bridge and sees the squiggle in the sky loses a lot of subtlety.  It seems to reflect on US adults giving US kids less credit for intelligence than Japanese adults give their kids.<br/><br/>Also, the moment when Chihiro first weeps is completely robbed of its significance by bad voice direction allowing far too much emotion to come out too early.  What in the japanese version comes across as anxiety comes across in the dubbed version as anguish or anger.<br/><br/>Sorry, I tried to leave my ""brie"" at home!"

Beautifully animated, very funny and consistently surprising, it is -<br/><br/>along with the brilliant Belleville Rendevous - the best animated<br/><br/>feature of the year. I also really valued the fact that it comes from a<br/><br/>completely different cultural sensibility from the U.S, which<br/><br/>produces the majority of animated films we see in the U.K.<br/><br/>Everything - its plot arc, character development, visual style, pacing<br/><br/>and the characters' value system - is different, sometimes a little,<br/><br/>sometimes a lot. <br/><br/>I loved the mutliplicity of weird and wonderful characters that the<br/><br/>protagonist Chihiro encounters and the alternative universe that<br/><br/>they inhabit. Like Belleville Rendevous, there's some scenes in<br/><br/>this film that simply leave you aghast at their strangeness, beauty<br/><br/>or inventiveness. Definitely see this film at the cinema as soon as<br/><br/>you can. <br/><br/>P.S DON'T be put off by the fact that it's being distributed by the evil<br/><br/>mega-corporation Disney.

","As I'm not a fan of Japanese animation I went it to see the film with some suspicion that I might not enjoy it, but as the story started to unfold I couldn't believe I was ever thinking about not watching this film. It has to be one of the best animated films I've seen for a long time in terms of thoughtfully constructed plot and dazzling effects. <br/><br/>     It is also a welcome change from the CGI animation that came with the Toy Storys and more recently Finding Nemo, although the animation isn't as believable as those created by Pixar they are still a work of art. Being the first time I'd seen a Hayao Miyazaki film I didn't know what to expect and now intend on watching a few of his older films like Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>
     Although partly produced by Walt Disney there is no sign of the usual sentimentality that they enjoy filling with films such as Pocahontas and Treasure Planet. I really do recommend this film to anybody no matter what age you are even if you're not a big fan of Japanese animation. Some smaller touches towards the end of the film which really make it worth while watching, is the interactions between the mouse and bird!<br/><br/>     Even though 'Spirited Away' can be just seen as an enjoyable film the underlying messages about love conquering all and the dangers of greed and sloth are examined within."

"baseballfanjm","10","2","3","21 August 2003"," A journey I'll never forget
","Possible spoilers ahead.<br/><br/> When I rented ""Spirited Away"", I was unsure about all the hype I've heard about it, about it being an utter masterwork. Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" is one of my favorite movies and I didn't know how he could top it. But did he ever. I'm at a loss for words. Mastery doesn't begin to describe this. It's too bad that this is Miyazaki's, I believe, last film. Today, CGI is all the rage, and many believe that the days of traditional animation are coming to an end. But ""Spirited Away"" is a movie that could never be done with computers. Sure, it'd be crisper looking, technically ""better looking"". But CGI would ruin the subtlety, the<br/><br/>simplicity that makes it so brilliant. Don't get me wrong, CGI has rightly earned a place in the film industry. But I hate the idea of all animation being CGI.<br/><br/>
Anyway, back to the movie. ""Spirited Away"", is so remarkably beautiful is so<br/><br/>many ways. On shot that got to me in particular was when Chihiro, after being shown what has happened to her parents by her friend, Haku, is walking away.<br/><br/>After crossing a bridge, she looks back, and Haku has transformed into a<br/><br/>dragon. We can see him, but only at a distance, like how we'd see a majestic<br/><br/>eagle, framed against the sky. This shot is too simple and beautiful for words. Nothing in this is too bombastic, nothing overdone, and for two hours and takes us on an amazing journey that only a master of animation, like Miyazaki, can<br/><br/>take us on. I'll never forget watching ""Spirited Away"" and I beg anyone who has bothered to read this review to watch this movie as soon as possible. I doubt you'll forget either."

","I got Spirited Away on DVD and have watched it twice now.  I am absolutely disgusted by what the English voice actors and Disney have done to this beautiful and creative animation by coming up with their own screenplay (as if the people chosen to do the English voice acting weren't bad enough). Wile watching the Japanese version I accidentally, and fortunately, found out that there are two different subtitles: one is what Disney has come up with, and the other is the original (Miyazaki's) screenplay.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that Disney has changed about %90 of the lines that Miyazaki had come up with for the characters.  It seems that it has become a trademark for Disney to add a certain level of stupidity to anything that that they are involved with, including master story teller and animator, Hayao Miyazaki's projects.  Give yourself a big favor and watch the Japanese version with English subtitles (make sure you choose the ORIGINAL translated subtitles. My DVD player has a ""English sub. 1"" and ""English sub 2"", yours might be different). I liked Spirited Away even though it was a bit different than other Miyazaki's projects.<br/><br/>English version 5/10, Original Version 8/10"

","Spirited Away: 10/10<br/><br/>Wow, WOW. I missed Spirited Away at the cinemas, because it was before my movie craze that has developed this year. It looked interesting from the commercials I saw, although I didn't really have any clue what it was about - Yubaba's giant head was scary. I picked up the limited edition DVD box, which is beautifully designed and includes an awesome special feature DVD. I watched the movie with English dubbing, which I'm always wary of, but it was superbly done this time. On the surface, this looks like a children's story, but in execution it's for everyone. Spirited Away was one of the most enchanting experiences I've ever had, Miyazaki produced one unbelievable masterpiece, deep in Japanese culture. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I never looked away from the TV screen. Everything, EVERYTHING was so perfect. The animation was beautiful, the music was beautiful, the story was beautiful, this was PERFECTION. If there is one DVD you get this year, make it this! It's an unforgettable experience, and is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. The special feature DVD is great as mentioned, and ""The Making of..."" makes you love the movie even more, and respect Hayao Miyazaki as a brilliant man and director."

The movie is digestible for the kids (mines are 8), it is funny sometimes, but has much more complex meaning than other ones, born from the Western civilization. It is full of mystery, excitement, color. The characters have real nature, they all have both good and bad characteristics, so you can never predict what happens next. This makes the film even more fascinating, you see the ""cruel"" witch being an adoring mom, or appreciating great performance. The actions are not overexplained, you have the room to build your own interpretation.<br/><br/>The Eastern philosophy and culture would be enough to attract us, but it has more than that. There is a deep humanism in it, and endless, free fantasy. I felt sorry that it had ended, though it lasts more than 2 hours.<br/><br/>I will surely go to see it again. Top rating."

"mppullar","10","2","3","31 January 2003"," Indisputably brilliant
","A film like ""Spirited Away"" is an incredibly rare gem. While works of absolute genius do appear most years (and 2001-2002 has certainly seen a lot of these movies reach our screens), they are so often the sort of films that can only be recommended to hard-core film buffs, generally because they would be dismissed as ""strange"". Films which are easy to watch, entertaining, and yet are absolute and indisputable works of artistic genius are few and far between.<br/><br/>All this said, ""Spirited Away"" meets all of these requirements. With some of the most beautiful animation you will ever see, clever dialogue, brilliant characters and some fantastic social commentary, it works at so many levels and can, and should, be appreciated by everyone. Unfortunately, the majority of animations which come to western cinemas are only able to be truly enjoyed by school-age children, and a lot of children beyond a certain age are reluctant to either watch or enjoy them at risk of being ""childish"". As a result, truly original animations which appeal to an older demographic are rare - Richard Linklater did a brilliant job with ""Waking Life"", but unfortunately that could only really appeal to a small group of adults because of the high-brow intellectualism of the ideas explored in it. Films like ""Toy Story"" and (breaking the tradition of all sequels being pathetic) ""Toy Story 2"" are usually the only exceptions, managing to appeal to adults with a more sophisticated style of humour.<br/><br/>BUT ""Spirited Away"" is, despite being technically a ""children's"" film, the sort of movie that almost no-one is too old or too young to enjoy. Very few movies like this exist, even though a lot of films are marketed as being ""all-ages"" films. The sheer imagination that has gone into making this film cannot fail to bewitch anyone who sees it, and it has so much which can appeal to older viewers, particularly the many satirical and poignant comments it makes about contemporary capitalist Japan (such as the faceless people on the train, lifeless, barely there). This film will probably never truly make sense, which is the beauty of it. There are no cop-outs - it truly embraces the surreal and the imaginative, without ever becoming conventional or at all unoriginal.<br/><br/>I saw this film in the original Japanese version, and would suggest that people watch it in this version if they can. But really it should just be seen in whatever version is available, doing whatever it takes to see it. No really - it's worth it."

","Here's an easy one: If you come across a shop with a sumptuous spread of food and the proprietor is not in sight, do you: (a.) Start eating the food with the intent of settling later, or (b.) abstain from eating--regardless of the temptation--because it was wrong. In the film, two out of three respondents answered (a.) and were transformed into what they behaved as: pigs. Such starts out Hayao Miyazaki's finest work to date, ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi."" (""Spirited Away"" in US theaters) This is the finest animated film I have ever seen and is near the top of my list of films of any genre.<br/><br/>The main character of the story, a 10-year old girl named Chihiro Ogino, is a normal child thrust by her parents into a strange world and is immediately left to fend for herself--as she was the one out of three who chose the correct course of action by not eating the food. Throughout the remainder of this beautiful film, she is faced with numerous choices--each crafted by Miyazaki to emphasize the importance of living a virtuous life. While the specific cases use things from Japanese folklore, traditions, and culture (and Miyazaki's incredible imagination), the fundamental virtues apply Universally to all.<br/><br/>One admonition: the English-dubbed version, though touted as being true to the original, actually changes the nature of the film slightly.<br/><br/>The original Japanese language release, subtitled if necessary, is a truer rendition of Miyazaki's imagination.<br/><br/>On a scale of ten, I'd give this one an 11."

","Alice in Wonderland, eat your heart out, there's a new fantasy that surpasses you. Spirited Away is one great film with superb animation and characters you actually care about.<br/><br/>Chihiro is voiced by Daveigh Chase, aka Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. She and her family are moving and are almost at their new house when a wrong turn leads them into a tunnel. It begins like a Scooby-Doo episode. Mysterious characters running around an abandoned theme park. But the rest of the movie unfolds like no other. A feast is layed out, and Chihiro's parents start pigging out and-of course-turn into pigs. Soon other characters come out and Chihiro flees for her life. Various, and odd, events ensue.<br/><br/>I have got to say-if there was ever a movie for everyone in the family to enjoy, this is the one! Interesting characters, interesting events, and interesting visuals encourage a very interesting moviegoing experience. We have got to hand it to Miyazaki (the director), he's created another world that will stick with us for the rest of our sane lives.<br/><br/>I'm not into animÃ¨ at all, but the animation was-wow! It looked like two different settings-the very realistic background and the obvious characters. The emotions on the humans were very real (or as real as this movie could be). All of the various ""others"" from the opposite world were life-like and seemed real. However, there was one thing that I didn't fully understand-what was the purpose of No-Face? He could have been just in there for linking purposes, but it doesn't really bother me one iota.<br/><br/>A lot of times, my heart was a'going th-thump. There were many tense moments, many funny moments, and many, many powerful, dramatic moments. You smile when Chihiro is happy; you're sad when she is sad. There are some movies that can make you do that, but not many. A very creepy moviegoing experience.<br/><br/>The 124 minute runtime seemed to run by quick. It felt like awhile for the movie, but you hardly noticed it. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. When I walked out, I heard some other kid say, ""It was OK, I guess."" Spirited Away is not really a little kid's movie. They'll be too scared and will not be able to fully grasp the potential of the film. They also seemed upset because it was ""so long"". Don't go to many more movies, kiddos. This'll seem like a commercial.<br/><br/>Miyazaki, if I could, I would shake your hand. You've created a masterpiece, plain and simple.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for scary moments and a surprising amount of blood."

There are really only two groups of people that I would recommend this movie to: ANYONE and EVERYONE.  If you are in possession of both an auditory and a visual system, then SEE THIS MOVIE!

"HaveSocks","10","2","3","15 October 2002"," Another excellent movie from Miyazaki.
","This film is not as overtly violent as was Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) but violence does not make a movie worthwhile usually.  Instead the story and animation are both superb.  This is very reminiscent of the early 90's Disney works (Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin).  But unlike Disney the characters don't break into song every other minute!  The most impressive aspect of this movie was that even though the movie may be freightening to young children it also conveys a message (yes a moral) to the audience on two different levels...for children it tells them to be brave in the face of adversity and for adults it tells them to be aware of your child's feelings about any changes that they or the family might be going through.  Miyazaki yet again has produced another masterpiece that the American public will not be aware of and those who might be aware of it will generally be biased because it is an animated film."

Although not my favorite Miyazaki film (this ranks slightly behind Tonari no Totoro), it's certainly leagues beyond any other animated film in recent years.<br/><br/>I decided to wait until I had seen the English language version (I've gone to it twice already since it opened on the 11th, 3 days ago) to comment on it here on the IMDb so I could take a look at the version most people would likely see.  I am a big fan of anime but I am not one of those obsessive sub-only purists, if it's dubbed well then I can enjoy it just as much as the original.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the English language version even more than the Japanese and Cantonese versions I saw by a good bit.  The voices all seemed very appropriate and I enjoyed the few added lines that were included.  I was a little bummed about how when Haku says his full name they did not leave it in Japanese, I think it would have been better with saying how it sounded so royal, etc. but that was my only nitpick.  Disney did a wonderful job in the English language production, now only if they would market it some (I've not even seen a tv spot here and the ad in the newspaper was very small) and put it in more theatres they may find they have a fairly successful film on their hands to go along with its status of critical darling."

","Aren't we all tired of cuddly singing animals and happily-ever-after plots? Well, according to box office numbers, the American movie audience is not. But man, I am.  It is so refreshing to be amused and surprised while watching a movie.  Although this movie is marketed as a children's fantasy fairy tale. often compared to Alice In Wonderland, I think this movie is much more than that.<br/><br/>I can compare a standard Disney animated movie to a Happy Meal.  Hey, I have nothing against Happy Meals.  They're cute, they're tasty, you know what to expect, and there's always a neat toy inside.  It's a proven success.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is the `Iron Chef' of animated movies.  You might not know what the heck you are about to eat, and some of the dishes might violently disagree with you. but you may come across something that will blow your socks off.<br/><br/>Expand your palette.

","Spirited Away 2001/2002 (Review) By Stephen Palke<br/><br/>Director: Hayo Miazaki<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>A little girl named Chiriro, who has recently moved. She is being driven to her new school by her two parents. Her Dad can't find her new school and takes a short cut through the woods. They run into this tunnel. Chiriro's parents stop and decide to take a look what is on the other end of that tunnel. They make it to the other end and Dad thinks it's a shut down amusement park. Chiriro is scared and wants to go. The parents want to continue to look around. Dad smells good food and tries to find where this food is. They find it at a store. The parents gulf down the food. Chiriro looks around and sees this small bridge which leads to a huge Japanese style castle. A boy named Master Haku tells her to get out before it hits dark. Chiriro runs and looks for her parents. Her parents are still eating the food, but Chiriro has found that they turned into pigs. Now Chiriro must get a job at a bathhouse for gods and spirits get her parents turned back into humans. However she gets into many other adventures along the way.<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>10/10 The Japanese always make excellent films like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Akira, and The Samurai trilogy. This is another excellent film. Japan is known for it's animated films. Now when Spirited Away hits wide release in the U.S, Japan will be known for this animated film, Spirited Away. This film is much better than any Disney film, which is saying a lot when you look at Disney's history. Ironically Disney has bought the U.S/European/Australian rights to this film, go figure.<br/><br/>
I must say how very imaginative this film is and how colorful it is. The animation is brilliant as is the story and characters. You care you the lead character: Chiriro, which is hard to do in most other films. This will be a big film in the over the world"
"jhjenkins","10","2","3","9 October 2002"," Beautiful and lyrical
","This is a truly beautiful movie, both in terms of the story it tells and in terms of the visual feast that awaits.  Like all of Hayao Miyazaki's work, the images on the screen in and of themselves are worth the price of admission; and like all of Miyazaki's work, the characters who inhabit his world and the lives they lead are fascinating.<br/><br/>There are some disturbing moments which might make the film inappropriate for small children, and some older kids may find the film too ""weird"" (meaning too unlike mainstream fare) to enjoy; but this tale of how a sullen girl finds power within herself to face the world is worth seeking out and watching."
"ArdenD","10","2","3","7 October 2002"," The movie has been called the 'Alice In Wonderland' of anime... and it's true!
","When I saw that this gem of director Hayao Miyazaki was being released here, I was itching for the day I could see it.<br/><br/>I am a lover of beautiful animation, story telling and I have to admit both in this movie were great.<br/><br/>In the movie, Chihiro is the beautiful portrayal of the 10 year old girl, whose reluctance to moving to a new home has her worried... What is she to do in this foreign place, all her friends gone. The movie starts out with her parents taking a hilarious shortcut to their new home, and from there the fun begins.<br/><br/>The hijinks that await Chihiro are both moving and hilarious. This film is rooted in Japanese mythology, and at times you can be awed by how Miyazaki portrays it. Often you will wonder if he is showing you reality, or just how Chihiro envisions it.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you see the maturing of Chihiro, and it was a flawless depiction of how a 10 year old girl learns to adapt to her reality, wherever it might be.<br/><br/>I definitely thought the movie was worth my admission fee, and more.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

","To me, ""Spirited Away"" is about the ability of children to see the truth because their vision is not clouded by greed and prejudice and how adults ignore the observations of children at their peril. It is also about the redemptive power of hard work and how true satisfaction and happiness come from striving to do our best in difficult circumstances rather than from being fed and entertained. And it is about being true to oneself in the face of temptation and fear.<br/><br/>""Spirited Away"" is a beautiful, inspiring movie with a pure heart. It is full of imagination, humor, and wonderful animation. I recommend it to everyone."
"jmo154","10","2","3","6 October 2002"," A Masterpiece
","I just saw this movie in a theatre yesterday and I still cannot stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>The story is in the vein of Through the Looking Glass, but I honestly feel that movies like Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland only wish they could have the depth of this film.  The world presented and the characters included have so much perspective to them that I could sit down and analyze for hours.<br/><br/>The movie is a true fairy tale.  Love conquers all, hard work is rewarded, etc.  However, where it is a fairy tale is that Miyazaki is not afraid to be dark.  Many times in this movie the viewer is filled with the same dispair that we see in Chihiro.  The scene near the beginning where the spirit world opens up around her is both breathtaking and absolutely chilling.<br/><br/>
To sum it up, very few movies I have ever seen have completely whisked me away to a different world and I felt truly there.  A completely different reality.  Any movie that could have a label of fantasy attached them attempts this, but rarely do you completely feel enveloped in this foreign world. In the past year, two films have done that better than any other films I have ever seen, Lord of the Rings and Spirited Away."
"d4v3cs","10","2","3","7 October 2002"," most horror movie I ever watch.....or not
","this movie scares me to bits... Damn, it reminds me of my childhood nightmares and dark imagination everytime I went to an amusement park, that after the sun sets, the place would turn into a dark dimension with horrible and hideous creatures. Also a certain tunnel that leads to another horrible places full with disfigured creatures, ghouls and goblins. This movie brought it EXACTLY like how it was in back then. Geez... now I can't even eat much anymore...buekkhhhh<br/><br/>apart from that...uh. I can't give any praise. Instead I'll just say what I feel, this is the most mixed emotion movie I ever watched...also the most weird. It seems like the movie ""babe"" went wrong at first. As the movie progress, I started to see the true innovative art behind it. This is the first movie ever where I'm unable whatsoever to guess what happens next. I watched it straight after mononoke, I can't help but to wonder why there's always blobish/tentacles thing in his movies.<br/><br/>
Now the strange thing is how I relate so much to the mask man and Migihayami Kohakunushi, barely unexplainable.<br/><br/>At last, as always, it's the soundtrack, the spirit companion of a movie, the single tool that let its images linger in your mind and memory."

","On a purely plot-oriented basis, Spirited Away could go down as a classic fable that charmed and touched millions of people world wide. That's on a PURELY PLOT-oriented basis. In actuality, Spirited away is so much more that it's almost indescribable. Trying to encapsulate in words what this movie is would be impossible for any reviewer, but many, including myself, will try.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a visual landmark, not only in animation, but in the entire realm of story-telling. Every scene is perfectly crafted. The imagination that oozes out of every cell of this hand drawn movie is mind boggling. Hayao Miyazaki, the creator of Spirited Away, is considered one of the greatest animators of all time and with good reason. His movies have charmed viewers in Japan and American anime fans, like myself, for years. Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke rank as the #1 and #3 grossing movies in Japan's history. Both were made by Miyazaki.<br/><br/>However, while Mononoke was a nature oriented war epic, Spirited Away is like a child's fairy tale. It tells the story of a young girl named Chihiro who must escape from a fantasy world after her parents and her get lost in an abandoned Amusement park...to say more would ruin the film. Just know that every scene, plot twist and character from that point forward is perfectly crafted. The uniqueness and beauty of EVERYTHING you will see is unparalleled in modern film making...and it is all held up by beautiful hand animation and a marvelously touching story that does not draw lines between good and evil, but shows you every character as he/she is and allows you to be the judge.<br/><br/>Believe me when I say that the best decision you could make this year regarding movies would be to see Spirited Away. Your eyes, ears, and heart will thank you."

This movie was beautiful and amazingly done. The dubbing has been some of the best I've seen in his films, and the voices match the characters perfectly. Yet again, Miyazki takes us into a magical world where spirits rule and man is regarded as basically a common animal.

"johnnysugar","10","2","3","25 September 2002"," Pure Joy
","I've been a fan of anime for years.  Unlike many anime watchers, my first exposure wasn't to ""Akira"" or ""Macross.""  It was to a movie called ""Warriors of the Wind"", which I learned years later was actually a hack-job version of the poetic ""Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind"" by Hayao Miyazaki, a man compared often to Akira Kurosawa, and who many call the most gifted anime director of all time.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's film ""Princess Mononoke"", which was imported to the US and released by Disney in an English dub, was an ecological fantasy where humans and ancient gods dueled for the fate of nature.  It was a dark and dramatic epic of culture and tradition.  In comparison, Miyazaki's latest release, ""Spirited Away"", is unadulterated joy and innocence, a two-and-a-half hour fable of courage and perseverance.<br/><br/>Young Chihiro is moving to the country with her parents.  On the way to their new home, her parents come upon a seemingly abandoned theme park and, despite the protests of their daughter, begin to gorge themselves on food they find.  When night falls, the theme park transforms into a land of shades and phantoms, and Chihiro's parents have been transformed into pigs. Chihiro receives aid from a strange young man named Haku, who tells her that to stay in the spirit world and rescue her family, she must get a job from the witch Yubaba, who cannot refuse her request.  During her stay in this strange world, Chihiro undergoes many trials that put her courage and her love for others to the test.<br/><br/>The movie itself plays like ""Alice in Wonderland"" filtered through Japanese folklore.  I admit, I didn't understand many of the concepts of the movie because of its reliance on such things, and while at first the movie seems not to have a coherent plot, keep in mind that anime in general has never fully subscribed to the linear plots of American cinema.<br/><br/>
The colors and designs of the movie are fantastic, and there is no shortage of unusual beings.  Tiny soot monsters who work for an eight-armed man, a bulbous Radish Spirit, and a majestic river dragon are a few of the inhabitants.  The most poignant of the movie's characters may be No-Face, a lonely spirit that consumes all he can.  The tone of the movie is generally light, with moments of drama and darkness when appropriate, but always filled with a resonant innocence and wonder.<br/><br/>The voice acting, while not as star-studded as that of ""Mononoke"", is quite good, with seasoned actors like Suzanne Pleshette (Yubaba) and the ever-popular and multi-talented Tara Strong providing solid dub skills. Daveigh Chase, wonderful as Lilo in Disney's ""Lilo and Stitch"", is Chihiro, and while some of her readings sound a bit shrill, she is a very believable and realistic voice for the plucky heroine.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, the movie may lack the drama and desperation of many anime, but instead of offering this, the movie is content to transport you to another world filled with joy and mystery.  Few movies display as much pleasure as this one in displaying moments of awe and laughter. Never mind that the animation itself is beautiful and intricate as only a master could create.  If you are lucky enough to be in a city where this movie is showing, by all means, see it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"superjxiv","10","2","3","25 September 2002"," See it. Just go. 'Nuff said.
","If there's a reason Japanese animation is so popular in our American culture, I'd guess its something with the conventions. Anime doesn't have the same basic rules American animation has, and therefore it can show us things we've never dream of. For example: A witch with a head the size of a grocery cart that runs a day spa for demons and spirits.<br/><br/>
Trying to describe the rest of Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is like trying to describe a dream you can barely remember. There are key images you can't forget, specific emotions that felt too real, and for the life of you, you can never accurately explain how they all connected.<br/><br/>
Now since this is an animated film from Japan, I feel I need to clarify one very specific thing. I am not a big fan of anime. There is only one anime movie on my shelf of movies, and its ""Princess Mononoke."" It's not a coincidence that this film was also directed by Miyazaki. He is the single best director of animated movies because his characters have depth, his stories tell about the most basic human emotions, and he draws or redraws a majority of the frames himself. <br/><br/>""Spirited"" has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and I can't think of a simpler way of explaining it. Chihiro, a wiry 10-year-old girl, is our Alice. The movie opens with her and her parents moving to a new town. A wrong turn brings them to an abandoned theme park. But when the sun sets, the exit disappears, and Chihiro finds her parents under a curse. She is alone in a world full of spirits, demons and really big headed old women.<br/><br/>Chihiro's quest is not an easy one. She must save herself, she must save her parents, and she must find a way home. These quests are side-tracked as she meets employees and guests at the day spa. There's the boiler room operator, a man with six arms whose mood lightens when Chihiro visits. There's a river spirit that's so polluting no one can stand the smell of him, Chihiro stops at nothing to help him. She befriends the misunderstood No Face, a demon that won't stop eating anything, including the not-so-lucky day spa staff.<br/><br/>
What I find most amazing about the animation is how little computers were used throughout the production. There are a few backgrounds that are sparsely rendered, but they look more like moving oil paintings and are used as a contrast. All the onscreen action, all the character's faces and emotions, all the minute details of this Wonderland have been perfectly realized by the world's best animators and the great Miyazaki.<br/><br/>
Go see this movie. It is a feast of sensational visuals; it is an amazing story of meager people doing epic things, and as long as you're outside, go rent ""Princess Mononoke."" Films such as these can not disappoint."
"yoo_yoo_yoo","10","2","3","24 September 2002"," Great Manga
","I have seen Mononoke, an excellent film, but overall I was not that entertained by it.  While there was a large amount of action, I felt that some areas tended to drag, the animation was of high quality, but not that imaginative.  Plus I saw the dubbed version and Claire Danes gets on my nerves.  Overall a 7-8 range movie, good, not great, a video rental but not a DVD purchase.<br/><br/>Spirited Away took my breath away.  While less violent than the Princess, it is far more entertaining.  Mind you, I enjoy violence in Japanese Animation which makes my approval of this movie all the more suprising.  Ninja Scrolls, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, all violent and excellent animation features.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is completely different.  Manga targeted towards a younger audience but still highly entertaining to adults.  Similar to the Simpson effect.  There were so many scenes that amazed me which were all sewn together in an excellent storyline.  A few examples, the dragon battling with paper dolls, the train on the water, Haku moving about at blinding speeds, the dust balls, the tiny crow and the rabbit renacting the freeing<br/><br/>of Haku.  AWESOME.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this in the theatre.  It is truly an event to behold. Particularly since Hollywood these days seems incapable of coming up with anything fresh or new.<br/><br/>This movie is so completely different than any kind of American film its refreshing.<br/><br/>Run, don't walk to a theatre near you."

I'm a big fan of Miyazaki but have only seen Castle of Cagliostro, Princess Mononoke and now this. Where Princess Mononoke was high on action and environmental issues, Spirited Away is high on emotion and issues of love.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, you are greeted with Miyazaki's astonishing art work and animation.  The bright colors and subtleness bring peace to your eyes. The story keeps you glued to your seat as it takes you to incredible places and introduces you to amazing characters.<br/><br/>Miyazaki puts a 10yr old girl as it's protaganist. Her innocence, wits, and amazing courage make for a great heroin in this amazing adventure.  A la Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>If anything, this movie made me feel young again.  As more and more incredible things unraveled before my eyes, I just sat there wide-eyed and full of wonder.<br/><br/>The musical score by the legendary Jo Hisaishi (who composed scores for most if not all Miyazaki movies) is as usual astonishing.  His music combined with Miyazaki's artwork, makes scenes more breathtaking, suspensful and emotional.<br/><br/>Catch this movie if you can find it.  You'll be taken on an adventure you will never forget."
"HPeep","10","2","3","21 September 2002"," Excellent. Miyazaki's best.
","Starting with the bad news (which there is hardly any of). The movie is 125 minutes long with credits but you will wish it were 187 minutes long. The film has one very noticeable (but fairly standard) continuity error.<br/><br/>   The good news, it is one of the best films you will ever see. It ties with Fellowship of the Ring as #1 movie of 2001. Unforgettable story and visuals will make you want to see it again and again.<br/><br/>   The story involves a girl who is accidentally in the spirit world when her parents (who later become pigs) take a wrong turn on their way moving to suburbia. Haku helps her through the maze of gods and spirits but he may be working for the Yu-Baaba (which literally in Japanese means Bath Crone). But enough story. Go see for yourself why this is such a good movie. When I saw this film I saw the English dubbed version. Like Mononoke it was a very good dub.<br/><br/>
Rated PG for frightening and violent images. Suggested for ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>If anyone from Disney reads this please make Spirited Away a huge DVD with a DTS-ES track and loads of features from the Japanese DVD."

","This was a really fun film to watch.  Miyazaki's imagination depicts a whole other world through the eyes of young Chihiro.  The colors  radiate life especially the garden scene which looked awesome on a digital projector. The story's so straightforward but it's the journey of telling it that fascinates and draws you in from beginning to end.  I remember talking to friends after seeing it and we all had interesting points.  I felt the film focuses on Chihiro's innocence as compared with the other characters she encounters, but her child like views are so carefree (and naive at times) and her youthful exuberance  really makes it endearing.  Another friend said it was a coming of age and how Chihiro herself progresses throughout the film.  I mean, if you can find so much insight in a film, you know you have a great film.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is not too dark and there are plenty of laughs throughout.  A definite buy on my DVD list."

I think maybe every child will imagine that he can have a Bailong friend, he is usually about the same size as himself, and he can play with himself, but when he is in danger, he will transform into a strong Bailong and stand up Out. Yes, that is not surprising. But not every child would have imagined that he was in despair, isolated and helpless, full of strangers with indifferent expressions and deliberate intentions. Of course, it is impossible for them to really encounter such a thing.<br/><br/>Chihiro took the train that went back and forth without returning, just like we had the youth that went back and forth, and began her last trip.
That is no longer a passive decision, but a choice made by her independent free will. Now she no longer listens to the instructions of others, she only listens to her inner voice. In fact, the surroundings are still so strange, and all the passengers are all vaguely faced and do not know what to do, and the trip is still uncertain, and there is no more equipment to face the danger on Chihiro 's body. Only one can rely on oneself. However, at that moment, Chihiro had no panic and hesitation. She looked calm and determined. She knew exactly what she wanted and what she was doing. She didn't doubt it. In her eyes, she was strikingly beautiful: the waves of the water wave flashed, the fallen trees stretched green, and the brilliant glow reflected the distant ground ..."

","In Spirited Away, the cute ten-year-old girl, Chihiro, strayed into the ghost world with her parents, whose parents turned into big pigs because of gluttony. In order to save the whole family, Chihiro had to work for the mother-in-law Tang who was in charge of the baths in the spirit realm, and at the same time gave up her name-which also meant giving up on herself. In fact, most of the people working in this bath are lost children, giving up self, only seeing money in their eyes, or the desire for life represented by money.<br/><br/>The happy ending of the cartoon is not unexpected, and the relationship between Chihiro and Bailong is also reasonable. But I don't think it's a movie about emotions, not even Chihiro's extraordinary courage. What I see is a return from beginning to end, a return to innocence, a return to childlike innocence.<br/><br/>I always feel that the bath has a special meaning in this story. The bath was originally a place where the dust was cleansed to purify the soul. The huge river god was moved by Chihiro 's innocence in the bath. He washed away the pollution before giving her the god of river; His true colors. And the reason why Chihiro can not be moved by desire from beginning to end is because she can maintain the precious innocence from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Innocence is valuable because it is not stubborn, or persistent, changed by the external environment. The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful, and whether they should feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart."

"Koma-Mo","10","1","1","17 September 2019"," Easily one of Studio Ghibli's best work of all time.
","With such a huge filmography, it is difficult to consider which one is the best out of everything that Studio Ghibli has released. Just like with Disney, people will have a different, but understandable preference toward why they consider that film to be the best. One thing that people can agree on is that this film is one of the best out of everything that Studio Ghibli has made throughout the years.<br/><br/>Mixing in culture with fantasy, I loved how you become totally engrossed in this world and will be in total wonderment as you go on this journey with Chihiro. Sprinkling in humor and emotional moments throughout the film, this really helped the flow of the film and making it very fun to watch and embracing everything that happens. Never looking down on the audience, this film doesn't spell out everything for you, allowing us to figure things out and to find the answers on our own. Even just by watching the film again, you are able to catch certain details that you may have missed while watching it for the first time. The biggest strength of this film are the characters. For example, you are able to embark on this journey with Chihiro and you see her growth as a character, becoming more mature as the story progresses. Even with some of the sub-characters, you see them grow as well, making this journey very worthwhile, along with making this film very rewatchable.<br/><br/>This film is enriched with very colorful characters who are very memorable and have such interesting personalities to them that has them stand out with every scene they are in. From Yubaba, even with some of the gods that enter the bathhouse, I loved every single character that had appeared and they all helped add life to the whole movie. Surprisingly enough, the voice work here does help as well. I'm judging on the Japanese version here, so bare with me. Many of the actors chosen are not professional and there isn't a single weak point in the acting. Usually, Ghibli films will hire actors who are sometimes really good, but for most of the time are subpar passable or terrible. This is not the case as everyone was wellcasted and I loved everyone's performance.<br/><br/>Mixing such beautiful art with Hisaishi Jo's music helps add more personality to the overall film. I have to say that this may be the most beautiful film from Studio Ghibli. The mix of colors and from the look of the bathhouse to the scenery, the film has such a great look that makes it very beautiful to look at. There are plenty of memorable moments here that can be a painting of itself and mixing all of these great elements together really helps make this film stand out from the other Ghibli films and is still worth watching up till this day."

","One of its writer's better movies if just for the onslaught of bizarre and vivid images that are thrown upon us. It really is quite spectacular and even terrifying at times.<br/><br/>Although Chihiro is not a great character, instantly going from brat to scared little girl never to return in a matter of seconds, you really have a powerful sense of being trapped in a strange and exotic land that only grudgingly has a place for you.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly engaging as we try to get home and struggle with a few episodes at the bathhouse.<br/><br/>Worth a couple of viewings as we explore some interesting ideas on the nature of identity and culture being lost in industrial modernity, we get an ethnically rich and frequently grotesque hybrid of cultural flavour and the monstrosity of big business with only a modicum of the sanctimoniousness that is Hayao's signature.<br/><br/>Sweet, funny and again with a score that will be your new guilty pleasure, this may not be Ghibli's (or even Hayao's) best movie, but it's place in those top 100 lists is more of less earned even if as usual it is as a feat of spectacle and imagination, not so much of story telling.<br/><br/>On that note we are one climax away from a great movie. The thing just...stops. But it's the journey not the destination. I feel this could have made a very dignified movie for all ages but seems to have been intentionally ""kidified"".

"xavierwittmann","10","1","1","26 October 2017"," Every parent should watch this movie for the sake of their children
","This is by far one of my favorite movies of all times.<br/><br/>First of all, the drawing is absolutely superb and the watcher is totally immersed in this magical world.<br/><br/>Then, what makes me love this movie above all is not only that the message conveyed is pretty strong, but that actually many people see, FEEL, the message differently. That is the greatest strength of the movie that, by sending the watcher back in his own childhood, succeeds in making emotions arise that will be different for each person, depending on each one life.<br/><br/>I don't pretend having understood the movie better than anyone else but here is how I felt it.<br/><br/>Chihiro indeed enters somewhere as a children, and, being forced to face a number of issues alone, by taking her own responsibilities without the presence of her parents, succeeds in leaving it.<br/><br/>Many people see in the movie the passage from childhood to adult, passage that is done when a children has to take decisions in certain circumstances when there isn't really someone present to take him/her by the hand. But, that is not how I see it, at least not totally. I believe that in fact this movie wants to convey this message, but equally another one.<br/><br/>The entire troubles, throughout the ENTIRE movie, are exclusively the outcome of human natural thirst for greed and power. There isn't a single trouble in the movie that is not related to such behavior.<br/><br/>The only person that succeeds in overcoming each of those issues is Chihiro. All other ones have been trapped.<br/><br/>And that is the subtlety of the movie: What did Miyazaki intended to tell? Simply being critic toward our own nature? I don't believe so.<br/><br/>This movie opened my eyes as a father: why did Chihiro succeed when others failed? Because she faced each issue while being totally immune to power and money, making very simple choices, without fear, simply following what her pure children's hearth commands her to do.<br/><br/>And that is an eye-opener: what if as a parent, finally, we don't have more to learn from our children than they have to learn from us? What if finally, we should try to be more like them rather than trying to make them look like us, corrupted adults? From the day I watched the movie, I'm trying to leave my kids be, take their own decision, and helping them to make their decisions following their hearth rather than my 'hard-given' advises."

","To me, I know exactly why Miyazaki is considered to be the Master of (Japanese) Cinema because he gave birth to the best Japanese animated pictures that inspired many people around the world. I love the guy in a way you love film. Spirited Away is the most critically acclaimed film ever and audience interested in seeing this film.<br/><br/>I love the way how the story continues from start to finish and it just shows very entertaining characters that have weird personalities, etc. Every time I always watch a person's review on this film and says he or she can't get over the films weirdness throughout. It is not because they think the film is very bad and if they did say that, it will make us very angry in a way that I hate opinions that do not have any faith and have agreements to other's opinions.<br/><br/>I would say that this film shows weirdness is because that weirdness is sort of a symbolism that shows us what Japanese culture is like to us. That weirdness is representational, I believe in what cinema shows us, it is not a piece of laziness, it is the weirdness that represents what they do and why they sort of look like that. To me, the weirdness in cinema is the symbolism on what the film shows us and that is what I love about films that can be hard to follow and believe e guys, I do have a faithful opinion on the true magic of film. The weirdness is representational, symbolises what the film shows us and why and gives us more learning about influences and inspiration.<br/><br/>I understand 100% pure how it goes and it is just so inspiring to watch and Miyazaki shows the weirdness that is representational and symbolises culture. The animation looks so beautiful at its time, released almost the same time where Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and the first instalment of Harry Potter, tons of classic huts out in 2001. It suits for that era. Great soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. I also love most things about cinema on what it tells us or shows at the very same time. It is really faithful on what film is like and should be like to us. Exactly what we need, foreign films. I watch billions of American films and makes me bored so I quit and move onto something, I watch less of 41% of American films but over 41% of British and foreign cinema. Exactly what we should see in order to the get the right inspiration."
"dreamwork-32530","9","1","1","14 August 2017"," good movie
","Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. <br/><br/>What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes."

The story twists and turns, never once losing viewers yet still seems to make the fantastical happen. The characters are well thought out and all lend to the amazing plot. There are not a lot of films out there that can pack so much in in such a short time, however Studio Ghibli manage it nonetheless. One of my favourite titles out there."

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","1","26 June 2017"," Dorothy , Pinocchio, Alice and finally... Chihiro!
","""Spirited Away"" ventures in the realm of poetic fantasy through the life-changing journey of Chihiro, a ten-year old girl imprisoned in a world of spirits after her parents have been turned into pigs.<br/><br/>This premise suggests a mixture of two universal stories immortalized (but not created) by Disney: ""Pinocchio"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"". The parents become pigs after they surrendered to gluttony in an unattended restaurant full of appetizing meals; the father mentions his credit card before swallowing a large spoonful of noodles like a pig, literally. Both adults are punished like the kids in Dream Island who made jackasses of themselves. Chihiro was spared because she felt something was wrong and only wanted (a bit cowardly) to get back to the car.<br/><br/>There's a sort of 'immanent justice' governing this seemingly hostile universe, any action has either a cost or a reward, established by the wizard-like imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. Take the villainous Yubaba, a big-headed 'witch' who's also the tenant of a traditional bathhouse and the one who cursed Chihiro's parents, despite her evil ordeals, she's not as one-dimensional as the Coachman, she's a manager who believes in good work and good manners. She's as capable as complimenting and rewarding as she is in the 'punishing' department. It all comes to a moment halfway through the film, when you see the parent's punishment as a severe yet understandable answer to their lack of humility. <br/><br/>But just because Chihiro didn't yield the temptation doesn't make her immune to the wrath of Yubaba. Chihiro wasn't too enthusiastic about the family moving to another town, she missed her friends and school, she's literally turned to the past, like an overprotected only child who can't get off her zone of comfort. After ""Pinocchio"", she's also a little Alice who doesn't dream about escapism but quite the opposite, and although she doesn't become a pig, her presence in that world has a reason, Chihiro is a girl who embraces the present and only wishes to have her parents back, but she has a few lessons to learn, not to redeem her parent's fault but to overcome her status-quo complex and the things she take for granted.<br/><br/>Chihiro works as a slave for Yubaba, giving her name in exchange of safety. It's not exactly the name, but from what I gathered, a 'kenji', a sort of syllabus that changes her identity to Sen. Actually, the literal meaning of the Japanese title is the ""Disappearance of Sen and Chihiro"" as if Chihiro was incarnating the loss of Japanese memory, like her parents did when they forgot about basic courtesy in the name of money or like these human ghosts in that masterful train sequence, probable metaphors of Japanese people alienated by the modern world. By becoming two persons at once, Chihiro embarks on a transitional state, in a quest she knows nothing about, and neither do we, until the end, when the film unveils the message, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" did with the unforgettable 'there's no place like home'.<br/><br/>Now, at that point of the review, I'll keep this simple and say that ""Spirited Away"" is also a visually rich experience full of Carrolian elements, such as animal-creatures and food with shape-changing power. It is populated by a vast gallery of characters, humans, toad-looking creatures, a boy named Haku who knows Chihiro's name but suffers from existential amnesia as well, there's also a spider-human hybrid working in the boiler room, helped by minuscule black minions (the closest to comic reliefs in the film). Miyazaki drained his imagination from Japanese folklore but he creates his worlds with an instinct in detail and harmony in the drawings that would make any foreigner feel 'at home'. Some elements will certainly be lost in translation, but it's like Kurosawa's movies, the core is universal.<br/><br/>The clear line that became the trademark of the anime elevates the animation to the level of a noble art, one that creates realities of its own, or worlds that speak to our own perception of reality. And using his poetry and his delicate artistry, Miyazaki reprises the same themes than in ""Mononeke"" with a few variations: the former was about the battle between men and nature but this time, it's about the inner battle, causing men to disrespect the environment, forget about their identity and embrace life like money-driven robots or faceless ghosts. And it's not much that the film is about this stuff but the way it is. The effect on environment is demonstrated through a wonderful sequence involving the washing of a putrid creature, and the lure of gain is conveyed by the ""No Face"" character who gets anything he wants in exchange of gold nuggets.<br/><br/>Things get easily out of control, until Chihiro refuses the gold nuggets because she didn't need them. All she wanted was to save her parents. As the movie progresses, you can fell the change going on, she's not the shy little girl who couldn't even climb down stairs, she became strong, mature, confidently walking on a very tight metal pipe, symbolically coming to age after a harrowing journey. <br/><br/>A tale about modernity set in a traditional Japanese setting, ""Spirited Away"" belongs to that breed movies that embrace weirdness with such majestic confidence we can't feel more deceived when we get back to our flat and boring reality, speaking for myself, after watching two ""Miazaki"" in a row, I feel instinctively bored just thinking of the 'regular' animated movies."
"cynthia_008","10","1","1","22 August 2008"," Intelligent cinema
","This is an important film in the history of animation and storytelling in general. It caters for both young and old and demonstrates great skill in the art of story-telling. I've watched this movie with two four-year-olds on different occasions and they were transfixed for the full two hours. Not one moment of distraction and questions at the same points. It does need some parental guidance for very young viewers as there are some slightly confronting scenes which may require a little explanation.<br/><br/>While the story line is just great (cultural, diverse and imaginative) I like this film because it does what many children's films don't do which is to expose them to life, without abusing a child's sense of right and wrong. Movies like these help to prepare children for the life ahead rather than being over-protective.<br/><br/>You will have to run the dubbed version for young children, but do take the time to listen to the Japanese language version yourself because it makes the film more effective and even more beautiful."

","First of all, watch this movie with subtitles. I cannot stress enough the amount lost with the americanized translation and the unnecessary dialog used to satisfy over-sentimental western audiences with the dubbed 'Disney' voice-overs.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a visual splendor like no other and it's unusual technique of being completely hand-drawn does not create a lack of quality but in contrast makes you appreciate the astonishing imagery and magical burst of color. Indeed, this alone makes this movie stand-out above all others. But it doesn't rely on its excellent animation alone.<br/><br/>The story is simple but no doubt carries complex themes, to which immediately makes this more than a 'kids' movie, as cynics would suggest. In saying that, this movie can appeal to all ages and equally be interpreted differently to children as to adults. It will keep you intrigued to the end as the fantasy tale twists and turns and brings you to an enchanted land of mystical madness like no other.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, I was of slight disappointment with the ending, seemingly rushed and disorganized and not justice to the spectacle just witnessed. Without this fault, it would surely be a classic in my eyes, however, it is incredible nonetheless. I would recommend it to anyone, not just animé fans, as it manages to serve up a great plot and dialog to match its beautifully crafted animation. Excellent."

But as it continued I was drawn more and more into the story to where I accepted anything the story threw my direction. I was a part of the movie in a way very few movies can involve me.<br/><br/>Disney movies have their charms and I'm a big fan of some of them, namely the Pixar movies and a few of the 2D ones, but this will be unlike anything you've ever seen before (unless you're already familiar with Hiyao Miyazaki, in which case you'll probably be able to fully appreciate Spirited Away). I'm not going to ruin the plot for anyone, but I will say that it follows a girl named Chihiro on her journey into a spirit world and her discovery of how to take care of herself and those around her. There is far more to the movie than that, but I'll let you enjoy it for yourself. It's worth it."
"elsinefilo","Null","1","1","4 March 2006"," it may look unrealistic at first sight look closely you'll catch the difference!
","I should start this comment by saying: You need some time to ponder over that anime! First of all I am not Japanase so it's not easy to affiliate yourself with Japanese culture(for example if you know nothing about Shinto religion it's really difficult to put pieces together)When I first finished watching that movie I thought ""Hey it's really fun but it's just a conglomeration of imaginary fantasies but when I really pondered upon it and when I did some reading on it I realized that there are more to Spirited Away that eyes can see at surface. For example there is no clear-cut distinction between good and evil just like in real life right. Even Haku and No-Face who seem good at first look have their share of bad and good within their souls. Words have such a power in the movie. For instance Chihiro has to keep her real name in her mind if she doesn't want to be entrapped in the spirit world. This is actually what we do in real life. We attach such an importance to words that our emotions like anger,love,hatred,passion are channeled through the power of words. Greed makes spirits and people oblivious to what really matters in the movie. Spirits and people's greed (even Chihiro is greedy when it comes to grasping her parents attention)is self-destructive mostly. In short Spirited Away shows us the consequences of actions that alter the natural order of things in destructive ways just look around you you'll see how we humans are self-destructive by creating a figment of our imagination that we are not hurting ourselves but others to gain a place.Spirited is the story of transformation of a whining weak greedy little girl into a capable altruist brave girl.I say don't miss it!"

His films take you away from the cinema to somewhere completely different, which is something I love films to do to me. Spirited Away was no exception, and although I didn't find it as incredibly moving or as enchanting as Mononoke Hime, it's still easily one of the best films I've seen in cinemas this year.<br/><br/>Anyone can enjoy this film, no matter what background they're from or what genres of film they favour, it's a brilliant story and beautiful artwork.

","After all of the hype that this movie generated, I was expecting it to be overrated. However, after watching it I was pleasantly surprised. I won't deny that it's strange-- after all, it does take place in the spirit world, so how ""normal"" could it be? But this film has a lot to say about greed and perserverence, about friendships and hardships. Chihiro loses her parents to the spirit world because they mass-consume a feast meant for ""sprit guests"" like a bunch of gluttons, and are turned into pigs. Chihiro, who declined the meal, is left wandering around the spirit world, aided from time to time by a mysterious young boy named Haku who is sometimes a wolfish-looking dragon-serpent thing. She becomes a worker for this creepy old lady witch named Yubaba, and from there proves over and over that kindness and hard work will be her saviors. The animation is delicate, the colors muted and not as garish. Most anime is bizarre, and this is no exception, but it isn't hard to follow. Really it's a very moving story, great for young or old audiences. (I always prefer watching foreign films with the subtitles instead of the dubbing, and I would suggest this to anyone else wanting to watch the film, as sometimes the translations vary.)"

It has a dreamlike logic.  Things that seem perfectly ordinary at the time you watch it will make no sense when you try and explain it to somebody else.

The characters, as strange as many of them are, are completely believable.  It takes someone of great imagination to make a film like this, and make it work.  And this coming from someone who usually can't stand what most people term ""anime"".<br/><br/>On a side note, I've noticed some parents complaining about this movie for various reasons.  The box for the movie says it is rated PG.  This is not a Disney PG where it's been rated for slapstick or the occasional bad word. This is a ""you're insane if you're letting any little kid who can't sit still for two hours/gets scared easily/under 7 years old watch this movie"" PG, kind of like Harry Potter was.<br/><br/>Recommendations: If you like the story of Alice in Wonderland, you'll probably like this.  If you're into enthralling animated fantasy, I'd recommend ""The Last Unicorn"".  ""Flight of Dragons"" is also good, but doesn't hold up as well under repeat viewings."

","Looking at this film as an outsider, someone who knows very little about Miyazaki's films or ANY anime film for that matter, I've got to say that I found it to be a real breath of fresh air, and a welcome break from Disney films. It encourages me to go out and seek more anime films, but I also fear that I might be disappointed by those films if they aren't as great as this one.<br/><br/>Most of the film is set in a hotel for spirits which is ruled over by an evil witch and is staffed by a variety of extremely weird, but certainly original, monsters. A young girl named Chihiro (or Sen) finds herself trapped here after her parents trespass on the property, and must work there until she can find a way to escape with them. With it's cultural sensibilities, the film at times has a harsher edge than you would expect to find in your average American cartoon, but in the end it is also extremely heart-warming.<br/><br/>As I'm not really familiar with Anime, the closest Western parallel I can think of would be pixar's Monsters Inc., which was similarly interesting and original. Whether or not children will understand or enjoy this film I don't know, but adults will certainly find it interesting. It's worth noting that though I've only seen the subtitled version, there is an English dubbed version also available if you do want to show it to your kids."

","Here is my harsh, unsolicited review of Spirited Away. I wanted nothing more than to fall in love with this movie after having it recommended to me numerous times. Heck, I even bought the physical copy because I couldn't find it anywhere else. But, I'm terribly disappointed to admit I'm more than likely never going to watch it again.<br/><br/>The artwork was visually appealing, and I could see how people could compare it to Alice in Wonderland. However, unlike Alice, Spirited Away was difficult to sit through. I say this because the soundtrack was bland, there was hardly any character development, and the plot was seemingly pointless.<br/><br/>I did watch the entire 2 hour film hoping that my many questions throughout the film would be answered. Nope. That being said, the grotesque scene really did not help my opinion of this movie. I understand that so many people love this movie but I personally just don't get it.<br/><br/>TLDR: the only redeeming quality about this movie is the artwork itself."

I will say the production design, use of color and music score were amazing.  However, in terms of plot, story structure, catharsis, plant and pay off...it's all over the place.  I felt the world had no rules to it and therefore lacked any real tension.  I felt the story lacked any logic to it and therefore had no reason behind the motivation for characters.  Why did she do that? What is that supposed to be?  What was that all about? When will this end or start making sense?  With so many positive reviews and awards I'm confused.  Perhaps I just didn't get what others got from it...  All I have to back me up is the crowd of friends with whom I went to see the film with.

I know there is some symbolism behind the story and imagery, but the weirdly meandering plot distracts you from appreciating it.

They made a terrible choice when selecting the voice over cast (ESPECIALLY FOR CHIHIRO) I must applaud Kamaji's voice over, who did a very nice job along with Yababa/Zeniba.

","I stumbled upon Ponyo a few days ago, and loved it a lot. I had maybe too high expectations for Spirited away after that...<br/><br/>The plot is at best uninteresting. At worst, non existent.<br/><br/>The main character is bland and frankly annoying. Worst she seems to evolve a tiny bit throughout the movie only to go right back to annoying selfish bratty behaviour in the last scene. There goes the idea of the movie being about a rite of passage, or coming of age. She does not learn, evolve or change.<br/><br/>The dragon form of Haku seems to be taken right off the never-ending story. He could make for an interesting character, with a story to tell, he seems to have been through a lot. But towards the end of the movie the only things we learn about him just serve to confuse us more.<br/><br/>Everything else apart from a few humans (and Haku) is ugly/monster like. And behave in a way that is anything from logical. The ""no-face"" attitude being the best example of that.<br/><br/>There seems to be a theme about not forgetting who you are (the parents change into pigs and forget about who they were before, people forget their names, the ""no-face"" changes a lot after only a little while in the bathhouse only to change again when he is out of it, the big baby thing also changes when he gets out etc ...) but it is not really followed through.<br/><br/>Apart from Chihiro wanting to ultimately get out of that place and help her parents, the motives of other people there are unexplained. We don't know why the witches act like they do, why people never try to get out, why the spirits act like the big lumps they look like.<br/><br/>I really wished I had liked that movie, but nothing of what went on in it made any sense to me. I did not comprehend or liked any of the characters, or for that matter the whole ""world"" it took place in.<br/><br/>Feel free to explain it to me, because seeing how high its rating is, I'm really wondering if I've watched the right movie!"

","Two kinds of people will love this film. People who think anything,and I do mean ANYTHING made by the Japanese especially concerning anime and games*cough* Final Fantasy Series* is crafted by God himself.a.k.a.fanatics,and people who have a INFINITE reservoir of patience.Everyone else and by that I mean people who will call out B.S. no matter how so called good their past works are will hate this film with a passion.I watched this film for the first time in 10th grade and now as a sophomore in college I watched it again on Youtube because the same person who uploaded the entire movie called Howl's Moving Castle also uploaded this too,and I said what the hay I'll give Spirited Away another chance. I did,and It still bored the hell out of me. Although I must admit I did understand it a little better this time.<br/><br/>Plot:Girl and family moving to new place. Girl's father runs off road. Girl's parents see old building. They want to explore. They see food, eat food, and turn into pigs. It suddenly turns night. Weird boy comes out of no where tells girl to leave. Weird creatures start moving all over weird town. Boy disappears for 80% of movie. Girl can't remember her name,boy (before he disappears that is says he can't remember his name either. Girl gets job, and so on and so on.. That sounds like a okay weird plot, and done right it could have been great,but the Japanese aren't known for their plot or character development skills or excitement for that matter. Bottomline: The storyline and pacing of it was boring as hell, cheesy, and a good deal confusing, and holey. If you have insomnia this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Visuals: Okay for hand-drawing.<br/><br/>Characters. In the end you don't care if she gets home or not and you will p*ss yourself laughing when you find out what the boy's real name is.Everyone is easily forgettable once you turn the VCR off.<br/><br/>Dubbing: The dubbing was very good to me. I hate Japanese dubbing because their men always sound like girls,and the girls always have high pitched squeaky air-headed voices,and I can't understand a d*mn thing.The one's who say English dubbing sucks are prime examples of Japanese worshiping fanatics. All dubbing sucks to them as long as it's not Japanese.<br/><br/>Bottomline: P*ss isn't gold no matter what Japanese worshipers say.

"Mr Toad","6","5","12","19 April 2003"," Not terrible
","*May be some spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>This was supposed to be the anime I could appreciate. Yet, once the DVD's turned off, it is still... just anime.<br/><br/>You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again: Why does all anime look the same? As lush and imaginative as the world of Spirited Away is, Chihiro et al still look like they could have come from any other Japanese animated movie. I'm starting to think it is a good thing Disney has the American market monopolized. At least Disney strives for variety from year to year. You may not like the consistently happy endings, or the ultra-family-friendly nature of the films, but visually, at least, the Mouse innovates. Compare the differences between Beauty and the Beast and Lilo and Stitch with those between... well, any two anime titles. Notice something? The difference between ""good anime"" and ""bad anime"" does not constitute stylistic variety.<br/><br/>Yes there are positive themes in the movie. Chihiro grows up. It's great that she learns a lot of good things: respect, discipline, true friendship, etc. But the character development is spotty at best. Whereas we get a good understanding of Chihiro, we learn very little about Haku, the boy she learns to love (in a semi-platonic way).<br/><br/>Two more gripes: Why do the main characters have to explain the plot as it unfolds via monologue? e.g. ""He flew into that window up there. Maybe I can climb up and help him."" (when no one else is present) And, even in a fantasy setting, shouldn't the characters struggle a little before accepting some things? e.g. ""Oh he's a dragon."" and ""Call me Granny."" ""O.K., Granny.""<br/><br/>Again, it's not a terrible movie. But it is still anime, little mouths, little noses, cute fuzzies and all. I give it a 6/10.<br/><br/>--------------------------<br/><br/>Edit: I'd say it's grown on me by about an extra star over the years, but still isn't one I'd recommend to someone who wanted to watch anime. Even for Miyazaki, you're better off watching Howl's Moving Castle or some number of his older stuff."

","Lyrically beautiful animation? Yes.<br/><br/>Engrossing in parts? Yes.<br/><br/>Representative of themes and mythologies hopelessly foreign to the Western audience? Possibly.<br/><br/>Again, I just didn't get it. I didn't get it with 'Princess Mononoke' and I didn't get it with this picture either.<br/><br/>Ever since I watched the anime epic ""Akira,"" some 12 years ago, I have been a fan of the genre. In fact, having spent much of my formative years in the living room of a childhood friend of Japanese descent watching tapes of shows (on Sony Betamax, of course) his relatives had sent form Japan, I have tracked the incredible heights the art form has achieved in the land of the rising sun. So for me, much of the animation in ""Spirited Away"" is old hat. Maybe I'm harder to impress than the average American. Maybe I have yet to locate an anime experience cooler than ""Akira."" Maybe I've decided that Disney does it better after all anyway. But the animation in this film, while impressive and filled with entertaining characters and visions, was not huge.<br/><br/>Which leaves us with the plot. To which I can only say, ""Huh?"" I am gratified to have absorbed some of the analysis I've read on IMDb which helped me understand the meaning of at least one of the film's characters -- the strangely poetic ""No Face"" -- I fear the rest of the story failed to connect with me at all. Assuming the folks who translated the picture into English subtitles were able to accurately retain the meaning of the dialogue, and assuming that the film's themes were intended to be recognized not just by the average Japanese audience, we are left with a story that seemed, finally, rather pointless.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** I mean, in the end, Chihiro, through integrity and determination, is able to thank the river god, Haku, who kept her from drowning as a smaller child? Excuse my French, but BFD! ***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I just didn't care. And all the disembodied heads and soot creatures and giant babies and large-headed witches and talking toads and flying dragons couldn't make me care.

"greguva","1","30","114","31 August 2003"," Disappointed
","<Spoilers ahead><br/><br/>I had heard that this was a wonderful piece of animation and a truly creative and imaginative story, and in that regard this movie does not disappoint much, although I have little appreciation for anime. However, it seems to me the film is lacking in some of the basics of cinema. There is little plot or character development, serious lack of continuity, plotlines left dangling, situations resolved far too tidily, etc. At one point Kamajii tells Chihiro that, rather conveniently for her, he has been hanging on to some train tickets for 40 years. Why?? Where was he planning to go? Why didn't he use them in all that time? Why is he now so willing to hand them over to Chihiro without a moment's hesitation? There were countless examples of this sort of thing throughout the film. After experiencing No-Face's devastation of the bathhouse, Chihiro just walks out ahead of him and says matter-of-factly that he just got a little crazy in the bathhouse - reminded me of a scene in Monty Python's Holy Grail (except the scene in Holy Grail was funny). At the end of the film, Chihiro has little trouble determining that her parents are not among the pigs shown to her, although earlier in the film she could not pick them out in a dream. If you're going to put foreshadowing in a film, you ought to follow up on it and not just ignore it! Chihiro falls in love with Haku (vital to developments in the film) despite having spent only about 10 minutes with him (some of which he spent being nasty to her), despite the fact that she has been told that he is not to be trusted, and despite the fact that she has proof that he has stolen in the service of Yubaba. I know this is a movie, and a fantasy at that, but I need some reason to believe that she might have fallen in love with him, not just some other character stating that it is so. Haku, mortally wounded as a dragon and now back to being a boy, inexplicably recovers and is well enough to fly to Zeniba's house; again somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Holy Grail (""I got better""). I could go on with other criticisms of the film, but I could be here all night if I really got started.<br/><br/>To me, this film was simply a collection of well-animated fantasy pieces strung together to fill out 2 hours. And, to be honest with you, while the backgrounds were incredibly drawn, I didn't think the movement was anything special. It wasn't particularly funny, exciting, or interesting. I spent most of the movie thinking that there must be a tremendous gap in my understanding of Japanese culture, theology, and mythology that would have helped me to better appreciate it. Upon reflection, however, I think that no amount of cultural sensitivity could have made up for what was simply poor film- making. I concede the posssibility that, as suggested by some at this site, the English dubbed version that I saw is far inferior to the Japanese version with subtitles. However, I am not willing to waste yet another 2 hours of my life that I will never get back to find out if that is the case."

Whether it be the leads of Chihiro and No Face to the supports of Lin and Kimarji they are all fascinating to watch and you quickly get attached to them, willing them on to succeed in their given tasks.<br/><br/>Tha animation itself is also some of the best I have ever seen, it is fluent and bursting with color and life. Every character is beautifully realised and there voices are perfect Talking about voices, this is where I get stumped. Most people agree that the original Japanese dialogue with subtitles is superior to the dubing. But I cannot make my mind up, apart from the witch i find all characters to be equal in their dubing and Japanese versions. The dubing is also easier to understand (although it can border on Disney-ification sometimes, a lot of work has gone into the dubing and it shows.

It is a film which is immensely entertaining and full of scenes which are just playing fun to watch. However, you must be warned. In between the incredibly detailed animations, there is an almost never ending mythological plot (this lack of realism irked some of my friends). There are creatures and monsters, heroes and villains, none of which are as they first appear. It has everything a movie should have however there is no guarantee you will like it. If Spirited away has one fault it is its length. At 2 hours it is a killer for those with short attention spans (I did however make it through and in the end was glad I did). When going into the movie if you can go in with an open mind purely with the desire to be entertained then spirited away is a movie well worth seeing; however, if you are one to find fantasy and cartoons dull and nonsensical then find another movie."

","Wow. Just wow. I'm completely blown away by how amazing this film was. For a while now I've had an urge to watch it even though I had no clear idea of what it was. I was under the impression that it was a present-day Anime version of Alice in Wonderland. Lucky me it turned out to be completely different considering I can't stand Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>I think the most prominent reason why this movie hits you so deeply is because its real. If I wasn't constantly thinking ""Oh my gosh, the animation is so beautiful..."" I probably would have forgotten its cartoon-status completely. Little things like the way Chihiro's hair moved when she walked, the expressions and body language put forth from everyone. I can hardly believe that the artists were able to capture that.<br/><br/>Then there's the story, which is just magical beyond all belief. I started watching this movie at midnight and sat quietly on my bed, spell-bound, for the next two hours as the movie played out. I've never watched a movie that could hold me so avidly the entire time. <br/><br/>Of course you have to comment on the whole spiritual journey Chihiro goes through while she is on her physical journey. Essentially, she starts out as an annoying brat and ends up as a less annoying not-really-a-brat. That sounds pretty negative, but Chihiro was a little annoying sometimes. Then again, kids her age do tend to annoy me in real life so she was obviously portrayed realistically. Oh well, you have to love her anyway.<br/><br/>This was a magnificent movie. I don't intend to give it back to the person I borrowed it from any time soon. What are you waiting for? Go watch it!"
"pifas","9","4","9","29 January 2004"," Life beyond Pixar
","There's no doubt that Pixar Animation Studio is the greatest thing on animation in modern times. I use to love any effort by them, being Monsters, Inc. my all-time favorite so far. However, yesterday I rented this movie 'cause I've been hearing some great things about it, and after watching it, I just have to say that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi it is not just a great movie, this adjective is almost insulting: it's awesome, it is spectacular, it is mind and sight challenging, and is a round film from wherever point you wanna see it. Said in a few words, it's a masterpiece of modern times, which spends most of his time in a parallel (and surreal) world of ancient Japan. Sen to Chihiro... has so many powerful stuff to stand out for. It has one of the strongest imagination I've seen in my entire life on animation, and also there's a lot of inventiveness, believable profiles on characters (and they're animated!), perfect on detail drawing (yes, hand made, traditional drawing), pulse accelerating action, humor, an outstanding and subtle soundtrack, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Even the closing song is not less than beautiful.<br/><br/>As much as I love and respect Pixar, this one blew me away enough to place it on the same level as the films made by the most popular animation studio. I just couldn't believe my eyes as I was watching it. Is that simple. This experience is magical, involving, marvelous, and one more great thing about it is that you don't have to be a manga fan manga to truly enjoy the trip; just have to be an animation lover. Well done animation. And that doesn't happen much; it did to me with The iron giant, but that was some time ago.<br/><br/>
Mr. Miyazaki, I knew nothing about you or your work before Chihiro, but, from this point on, you have become my hero and I can't wait to have on my DVD player any other piece of animated heaven you've created."

None of the fantasy elements/ characters seem to have any link to one another or the story nor can they be seen to act as a metaphor for anything - either taken as a whole or on their own. Characters motives are completely at random and lack credibility - they start off afraid/dismissive of this ignorant insignificant little girl then all rely on her to solve their problems - what?<br/><br/>Utter gibberish executed well is occasionally very entertaining (Alice/Terry Gilliam films for example) - not in this case.<br/><br/>A bad episode of pokemon"

","This animated film is pretty to look at, but IMO it was endless and rather meaningless, at least to this western viewer.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film holds meaning to those cognizant of Japanese mythology, but although the protagonist is changed by her strange adventure here, there seems to be no moral lesson to be learned other, perhaps, than ""act with kindness toward others.""

","I'm a huge Ghibli fan and admit this was a great movie and deserved every single prize it won. Had some cute ""Ghibli treats"" like the Susuwataris (Totoros Dust Bunnies) but overall, and maybe for the first time, I didn't felt the originality Ghibli has everyone used to: Whole concept of being trapped inside a new world and trying to save it before returning to their own reminded me a lot of Neverending Story. Could be coincidence in there, but then you see that Chihiro must protect her identity and name before she forgets it. Exactly the same happened to Bastian. Haku can turn into a flying dragon (although his hair reminds me of Atreyu), Neverending story has Falcor the luck dragon. I read the book and watched the movies as a kid, I see a heavy influence here. Spirited away is a great film, I just didn't saw anything new. Not Ghiblis best.

","I only recently saw Spirited Away and I was extremely pleased with it. I searched out some of the negative comments out of curiosity to see what possibly could some people NOT like about this movie. Most reasons pointed to the lack of character development and the lack of a real story that made sense. In other words they expected something that fits perfectly together as often happens in all Disney movies. Not to say that Disney movies are bad, they're just different, they're very simplistic and offer nothing more than an hour's worth of entertainment. Spirited Away blew me away, all the motifs were portrayed so carefully and subtly and with such amazing animation visuals. It combined elements of many classical popular stories that I myself was familiar with and thus able to enjoy. It is probable that individuals exposed only to the Disney ""culture"" which comes very very close to no culture at all is negatively surprised by this movie. For everybody else who is familiar with coming of age stories, and other stories rich with fables and with lessons will see the lessons and motifs portrayed in Spirited Away and will not JUST look for a plot line and character development, but will see beyond that to discover that the plot was fantastic and there was also plenty of character development. For those of you who haven't seen this feature I wish you GOOD viewing! Do see this film on a rainy Sunday afternoon."

","If you are not Japanese, definitely see this movie with the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not dubbed. The sound will then go with the gestures and facial expressions. The story is a great introduction to themes in Japanese culture. The words ""spirits"" and ""gods"" which are used interchangeably in the movie are translations of ""kami"" (you can see the term in the title in Japanese), which is a Shinto concept of a spirit being, not god as thought of by Jews, Christians, and Muslims (who might be offended by a ""stink god"") . Many things in nature are filled with this kind of spiritual power--rivers, winds, rocks, etc. (For example, kamikaze means ""divine wind"" and it referred originally to the two great typhoons that destroyed the Mongol fleets when they tried to invade Japan in the 1200s). As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is about Chihiro's transformation from a whiny brat to a self-reliant, courteous, compassionate and aware individual. The viewer may see a resemblance to Memoirs of a Geisha in the heroine's maturation from a frightened little girl traumatically separated from her parents to a servant who must start at the bottom of the hierarchy and finally to a self-reliant and successful person. Another theme that is similar is the character of the greedy, powerful, witch-like owner of the establishment. Yubaba is contrasted to Zeniba; the former's home is ""in bad taste"" with a lot of imported ornate stuff (from chinoiserie to western-style furnishings) whereas Zeniba's cottage is very wabi-sabi (rustic-archaic) and simple, hearkening back to traditional Japanese design. Another thing I liked about the movie was its complete acceptance of a girl-protagonist (whereas girls are often treated as ""second-best"" in American movies). Japanese gender hierarchy and women's ""submissiveness"" are not as simple as some folks think. In early Japanese history, women were very powerful and autonomous figures--politically powerful, writers, etc. Originally the society was matrilocal and women had considerable say in their personal lives. The emperor is the descendant of the sun-goddess. Women's status declined in the samurai period and the Meiji Restoration, but there are still traces of their originally higher status and importance. So Spirited Away is not only fun entertainment but also a little introduction to themes and values of Japanese culture."

","At my friend's 12th birthday party we watched this movie, her absolute favorite movie of all time. I was extremely hesitant, especially when she insisted in watching it in Japanese with subtitles. However, being a polite guest I sat down to watch it with everybody else. After the first three minutes I was hooked. My friend had seen the movie multiple times and had visited every fan site known to human. She was an expert. The plot is complicated, but with my friend pausing to explain it here and there, it made it a lot more enjoyable. Several other users have commented on the art, (which is fantastic), but nobody has given the music the credit it deserves. Without any music the movie is excellent., ten stars. But with the music it is absolutely INCREDIBLE, a twenty on a scale of 1-10. Even one of the guests who isn't at all very musical was begging for a copy of the CD.<br/><br/>Anyway, at first I was very hesitant to sit and watch it. But I did, and now I am almost as big of a fan as the birthday girl herself. I have Yubaba as my computer's background and screen saver. I own the movie, the CD, the works. On the movie however, I watched the English version out of curiosity. It is TERRIBLE. Chihiro sounds like a spoiled brat throughout the movie. Also, it being a Japanese film, it sounds so much more beautiful with the Japanese version.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this review. Rent Spirited Away and watch it in Japanese with subtitles. You won't regret it."

","I normally dislike anime as an animation style (one of the only animation styles is don't like actually). However, this movie is great. One of the reasons being that this is an animated movie using the techniques of the western industry, i.e. enough frames to avoid the fact that it seems to be a sequence of stills.<br/><br/>Then there is the story, which is innovative in a way which one only sees once every few years (Shrek, Ice Age,...) and not one which recurs every two weeks (dragonball, ...) <br/><br/>What is very attractive also is the technique used to show ghosts and spirit in a slightly sfumato style.<br/><br/>Super story en superb animation."

"smakawhat","10","3","6","20 September 2002"," unbelievable masterpiece!!
","I ran and took the metro for about 45 minutes way across state lines. Living in Northern Virginia, this show was playing in only 2 theatres in the DC metro area (composed of DC, VA and MD). I had to head to the Mezza Galeria in Friendship Heights way out on the edge of NorthWest DC on the border with Maryland. Basically it is a trip that I will never forget and I will now always associate that area with the greatness of witnessing this masterpiece.. This film has already grossed over 200 million dollars and won major awards at film festivals, all without even being released in North America. Until now....<br/><br/>Basically put here it is (not giving any info away that would be VERY wrong). Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away), is a trip about a 10 year old girl who enters a magical spirit land with her parents who end up imprisoned. It is up to 10 year old Chihiro to find the strength inside to survive and perhaps rescue her parents.<br/><br/>But this film isn't about that plot, it is about the imagination of youth, the magic and characters who exist in this world, and about growing up and gaining courage.<br/><br/>I'll say this. I am having a really REALLY hard time putting the emotions I felt after witnessing this masterpiece on the screen. The scenes are masterfull, the animation is incredible, the backgrounds are pieces of art, there are things that happen in great stillness, and in great motion that take your breath away. It is very funny, and charming. However what separates this film from say Miyazaki's last recent work Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is that this film is more universal for all ages and more imaginative, incredibly so on the later. Where Mononoke was more political and intriguing and ingenious this film is something every person can relate to including 7 year olds. As one earlier minor review I read said, ""Kids will like it, parents will love it even more"". I can't begin to describe my jaw gaping mouth that stood there hanging almost every 5 minutes at what I was witnessing.. I could spend hours describing the myriad of characters in detail, but I would be writing to the end of time....<br/><br/>There is a scene in this film that just highlights everything that is grand about this movie. Chihiro takes a train ride with 3 spirit characters all very different and unique in their looks and personality. The purpose of the ride is simply just to go from A to B. Its not important for the story, it does not advance the plot on the grand scale of things. It is just something that is simply there to look at.<br/><br/>This scene had me in tears. Not because it looks sad, or the characters are tragic, or because the story at this point is so gut-wrenching (think of the opera music scene in Graveyard of The fireflies). It just pulls the emotion out of you because it is just so mesmerizing and beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>This film which has just been released in North America, looks to be in limited release so far. I'll put it to you this way. I am not a major fan of Japanese anime, but I have seen a small handful of good ones. I was speaking with people after the show, and I ran into one guy who as he puts it, has seen SEVERAL anime movies. He said this is the best one he has EVER SEEN. Period.<br/><br/>This film is going to be HUGE.. It just may get the North American public addicted to Japanese anime, an art form that has been nothing more in the eyes of America as an overly grotesque cartoonish immature art-form, that seems to be overtly sexualized, and overrun with violence and nonsensical stories. This film will not just break that barrier, it will be a tidal wave of movie history crashing through it with tsunami punch! If it DOES NOT... then anime does not even deserved to be shown in this country to be appreciated. I can't see this film not being a huge buzz within the next few days. The audience I was with which was very varied kids and adults of all ages, were entranced and applauded massively when this film was over in celebration.<br/><br/>I can only think of one film I have seen that is of this level and would rank now as a tie after seeing this film for best film of the year (that would be Monsoon Wedding). A very different film obviously which can't be compared to this.<br/><br/>This isn't just a great animated film. This isn't just a great Japanese film. This isn't just a great award winning film. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10"

","I just saw `Spirited Away' (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi), and have to tell you that this is no `Akira.' Although the animation is crisp, clear, and flawless for what it does it breaks no new ground and doesn't deliver what I would consider an Oscar-worthy performance. The plot, if one can call it that, is thin; amounting to very little. This is Japanese `Alice in Wonderland' on hallucinogens.<br/><br/>I'm completely at odds with all the rave reviews: this doesn't deserve any of it. I suggest everyone take a deep breath, and step back from being an otaku for just one second and rethink their viewpoints. For the uninitiated, this is pure fantasy gibberish. I have no choice but to give this movie sub-par ratings because of the plot-which is practically nil. I gave it the rating I did only because it is wonderfully colored and next to Akira is as flawless as anime will ever get; but at the same time its non-existent plot breaks the whole thing apart, and what you're left with is  well  nothing. It's all style and no substance.<br/><br/>I give this a `4' only because it shows how good Japanese anime can look. Pity it was hobbled by not having a story worth sitting through."
"s-j-james","2","12","39","30 June 2005"," A massively overrated piece of work
","An over-mannered and terribly awkward movie - the plot struggles to cohere and the animation is by and large rigid and inexpressive (look at the faces of the witches, for instance). Worst of all, however, is the voice acting. The lead, especially, squawks in the most grating way imaginable; some of the more gifted members of the English-language cast do their best, but struggle with a very limited script and emotional range. There are a few flashes of style in the visuals, but this movie is a clumsy and unfortunate reminder of how far the animated genre still is from mature achievement even as long after 'Akira' - there are less acclaimed animations you would be better off renting instead."

The art work is excellent, but the story is, in my opinion, too shallow. But this is a problem I have with all anime (with the only exceptions of ""Ghost In The Shell"" and ""Cowboy Bebop""). But not only was the story too thin but also it depicted a rather depressing line of events: A girl follows her curious parents, who want to explore an old building. They get lured in by ghosts who fill them up with food that turns them into pigs. The girl has to endure all kinds of insults and dangerous situations to free her parents. The girl basically had to suffer for something even her parents didn't do wrong, they just wanted to explore things. The end of this movie made it look like to me that wanting to explore things is generally a bad idea.<br/><br/>People who love anime will still have a good time watching this movie for it's artistic value."

","I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical.

","I give this movie a ten for a lot of reasons. First of, Spirited Away is about a girl named Chihiro who goes thru a tunnel and finds herself in a world full of spirits, witches, and people who can transmit themselves into different creatures. It's also about the love between two kids who save each other's life in different times and places.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie when it first came out on DVD, and even now I'll say it's the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I still have the DVD packed right in my room in a place I'll remember where it is so I can watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is kind of one of those movies that at the end you have this gulp in your throat and how many times you watch it, you'll want to cry. Well in my opinion, I say this movie is better than the Titanic.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie for everyone to see, no matter what age you are (take me as an example) because this is definitely a good movie by Miyazaki."
"playerazzi","Null","4","10","12 July 2004"," Too much for me
","OK, the animation per se is great. But that's it. <br/><br/>This is a romping, non-stop fantasy that takes us from one station to the next with no map in between. Wherethehellarewe?<br/><br/>It is actually a scary movie, and I didn't understand the point in it.<br/><br/>Our protagonist, Chihiro (sounds like Tihiro in the movie), is moving to a new town, which will bring a new school, and new friends, and she's not sure she can handle that. When their parents take a wrong turn, and Dad gets out of the car to explore the landscape, they end up in a ""trap"", in which her parents are tempted by delicious food, and turned into pigs. With me? Hold on. <br/><br/>Now, Chihiro is befriended by Haku, a young feller who should be a romantic interest for her. But this doesn't really pan out, maybe because she is so young. Haku befriends her, and instructs her in how to get her parents back. She must do this by passing many tests. One of which is being able to identify her pig-parents from amongst the many pigs in the sty. What's the point here? Dunno. <br/><br/>So, she's got to go through this bath-house where spirits come to get washed up. Huh? Yea, well, hold tight there . . . Seems the lady in charge (with a really gross huge face reminiscent of - yes - the Queen of Hearts of Alice fame) is a witch by the name of Yababa (sounds like I'm-baba in the movie), and for some reason she can get Chihiro out. But she first steals her name. OK, nevermind. <br/><br/>Hoo-boy. <br/><br/>If you are American or European, forget it. Especially if you don't like fantasy (I don't, can you tell?)<br/><br/>What I *did* like was seeing hints of Japanese culture, such as:<br/><br/>* They drive on the left side of the road. <br/><br/>* The new town is in the hills. Where are there NOT hills in Japan?<br/><br/>* They eat with chopsticks. Cool. <br/><br/>* Protocol - ie, how you behave and manners - is very important.<br/><br/>Chihiro doesn't know when she is going ""inside"", and so when she forgets to leave her shoes she is reminded that she is going inside. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>* This is the best - the most horrible monster is a Sludge Monster, who brings sludge and guck into the bathhouse. This is the most frightening thing - not a thief, not a drug pusher, not a rapist, not a murderer, no, no, that's not scary. The most frightening thing is to get sludged and all dirty. To the clean-conscious Japanese this must be a horrible prospect indeed.<br/><br/>* When Yababa steals Chihiro's name, she does so by taking four of the five Kanji characters used to spell ""Chihiro"", and leaving one, thereby spelling ""Sen"". I do not read Japanese, but this was clear to me. Super Cool.<br/><br/>* Trains are used for important transportation, as they are in Japan.<br/><br/>* Chihiro and Len sit down and eat this Japanese food that looks like falafel, wrapped up all neat. Anyone know what it is?<br/><br/>* Finally, and this I learned by reading the posts here, Shinto, the Japanese religion, is animist. This means that inanimate objects are imbued with a ""spirit"" . . . . <***SPOILER***> ------------------------------------------ Chihiro says she ""knows"" Haku, and apparently Haku is not a feller at all, but a river spirit re-incarnated into human form. Well, he's occasionally a dragon. He's a switch-hitter. First time Chihiro sees him as a dragon, she knows it's him, but why this is so is never made clear. Anyway, Haku the river spirit once saved Chihiro's life when she fell into the river at one point. <br/><br/>Bottom line: just BORROW the video, don't spend a dime on it. Or a yen. Whatever."

","Despite the gorgeous animation and backgrounds, I find myself agreeing with some of the more negative reviews on the site--once one gets past the otherworldy, alien nature of the ""Spirit World"" (about 1/3 of the way through) and moves into the actual plot, what is there?<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: If the big message of the show is spiritual growth, well, Chihiro (though whiny)doesn't seem particularly bratty or selfish at the show's beginning, and doesn't seem much changed at the end--if anything, she seems justifiably resentful of her parents by the closing scene. Her parents return to normal without their memories, so no lessons there. Except for Haku and the ""Big Baby"", the world she leaves doesn't seem much changed after her departure--for all we know, nasty old Yubaba went right back to turning her unproductive workers back into pigs the moment Chihiro's gone.<br/><br/>Perhaps the plot is more of an ""Empire Of The Sun"" type of thing, of a child's survival in a tough period, but given the animators' efforts, that seems like a cop-out of a plot.  So does the ""Alice In Wonderland"" amazing-but-pointless journey. Easier to think that maybe (like Mononoke) Miyazaki rushed through the story and is dismissing dangling plot threads with a shrug and substituting outrageous character design and mild schmaltz for genuine personalities. Oh, and giving us more blobs--lots of moving, amorphous blobs!<br/><br/>I dunno--should I end ""The greatest animated film of this (or any!) year"" with a detached ""hmm!"" as the credits roll?

"bigben5","1","23","95","8 September 2002"," IF you really want to know if it's worth it....
","* YES, IT DOES CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a story about Chihiro, a smart young girl who - thanks to her parents stupidity -  end up getting lost in a sacred forbidden city where spirits come to bath and relax. But you already knew that before reading.<br/><br/>I can tell you up front that the story is pretty much a copycat version of Alice in Wonderland, only with a much darker plot. For example, in the preview you don't get to see Chhiro's parents mutating into pigs after eating the forbidden food there. Nor is the fact mentioned that the guy who turns into a dragon does so because he sold his life to witchcraft. Or is even mentioned that part of the scary old women's pets is three decapitated heads rolling and jumping around. So think twice, about it if you want to bring kids to this movie ( then again Disney probably cut all that out, or adlibed it differently to change the story). My little cousin, from what I hear ran out of the theatre scared as hell... but then went back in later on because he was curious to see how it would end.<br/><br/>
So how about good points?. Well, I can tell you that the animation is superb. I mean really good. It's a mileu - where you get to wonder in awe of the scenery , rather than concentrate on the story. The music is also very well orchestrated, giving a great overall feel to the movie.<br/><br/>
Now the bad points. The plot stinks. I mean it, there are literally so many holes and details that if you're not paying attention to the whole thing, you'll get confused very soon. The question, as to whether or not Chirhio is able save her parents is pretty obvious and as to why you would care is another question that never gets answered. Overall, after seeing the movie you'll feel it's pretty pointless.  Oh yes, and they also dubbed it - another bad thing. I can tell by watching the preview that the dialogue has changed. I watched the chinese version - and there is a difference. So , should things not make sense , just blame the translators.<br/><br/>So what's my judgement?  YES - go and see it. The movie, I think is worth seeing at least once, especially on the big screen, and no more afterwards."

","`Spirited Away' is well animated film but suffers from a poor story and uninteresting characters. You can add all the freaky dragons and netherworld spirits you like and marvel at their strangeness but what do they add to the story? There was no intrigue and no real character development. to me it felt like watching a anime version of the Nutcracker Suite except with over the top symbolism (things like the greedy parents turning into pigs).<br/><br/>
`Mulholland Drive' accomplishes much better the kind of storytelling through emotion `spirited away' attempts.<br/><br/>4/10"

","(A Little Spoilers Included)<br/><br/>As Hayao Miyazaki's fame grows internationally, his Japanimation productions become more sophisticated, more aware of the Western audience (In Spirited Away, the viewers can see the Western influence on some characters' facial features, most namely, Yubaba's), and, at the same time, less spirited than his earlier works. While Spirited Away may be one of the most well-designed productions of his, the story is relatively simple and focuses on a single argument, greed, which occasionally gets too ugly. Some settings are weak or absurd without reasonable explanations (e.g., why does Yubaba have to offer a job to anyone who's willing to work? What's the point that Haku, the lover of Sen/Chihiro, used to be a river in ""our"" world?). Composer Jo Hisaishi appropriately enhances the neutral nature of the film with a John-Adams-ish indistinguishable post-minimalism score."

","An amazing piece of cinema. Disney made a big cock up, though, on advertising it in America and the United Kingdom. In Japan, one sixth of the population saw it, and I am furious at Disney's lame attempt to promote this film. Then again, it is so good that I think it would have beaten all the latest Disney releases by miles, so they probably kept the film in a low key... Chumps. The film is centred around a 10 year old girl named ""Chihiro"", who finds herself in a world full of spirits and creatures. She has to save her parents who have turned into pigs by the higher authority of the spirit world.<br/><br/>I will not delve into the details, but this really is an amazing film, where the characters are unique and original, unlike todays Disney movies.

"moribana","10","3","7","2 September 2001"," Yet another timeless Masterpiece
","Yet another timeless masterpiece from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.  Though it shares certain similarities with his other work, it is still a very much unique and new vision.  The substance, as usual, is quite profound, having to do with finding one's freedom through pure-heartedness.  Of course there is no preaching, things just happen like they do in life.<br/><br/>Except the world is fantastical with all manner of strange creatures.  But the world never feels artificial or silly.  It has a marvelous technological consistency like the Castle Cagliostro in Miyazaki's Lupan film.  The creatures, though oftimes crazy or hilarious also have an uncanny realism to them.  Alltogether this creates a sort of spellbinding effect, as one is witnessing something very new and bizzare, yet so real at the same time.<br/><br/>Unlike the epic/tragic tone of Mononoke Hime, this movie's tone is basically comic, though I might add it is comic in the Shakespearean sense e.g. intensely serious at the same time.  But it is not full of war and death like Mononoke Hime.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything by talking about the plot and I cannot think of anything else to compare it to.  It is unique.  Someone above mentioned Alice in Wonderland, and I suppose there are a few similarities, though overall I find it a superior work of art to Lewis Carroll's story.<br/><br/>My only dissapointment was with the music. I thought Joe Hisaishi's music for Mononoke Hime was really tremendous.  It haunted you long after the film ended.  Indeed, I thought it one of the greatest film scores of all time. The music for Sen To Chiro is not bad at all and does not detract from the film in any way, but except for a few inspired moments (like the closing credit folk tune--wonderfully simple yet effective) it might as well not been there.  I noticed one of the main themes was a variation on the main Mononoke Hime theme.  I wonder if there is a central musical motif he variates for all the Miyazaki films?<br/><br/>The audience at my showing had little children aged 4 to 5 years all the way to grandparents of the 80+ variety.  One and all they sat rapt and spellbound the entire 2hours and 20 minutes.  Rarely have I seen such focused wonder from a movie audience.  I think it is a testament to Miyazaki's master artistic status.  He delivers word, story and image so powerfully and directly that one just gapes in wonder.  To my mind, that exemplifies what cinema should be. How lucky Japan is to have such a great master and to so embrace him!  Sen to Chiro will likely break all the attendance records in Japanese Cinema, currently held by Mononoke Hime and Titanic.<br/><br/>I really hope this film gets a good release in the US in Japanese with accurate English subtitles.  His films do not work well in English!! Especially the dumbed down and cliched translation Mononoke Hime got.  But even translation aside, Miyazaki's films have a Japanese soul that is all out of kilter with English.  Crouching Tiger was a huge hit in Mandarin. Let Sen To Chiro be heard in Japanese!"
"Leofwine_draca","6","4","11","4 April 2013"," Needs a better story
","SPIRITED AWAY is a well-regarded Studio Ghibli animation about a young girl's adventures in a fantastic netherworld filled with all manner of strange and terrifying creations. While it packs more imagination into one movie than ten Disney cartoons, it feels a little aimless and meandering, in search of a decent storyline to go along with the madcap creations.<br/><br/>In terms of visual spectacle, at times this is as good as it gets for an anime: every scene features all kind of kooky, uniquely-crafted monsters and creatures. My favourite has to be the three bouncing heads. Unfortunately, the protagonist - a sullen little girl - turns out to be rather irritating and her journey to greater understanding is slow and over obvious.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to like these Ghibli movies, but SPIRITED AWAY is no classic; it starts well and tails off, with a stodgy middle and better ending. So far, my favourites are those that take place in the 'real' world - like GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES and PONYO - rather than those that exist in a fantasy landscape, like this and the overrated PRINCESS MONONOKE."
"Christopher_Reid","6","4","11","10 June 2007"," Great animation, beautiful music, uninvolving story.
","Spirited Away has all the elements of a great film but one. It doesn't seem to know what it's really about; there is no apparent focus or purpose. Clearly Chihiro is the main character in the movie (unless you count the world she discovers as a character or something like that) and yet her emotions and thoughts are given little attention. Most of the time she simply appears to be mildly confused. Although I could relate to her, I couldn't relate to her reaction to the world she finds herself in.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of Chihiro adapting to her situation and becoming stronger in the process but she never seems to become critical of how illogical her new world is. Characters appear to randomly alternate between mean and nice, wise and stupid, important and insignificant. This would be okay if Chihiro's character was explored more deeply, but it isn't. The lack of Chihiro's development would be okay if the world was more meaningful but it isn't. This is just my opinion of course, perhaps I'm missing the point of the movie completely. This makes it very difficult to criticise - it just doesn't work but for a plethora of reasons.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the score by Joe Hisaishi is magnificent, the animation is superb, and the film has some redeeming moments towards the end. I can't help but wonder what a fantastic film it might have been. I think a comparison with Alice in Wonderland would help me pinpoint my problem with it. The stories are very similar and where I found Spirited Away frustrating, Alice in Wonderland is entertaining and even thought provoking. Although Alice's world is very odd, it is also quite funny. Chihiro's world is too mean and serious to be funny. In fact, maybe that simple distinction summarises why I don't adore Spirited Away. I don't know. Another significant difference is that Alice actually gets frustrated and appreciates how ridiculous her world is at times.<br/><br/>In summary, if you take Alice out of Alice in Wonderland you get a silly pointless movie. If you take Chihiro out of Spirited Away, it makes little difference because of her lack of presence (excepting some later parts) and you get a silly pointless movie. So Spirited Away is too close to being a silly movie when it could have been enchanting and entertaining."
"JVL78","6","4","11","8 August 2005"," Too metaphorical
","*may contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>Spirited away was a very beautiful and mesmerizing movie. The animation is marvelous, the backgrounds beautiful. But the plot is muddled. I didn't get this film the first time I watched it. The problem isn't that there's no plot, it's just really subdued. The General story arc is pretty simple and somewhat uneventful. A girl gets trapped in the spirit world and must work there to try to free her parents. However most of the story (from what I have read) is told through allegory and metaphor, however if you don't get the metaphor you'll be pretty lost. For example; the character No Face, he's sometimes a ghost who seems pretty benevolent and who can't talk (just make sounds and gestures) then later he has legs and can talk, then he goes on a rampage and eats people, then seems friendly with Sen then seconds later tries to kill her, then seconds later they're friends. The hardest part is that there is no obvious motivation for his actions. But from my reading elsewhere, he IS a metaphor, he's ""no face"" meaning no character, he's takes on the traits of whoever he's near, which explains his drastic change of character. But were never ""told"" this! Now, I might be stupid, but I didn't get that, therefore I dint get that whole part of the movie. Other parts are just a inexplicable, Like why would Sen's parents go to this ""theme park"" which has apparently been closed for some time, then find some food lying around (which doesn't belong to them I might add) and then start eating it all. Were they under a spell? I don't know, just not rational behavior. Another part I didn't get until after I read an explanation; A Stink spirit comes to the bathhouse to take a bath. Sen is helping him when she finds a ""thorn in his side"" when she pulls it out, it turns out to be huge pile of trash, and the stink spirit turns into a water spirit. Once again this is a metaphor for pollution. (Ok, I kinda' got that). The newly cleaned water spirit gives Sen a piece of food (?) which she feeds to two different characters to ""cure"" them. (It's never explained that this is magic food or anything). I didn't get the significance of her knowing Haku in the past, or the coal sprites (which we focus on for quite a while) they don't seem to play any real role in the movie. <br/><br/>*end of spoilers*<br/><br/>I think the movie is trying for a ""mysterious"" feeling. It did evoke a sense of wonder in me, but I was a little too lost.<br/><br/>Upon reading detail explanations of the movie on the internet, I realized that I missed (or misunderstood) about a dozen parts in this movie. I appreciate mystery, but this may be a little overboard."

Here's a tip, if you think it's below average in the first 30 minutes, don't bother finishing it. It doesn't really pick up. Maybe it's because I don't understand Japanese and read the English subtitles. I just really didn't find this to be great.

The animation itself was superb, so crisp and bright, nostalgic in many ways. The score really complimented it also. I just did not really enjoy the story. It seemed to be very jumbled and trying to get too many themes and messages across. Greed, coming of age, friendship, even environmental harm. It was just too much. I found nearly all the characters somewhat annoying apart from Haku. The young girl who was the main hero grated on me after a while. The spirit world also was confusing. It was hard to figure out who was good and bad at times and I pondered whether all the spirits were actually being held prisoner. I also thought the ending was a bit lame. Without giving away too much they introduced a character towards the end and it somehow felt only to bring the movie to a conclusion and help the young girl. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of what happened after. A strange movie in many ways and I am baffled as to why I did not enjoy it and so many people rave about it and it lays claim to being one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe I have missed something, I really don't know."

"EErshova","10","2","4","23 August 2012"," Beautiful and heartwarming
","Although I am in no way a fan of Japanese animation, this movie is nothing short of exceptional. I have watched it countless times, and it never gets old, only better. It is a children's fairy tale - however, there's depth to it that makes it more of a fairy tale for adults that want to remember what it was like to be a child. The message (a common one for Miyadzaki's movies) is simple and beautiful, and although he is not a religious fellow, entirely Christian in its essence: not physical strength, fame, money, or brute force will make a difference in this world - but love, hope, strength of heart and self-sacrifice. The hero of Miyadzaki's movies is not an all-powerful superhero, but a small, insignificant and frightened little girl, who nevertheless finds the courage and strength to do what her heart tells her is right. Just as in most of his movies (and another very Christian aspect), while there is evil present, no character is truly evil for evil's sake - the mean giant baby is just a spoiled fussy child, and even the ""wicked witch"", Yubaba, has a sense of justice and is capable of love. The characters are all memorable: the adorable coal spirits, the Faceless spirit, the dragon - just to name a few. The animation is brilliant and the music is mesmerizing. I have yet to see an animation film that is more magical. My favorite scene: when Tihiro rides the train through the water. Sends shivers down my spine every time!<br/><br/>In summary, its a masterpiece and fully deserving to be in the Top 100 movies."

","Spirited Away is a Japanese animated fantasy-adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. The film tells the story of Chihiro Ogino, a sullen ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, becomes trapped in an alternate reality that is inhabited by spirits and monsters.After her parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and escape back to the human world.Master animation director Hayao Miyazaki follows up on his record-breaking 1997 opus Princess Mononoke with this surreal Alice in Wonderland-like tale about a lost little girl. <br/><br/>The film opens with ten-year-old Chihiro riding along during a family outing as her father races through remote country roads. When they come upon a blocked tunnel, her parents decide to have a look around -- even though Chihiro finds the place very creepy. When they pass through the tunnel, they discover an abandoned amusement park. As Chihiro's bad vibes continue, her parents discover an empty eatery that smells of fresh food. After her mother and father help themselves to some tasty purloined morsels, they turn into giant pigs. Chihiro understandably freaks out and flees. She learns that this very weird place, where all sorts of bizarre gods and monsters reside, is a holiday resort for the supernatural after their exhausting tour of duty in the human world. Soon after befriending a boy named Haku, Chihiro learns the rules of the land: one, she must work , as laziness of any kind is not tolerated; and two, she must take on the new moniker of Sen. If she forgets her real name, Haku tells her, then she will never be permitted to leave.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning, and his imagination so vivid, that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period, no timeout.Also,it was the most deeply and mysteriously satisfying animated feature to come along in ages for it was is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by our world."

","Like many of Hayao Miyazaki's films, Spirited Away is a fun movie that at the same time provides thoughtful themes and stunning visuals. The main character, Chihiro, is both easy to relate to as well as inspiring, and like many other characters in the movie, she is very distinct and memorable.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely well paced, with both slow, thoughtful segments as well as quick action-packed sequences.<br/><br/>Though it does not hurt to be familiar with Japanese culture and mythology (as it certainly adds a lot to the movie), it is not necessary to enjoy the film.

","I have to say that as far as movies for kids go, this took me by surprise. I enjoyed every minute of it, from the oddball characters of the hot spa, to the really weird characters that were the guests. A story of a little girl thrust into a world of the unknown, because of her parents eating food made only for the spirit world. When they turned to pigs, she had to save them by becoming a temporary spirit working in the lavish spa. Working under a witch named Yubaba, a kind of mean streaked yet fair witch who oversees her employees. In giving her a job, Sen then tries to make the best of it working with the other help and to make sure the guests are looked after and cared for. It is quite hard at first but then becomes more attentive. In the midst of this, she also has a friend who is also a dragon, but can be humanoid when he sees fit to do so. Sen's duty ultimately leads her outwards to the spirit lands where she meets Yubaba's twin sister to return a seal which the dragon stole under the tutelage of Yubaba herself. All in all, this was a beautiful movie for scale, characters, the idea that being spoilt has its downfalls. And Sen really learn-ed the hard way. She got to do an honest days work, make lots of friends, and become a kind of grand daughter to Yubaba's twin sister. Her journey was breath taking, a marvel in film making."
"khanbaliq2","10","2","4","20 September 2009"," Spirited Away is a memorable and captivating journey, marking a high point in the director Hayao Miyazaki's career.
","Spirited Away is perhaps the Miyazaki film that appeals most to adults, and it also happens to be one of his strangest. The film views a sullen ten-year-old girl in the middle of her family's move to the suburbs and an awkward wander into a world ruled by gods, witches, and monsters; and a bathhouse for these creatures. The film received many awards, including the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, the first anime film to win an Academy Award. The film also won the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Spirited Away overtook Titanic in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history.<br/><br/>Spirited Away happens to be my favorite Studio Ghibli film. It's also undoubtedly one of the studio's best films. It's a testament to director Hayao Miyazaki's creativity that he managed to make this masterpiece so late in his career. The animation is just gorgeous. The use of color is fresh and vibrant. All the backdrops have so much detail that even if you watch the film more than once you'll still see something that you didn't notice before. Even though the film is a fantasy Miyazaki still made it as realistically as he could. For example, when Chihiro runs, she runs realistically like a little girl. It's these little details that made me like the film even more. Even though the setting is very much Japanese it's still possible to see what influenced Miyazaki (not just in Spirited Away but in his other films too). There are American influences but there are also Russian influences. Miyazaki has stated that the 1957 Soviet film The Snow Queen is one of his inspirations to work in animation. When he started his career, Miyazaki had a rough start and was thinking of leaving animation already. When he saw The Snow Queen, he admired it and continued working in anime. In September 2007, it was announced that Studio Ghibli will be distributing this film through their Ghibli Museum Library label. The plot of Spirited Away resembles that of several popular Russian fairy tales. A girl who enters a strange land, meets strange creatures, and then manages to return home. I've seen it before. Yubaba was obviously influenced by Baba Yaga, a witch-like character in Slavic folklore (her magic, her big nose, her ability to fly like a bird, and that she's the master of some place). All this may seem strange at first, but it just adds to the uniqueness of Spirited Away. This time composer Joe Hisaishi delivers a pleasant yet beautiful score. The highlight of the soundtrack is the closing song Always With Me, performed by Yumi Kimura. As in most of his films, Miyazaki includes his thoughts on the environment, childhood, friendship, work and manners. These become good lessons in the film. In conclusion, Spirited Away easily earns a perfect rating from me. I give it my highest recommendation, and it's on my list of the top ten films."

","Princess Mononoke was my first Ghibli movie, and then I saw Spirited Away. Both are simply awesome. Miyazaki has this wonderful ability to bring an 'Alice in wonderland' feeling to most of his movies viz. 'Howl's moving castle', 'My neighbor Totoro' and 'The cat returns'. Spirited away is the best in this genre and perhaps the best from studio Ghibli. Other than wonderful animation and a very good storyline, what caught my attention is Miyazaki's unique way of character development. The characters in this movie (and most other Ghibli movies) are so full of life.

Cause I really like Disney/Pixar though it seems almost boring next to this.<br/><br/>Chihiro is a nervous little girl who's on the move with her parents. When they're on the way to their new home, they get lost on a road into the woods and ends up in a tunnel who leads to something they think is an abandoned amusement park. When the parents start eating from a table full of delicious food who just happens to be on a table in this place, the day turns to night, her parents turn to pigs and the world changes to something scary, weird and completely different...<br/><br/>This tale is the work of geniuses. I have never seen such an always captivating film filled to the brim with wonderful and unique characters, as well as an original, exciting and constantly surprising story. The feature contains an amazing mixture of adventure, action and drama with some drops of cream comedy on the top. I simply couldn't take my eyes away from the screen a second of the two hours, two hours who felt more like 30 minutes. It is such extraordinary entertainment to watch Chihiro using the power of courage and love to save her loved ones. I could keep going on with the superlatives but you have probably taken my point by now. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie in Japanese with subtitles. It simply feels much more natural that way than it does dubbed. All in all ""Spirited away"" is the best animated feature and even one of the best films I have ever seen. I nearly never give movies 10/10 but this time I simply must."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","27 April 2008"," An adventure that will leave you spellbound
","""Spirited Away"" is a great film, but not great in the way that most Americans will think of movies. This film is an adventure unlike anything the western hemisphere has ever seen (unless of course you belong(ed) to your high school anime club). It's a story about simple, pure and true values, not a story about life's deepest questions and that's what separates it from the dominant form of ""Western"" films.<br/><br/>The story is about a young girl named Chihiro who is moving with her parents to a new town when a stop along the way leads them to what appears to be an abandoned carnival. You get the feeling things aren't that simple and before Chihiro knows what hit her, she is in a spirit world and her parents have been transformed into pigs for gluttonously infringing on the spirit world. To return to her normal life and get her parents back, Chihiro must work at a spirit bathhouse led by a cruel witch named Yubaba.<br/><br/>There is no explanation of what this world is in relation/comparison to the real world that the characters were in in the beginning, but once you get past that, it's all about the creatures, characters and bizarre events that happen. The world is unbelievably imaginative, combining both elements of conventional fantasy and ideas that are completely fresh. Whether it is the odd, but powerful creature named No Face, the multi-legged old boiler operator Kamajii or the bug-eyed, insane Yubaba, ""Spirited Away"" boasts an intriguing cast of characters.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film is about the values of love, friendship and helping others. We watch Chihiro, a sort of passive, ignorant girl learn (in some of the oddest ways) what it means to be selfless and giving and the film is her transformation into a better person. That's it. No deep criticism of humanity (other than don't be selfish), no questions about life, just a reinforcement of ideas that so often are either overlooked or expressed in uncreative, unoriginal ways. A children's film could have gotten the same ideas across, but ""Spirited Away"" shows that there are different ways to think about why those values are important."

"bigmoecrusader","10","2","4","29 May 2007"," Chihiro's Sacrifice and Selflessness
","At first glance Spirited Away seems to be another knockoff kid's cartoon, but actually is an adult movie that shows the corrupt modern society and its weaknesses. Hayao Miyazaki directly related the story to the problems of modernity compared to a traditional sense. The main character Chihiro is depicted as a modern girl who throughout the story captures traditional aspects in her life. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki shows the audience how the younger generation can change from a corrupt way of life, but the older generation is incapable because of there greed.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro is shown as a needy week little girl with arrogant parents that wouldn't even help her across a large creek. Crossing the creek changed the present day into the traditional world with a very Buddhist undertone and Daoist overview. Miyazaki represented everything in the traditional world as a symbol. The Bathhouse, were most of the action happened, symbolized purification because water meant cleansing. From the point she entered into the traditional world she had to overcome fear by herself. Overcoming fear by yourself is a very traditional idea, and throughout the movie she becomes more and more brave and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Chihiro was able to overcome many obstacles throughout the movie because of her selflessness and her willing to do whatever it took to get her parents back. She risks her life twice during the movie through compassion. When she pulls all the garbage out of the muddy monster that represents sickness of modernity, Miyazaki is saying that you can cure the problems of society and that you can go out and clean it up. The second time she risked her life, she cured the monster No Face by sacrificing the pill that could have cured her parents. Miyazaki is telling the audience that you can solve the illness of society through compassion and sacrifice.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that would like to see how the younger generations can save traditional ideas in the modern world. In order to understand the deeper meaning that Miyazaki was trying to portray, leave your idea of a good movie behind. Being able to see beyond the surface, and understand Miyazki's true meaning of the text will help you interpret the ending of the movie."
"ShiiStyle","10","2","4","10 April 2007"," The best bildungsroman of all time
","I do not see how the story of maturity could be told any better than it is in Spirited Away. It is simply the story of a selfish girl who learns to work, told with perfectly executed emotion in the century-long tradition of Japanese film, and brilliant images that will stick in your mind for decades. Doesn't No-Face's monstrous devouring remind you of people, or events? The writhing of the dragon, the sludge of the polluted river spirit-- aren't these images you will come back to in real life? Miyazaki has gone beyond simply trying to tell a story. He understands the very medium of traditional animation and what it is best at doing, the things other media simply cannot pull off. It could not have possibly been executed in live action, or in computer-generated 3D animation. This film is a triumph for animation that sets a bar so high I wonder whether other media could possibly live up to it.<br/><br/>Spirited Away appeals at once to Japanese and non-Japanese, those who have seen Miyazaki's movies and those who haven't, film buffs and casual movie watchers, those who enjoy symbolism and those who want a fun story, fantasy geeks and those who prefer normal characters, those who love exciting scenes and those who only want to get a closer look at the scenery. Miyazaki has firmly harnessed the microphone and nobody can miss his message. Spirited Away should be the picture people see when they look up the word ""anime""."
"thenamestuxedo","10","2","4","2 October 2006"," Best Animated Movie Ever
","Without a doubt this movie is a huge journey of random encounter but with an entire symbolism in itself in Japanese mythology as well as just total anime randomness. The art speaks for itself in its originality and majestic style. This film definitely deserves to be on the top of the greatest animated movie spawned period. Th voice acting gives a great mood of the personalities of all the characters. The story even is a critical and somewhat at times confusing. This movie is definitely more for the less narrow minded. Be sure to pay attention in this movie, its also a great starter for those who want to explore the world of anime."
"edinburghstoryteller","8","2","4","25 January 2006"," Beautiful film - comes highly recommended...
","From some of the reviews I was reading I was expecting something very trippy, but very well made. In many ways, that's exactly what I got, but if you bear in mind that this is a fantasy tale it's really not as weird as many people make it out to be. Some of the ideas and the imagery are bizarre - in fact most of them are, it must be said - but nothing feels like it was thrown in there purely to be different. It all feels like it has a place all of its own.<br/><br/>It's sometimes hard for animated films to draw you in and make you feel involved with the characters, but Spirited Away does this brilliantly. Even some of the stranger ones - you find yourself becoming deeply involved in their little sub-stories. The end result of all this is that it becomes a joy to watch, from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to virtually anybody who appreciates good movies, because it is so well crafted that if you approach it with an open mind and simply allow yourself to be swept along with it, you cannot help but enjoy it."
"eroginsk","8","2","4","2 August 2005"," Spirited Away review: Sending Mixed Signals
","In Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki creates a color-saturated world filled with interesting characters, magical creatures. The colors in the movie are stunning in their variety. The movie's animator has an interesting way of showing light and shadow, making it seem more cinematic than cartoonish, and Miyasaki shows a great attention to detail in every image he creates. The movie centers on Chihiro, who is a whiny, sullen girl whose family is moving. Chihiro does not want to move, and she makes her opinions well-known. Her whining does not stop when her father decides to take a shortcut to their new home and encounters what he believes to be an abandoned theme park, which is really a bathhouse for spirits to get away to. Chihiro is essentially orphaned in the spirit world when her parents partake of some food that's been left out in preparation for the ghostly guests, and the parents' greed turns them, quite literally, into pigs. It is interesting that Chihiro is the one who warns her family to not go into this seemingly abandoned place and to not eat the food because the viewer believes that Chihiro is just being surly and childish, when really it appears that she has had some special insight (another image of the child as seer). She has not been turned into a pig, and it is her quick thinking and the help of a stranger that just might help her family get out of the mess they have fallen into. Chihiro must then grow up quickly, start becoming more courageous, showing strength and determination. The movie seems to be imparting some very specific lessons to its viewers. Indeed, there is a big focus on manners, ""Aren't' you even going to knock? You're the most pathetic girl I've ever seen"" is one of the lines uttered, and ""Anyone can see you are a lazy, spoiled brat with no manners,"" is another telling piece of dialogue. Chihiro is constantly being reminded to say ""yes, ma'am"" and ""no, ma'am."" Additionally, Chihiro's gluttonous parents get turned into pigs for their mistakes. Also, greedy people get eaten by the dark spirit that crashes the bath house. The movie, however, does seem to send somewhat of a mixed message because Chihiro appears to be bratty when she complains that her parents shouldn't stop when they do, and yet she is right that they shouldn't have trespassed and that they should have stayed away from food that wasn't meant for them. On the other hand, through her experiences in the spirit world, she matures, becoming more self-sufficient, empathetic, and responsible. She is only able to achieve these great human characteristics because her parents have failed to follow the very codes the movie seems to be promoting, like respect and restraint."

","Following the story of Chihiro, a young girl who mistakenly wanders into the spirit world with her parents, Spirited Away will be responsible, along with the CGI geniuses at Pixar, for the long-overdue downfall of Disney animation, both ideologically and visually. The story is neither simple nor predictable, and the weird and wonderful characters, locales and soundtrack are woven together with the hand of a genius director (Miyasaki) who really is at the top of his game.<br/><br/>This is easily the most emotionally enchanting and visually brilliant animated film I have ever seen; every cell is crafted with such vibrant wonder that 'awe-inspiring' is a phrase which will need redefining. I hope that, in time, word of mouth (through sites such as this) will elevate this film to Shawshank godliness, no less than it deserves. As a foreign film, a feature animation and a children's film, this will satisfy lovers of all three genre and convert many more to all three causes, such as I."

But for me, all i can say is that the movie's scenes and background are the most outstanding scenes and background of all animated movies i've ever seen. The cinematographic scenes and background is so realistic that it doesn't seem to be just a still and 'Dead' animated movie. it's just brilliant that it's very very complicated to make, so real, the lighting and shadows.but that's all!! and what i dont like? i dont like the human characters, just say like chihiro and her parents. Chihiro is not cute at all to move me in the movie, and is not cute at all to make me really interested to the movie, or even not cute at all to say this is the best animated movie ever made. it's just so unperfect and old fashioned. and the story is so alice In Wonderland. maybe it's the japanese version of it, but it just seems to be not really creative. most of u say this is the best animated movie ever, but for me and most of my friends where i live at, this is not. so i wanna put it this way: if a movie had so much attention and compliments, it should have been most of the time, most of the place, and most people , right?

"howard.schumann","Null","2","4","3 November 2003"," Brilliant and Imaginative
","Animism is a belief that a soul or spirit exists in every object. Shinto, the native religion in Japan that goes back to 500 BC, has incorporated many of the ideas of animism, worshipping the spirits of mountains, rivers, rocks and trees and using rituals that connect people to nature's timeless flow. Many of the spirits and stories from the Shinto religion are depicted in Miyazaki's animÃ¨ feature Spirited Away and the director has said that many images in the film came from his childhood memories of traditional Japanese culture. Spirited Away won the 2003 Oscar for Best Animated film and has been deservedly praised for its imaginative story, brilliant colors, and superior technical achievements.<br/><br/>As an unhappy ten-year old girl, Chihiro, travels with her parents to her new home in the countryside, they take a wrong turn and end up in what they think as an abandoned theme park. Separated from her parents, who partake in a gluttonous meal, the little girl is drawn to a bathhouse for spirits and enters an alternate reality. Her parents have been transformed into pigs and she is trapped in a world she can barely understand. Chihiro does not change or grow up suddenly but calls upon her inner strength that she barely knew existed to help her out in dangerous situations. She is helped by young Haku, an assistant to Yubaba, the bathhouse manager who tells her that her only chance is to ask Kamajii for work in the boiler room (Miyazaki said that he was trying to show Japanese girls who never had to work the experience of hardship). Kamajii in turn sends her to Yubaba (yet another wicked witch stereotype) who steals her name, calling her ""Sen"" and gives her difficult tasks that she must undertake successfully in order to free her parents and return home.<br/><br/>Along the way, Chihiro encounters physical and psychological dangers. There are no simple villains in the film but there are many repulsive creatures such as a boiler room boss with six tentacles, a giant grotesque baby, rolling heads, stink monsters, and the like. One wonders where these images come from since Japanese gods have no actual form and elementals in mythology are part of the simple beauty and magic of nature. Yet, unlike the Disneyfied view of the world with sharp lines separating good and evil, Miyazaki's film is ambiguous and shifting and Chihiro must adapt, figure out the world she is in, and learn whom to trust. <br/><br/>When Chihiro begins to control her own destiny, she creates supportive friends to help her complete her tasks and, in the process, discovers abundant courage and a sense of responsibility. As she and Haku move toward freedom, they both realize that they cannot escape their enslavement until they remember who they really are, a metaphor for all of us groping toward our spiritual connection. The power they find does not consist of magic spells or objects to render opponents senseless but the energy that flows from love, forgiveness, and non-violence. Spirited Away is a remarkable achievement and a film that left me feeling uplifted and connected to a greater reality."

See it in the theater, then get the DVD when it's released.<br/><br/>Now, does this sound like an infomercial?  You bet.  But the difference here is, that it's not hype.  It's all true.  The plot has been outlined elsewhere, so I won't repeat it.  Just a few things that appeal to me personally:<br/><br/>Despite the Western trappings of a suburban family moving to a new house and the theme park setting, the central location of a bathhouse reminds me that this is a Japanese film, with Japanese sensibilities and Japanese aesthetic. I feel like I'm watching a synthesis of Zen and Shinto and Noh and maybe even a little Sumo (you'll recognize that reference when you see it). <br/><br/>
Many of the Japanese mythical allusions which many of the characters are making are lost on me, but the wonderful artistry of the depictions makes their obscurity that much more charming.  I really like ""No Face,"" especially in the beginning:  a real spook, and because of the dramatic mask it wears, one I'd imagine is a stock character which Japanese children are familiar with.<br/><br/>The dragon, at once fierce, because I'm a Westerner, and sympathetic, because of its plight:  there is an amazing scene where it is being devoured, in flight, by birds - ORIGAMI birds!<br/><br/>The inside of the bathhouse:  It's the most exciting, delicious, nightmarish thing I've seen since I was a little kid watching that house of naughty boys in Pinocchio's dream.<br/><br/>This flick has pushed my buttons - the right buttons - so I could go on and on.

I found this film severely lacking in that last department. I can not understand why it is ranked so high on the top 250 (at the time of writing this around spot 40). None of the characters' actions seem motivated and they are very badly developed. It seems like the person responsible for the ""story"" here just throw a lot of 'cute' and weird characters in and made the whole thing an obvious reference to Alice in Wonderland and thought the rest would solve itself. It didn't. <br/><br/>The end result is that you just don't care. The pace is very slow. A lot of things may happen but the film doesn't draw you in. I think that many of the problems with the film ""Princess Mononoke"" was repeated in this anime.

Haku was originally a river, but now it is covered with a lid and becomes a culvert, but the essence is a river.
I thought that this story is to say that the appearance is different from the contents, and the appearance changes depending on the contents. No, it looks different even if the appearance does not change! ... The protagonist is rotten at first and looks ugly. However, when the story ends, this protagonist is truly charming and shining. It became the most attractive character in Hayao Miyazaki's animation. The contents of her which she take make the difference of the appearance. And inside of every human beings, there is an unknown power unknown to even thirself.
At first, the story composition follows the heroin's feelings and given tasks, and then expands to the story of the supporting character Haku from the middle.

"Pierre-Andre-17","10","0","0","27 April 2020"," Don't forget what you strive for originally...-What I have learned through this profound animated movie.
","Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of a story, a story that someone loses him or herself because of greediness:
Ogino' parents become hogs because they can't leave the so-called feast;
Boh is attracted by food and sensory feast in the bathhouse and finally becomes a monster after wasting excessively;
Haku enters the bathhouse to learn magic while becomes a thief controlled by Yubaba;
Almost everyone in the bathhouse works hard to get the gold, even if they know they will be swallowed....
What does the bathhouse mean there?
There exist a variety of food, sensory feast, which attracts people to come eagerly while leave satisfactorily. -This is more like a microcosm of our world, which is filled with and blotted by materialism.
But what happen after Ogino' s come?
01
Lost
When Ogino comes to this world, it feels like an innocent kid entering a la La Land. She witnesses her parents becoming hogs which represent the greedy men who only care how to cater for their appetite and never be satisfied.
She is pretty scared and doesn't want to eat any food in this world to cut her own appetite. However, without food people will disappear. So Haku brings food for her and tells her to work-only in this way she can survive, which means no pain no gain.
To avoid becoming a hog, the neophyte asks Yubaba for a job. Admitted Yubaba gives her a job, but she also stripes of her original name-Chihiro Ogino.
Ogino is her original name, original appearance and original identity.
While ''Sen'' is what Yubaba call her-this is a new identity meaning that she is working here.
If a man forgot his or her original name or appearance, he or she can't go back to the original world. Thanks to Haku giving Ogino her clothes to remind her her original name.
Sometimes people lost themselves in this way. In seeing the workers in the bathhouse, we should know that they are epitome of us, who want to make more money while don't want to do more work or just want to designate the others and bully the poor ones. In this way, we adapt to this world to greater extents;we chase power,success,higher ranks and more captured equipments....
So that's why kind Haku becomes a lackey of Yubaba;that's why frogs are willing to exchange their lives for money....
At this point, I want to ask how many people can still remember their original ideal and what we want to do at first?
Or we just be busy with something mundane and gone with the wind. Love someone;merry someone;have babies;become bosses and become rich.... Admitted, we might achieve something, but we also lose the basic ability to remember our name....
If we really change the world hard or if we are changed by the world hard?
While Ogino is still innocent:she only works and doesn't care about money. Everything she does is derived from her heart:bathing ''Stink Spirit,''helping No Face, and saving Haku.
Probably we might introspect ourselves:what we have swallowed in this world? Only vomiting the things like what No Face has done, we would be as clean as a mirror....<br/><br/>02
Seeking
Ogino who works hard is distributed to the worst place in the bathhouse and has to welcome the most horrible guest-Stink Spirit.
No one wants to get close except goofy Ogino. -Though she is scared to paralysis at first, she still takes him to the bathroom.
This is the key of growth-facing the fear itself bravely. The others are not brave enough, so they are ''Sen'' instead of ''Ogino.''Only the bravery can bring hope at this urgent moment.
The wound is the place where the light enters you.
Ogino moves slowly along the bath pool with innocence. She accidentally falls down while finds the secret while being held by River Spirit- a bike stuck in.
The bike appears frequently in our dreams;it can represent our body, our mind, while it represents finding what we originally be there.-This bike is the source of every filth, while the filth mixed with each other is our own complexes.
The bike is the key point-everyone pulls off it together and cleanse everything filthy taken with it, and then the Stink Spirit becomes grave and great River Spirit.
Similarly, No Face can become originally innocent after vomiting everything he shouldn't swallow:materialistic appetite and those stink psychological rubbish....
So does Haku, who intakes a half of the pill and spits the things which he chases and which controls him. And finally, he becomes a human in figure.
Either the stink Stink Spirit or horrific No Face or seemingly powerful Haku, they are actually beautiful and clean after striping off the filth.<br/><br/>03
Finding
Ogino does something honorable there:she apologizes in behalf of Haku and returns the
amulet stealed by Haku.
She takes the train with No Face, the ''fly,'' and the ''mouse '' on the way of the return.
They finally arrive at the thatched while tranquil house and see Zeniba who looks similar to her sister.
Yubaba lives at the top of the building and is surrounded with wealth, while Zeniba lives in the happiest thatched house, knits a hair tie for ogino with the help of little''mouse'' and No Face.
One takes away Ogino's name, while the other directs Ogino to find Haku ' s name.
One makes a deal, while the other gives away.
Ogino apologizes in behalf of Haku -this is an important step to the growth:taking responsibility.
From depending on greedy Yubaba to loving industrial Zeniba, Ogino is no longer controlled by Yubaba while she attaches to kind and warm-hearted Zeniba.
When flying with Haku, she also remembers her lost memory:
''Listen Haku..., your true name is.... ''
''You did it, Chihiro! I remember! I was the spirit of the Kohaku River.... ''
Suddenly the scales of the dragon are scattered away in the sky, turning into a smiling smart man....
They hold each other's hands in the sky.... It is a charming story.
Ogino comes back to the bathhouse and undoes the last puzzle successfully:her parents have come to worldly world.
Then she says farewell to the others,especially to Haku, and has to go back without turning back. Though she has strong predisposition
to turn back, she still follows want Haku has said, because she knows:after that might-be turn, she might never come back....
In the end, it is only left the two people's hands which were shaken while loosen finally. I guess they will shake, they will,
they will....
Ogino finishes her journey in that world. But where we are now?"

","Whenever i visit any new place, my mind usually wanders away in things like history, food, culture. I try to connect with it in order to truly understand and appreciate it. Its like a journey which is material but also borders on the spiritual, and i am always lost in it. That is exactly the feeling whenever i watch spirited away.
This is a sense of wonder experiencing chihiros journey, to the point where you feel that you are chihiro. The movie keeps its sense of mystery throughout; chihiro knows as much about the world as you do. She struggles in a way you would if you swapped places with her; the world is fascinating and dangerous. There is symbolism scattered throughout, but its never handed out on a platter. What you take away from spirited away depends on what you interpret from it, and everyone will have a different interpretation.
I'm watching it in 2020 and the visuals still do not feel dated. This is a vivid world which expresses itself with almost the entire palette of colors available to it, and it marvels at how spellbound it will leave you. The animations also hold up very well. The art is legendary. Clearly they have a world class team behind the wheels, and the complement the directly very well.
I'll end it with the direction. There is absolutely no director alive who pours his/her heart and soul into making an animated movie like Hayao Miyazaki. And he is absolutely on point with Spirited Away. The story never drags, never has a dull moment, and keeps you hooked even while you marvel at the animation and the art. The characters are different, morally gray and have unique idiosyncrasies which immediately distinguishes them from anything the west has ever come up with. Spirited Away is a landmark movie in the world of animation and has definitely had an impact on anything that came after. Pixar has made some classics, but even today Spirited Away can stand in a league of its own, and that's saying a lot about it."

While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves.

","Spirited Away is, of course, a big experience to evertyone who wants to know the process between chidhood and adulthood/amadureciment. The film express this theme thought Chihiro, the main agent of this process, who doesnt have the perspective of the adult age, like a psychology book about chilhood, but the movie shows the consequences of this transition thought the own children.
Chihiro is showed in the beginning like a spoiled girl that all time is complaining about everything and everybody. She complain about the fact her are going to other city and about the fact her flower are dying (this is her responsability). In this first half of movie, Chihiro is, basically, a girl who have fight with whole the world about little things. With the happening of the story, when this parents are transformate in pigs and the region of restaurants started to be invades by ghost and sobrenatural criatures, the world had the effort to challenge Chihiro to get out of this situation, and this is one of the mensages of the movie: The world is a place that is indiferent or againt you.
To survive, Chihiro need to work in this sobrenatural society, a society that have a big obssession for gold. In this little information, is possible to compare with the capitalist real world about work and greed, for example Yubaba, the society's leader who's appear in movie like a authoritarian person. Yubaba, who's represent the boss, the politic and all of people who's only see money, shows her insanity when she ""take"" Chihiro's name, removing some letters in kanji (japanese writing) e transforme it in ""Sen"". The name ""Chihiro"" is formated by ""thousand"" and ""search"" kanjis, representing the person who's is big, numerally, but ""Sen"", name imposted by Yubaba, is formated only by ""thousand"" kanji, transforming Chihiro in a number. However, the most interesting about Yubaba is, not necessary, she is retrated like a bad character even have some characteristics of ocidental animations villains, like Disney. In some moments, she helps the people in some hard works in the bathroom, like in the ""stink spirit""(Kawa no Kami)'s incident, when she motivate Chihiro/Sen to serve the customer. An antagonist building that isn't totally bad distance of cliches animation and transforme Yubaba in a more humanizate character.
When it's know all dificulties that fight in this journey, important to her ripening that isn't ""opost to chilhood"" in any moment, many elements appear in movie, main in the second half, represent the memorie and the nostalgia of chilhood not valorized by Chihiro in the benning. The hair tie gived by Zeniba (Yubaba's sister) and stitched by No-Face (Bandai-Gaeru) is one of this elements. This Tie, that according to Zeniba can protect Chihiro of all bad things, transforme the material object, liked to polit in the capitalist world, in a emotional object, when, in this topic, express the emotional value of the things and not only the finantial value is part of individual ripening.
Spirited Away is one of the best Hayao Miyazaki's movies. Chihiro is not a passive agent that only see the world happen in your life, that is the form to represent the childhood in many times, but a ative agent who can build new thing in the world and suffers the consequences of his actions because the child is part of the world too. Like say the song of the brazilin poet and composer Arnaldo Antunes: ""Everybody was child yet, Einstein, Freud and Plato too/Hitler, Bush and Saddam Hussei/Who have money and who doesn't have"""

They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more.

In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax.

","Writing a review for this film immediately made me think of how many superlatives I know because Studio Ghibli's ""Spirited Away"" is as close to a masterpiece you can come. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film combines elements from Japanese folklore and tradition in the story of a young girl named Chihiro who needs to fulfill various quests to leave the spirit world she entered. With her parents turned into pigs, she starts working at a bathhouse owned by the witch Yubaba, and from here, the fantasy cavalcade is started. We get acquainted with all sorts of imaginative creatures in this vivid, colorful, dreamy piece of film magic. ""Spirited Away"" covers several themes during its 2-hour run; as Chihiro mature during her adventures, the film is much more than a coming-of-age story. It deals with greed through characters such as Yubaba and No-Face, with the latter being a symbol of how others can affect a person. A great deal of environmentalism comment is present throughout the film as well, delicately represented through the Stink Spirit as well as Haku, a former river spirit who has no recollection of his true self. In ""Spirited Away"", identity plays a large part for the plot, perhaps most effectively manifested by Chihiro being given the name Sen, and secretly keeps a ticket with her real name on it so she won't forget who she truly is. Other subjects are also dealt with and ""Spirited Away"" could be discussed for hours. Miyazaki has created a smart, entertaining, touching, film through ""Spirited Away"". While the message of the film, I believe, is to always remember who you are, I don't think anyone can watch this beautiful film without being baffled by its sheer brilliance. That is why ""Spirited Away"" is, arguably, the best animated film in movie history."

","Innocence is valuable because it is not stubborn, or persistent, changed by the external environment. The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful and feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart."

","VERY LIGHT SPOILERS
Although reading this will NOT ruin movie for you at all.<br/><br/>I really liked pretty much every aspect of this movie. First of all the animation and imagination in this movie is just great. Besides a few instances of CGI that didn't really fit, the film was consistently beautiful to look at even when what they were animating was made to look ugly. And this is easily one of the most imaginative movies I've ever seen. Easily at and probably above the Pixar level. And the characters also had me very invested. Chihiro and Haku were just great to watch. At first I didn't really buy the kinda romance they had, but by the end it completely worked. And the side characters were great to. Kamaji, Lin, No Face, Yubaba & Zeniba, all of them are a lot of fun in their own ways. Although I wish that No Face's motivations were made more clear. Maybe I missed something, or maybe that wasn't the point. Both are possible. And one random thing I noticed is that Scott Cawthon almost definitely ripped of The Puppet/Marionette's design from No Face for his FNAF games. They are extremely similar in regards to the design of their masks. Anyways, the story itself is pretty straight forward, but that definitely works to the movie's advantage. It allows us to not become confused and just soak in this amazing and interesting world that has been created. Although I would say that the movie starts off a little slow. I'd say about the first 1/3 of the movie is just good, but it's completely made up for by the other 2/3 of the movie which are simply fantastic.<br/><br/>EDIT A FEW DAYS LATER:
I can't stop thinking about this movie. It only keeps growing on me. There's so much I don't know about it. As in I can't quite tell what the message of the movie is but that just makes me love it even more. There's so much being said here that is going over my head, and that's very exiting to me. I need to rewatch this when I get the time. This movie has affected me in a way that very few other movies, or shows, or books, or even songs ever have. This movie gets a 98%."

The people involved in projects of this size are just incredible. They have great patience to make each painting by hand. The story is very well written and the protagonist's journey is well developed and very noticeable from the ways that she demonstrates throughout the journey. The characters have charisma and are very original in their own constructions. The world in which the entire film is set is so rich in mythology that we ask several questions, but the film is under no obligation to answer them and this is very pleasant because it makes it full of possibilities. It is a story with a beginning, middle and end, but with short pauses that make us breathe at the right time and make us reflect on the previous event. It's amazing how you identify with the character and that is because she is like us. And because of that fact, we grew up with it. (How nice to see Chihiro's growth.)"

","'Spirited Away (2001)' is a constant visual treat, its surrealist and often disturbing imagery taking dominance over its whimsical and rule-free narrative. Most of the picture is beguilingly beautiful, charming in an odd yet distinct way. It moves at a good pace and is always enjoyable, presenting a number of interesting set-pieces after it has established its fantastical story. Indeed, this is where most of its time is spent; its overarching plot isn't as important as you might expect it to be. It has a number of inconsistencies, particularly when it comes to a specific character, and it kind of loses its way in the third act, taking a rather strange detour before wrapping up extremely quickly. Still, the flick is entertaining even at its worst. It's almost always stunning to look at, too. It just has this almost unidentifiable charm to it. Its narrative isn't exactly complex, but it's a lot of fun. 7/10"

I saw the making documentary of it aswell and just how much work was put into it aswell as the race against the deadline at the end of the production period.<br/><br/>From what I saw, the studio and staff itself looked very friendly and creative. Easygoing but also focussed and determined when it came to finishing one of Miyazaki's projects.

","I have watched it two times.<br/><br/>The first on, I rented at the library, because I received good review about it. I had high expectations since I also watched Princess Mononoke a week before, and I was totally charmed by the original and audacious writing of Miyazaki.<br/><br/>This movies goes deeper than you can think of, it is a Japanese fairy tale indeed, but the characters have complex feelings, the better ssociation that I can make is for Yubaba. At first, you think that she is the archetypal vilain, but as the story goes on she is more like an Anti-Villain, and you learn that she have motivations for her actions, she want to protect her world, and the spirits, she is opposed to Chihiro only because, she have no choice, this is why you make some comparisons between her and Dr. Zaius from The Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this film adresses mature themes like the life, I can only cit the scene where Chihiro travel with the spirits in a train while we see the
landscapes to succeed to each another, and we see some spirits leave the train while no one his coming in, has a kid you can't understand these references, but they are still there to make to more mature public think and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>The second time it was with my students, the movie kept all his magic after that second views, and you can finally appreciate the message hidden in it that could have been hard to catch at the first time, you will enjoy even more the details that Miyazaki carried to the animation, the lights, the facials expressions. Somehow, you find somethings in Miyazaki's works that is inexplicable, but you can feel it.<br/><br/>Finally, it is obvious that this movie helped to increase the popularity of Japanese cinema and anime when it won his first Oscar, and it was really important because as we know anime are now very influential in arts."

","Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a story of Chihiro, a young girl moving to a new town with her parents, who gets trapped in the realm of spirits when she and her parents explore an abandoned holiday resort. There she must learn to cope with hostile beings, unexplained rules and the fact that her parents have been cursed into pigs for their crimes.<br/><br/>The film has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and there's a lot of truth to that. Chihiro and Alice are rather alike in their general demeanour and character. Chihiro is a bit more sullen, whereas Alice takes it all a bit more in stride. You definitely feel like Chihiro is in more danger throughout the film. But both Wonderland and the spirit bathhouse operate using logic not belonging to the human realm.<br/><br/>And that's one of the best things about this film. Its world is a strange one and there's always a new surprise around the corner. But for some reason it all makes sense. Like there's this scene where Chihiro and Haku, her new protector, have to cross a bridge and he tells her to hold her breath or she'll get noticed. Does that objectively make any sense? No, but in that instance it's completely logical. You just get it. Holding your breath makes you invisible to spirits. Makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>And the whole movie is like that. Apparently Miyazaki got his inspiration for the film by watching his young nieces and other relatives playing around. Which makes a lot of sense if you've seen the film. It is internally consistent and you always feel like its following rules. But they're the rules of a child's imagination.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's gorgeously animated, very well voice acted, with fantastic characters, songs, ideas and locations. It's a movie that you could play on mute and it'd still be one of the best movies you've ever seen. Likewise if you only heard it playing from another room. It's both child-like and surprisingly mature at the same time. Most character start out scary, alien and a bit threatening, but quite a lot of them have become your friends by the end of it.<br/><br/>My personal favourite. One of the few films I'd call perfect. Please, if you're ever going to see even one Japanese animated film, makes it this one."

"truongthh","10","0","0","24 December 2019"," The best animated film I've ever seen
","I have only been watching anime recently, and to be honest, Studio Ghibli films aren't as impressive as most anime said ( this is my opinion) Except for Princess Mononoke, other films like My neighbor Totoro or The Wind Rises didn't impress me that much. I prefer films by Mamoru Hosoda or Makoto Shinkai. But Spirited Away just blew me away and made me understand why Ghibli is the best anime studio of all time.<br/><br/>First of all, this is just a gorgeous looking anime. I seriously think it's better looking than some modern day animes. And to think that this picture-like film was hand drawn instead of being computer-animated it's just incredible. I don't think any Pixar film can even come close to Spirited Away's beauty.
The story was great. Often times some animes may not be enjoyable to children because of their complex plot ( adults may not even get it) but not this one. Surely it's far from a simple plot, but it's clear enough and has enough humor for kids to enjoy. And the most impressive thing is that behind all the incredible imagination from the director and writers lies a very meaningful message about society. Remember this film is nearly 20 years old, but its message is still true to this day.
The characters are amazing. If there's anything I love most about animes it's the characters. Japanese animators always know how to create characters that we adore so much but at the same time relate to them. Spirited Away is filled with wacky monsters and creatures, but I see so much human in those beings. Yubaba was a standout for me. Hayao Miyazaki may have some of the craziest imagination in the world, but he's a genius in bringing the human side into any character he comes up with.
There are a trillion things to say about this film (the score for example) but since this is a non-spoiler review, I think I wanna stop here.<br/><br/>So to sum up, Spirited Away is not only the best anime I've seen but also the best animated film of all time. Heck it's probably one of the best films of all time. I highly recommend this to anime fans. Even if you are not a fan, I think this film may get you into anime. Absolutely 10 out of 10"

","This is the greatest work of animation I've ever seen, better than all the 3D computer-animated movies which are the norm these days. I've seen 10 of Hayao Miyazaki's films, and Spirited Away is undoubtedly my favorite of his, with Kiki's Delivery Service being a close second. It's a shame most Americans think that cartoons are just children's media rather than an alternative style in film-making, because Spirited Away is not your typical Disney/Pixar/DreamWorks feature.<br/><br/>Even though the protagonist, Chihiro, is a 10-year-old girl, this is not just a movie for preteen girls. In fact, I would be cautious showing this movie to children under the age of 8 or 9, because Spirited Away is not a very easy film to grasp with all its symbolism and themes, and it can be a bit frightening. It's a coming-of-age story filled with many relevant themes that even adults would relate to, like environmentalism, greed, materialism, exploitation, the clash between tradition and modernity, identity, self-sacrifice and so on. In my perspective, the movie is crafted in a way that gives viewers a chance to ponder and reflect on their own lives, and the world we live in.<br/><br/>Spirited Away serves as Miyazaki's social criticism of modern Japan, when the country experienced unprecedented success during the bubble economy of the 1980s, and then a terrible recession in the subsequent ""Lost Decade"" of the 1990s. Since this movie was made in 2001, all the aforementioned events were still recent and fresh in the memories of the Japanese. It's perhaps no wonder why Spirited Away is Japan's most financially successful movie of all-time. Nevertheless, Western viewers won't have trouble with connecting to this movie as we too live in a consumer economy dominated by greed and self-indulgence. Just look at Black Friday as an example.<br/><br/>What I particularly like about this movie is how different it is from Disney. Spirited Away is more down to earth. The film is not a musical where everyone starts singing at random moments, and the characters are more lifelike. The absence of a stereotypical protagonist and villain really strengthens this movie. Additionally, there is no juvenile humor that plagues so many Disney and Marvel movies made in this century. One of the things I could never stand about Disney is its portrayal of female characters, who are typically one-dimensional damsels in distress (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, etc.) incapable of helping themselves without a Prince Charming figure. Basically, the role of a Disney princess, or any heroine, is to be pretty. Thankfully, Spirited Away doesn't fall for that clichÃ© and shows Chihiro as a strong character who matures throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Despite my general distaste for Disney, they did a very good job with dubbing the movie into English. Some people will say that the only way to watch Spirited Away is in Japanese with the subtitles turned on, but I strongly recommend giving the English dub a chance, at least for first-time viewing. For a hand-drawn animation, the visuals are so impressive and mind-blowing, you will miss out on many details if you focus your attention on reading subtitles. However, I've also seen Spirited Away dubbed in German and Japanese, and I think those language versions are slightly better, at least when it comes to Chihiro's voice, who's more shouty and high-pitched in the English dub.<br/><br/>Altogether, I couldn't recommend this movie highly enough. The storytelling is very captivating and the visuals are so wonderful you will forget that this is a 2 hour movie. I've already seen this movie 4 times this year, and it never bores me. The pacing is ingenious, with sequences of action and intensity nestled between moments of peace and solitude. The musical score done by Joe Hisaishi is also beautiful. I liked the soundtrack so much I bought the CD. This gem of a movie fully deserves the Oscar it won at the 2003 Academy Awards. Much like the title, this masterpiece will spirit you away."

","As you probably know by now, Spirited Away stands the test of time as one of the most influential animated films in modern cinema, and is seen by many as a classic. There isn't too much to be said about this movie that hasn't been said.<br/><br/>Of course, the plot starts with a young girl named Chihiro, who wanders into a secret world ruled by spirits, beasts, and witches, and gets separated from her parents, and must go through a variety of events in order to return home.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is a master of his work, creating some of the most beautiful and mesmerizing shots put to anime, with an incredible score, while establishing a plot that both children and adults can enjoy and be able to follow. All while the voice acting in both the original and English dub are both pretty great.<br/><br/>Another thing I wanted to note is the impact this movie has had since it's release. It's influence has caused Disney to help get the film released in the United States, as well as being the only Anime film to ever win an Oscar to this day. I was lucky enough to see the film today in theaters, and 18 years later, this film is STILL selling out theaters, and causing the audience to laugh and cry. It is that impactful. The film has truly stands the test of time, and is one of my favorite movies of all time."

This film has such a flow that you can immerse in it in the very beginning and forget about everything else.<br/><br/>The narrative is so unique and original, it creates a wonderful mythical world with various creatures, such as gods, witches and spirits and its also touchy sometimes.

"iguth","8","0","0","5 May 2019"," Classic
","Spirited Away is an adventure. As Miyazaki's possibly most well known film, it serves as a jumping off point for most fans and does so in the most exciting way. The whole movie has a very colorful art style which perfectly mimics all of the colorful characters that our protagonist interacts with. She is able to build meaningful relationships with people that just want to help her or don't even talk. There are many smaller plots scattered throughout to show our leading lady's struggle and since each of these subplots have their own ups and downs you stay engaged at all times. Overall Spirited Away does what most Miyazaki films do which is transport the audience into a world that seems incredibly fantastic in comparison to our own. You feel real emotion and a lot of the plot holds a deeper meaning (so much so that I don't understand most)."

"andrewroy-04316","7","0","0","18 March 2019"," A beautiful work of art and symbolic film, but especially the third act doesn't provide satisfying answers
","Spirited Away is both a beautiful to watch animated movie and gives the viewer plenty of ideas and symbols to ponder, but the story itself and particularly its conclusions left me ready to move on. I have the utmost respect for animation studios and Studio Ghibli after watching Spirited Away. Miyazaki puts in so many small visual details that immerse you in the spirit world and make it so much more realistic. In terms of the story itself, I found it inconsistent. There are plenty of great themes and ideas to consider, the two that stood out most to me being greed vs kindness in the characters, and the older, more naturalistic mindset clashing with the materialistic, capitalistic modern mindset. Chihiro is a fun protagonist who avoids one-dimensionality, having both a multifaceted personality and an arc that significantly shows her character develop throughout.
Where the story broke down for me was in several of the plot events and details of the world. Simply put, I found the ending to be deus ex machina and an overly simplistic and easy way to solve what had seemed like big, complex challenges. I didn't buy her sudden love with Haku and the way their relationship transitioned from a caring friendship to quite committed love. I also didn't find the addition of Yubaba's twin to make any sense, she felt like a superfluous character added in as a weird twist. The way she got her parents back felt completely absurd and was when I accepted that it just isn't a great movie. In addition to these and other plot frustrations, maybe it was an intentional choice to make the spirit world feel whimsical and ambiguous, but the lack of clarity in how the world functions limited my enjoyment. Are all of them spirits? How many of them are being held there against their will (like Haku)? What is the true motivation of all the spirits? How do the spirits interact with the physical world, and how do their transformations and magical powers work? I found many underlying workings of the spirit world to be unclear in addition to plot points that were either contrived or superfluous. I definitely enjoyed watching it and I do like the consistent, immersive feel of the movie from a young girl discovering this wild world perspective, but the exposition and later plot events didn't completely satisfy me."

The cons of taking such a path is that the characters are severely disconnected from the viewers.

Now Chihiro most always remember her name so she would not forget she is a human and be able to tell her parents apart from the pigs all this with her trying to find her way back to her world.<br/><br/>Spirited away is based on Miyazaki friend's ten year old daughter, he decided to make a movie for her and her friends who come for vacation in his cabin with his family.<br/><br/>With the characters mostly hand drawn and a budget of $19 million dollars, Miyazaki and his production crew decided to keep the graphics simple so that the focus of the movie will not be diverted from the story.<br/><br/>The English adaptation of the film was done by Walt Disney Pictures under the supervision of Pixar animator John Lasseter; also on the production crew was Beauty and the Beast (1991) co-director Kirk Wise who acted as the director in this English adaptation and Aladdin (1992) producer Donald W. Ernst who was also the producer in this flick.<br/><br/>I still stand to say this is one of the best animations out there, the fantasy level is high and the twist and turns that it brings makes the whole movie very interesting and a nice movie to see with the family.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","Spirited away is (and will always be) an instant classic that everyone one should see before they die. The detail in the painting was beautiful,the voice acting was top notch and the story to it was amazing. My favorite part in it had to be to see the little girl (Sorry I can't remember her or any chinease names.) was running around looking for her parents and in the background all the spirits started coming out. Also this is not gonna mess the rating up but I should let you all know so that if you have a little one who gets scared easily that theirs this black creature spirit that ate some people in the movie (it wasn't graphic)and started acting crazy and running around the bath haus. But I still give the movie 10/10 stars! ☺"

","As an English viewer, I can't bring any oriental appreciations to a viewing of Spirited Away: my lifetime of English experiences make Spirited Away an even more alien experience than it is for a native Japanese audience.<br/><br/>But I think it is supposed to be disorienting. This odd story of little Chihiro, uprooted from her familiar neighbourhood by her parents moving, and then finding herself in a bathhouse populated by spirits, creatures, ghosts and so on following her parents turning into pigs... well, it's a long way from Disney (even if one of the characters in the US adaptation is voiced by Susan Egan, Megara in Disney's Hercules).<br/><br/>This superb movie is imaginative, unsettling, visually entrancing, involving and, ultimately, moving.<br/><br/>Any animation fan should make an effort to catch it."

","I think Hayao Miyazaki's movies are very interesting. I especially like Spirited Away. I have three reasons. First, in this film,many characters are very unique. They have finely individual characters. Second,this film gives a very good picture of familial love. Sen makes efforts to help her parents. Finally, this film shows us the energy to go on living. When an ordinary girl enter this strange world, she displays her hidden power.

","This is a nice fantasy story. The high point here is creativity. The main plot's elements don't make much sense, but they are coherent between themselves. It's like a dream, where things obey the dream logic, but don't obey real-world logic. This also highlights the human characteristics of the main character.<br/><br/>Like many Japanese stories, this movie contains a lot of story for just 2 hours. It's not a boring movie; it has a long, complete story. The adventures of Chihiro are told in a good pace, we can follow it without getting bored. The personality of the various supporting characters are revealed as time passes, and Chihiro is an open-minded child, whose lack of prejudice makes her see the characters as they are, and therefore help the world she is in.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is very good. Full of colours, they vary according to each moment's mood, adding to the storytelling. The soundtrack also agrees with the scenes. The drawing is very good, like all Miyazakis.<br/><br/>One of the greatest accomplishments of this movie is that it appeals to most audiences, from the most thought-demanding to the less. When you analyze it, you can see many messages and information; on the other hand, if you're not like that, you can just sit back and enjoy the little nice fantastic story."

","Spirited Away is one of my best movie that I saw. It was made in 2001 in Japan. It is called Sen to chihiro no kamikakushi in Japanese.This movie was written by Hayao Miyazaki who is one of the famous writer in Japan, but recently he is known all over the world. His studio Ghibli warms people's heart very much.<br/><br/>The main character in this movie is Chihiro. The story begins in the car. Chihiro is moving to the new house with her parents. On the way to the new house, there was a traffic jam so her father plan to shortcut between the forest. Then there was a tunnel. They get off the car and pass the tunnel, next there was a long path so they pass it again. After that, there were some opening-restaurants. Chihiro's parents were hungry so they start to eat, but she didn't eat. She roam around and noticed that something is strange in that place because faceless spirits are walking around as night falls. She suddenly go back to her parents place but it was late. Her parents changed to pigs. She run to the path and cried. Then a boy named Haku found her. Haku promise her to help her. He suggest to go to the strange big building to work. That building is a bathhouse for Japan's spirits and gods. Everything were strange there to Chihiro but she keeps searching the mysterious why her parents changed and how can she help them. Do you think she can find the way home....?<br/><br/>This movie is a kind of family, fantasy and adventure story. It tells us how valuable is to help your important person. If you like a heart warming movie I really recommend you to watch it. Well...it's a little childish movie so maybe it sometimes make you boring. If you watched this in a different language instead of Japanese, I want you to watch it again in subtittled because you can feel more reality! You must watch it once."

"griffolyon12","10","0","0","28 July 2009"," One of the Finest Fantasy Adventures Ever Made!
","This film might possibly be Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece. While it may not be as epic in scope as Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away seems to be the most personal film in which Miyazaki has made thus far. That is why I think Spirited Away might just be his greatest work.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is the story of a young girl named Chihiro. Chihiro and her family are moving to a new town when they get lost and venture into what they think is an abandoned theme park, which later turns out to be a literal ghost town. As night falls Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs, spirits appear, and Chihiro is whisked away to a big bathhouse for the spirits. Here she goes to work for the sorceress who runs the place in hopes of freeing her parents and returning them to normal.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a very touching film. Deep, thought provoking, but also highly emotional. It has all of Miyazaki's trademark touches. The film has humor, heart, and not to mention some breathtaking fantasy. The reason why this is possibly his best work is simply because it achieves a poignancy that none of his other films have done for me.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a film about growing up, discovering the courage within yourself, and becoming someone who can truly make a difference in this world. It is a highly optimistic film that in the end has a very happy, albeit bittersweet ending. We feel for Chihiro. We laugh when she laughs, we cry when she cries, and we are happy when she shows happiness. It is thanks to this connection with the main character that makes this film a genuine knockout and makes it linger in your memory forever.<br/><br/>Here Miyazaki tackles themes that many live action filmmakers would never dare touch. But Miyazaki never beats the viewer over the head with a baseball bat, he subtly introduces these themes and weaves them into the story. This I think is Miyazaki's special touch, as this is something that he has done in nearly all of his films, but this one in particular just feels more personal. Perhaps Miyazaki finally realized all these themes to his heart's content with this film? We'll never know for we aren't Miyazaki himself, but the themes of this film speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Though Spirited Away is not just a deep, thought provoking art film, it happens to be a highly entertaining fantasy adventure. The scene with the Stink Spirit, or when Chihiro is chased by No Face are authentic set pieces that are exquisitely realized and are a thrill to watch. As well the film looks gorgeous. This is the most beautiful animated film I have ever seen. It's colors are vibrant, the animation fluid, and the world jam-packed with detail. Huge props go to all the artists involved in making this movie.<br/><br/>Overall Spirited Away is a very touching film, one that will stay with you long after it's over. It's a film that some may never come to appreciate, but for those who do they'll be implanted within their own imaginations and whisked away by this film.<br/><br/>I give Spirited Away a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","Spirited Away {dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 2002} <br/><br/>****/**** <br/><br/>This is the first Miyazaki I've seen, and suffice to say the man made one hell of a first impression! The story is equal parts Wonderland and Oz, also incorporating numerous tropes of classic fantasy. Yet the story and the entire film feel unusual in their completeness, in their immersive quality and breathtaking majesty. Visually, this is one of the finest films of the decade. A great move rich with characters, ideas and most importantly life. Each frame of this picture jumps off the screen and inhabits the viewer's subconscious, imprinting images that will last for a lifetime. It contains rich characters, an enchanting and slightly off center world, along with a thankful lack of moralizing. Like the best childhood parables, Spirited Away has the capacity to frighten, enchant, and most importantly entertain audiences from any culture in any language."

","I watched ""Princess Mononoke"" quite some time ago and found it to be just okay, albeit a tad bit disappointing. I have heard so many wonderful things about ""Spirited Away"", including all the buzz surrounding it following the 75th Academy Awards, so I came in with rather lofty expectations. It did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite simple. It follows a young girl's transformation from a self-obsessed and spoiled figure to a selfless and understanding individual. The plot is ordinary, yet it defies every single Disney or Pixar stereotype. It is captivating, and while Miyazaki is an absolute genius with almost all of his films, this is perhaps his best work. The protagonists, Chihiro and Haku, are both extremely likable, and while the film is categorized as being a part of the Adventure and Fantasy genres, there are humorous, serious, and even tender moments.<br/><br/>The animation is very good. It is not at all like that of companies such as Disney and Pixar. The animation in this film is different. In a good way. Miyazaki is brilliant in how he is able to include such relevant social commentary in the context of the film. He doesn't shove anything in the viewers face, but there are underlying actions and themes that suggest that what humans are doing to the environment may soon be irreversible and that one day when nature turns its back on us, it is a result of our doing."

","Note: This is a review I've already posted on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>When we think of our choices of great filmmakers, the names that come to mind are mostly Cinematic geniuses like Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Cappola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Akira Kurosawa, Peter Jackson, Stanley Kubrick and would even consider Clerks' director Kevin Smith as one those great filmmakers. However all of the mentioned above along with others not mentioned, are directors of live action, when we discuss great filmmakers of Animation, we usually mention a few like Walt Disney or Chuck Jones. However the one who truly deserves to labeled a Cinematic as well as Animated genius is none other than Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki's animated classic and Oscar winner ""Spirited Away"" is definitely a triumph of both imagination and storytelling as well as being possibly the ""Greatest"" Achievement of Animation to ever be created....... So far...<br/><br/>Kind of an Eastern mixing of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz, the movie tells the tale of a young girl, whose trip with her parents down an unusual was just the beginning of a mystical and unimaginable journey through a world possibly found in Japanese Mythology.<br/><br/>The animation is really jaw dropping, some of the most beautifully made animated scenes to ever be shown on the big screen. The story is also enchanted with a plot possibly beyond imagination. The characters are also well developed.<br/><br/>Although those who would fully appreciate the film would definitely have considerable knowledge in Japanese Mythology, the film can still be enjoyed by both fans of Animation and Cinema as well.

","This animated feature is probably the best I've ever seen, actually It's one of my best favorite movies of all time. My whole family love this movie. I think that this is the masterpiece of all Miyazaki's (needless to say that most, if not all, of his movies are great as well). This movie is full with fantasies and Japanese themes and culture. If you like stories that contain spirits and weird looking creatures then you will definitely like this movie. The feeling I got while watching this reminds me of the same feelings I got when I used to watch the Moomins back when I was a kid. Although almost every one I know loved Spirited Away, there are a few who found it to be boring, maybe it's because they are used to watching Disney animations. Well, it's true this is nothing like Disney, but I have to say that this is far much better than any Disney movie that I have seen (I'm a big Disney fan as well,so don't get me wrong) or at least It's so different than anything you've seen."
"varundelpiero","10","0","0","21 October 2008"," Fantastic animated adventure at its most compelling and heartwarming...
","I'll start off with a little confession: I am NOT a big fan of Japanese anime. The good ones are much too hard to find and always seem to be lost within a huge cluttered mass of cheesy garbage. You'll see about 100 lame ones before you manage to find a true gem. My favourite has always been COWBOY BEBOP, but even then I haven't followed the entire series. Additionally, I am NOT a big fan of animated movies. They always seem a bit too predictable, as if they cater specifically to certain viewers. In the end animated movies (especially of the Disney variety) seem only interested in box office numbers, and they continually insult the intelligence of their viewers.<br/><br/>I've long heard of Hayao Miyazaki's legendary status in Japan by a few trustworthy friends of mine, and my relative distaste of animated movies has resulted in me waiting a full 7 years before procuring a copy of SPIRITED AWAY. I tried to get my hands on the original Japanese copy with English subtitles but could only manage the more available dubbed copy. I was initially fearful that the dubbing would be embarrassingly poor (like most Japanese to English dubs) but I was somewhat mistaken. The voices actually fit in pretty well. The only real complaint is that the protagonist starts to get annoying after a while, if only sporadically so.<br/><br/>But let's shift gears and focus on the good, and there is no shortage of that here. First off, the animation is simply breathtaking. I heard about Miyazaki before but really wasn't expecting anything quite as visually satisfying as this. Every detail is accounted for, and the rain sequences are especially beautiful. The scenic shots have an epic eeriness to them, and are simply stunning. Anyone who hasn't seen Miyazaki's work before will be mesmerised. It has been said that he is somewhat meticulous, and this comes off strongly in his animation. Studio Ghibli rivals Disney and Pixar any day for me, and it is worth noting that most of the animation is done traditionally, with very few computer-enhanced effects. Some digitising is done only to finish up the product.<br/><br/>Another category in which Miyazaki trumps Disney is the storytelling. Miyazaki presents a beautiful and intertwined story with many surprising plot twists, all of which are believable and don't seem like they just come 'out of the blue'. The story itself is a beautiful one about friendship and love that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy , but that's only on the surface. Beneath the main storyline are some strong hidden messages which many may not get, for instance, Miyazaki, being a strong environmentalist like myself, sends little messages speaking to humanity's destruction/pollution of their living environment, and this is especially evident in one beautiful scene. Unlike Disney, Miyazaki doesn't give the viewers emotional 'cues'. He does not tell you when you should laugh and when you should cry. This is all left to the viewer to decide. Indeed, not enough can be said for the engrossing story, and at the end you will try to remember the last time 2 hours went by so quickly.<br/><br/>The music is also superb. From the opening sequence straight to the ending credits, the viewer is greeted by lovely moving pieces of well-orchestrated music which blend well with the story (yes, real music). This only adds to the whole experience, and helps make the move feels REAL and lifelike. You will find yourself actually having FEELINGS during this movie, and genuine ones too; not the fabricated ones that you get from the Western animated movies. You will laugh aloud. You will cry real tears. And at the end you will understand why Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli are thought of much more highly than Disney and Pixar, especially by those mature enough to appreciate the differences.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend seeing this one. It was my first Miyazaki film experience, and my only regret is that I waited this long to see it. I am now in the process of trying to obtain HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE...<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. May just fall short of my Top 100, at about 103 or so."

","A 10 year old girl Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town, when they get lost on the way. They arrive to what seems to be an empty amusement park in where they find tables filled with delicious food, even when there seems to be not a soul around. Greed possesses both mom and dad and they start to eat from the tables. Sadly, it turns out that the amusement park is actually a gateway to another dimension, and the food was meant for many Gods and spirits who dwell there. A powerful witch Yubaba transforms Chihiro's parents to pigs. To save herself and her parents, Chihiro starts to work in Yubaba's bathhouse. There she meets a young dragon-boy Haku, a big sister like Lin and a strange spirit called No-Face who starts to stalk Chihiro.<br/><br/>After the success of his masterpiece ""Princess Mononoke"", Hayao Miyazaki planned to retire from animation business. Thank God, some quality time with family persuaded Miyazaki to return to Studio Ghibli and make this, his second masterpiece, and in my opinion his best film. ""Spirited Away"" (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, 2001) is the most visually amazing, imaginative and heart warming animation I have ever seen (and should definitely have a place in Top 10 Best Fantasy films ever- list). Not only is this, again in my opinion, best Miyazaki film, it is also best Ghibli film and, if not the best, one of the best animations ever made. This film shows more imaginative story telling and detailed characters than all the Star Wars films together. Miyazaki's regular composer, Joe Hisaishi, also deserves special mentioning. Although his music has always been perfect for Miyazaki's earlier films, I really think that he too reached completely new levels here. From the simplest piano notes to the full orchestra symphony, Hisaishi creates some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard inwell, anywhere really.<br/><br/>Not only visually fantastic, the movie also manages to keep a very clear plot together and create actually characters viewer truly cares about. Chihiro, despite her rather fantastic surroundings, appears as a very realistic little girl. She is incredibly clumsy at times (I am amazed she didn't break any of her bones during the film) and at times can't take anymore of her new situation and just wants to curl up and cry. Despite that she does finds the energy and determination to strive forward. You just can't help but love her. Also her first-love romance with Haku is really touching.<br/><br/>""Spirited Away"" is Hayao Miyazaki's own kind of version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and also the most fantastic movie he has made. The film deserved to be awarded with the best animation Oscar in 2001. If Miyazaki ever creates a movie that can surpass this one, as both visually and emotionally fantastic, then he is not a man but a God. One of the most amazing films ever to come across."

","What is there to say about a film you give 10 stars? Only a few films fit the bill and this is one of them, featuring Miyazaki and his Ghibli crew at their very finest. Everything is in balance here, the Miyazaki-isms working at full charming blast. Spirited Away delves into a beautifully imagined world of mystical Shinto-like abstracts. It is a solid modern myth, with the spirit of folk-lore and fairy tales, the endearing, exploring nature found in RPG videogames, and the greatest tales of adventure and heroism.<br/><br/>Miyazaki has mentioned that he doesn't think young girls have enough good role models in the media and in response he fashions his characters as upstanding paragons of virtue. As others have mentioned, every single character, every little dust mite and creature is given a fleshed out personality in this film. Everything on the screen has full life breathed into it; the whole affair borders on being genuine sorcery.<br/><br/>And the pacing here is fantastic too. The film gradually unveils all the regions and character elements of Yubaba's mansion with appropriately shifting thematic events. Miyazaki's storyboard has the masterful crescendos and smooth resolutions of Kurosawa's finest moments -- a compliment not easily distributed. As such, the entire film is a breeze to sit through and you'll find yourself consistently curious as to what each scene will bring or how it will resolve itself. And the answer is always a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>This is supposedly the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan and is probably the most famous Japanese animated film to be released in North America besides ""Akira"". This is with good reason, although I've heard other viewers complain of the abstract qualities of the tale. But I find that the abstract elements neatly tie together without necessitating any hindsight critique. <br/><br/>Does that make sense to you? No? Too bad!"

","This is probably Hayao Miyazaki's best film and given the very high quality of his other films that is saying a lot. As always with Studio Ghibli films the animation is absolutely beautiful and the story is enthralling.<br/><br/>The story follows the adventures of ten year old Chihiro who finds her self trapped in a spirit world when her parents take a wrong turn on the way to a new house. They enter this world through a tunnel which they think leads to an abandoned theme park. Her parents help themselves to the food at a restaurant and while they eat Chihiro explores fearing they will get in trouble for eating the food. While exploring she meets Haku, a young boy, who tells her she must leave before it gets dark, unfortunately when she gets to where her parents were eating she finds two pigs and she can't return to the car as a river now blocks her way.<br/><br/>As it is too late for her to leave and she wants to rescue her parents she has to stay. Haku tells her that humans are not allowed in the spirit world but if she can get a job there she will be allowed to stay. She manages to get a job in the bath house where she impresses the others when she deals with the stink god who isn't quite what he originally appears to be. She also lets the mysterious No-Face enter, at first he is welcome as he hands out gold to the workers but as he eats more and more they realise he isn't as benevolent as he seems. There are further adventures involving Haku, No-Face, Yubaba (a witch) and a giant baby amongst others.<br/><br/>The film is full of strange and wonderful characters, some are friendly, some are creepy but none seem really malicious. This film is suitable for all but the youngest or most nervous of children, it ends with Chihiro earning freedom for herself and her parents not slaying some evil monster. If you enjoy traditional animation and have yet to see this then you really should give it a go, I'm sure people will be enjoying this for decades to come.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."

This film is an animation epic and may well be the last throw of the dice for 2D films, although as I type these words out I'm sure some other wise guy will prove me wrong. The film as a chronicle of Chihiro's adventure is a triumph of storytelling, the artist's skill and craftsmanship, the voice talent's invention and skill (Both Japanese and English) the clever use of symbolism as a comment on the state of Japan as it is now, the combination of which makes for a one-off in film that will and has already stood the test of time, as it's score on these boards is testament to.<br/><br/>If IMDb voters are to believed, then this is the best animated film of all time.<br/><br/>Believe it."

Watch a Disney film, and you'll probably be able to figure out the outcome yourself. Watching this movie, I had no idea what was going to happen next. Things happen in the movie, that are unexplained, and you're left wondering what function something or someone serves.

","It isn't very easy to convince the jury of a pretentious festival like Berlin that your animation is better than all the other features in competition. Maybe Miyazaki's success is based especially on his extremely focused effort on creating a believable world in which believable characters evolve bound by a dreamlike predestination. When Chihiro's parents start eating from the tables filled with extravagant dishes, one can expect something nasty is going to happen. Animation is the closest step a filmmaker can take toward an accurate depiction of dreams, and the ""Japanese Disney"" can obviously handle the techniques. The entrance in the ""mysterious town"", the green field, the beautiful architecture, the loneliness of that place reminds us of eerie moments in our own childhood, when we could wonder at a midsummer garden full of flowers in the afternoon. Soon, the plot unfolds and we can witness Chihiro's adventures in a fantastic land where spirits gathered after dark. It's useless to describe the richness of colors and details and the amazing characters which one can enjoy in this monumental fairy-tale. The European and American response to this Japanese production showed that this kind of story, although filled with specific motives and themes, is useful in any civilization. It's about the power of a child to surpass any fear or difficulty in order to be back with her parents."

","Despite never really having a taste for anime, I found myself really enjoying this film. The director expressed many problems he had in the world today with a simple and harmless film that people could dissect and take in which ever way they wish. For this reason, this film is suitable for all people, young and old. Younger audiences will be attracted by the story of the young girl and her adventures, while older audiences should look at the girls struggles more in depth. The film follows a pretty good pace and keeps audiences interested during the entire film. I found the framing and editing on these characters and scenes fairly impressive. Hair and clothes moved while eyes would blink. These are all just little details that added up and made this film. When I first started watching this film I didn't really give it a fair chance, like many people I judged it before actually viewing it. Spirited Away quickly grabbed my attention and I found myself stuck to the screen because of its deep and interesting plot. A young girl gets lost in a spirit world and while trying to get home she has numerous adventures all while learning old values and good manors of the traditional Japanese world. There are all kinds of weird (but in a neat way) characters and each one represents something in life. The stink spirit represents the pollution of nature while No-Face symbolizes the pollution of man. The little girl finds ways to help these spirits and while doing so she learns these traditional values which allows her to save her parents who were turned into pigs at the beginning of the film. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone of any age. Keep in mind while watching it that Spirited Away is pointing out what is wrong with society today and what needs to be done to fix it. The beautiful thing about this film is that it can be taken as deeply or lightly as you want to take it. Some people may not enjoy it and that is perfectly OK, but just make sure that you start the movie with an open mind."
"queenofcrystals","9","0","0","5 June 2007"," The Sickness of Modern Society
","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is a film all about the ""illnesses"" of modern society. A young girl, Chihiro, and her family are moving from the city into the country. They stop at a strange tunnel which leads to, what appears to be, an abandoned amusement park. However, they soon find out that it is not abandoned at all. Chihiro's parents stop a restaurant and eat everything in sight without even waiting to ask permission. Because of this they are transformed into pigs, and this starts Chihiro's journey to save her parents in the spirit world.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about the movie is the way that Miyazaki portrays what he believes are the evils of modern society. At the bath house, Chihiro is confronted with a stink spirit. Because she is new, she is given the nasty job of preparing a bath for this creature. He is so sludgy and smelly that even a bowl of rice sitting next to him instantly rots. This spirit is the epitome of disgust. While Chihiro is preparing his bath, she notices something sticking out of the spirit's side. She alerts the other workers at the bath house and they help her pull it out. What Chihiro thought was a thorn turns out to be a bicycle and all other kinds of modern, industrial garbage. Once this litter is removed, it becomes obvious that this spirit was actually a polluted river god. The workers at the traditional Japanese bath house cleansed this god of all the pollution he received from the modern world. Miyazaki uses this to show how disgusting he thinks modern society is, and how he believes that a return to more traditional beliefs and values can cleanse society.<br/><br/>The second spirit Chihiro must deal with is a No Face. This spirit is mute and uses greed to get people's attention. When Chihiro first encounters him, he offers her more bath tokens than she needs. He believes that he will gain her friendship by giving her material things. She declines and takes only as many tokens as she needs. The No Face then lures a frog close to him by dropping gold on the floor, and then swallows the frog and steals his voice. The No Face makes everyone in the bath house go crazy with greed when he starts throwing gold all over the floor. But Chihiro is not influenced by this. She has begun to learn the traditional values and she can resist the temptation of wealth. She leads the No Face away from bath house and heals him. The No Face follows Chihiro to Zeniba's house out in the country. Zeniba lives a modest, traditional life. The No Face decides to stay with her and learns to knit and make things for others. Learning traditional values healed the No Face and transformed him into a spirit of giving rather than a spirit of greed.<br/><br/>This movie functions on two levels. It is an animated movie that one can sit down and watch just for the fun of it. For this reason I would recommend it for children. The animation is beautiful and you get attached to the characters easily. However, due to the serious, tradition versus modernity theme of the movie, it is also enjoyable for adults. This film works as a fun, children's movie and also a warning and lesson for the adults who watch it."
"debwando","Null","0","0","3 June 2007"," Anime Not Just for Kids
","Spirited Away by Miyazaki is about a young girl moving to a new house with her parents, and on the way, they are transported into a spirit world. She is separated from her parents and she must learn lessons and go through trials to get them back. The hand painted anime is beautifully well done. The characters' hair and clothes are shown moving and flowing rather than the stiff cartoon like animation in other films. The color and light was successful in each scene, specifically dark when showing the unwelcome Shinto spirits. The setting of the pure Japanese bathhouse was an effective place to show Chihiro's adventure in learning the great past traditions. The plot is straightforward and clear from the beginning. The excitement is in the journey in the character development of Chihiro as she meets a variety of strange and wonderful creatures.<br/><br/>This movie is all about examining where tradition fits into and helps modern Japan and how materialistic consumption is sickening society. It is rich with cutting social commentary on the state of affairs in Japan. Traditional elements of Taoism, Shintoism and Buddhism are seen throughout. The importance of connectedness to society is shown when Chihiro's friend gives her a purple hair tie. She is still wearing this hair tie when she comes out of the spirit world showing this tradition of connectedness should be carried into our modern lives. Also, the good twin sister witch teaches the ""No-face"" spirit (representing the illness of society) and Chihiro to knit and weave. This signifies the importance of learning and giving as they bring the threads of fabric together in connectedness. In the end, Chihiro's parents are not changed, but Chihiro is, showing that some learn the lesson and walk in it, and some do not. While children will enjoy this film very much for the excitement and adventure, there are so many hidden messages and ideas, it is also suited for adults to enjoy.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to any adult who is interested is societal issues. Also, anyone who likes a good adventure story with morals and a positive ending may enjoy it. Adults who have a problem with or are not interested in other religions and cultures may not benefit. It will not make as much sense to those adults with no experience in traditional Asian philosophies and religions. However, I think any child will like it."
"morganhiatt","9","0","0","31 May 2007"," Beauty and Greed
","Spirited Away is a great foreign film that represents the filth and corruption of society. Hayao Miyazaki, the director of this film, represented throughout his movie the problems of the modern society compared to the ideas and vies of the traditional society. The bathhouse in this movie is seen as a symbol of purity, which is a more traditional view that covers many Buddhist ideas. The two demon beings that were incorporated by the director represented the bad and evil of modern society. The first one represented the pollution that is constantly around us and the second one represented greed.<br/><br/>The movie's picture and color was very unique and different from today's animation, where every scene was hand painted, which made the movie seem more real. Another aspect of the movie that made it seem very real was the fact that the characters lips matched there words. These beautiful paintings and close attention to detail made for a very out of the ordinary animated movie.<br/><br/>Miyazaki presented the older ignorant generations as pigs of society because they were being greedy and would not stop eating the food. He also pointed out that they were unwilling to change from there corrupt ways and adjust to make society a better place to live. However, the younger generation did not seem to have as big a problem changing. Through symbolism, Miyazaki showed how the younger generations have the ability to change their views and take on society from one that is corrupt, dishonest, and modern to that of a more traditional society. Miyazaki used Chihiro in the movie as a symbol of this younger generation's ability to change more so than the older generation like her parents. Spirited Away portrays this generational change to show the arrogance of the Western more modern world and the idea that they will be able to clean up society.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to someone who does not have a problem with anime but also someone that can appreciate the beauty of art since each scene was hand painted. There were also a lot of underlying factors in this movie that made you think about society and the way that we live today, so if you like to ponder and dig deeper into things this movie will make you happy. And I would not recommend it to an American audience considering there are a lot of Buddhist and Taoist views that are represented and can give a negative connotation to Western society."
"GrowingMind","9","0","0","30 May 2007"," Spirited Away: Curing the illness of modern society with traditional values
","Writer/Director Hayao Miyazaki supplies us with an animated adventure full of social commentary on the illnesses of modern society. Miyazaki asserts that the youth of the world must learn and respect traditional values to cure the illnesses.<br/><br/>In this story a young girl, named Chihiro, is moving to the suburbs with her family. Living in the city her entire life, she is very against the move to the country. By chance they come upon the entrance into the Shinto spirit world. Her parents are turned into pigs, which represents modern consumerism, and must find a way to rescue them.<br/><br/>Miyazaki uses symbolism at just about every turn in the film. Chihiro represents the modern youth with no connection to the past. At one point they pass ""little houses"" that she did not recognize as Shinto shrines. Miyazaki basically sees the current youth as lazy, spoiled, cry-babies without manners. Chihiro even bumps her head in one scene because she did not bow.<br/><br/>Miyazaki symbolizes his modern illnesses with two monsters. The first monster we meet is the Stink Spirit which represents pollution, an illness of modern nature. The second monster is the No-Face spirit which represents the greed of modern society.<br/><br/>Miyazaki does see hope in the future through the young people by having his main character learn to work hard, display courage, and learn strength through tradition. Chihiro pulls out a bunch of modern trash from the Stink Spirit and comes to find that it was actually a polluted River Spirit, curing it's illness. Chihiro also defeats the no-face spirit by refusing the handfuls of gold that it was offering and showing it kindness.<br/><br/>The setting and atmosphere was successful. The anime was beautifully done. The plot flowed well throughout the film. The characters were convincing even though the were dubbed into English. The background music was appropriately added in as well.<br/><br/>This was a very well done film filled with symbolism. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I will say though, if I had not had a college course in southeast Asian literature that specifically discussed 'tradition versus modernity' with a sampling of many different authors and genre, I probably would not have enjoyed this film. Chances are that a lot of the people who did not like this film didn't understand the symbolism involved and had little or no knowledge of Shinto. With that in mind, I do recommend this film to anyone who enjoys anime."
"kel_kel_46","9","0","0","25 May 2007"," Only The Youth Can Save Us
","The best way to describe this movie is witty. It's a more subtle way of telling the youth they're the only ones of today who can put society back in a place that is moral and without greed or modern filth. From the beautiful images, to the characters' voices, to the message behind the entire movie, ""Spirited Away"" is a way of saying what many want to say about the only way to save tradition.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I have to say when I started watching the movie I was unimpressed by the animation that had a sort of hazy look to it, and when the scene of Chihiro running through the flowers came, I was confused because the animation of the flowers looked so much better than most other scenes in the movie. Then it made perfect sense when I found out it was all hand-painted, which made the movie so much more respectable.<br/><br/>Aside from the beautiful paintings, the voices matched well with the characters. Chihiro is portrayed as bratty at first, because that is what she was supposed to be, and the parents' voices were sort of dumb and rude sounding, especially towards Chihiro. Anyone who can't even help his or her own daughter across the water deserves to be portrayed as ignorant and crude. I can't think of any decent person who wouldn't help even a stranger's kid across the rocks in the water. But after all, Miyazaki is saying that tradition has become lost in today's society, and only the youth can save it. The young may be ignorant, but we're still being educated, and because we haven't been set in our ways or stubborn for many years, we can still appreciate, and take in, what we're being taught. The longer you go on with ignorance, the harder it becomes to be liberated. This becomes Miyazaki's point when Chihiro goes through everything she went through, for her parents to still be ignorant in the end. Miyazaki's point is also that maybe the youth are the only ones who can save society from modern ignorance because we're the only ones who can deal with it properly. To become one with tradition, and really understand it, you can't fight with it, and you can't control it. The only thing you can do is go along with it, and learn, which is made apparent in the way Chihiro handles No-Face. However, what will always remain with Chihiro is her new sense of tradition and respect. The purple shining hair band (which I found to be the most witty symbol in the whole movie) lets you know that there is hope for the youth yet, because tradition is there to watch over, and teach those who want to be taught.<br/><br/>Although the hair band leaves you with an optimistic future, and hope for the youth to make things right, I don't know if I can recommend this for an American audience. To appreciate the movie, you have to separate what you like from the point the director is trying to make about tradition (which doesn't want water gods kissing humans, so you'll have to get over it). The spirit of the movie is very Taoist, and even Buddhist, so keep in mind that strict rules over who can do what in hierarchy is supposed to be negative, as well as being ignorant (like the parents), and forcing what you can't control."

","We live in a world of animated movies. Most of them are rubbish, some are good - but none of them are entirely original. Each animated film probably uses the same idea that's been churned out about a thousand times before. Thank God for Spirited Away, then. Japan have always been good with animation - though Japanese animation frequently uses the comic-book style rather than big budget CGI effects, at least the Japanese can cook up some original, interesting plots with real culture and originality. Spirited Away is one of those films. It offers far more beauty and genuine though than bilge like Hoodwinked or the upcoming ""Simpsons Movie"" (which, I have a horrid suspicion, is going to be cr*p). It stays off the humour and cares more about adventure and magic. Personally, you can give me no humour and a great plot rather than loads of humour and a weak plot any day. We know from the start that Chihiro's going to have a lot of change in her life - having only just moved from her old school into a new, more obscure location. And from the moment we follow Chihiro's dad's car down that muddy road, we know that this film is going to be one very long adventure all the way. And it is. There's true magic to be found here - forget realism, fantasy is where great things lie. This is especially unique to Japanese culture and there is nothing in this film that has been churned out by anyone before. The wide array of interesting fantasy characters (No-Face is particularly noteworthy) and great colourful settings (the workhouse where Chihiro spends most of her adventure is a character all in itself) ensure that this is a film that will touch, amaze, take away the breath of, stun, interest and generally please anyone who sees it.

Dig a little deeper however, and you will be confronted with such themes as gluttony, greed, courage, and kindness. Although these ideas have been played out in countless movies and books, what makes it special here, is when you see how western culture has invaded Japanese society, and how these problems are solved with traditional Japanese values. The voice acting is very good, one of the benchmarks that I use when judging voice acting is if I forget that the characters are animated then the film has succeeded, and this is certainly the case here.

And, just as with his other works, it is perfectly<br/><br/>accessible to all ages, and carries messages, but never preaches. My<br/><br/>favorite scene was when Sen/Chihiro rode Haku when he was in dragon<br/><br/>form- terrific! I can't wait for ""Howl's Moving Castle"" to come"

","This is the first time I consciously watched a movie by Miyazaki Hayou (I watched the butchered version of ""Valley of the Winds"" which doesn't count anyway) and I have to say it's brilliant. Although the story lags it never bores. It's confuses and confounds and you forgive it for that. Most movies you want some underlying logic. Outside of basic Shintoism there is no logic and maybe that's what makes the movie great. It's not bound to Medieval Japan or the Modern one but is sort of trapped in between.<br/><br/>
My favourite part is the ""Oh my, a paper-cut!"" bit.<br/><br/>The only part I really disliked is Noh-Face's rampage. It seems to be the only thing that really doesn't fit. It's too eccentric and shifts the movie a bit out of place.<br/><br/>Other than that it's fine. But I guess some people won't buy Haku's real identity (which is a bit OUT THERE, I must admit). But I'd really like to own this movie on DVD, because it's a beautiful movie."

","The things everybody are forgetting to mention are the very things that make it great.  Like the attention to detail, for instance when little Sen puts on her shoes. And more importantly I loved the fact that while I was watching this movies I felt like, for two hours, I was ten again. I bought into the world hook line and sinker because of the small detail like a ten year old girl making sure her shoes fit right before she wears them."

","I really quite liked this film. I don't know why, as I don't consider myself to be a big anime fan. However now because of this I'm seriously considering giving it another chance and seeing other works (I haven't seen Princess Mononoke yet). It actually has a refreshingly simple plot but set in a quite complex yet enchanting world. I sat there thinking ""what kind of drugs was the writer on to come up with this stuff?"", tho I realize that a lot of the components probably draw on Japanese myth & legend. While it's ""dark"" it's not ""black"", altho you fear for the characters at certain points.<br/><br/>I listened to the English version. My only preference for listening to the Japanese version was simply due to it being in DTS on the region 4 DVD, which I prefer over DD5.1. However the fact that it's an animated cartoon removes the necessity of listening to it in it's original language and putting up with reading subtitles as for cartoons all audio is dubbed. It makes no difference. The English dubbing in my words was exemplary anyway and took nothing away from the film. For a real-life movie I'd always prefer subtitles over dubbed voices because, quite frankly, you can't put into the words the same emotion with a voice-over actor that the original actor can. But for an anime, that's not a factor, mostly due to it's economical frame rate in comparison to western style animation.<br/><br/>It's wonderful and one that my nieces & nephews are enchanted by as well."

","Hayao Miyazaki probably doesn't know that there are people here who waited to see his movie on the big screen for a long time, and I'm happy to say that these wishes come true :-) I saw, about 2-3 years ago, ""Princess Mononoke"" out of curiosity, at a time names like ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the shell"" where probably known by a few local animators... since then i have a thing for Anime.<br/><br/>I think ""Spirited Away"" is far more a mysterious movie then ""Mononoke"" and it is more connected with the Japanese tradition which is foreign to all of as, westerners. That's why there are people who relate to Anime as weird and not focused. I, of course, disagree. Please do yourselves a favor, see ""Spirited Away"" and while watching it try to forget everything your culture taught you to belief as the only truth."

","I totally fell in love with this movie. Hayao Miyazaki is a true genious, and the greatest animater living today. Although I don't like him being called the Japanese Walt Disney. This movie should capture you heart. It is now one of my favorite animated films yet, and DEFINITELY my favorite anime film. Miyazaki has truly made his masterpiece.

"Aeris4ever","Null","0","0","10 June 2003"," My favorite Miyazaki film
","While I've only seen two other films penned by Hayao Miyazaki, ""Spirited Away"" is my favorite of the three, by far.  What I like most about Studio Ghibli films is how realistic the characters are, in their movements and in their personalities.  Miyazaki's goal with ""Spirited Away"" to show the emotional and social growth of a spoiled child by placing her in a frightening situation.  <br/><br/>Chihiro, or Sen, is a sulky, self-centered girl who acts whiney and is hard to please.  Actually, I've seen worse kids, but in order to keep her character likeable, these traits weren't overblown.  Chihiro and her family are moving to a new home and she isn't too thrilled about it.  Her parents realize they've taken a wrong turn, so they immediately take a shortcut through the woods where they arrive at a mysterious place that looks like an abandoned park.  The parents want to go investigate, but Chihiro wants no part of it.  But fearful of the creepy surroundings, she follows them into a ghost town, where her parents discover a banquet of food and help themselves to it.  As Chihiro is walking around town, a strange boy called Haku approaches and warns her to leave immediately before the sun goes down, but it's too late.  Her parents have turned into pigs from eating the food and Chihiro is stuck in a spirit world to fend for herself, with some help from Haku.  That's just the beginning, as Chihiro and her parents have done a role reversal - it's now her turn to be an adult and save her family.  Haku tells her the only way she can save her parents is to get a job at the bathhouse, a place of leisure for gods.  From that point, we get to see the ""true"" Chihiro, a girl who is courageous, loving and loyal.<br/><br/>The characters drawn by Studio Ghibli may not be the most visually appealing of all anime, but the animation is always brilliant and very lifelike.  One of the best scenes is one where Chihiro is tying up her ponytail - the animation makes her look so real.  Yubaba, the owner of the bath house, and villain of the film, is a stunning character to look at, with lots of minute detailing.  Half the beauty of this film is in the artwork, it's eye candy overload and is extremely well done.  <br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS:  The other half of the film's beauty lies in its many messages and subtle symbolism.  All the characters bring a new theme to add to the pot.  Chihiro's parents are punished for their greediness and disrespect for others property, yet Chihiro learns from their mistake and when a similar opportunity arises later in the film, she knows what to do. The monster, No-Face, is the most mysterious character, as he represents a lonely outsider who seeks acceptance by indulging others.  Other themes/values covered include loyalty to your friends, putting aside your needs to help others, taking responsibility, confronting your fears, and forgiving your enemies.  It's a great film to learn from, but some of its messages might slip pass young kids.  <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film to everyone, especially teens and adults. Kids will likely be entranced by the trippy visuals and tense moments, but older viewers will appreciate the more complex elements.  Watch it a second time if possible, because it's very easy to miss something if your eyes aren't fixated on the screen.  When I realized what the film was really about, I enjoyed it much more the second time.  I regret that I've only seen the dubbed version, I usually like to see both versions.  The dub is very good, though, and the translation doesn't deviate too much from the original.<br/><br/>I hear Mr. Miyazaki is working on another film and I hope the success of ""Spirited Away"" and its much-deserved Academy Award will give future imported films a better chance to thrive in North America.  Hopefully, Disney has learned that the best animation doesn't have to come from Florida and will properly promote future Japanese-made films.  This one deserves all the acclaim its gotten.  I give it an ""A"" for astounding."
"a-tednev","10","0","0","4 June 2003"," Spirited Away is easy enough to understand
","Spirited Away is easy enough to understand -- it's about Love. It's about lots of other things too. Courage, remembering, cherishing what's good, honesty, redemption, the dignity of work, not exploiting your friends, taking only what you need, gratitude, staying true to yourself, the power of words, respect for all things and people, the importance of cleaning up the environment, and what to do after you stomp on a slug. It's one of the most uplifting films ever but there are many other things it is about -- greed, illusion, reality, gluttony, consumerism, shortsightedness, overprotected children, exploited children, pollution and future generations who will be stuck with cleaning up after us, addiction, abandonment, fear, betrayal, the Japanese recession, crassness, vulgarity, homelessness, exile, lost souls, materialism, rejection, trying to belong, persecution, joblessness, mean bosses, enslavement, and people who lose touch with the richness of their culture to the point where they mistake sacred ground for a theme park. It is also about evil. Evil is ordinary people fawning on a rich man to their detriment and his. Evil is ordinary people destroying rivers. Evil is children cowering from shadows in the sky. Evil is people having to ""sign their names away"" for the sake of loved ones. No super-villains plotting to destroy the world, just ordinary, routine evil. Evil is not defeated with a karate chop. The heroine conquers all and she does not use karate. She merely sees good or potential good in everybody, even the witch. Chihiro is not particularly beautiful or clever or graceful. She has little talent, and she is not a princess or a sorceress. She is not even unusually brave. She is brave only because she has to be. She's not especially resourceful or quick-witted. Her judgment calls and decisions are not flawless. She is forced to make dreadful choices but everything turns out well just because she has a good heart just like things occasionally do in real life. She's loyal and honest to enemies and friends, she refuses to be swayed by greed or fear. She tries her best to please others and fit in but she never goes against her conscience. The main thing she has going for her is an ability to love courageously and without calculation. Her friends save her from despair; and she frees herself, and redeems her friends and finally her parents with Love. Yes, there are lots of puzzles. What does No-face represent? How does Chihiro pass her final test? Why do certain personalities seem to change so abruptly? Puzzling over those questions is part of the fun. Spirited Away is not a sterile video game where victory comes with quick thinking and quick triggers. Chihiro endures shocks that would stun many adults and almost collapses from it all until Haku gives her renewed hope and courage. When she boards the train for that famous ride she sits silently, looking out the window at achingly beautiful scenery. She has a lot on her mind. Just for starters there is a dangerous witch behind her, a dangerous witch ahead of her, she may have to choose between saving her parents or her dying boyfriend and may lose them all, and on top of that she has taken responsibility for three child-monsters. Yet she gazes out the window with great stillness -- living in the moment. There is nothing superhuman about her yet, at least for those few moments, she gazes at eternity with enviable courage. In spite of all the Japanese weirdness and psychedelic imagery Spirited Away has a message of love, redemption, cleansing, healing, liberation, and salvation that are should be understandable here just as well as in the Mysterious East. It is not just a good movie but a grand human achievement Beethoven's 9th on celluloid. Spirited Away is about lots and lots more things than I have mentioned so far -- but mostly it's about Love."

This movie is a true masterpiece.  Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you should probably still see this movie.

Personally, I enjoyed the dubbed version better than the subtitled, because it seemed better translated.  To the casual moviegoer, this movie may seem quite awkward, and too generally weird to actually be worth watching.  But on the contrary, this movie is brilliant in every aspect.<br/><br/>I was just so impressed with this movie, I really don't know what to say. Just truly an awesome movie.

","Films from Japan never lack in creativity. `Spirited Away' is certainly no exception. It's a movie fit for kids that even adults can appreciate in that this film uses creative muscles you thought never existed.<br/><br/>
`Spirited Away' came to U.S. shores thanks to a deal with Disney. Thought the original version of the film was in Japanese, fear not, because Disney handymen did an excellent job of removing the seams from the overdubs.<br/><br/>The movie is a modern interpretation of an Alice-in-Wonderland-type adventure of young Chihiro (voice of Daveigh Chase), who finds herself in the land of the spirits when a family trip turns awry. She desperately searches for a way out of the zany underworld. In order to do that, and save her parents that had turned into gargantuan pigs, she took up employment at a bathhouse for affluent ghosts. There, she meets a troop of unlikely friends eager to help her out of her predicament-including a mysterious boy named Haku (voice of Jason Marsden).<br/><br/>The movie slides into a roller coaster of strange characters and unbelievable twists; it keeps you guessing what could possibly happen next. Woven into the story are dragons, body-less heads, mystical dragons and magical spells. No fantasy, myth or eastern spirituality is spared.<br/><br/>The film blends a well-animated backdrop of colorful creatures and splashing scenes together, complete with pre-Meiji architecture. In other words, the city of the spirits conjures up memories of traditional Japan. People look like typical Japanamation characters: enormous round eyes and small features. Throw in some walking sludge piles and an elderly witch with a protruding beak for a nose and you have a recipe for intrigue.<br/><br/>
The character development was a bit weak, considering the number of incredulous situations Chihiro manages to get herself into and the strange creatures she meets. She seems remarkably calm in the face of the barrage of hideous creatures, including a ghoul with an appetite for anything on two legs. Also, the voice of Chihiro is unusually whiny-even for a kid.<br/><br/>These small tidbits did not stop director/screenwriter Hayao Miyazaki from lining his shelves with trophies for the movie. The film received awards everywhere from the Berlin Film Festival to the New York Film Critics Circle for both best animated film and best foreign film.<br/><br/>At any rate, this film will be a winner for any kid looking for a different type of film. It ties together influences from The Neverending Story and the Wizzard of Oz in a completely new perspective. Granted, Disney movies-backed with plenty of corporate advertising-usually take home the more money. However, this film-available now on video-delivers an imaginative script and a vivacious palette of hues and scenery."

","Japanese and American films have been evolving independently of one another for many years.  While American films have pioneered the areas of special effects, acting, and directing, Japanese films have pioneered the realm of animation.<br/><br/>One might argue that films like Toy Story and Shrek have also pushed the envelope in animation, but there is one crucial difference between the evolution of American and Japanese innovation - imagination.  Toy Story and Shrek were incredibly entertaining movies, but pale in comparison to the way that director Hayao Miyazaki exploited the unrestricted boundaries of cartoon cinema.<br/><br/>In the film Spirited Away, Miyazaki creates a fantastic world of magical adventures and supernatural characters that interact through believable emotions.  Miyazaki really perseveres through the typical silly feel of some cartoons by adding depth to his characters.  From the hilariously cute little soot creatures to the mysterious No-Face, many characters are unforgettable.  Their animation and actions fit perfectly with their personalities.<br/><br/>Miyazaki uses these characters to symbolize love or evil and has a talent to seamlessly incorporate them into complex themes.  For instance, one of these themes, which is also apparent in his earlier film Princess Mononoke is the corruption of good by that which is unnatural.  Yet, Miyazaki also shows that this corruption can be reversed through the counteracting force of love.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a children's movie, and at certain times, one feels that Miyazaki could have delved deeper into some of these themes that he introduced.  The ending also seems to rush the resolution.<br/><br/>But will the average 10 year old really care?  No, and the average 20, 30, or 40 year-old will not care either.  Miyazaki's fantasy world is so engaging that the audience becomes enchanted.  Even the brilliant soundtrack adds to this effect.  Spirited Away is also, simply put, one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Critics have already embraced this movie, but kids and teens just love it.  Acceptance of this new genre of Japanese Fantasy, may usher into America a wave of Japanese Animations that were previously unmarketable. Don't miss the cartoon renaissance.  Go see one of the best films of the year, Spirited Away."

","This is a film that one must see with as many friends as possible at the same time, then spend the next two hours picking it apart and then reassembling the parts back into its original flow  but with a clearer understanding of the moral and metaphors and parables that were visually acquired during the viewing.<br/><br/>And then save the next day for a phone call or two to add another interpretive layer.<br/><br/>The animation was, clearly, the most refreshing visuals I have seen in one film. I have not experienced an animation film that changed in dynamic fashion to fit the mood of the story.  There were simple sketches, or photographic quality renderings, or complex layers or angles of perspective -- all of which defined the animation itself as having a distinct personality in parallel and union with the story telling.<br/><br/>FANTASTIC!!!<br/><br/>The story was steeped in many notions:  (1) self-indulgence and its tendency to acquire more and more things in expanding greed and dependence on consumption of goods and services in some religious or patriotic fashion; (2) the growing power of those who run' or control an economic infrastructure or business; (3) the innocence of youth and coming of age while taking control of one's own life and future; (4) the loss of respect by youth towards their parents; and (5) the most obvious, a venture outside of our own dimension on Planet Earth into that of spiritual beings where there is a spirit or ghost for everything on earth from a Japanese radish to a green frog to a timid speck of black coal dust that is tasked with the heaviest chore to stoke power consumption by feeding chunks of coal into the furnace.<br/><br/>I find the oddest thing in this whole post-viewing and writing experience is the fact that Disney acquired the rights to the film's distribution at some level outside of Japan when in fact the film itself smites the over expansion of theme parks (in Japan and elsewhere, I suppose) as over-indulgence in (American) corporate irresponsibility in the skimming of profits away from Japan and its residents and citizens.<br/><br/>Hello, Mr. Déjà vu.

If hallucinogens aren't your thing, then this will surely provide the closest experience attainable while<br/><br/>retaining clear thought. Well, sort of.<br/><br/>Not sure how well the American market will take to Disney's noble attempt to<br/><br/>introduce the Miyazaki form to the American public, but those who see it will be left with a lasting impression not soon forgotten. Disney doesn't appear to have much of an economic incentive, but their marketing department must be on to<br/><br/>some sort of strategy to enable such a remarkable effort.

","Upon viewing the original Japanese version of Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi), I was left saying, `wow, I've never seen any North American cartoon pull off so much in a children's cartoon.'  The movie's theme and storyline was clearly directed at kids, however the imagery and select content from the movie would easily be difficult for some teens to digest (at least the squeamish ones).  Which is probably why this movie was given a PG rating for North American release.<br/><br/>Spirited away is a story about a young girl (Chihiro) which ends up trapped in an abandoned amusement park full of old Gods.  Chihiro is not welcome in this world of the spirits and Gods.  In order for Chihiro to remain safe in this world, she must meet a purpose in the world.  Chihiro goes to meet the evil witch (Yababa) which owns a bathhouse for the Gods to apply for a job. Yababa is reluctant, but accepts her to work at her bathhouse.  Yababa makes Chihiro sign a contract to work, but Yababa steals 3 out of 4 characters of her name, leaving her name only as Sen (I assume you really need to know Japanese in order to understand how this works).  From here the story gets quite interesting and no shortage of entertainment (the synopsis above only summarized approximately the first 20% of the movie).<br/><br/>For people who have seen Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime), the violence level and maturity is in the same ball park (they are both by Studio Ghibli which is why I used this comparison).  Spirited Away contains scenes of vomiting, and blood.  The vomit scenes are NOT extremely detailed, but for some people I viewed the movie with (ages range from 19 - 25), were graphic enough.  Blood appears primarily in one scene, it was well implemented and used tastefully, but for parents, a little less blood probably would have been suffice in most cases.  For every graphic, there is the extremely cute scenes.  The imagination to make this movie is extraordinary.  So many original ideas in character design and little side details that are rare in most one dimensional Disney story lines.  The movie is filled with many extremely cute little scenes (but not too cute to make grown men turn away saying, `what the hell is this').  And primarily, there is no singing during the whole 2 hours and 6 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the movie.  I would suggest it to children 10+ or ones that have a strong sense of maturity.  There is no killing or senseless violence in this movie.  But the one scene with blood and some vomit is my personal reason for knocking up my opinion on the age issue.  For adults taking their kids, you just might enjoy this more than your kids will. It's a good solid movie.  I give it an 8.5 / 10 (I am very picky)."

","Having heard many good reviews about Miyazaki's work, I decided to watch 'Spirited Away' one weekend. Fully expecting a Japanese work, imagine my surprise when the dialogue that came out of the characters' mouths was in Mandarin! Though initially disappointed by the dubbing 'glitch', I fully enjoyed the film and was throughly captivated by the depth of imagination and the beautiful realisation of the background visuals.<br/><br/>
Though the film has been compared to 'Alice in Wonderland', the similarity is on the surface only, as in both films centre on a young female protagonist who journeys through a fantastical landscape full of monsters and creatures. In 'Spirited Away', Chihiro embarks on a journey of self-discovery to find an inner strength and optimism that you would not have imagine existed in the character at the beginning of the film. It also showed how these precious qualities that she found in herself had a tremendous and positive impact on the monsters and creatures in the strange world she came to. Whereas Alice is somewhat separated from Wonderland, a discordant note in its landscape though she may journey through it.<br/><br/>
Surprisingly, there is not a single detestable character in the film, even Yu-baaba the villain of the show. The variety of creatures (with some really lovable ones) would delight your little ones and the richness of the story and beautiful animation will captivate and engage the grown-ups.<br/><br/>All in all, a truly excellent film!"

I can hardly wait for this movie to hit the theaters here in the States.<br/><br/>The story has so many things that people can identify with. The fears of moving to someplace new. The chance for an ordinary kid to become a hero by overcoming fears and working hard to be a good person despite an uncertain future. The vital importance of someone's name.<br/><br/>Chihiro's dedication to her parents and her loyalty to the friends she makes in the magical realm she finds herself in make her the kind of character that people wish that they were more like. Despite her own problems she still tries very hard to help others. She also doesn't judge people/creatures/things by their appearance alone. Despite all the problems Chihiro encounters she never gives up hope of saving her parents and returning to the human world.<br/><br/>The movie manages to be very emotionally moving against a bizarre, and sometimes grotesque background. It's almost like Miyazaki was able to take a really incredible dream and transfer it directly into stunning animation. The fact that this movie is strange doesn't keep it from being absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>One thing. If Japanese is not your language of choice, avoid the temptation to watch the dubbed version when it comes out.

It's been re-baptised 'Le voyage de Chihiro' for it's French release and it's being shown in French theaters both in a subtitled and a dubbed version as I write this. I strongly encourage any Francophone to jump at this opportunity and see the film subtitled. But I imagine not even a dub, or even meddling from the editing-happy Yanks could really ruin a film as beautiful and enthralling as this.<br/><br/>No doubt you've seen how Disney keeps claiming that the latest drivel they spit out is ""a timeless classic full of wonder for the whole family to enjoy"". It would be an insult to compare the beauty of this film to any Disney rubbish, but the phrase ""a timeless classic full of wonder for the whole family to enjoy"" describes what this film accomplishes very well. I've gone to see it twice, and noticed that the theater was filled with such diverse viewers as late teens, students their twenties and even middle-aged married couples. Yup, this whole spectrum of 'adults' had gone to see a so-called children's cartoon. And judging from the laughs and chuckles that the film's many charming moments raised (the fat mouse was a huge hit), everyone genuinely enjoyed it, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality or whatever else. Sen to Chihiro has a kind of charm that can touch everyone (it says a lot if a fussy homosexual otaku can drag both his parents and grumpy kid brother into this and they all come out loving it to bits).<br/><br/>The story is quite simple, at first sight. On their way to their new home in the country, young Chihiro and her parents come across a tunnel which leads them to a strange-looking abandoned town. Her parents discover a restaurant packed with attractive food and immediately start to stuff their faces while Chihiro wanders off. It's then that things take a turn for the bizarre; night falls, and the town begins to fill with all sorts of ghosts and goblins, while Chihiro's parents have suddenly turned into pigs, and the way back is cut off. A young boy named Haku seems to be the only unexpected ally Chihiro has in this strange new world. To save her parents and make it back home eventually, Chihiro has to find work in a huge public bath house run by the witch Yubaba who seems to rule the place. Among the many strange and mysterious creatures there, she has to make friends, build up her courage and eventually find her way back to the normal world again.<br/><br/>There must be heaps of different possible interpretations and underlying depths to the film, and no doubt each viewer will experience it in his own personal way. The animation has already been greatly praised, and rightly so; it's gorgeous. Every scene is rich in color, crystal-clear fluidity and intricate detail (check out all the things moving in the backgrounds - there's a lot of silly mischief going on for you to discover). And best of all, the beauty never seems to strike a blunt in-your-face note - they're not trying to push big gasps of admiration out of the viewer with flashy CGI or over-the-top shots. The visuals' excellent just quietly seeps in and sweeps you away all the more efficiently for it. This isn't just brilliance, it's refined brilliance.<br/><br/>While every element of this little marvel deserves paragraphs of praise, I'll limit myself to the one element that impressed me the most - the very vivid atmosphere of Chihiro's world. The rich color palettes and the unusual architecture of the settings set a strong feeling of surreality. It's innocently colorful and rather spooky at the same time. And for such a fascinating world, it has inhabitants to match. The myriads of creatures that pop up all ooze personality with far more than just their weird looks. Watching the bizarre animals in motion really draws you in, and you cannot help but grow to like them. The frog in the blue kimono and the giant yellow birds really struck a note in me personally, while the aforementioned fat mouse and it's tiny bird companion raised so many laughs they must've stolen the show (somebody make us plushes of these critters, please!). And there are so many others to enjoy. To name but a few, the trio of bouncing green heads or the 'no-face' black Kaho-nashi who sways between endearing and frightening are brilliant ideas. Watching how these mysterious creatures behave adds loads to the fun of this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, an enchanting experience for any viewer, and a killer uppercut to the bloated jaw of Mickey Mouse. See it for yourself and let yourself be gently carried away to a dream-like world that your inner child can't resist to explore through your eyes. It looks like anime fanatics may finally have the cure for Akira Aftertaste. If there's a film that can to rub out the bad impressions left by the cheap violence-fests released by clueless companies and establish the international respect that the anime medium deserves, Chihiro has all it's chances. But more importantly, it's a wonderfully accomplished film full of imagination - a glimpse into a world that can make everyone dream. Very strongly recommended, for absolutely anyone."

","This is a gorgeous movie which could do pretty well outside Japan...but for the problem of the title.  The title itself is related to a plot point which is simply not possible to translate to English (or perhaps any non chinese-influence language)  Chihiro's name being changed, shortened, actually, to Sen.  There are two ways to handle this, and from the English title, I'm guessing they're doing it the graceful way...to ignore it, rather than awkwardly try to explain or translate it.  <br/><br/>""Sen to Chihiro"" reminded me a lot of the animated ""Chinese Ghost Story"". Not just visually (and the visual similarities are strong), but plot-wise, as well.  ""Sen to Chihiro"" is much better, however, in every respect.  (And ""Chinese Ghost Story"" was pretty good.)<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie more than ""Mononoke"".  Brilliant animation, design, and music, and a family-friendly story which isn't an insult to the intelligence of the audience...it may not be as hyped in the west as Mononoke was, but if Miyazaki finally wants to quit for real, I think this is an even better swan song.<br/><br/>See it at your earliest opportunity.  Even if you miss the nuances, it's still amazing, and better than anything Disney has produced in 50 years."

","It's not something new that chinese and japanese animation has always inspire, dazzle and marvel all of us, westerns. Despite quality (in some cases good; in others, bad) the sets, the characters, the animation and the colors always made us want to plunge inside the screen to follow the adventures in their quest; most noticebly, in my personal opinion, the Tv Series ""Evangelion"". When the trailor to the voyage of Chiriro hit the theatres, not a single skeptical and even so called hateful eye, could manage to blame any of its excentricities and its obvious scientific impossibilities. but has we have seen in many other movies before, either animated or not, many of them are not attempting at plausibility, they're rather a metaphor. What this movie r is all about is love, and how we can step out of our fearful world to try to catch our beliefs, save the ones we love. In that area, the movie plainly fulfills its mission: it has emotion everywhere, being that same emotion supported by a dazzling animation. Mutch to my desmay, I truly wanted to like Chihiro, but it became somewhat of a bore: like many other movies it could have been told in half the running time, some scenes were totally expendable, and somewhere around the middle of the movie, it becomes a total compliment to gore and dirtyness. Sincerelly, over two hours of dazzling animation aren't enough to make a movie all that great. In the bottom line, as for me, the movie only was average worthy in the instrumental main theme; Chiriro 'flying' from room to room towards Yobaba and Chihiro's fabulous view from her room. It's eye candy, in fact, but it doesn't make us plunge. That's its main and fatal sin."
"Laserwolf65","Null","6","20","9 June 2010"," A visual masterpiece, but a failure at storytelling
","Some call Hayao Miyazaki the Disney of Japan. In regards to this movie, I would like to offer my own analogy: he is the Don Bluth of Japan--he's an amazing animator, but a horrible storyteller.<br/><br/>The story starts out with Chichiro and her parents. They stop off at what looks like an empty carnival and the parents begin eating. This show of gluttony and greed transforms the parents into pigs, and as night falls, the spirits that inhabit this place come out. Chichiro winds up trapped with the spirits and winds up being captured by a witch who steals her name and forces her to work in the witch's bath house. Now it's up to Chichiro to get free and save her parents.<br/><br/>There are obviously more characters that I have not mentioned, but that in a nutshell is the plot. The problem is that Miyazaki doesn't want to develop it. Instead he opts for what seems like 1000 different sub-plots.<br/><br/>One deals with a river spirit, one deals with the witch's sister, another deals with a spirit called No-face, and the list goes on. The main plot is essentially forgotten until the very end of the film, and is resolved in the most trite of ways.<br/><br/>This is really the movie's big problem. It's as if Miyazaki and crew came up with a million ideas, and rather than pick one or two, they picked all of them. It doesn't only affect the plot, but also the look of the film. I understand that many of the creatures are traditional Japanese spirits (and I'll be the first to admit my lack of knowledge of Japanese culture), but there were simply too many weird creatures that serve no purpose. The witch for example has a baby that fills an entire room and three severed heads as assistants. Why? Because they could.<br/><br/>I honestly hated this movie. When it was finished I felt flabbergasted. It was uninvolving, nonsensical, pretentious, and boring. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I honestly cannot understand why this movie is so well-loved. In my humble opinion, it is complete and utter drek."

","No just no. Thats gonna be my main statement, the movie is to ridiculous to respect and along side that it barely makes sense. This whole ordeal just shouldn't exist. Its to crazy and makes me wanna shoot babies. I can't even name everything, god the Noface character killed me. The town and everything that went on in it was way to much I'm sorry. Just didn't make sense whatso ever. People think its good because they feel there has to be some sort of reason behind a speed trip this crazy. They feel that it has an intelligent aspect because they feel everything represents something or depicts something. It doesn't, I'm gonna tell you that right now, nothing in this movie makes sense, the title, the characters, the plot, the settings, nothing. If I filled a tub with acid and cut my self in several places the things i would see would very closely resemble this movie. Jimi Hendrix could've written this movie and it wouldve been better just cause the music would rock. People that are uninformed feel that authors and directors make everything represent something, everything. This is not the case, now I'm not trying to offend the director but I'm sure he just wanted to make a movie that seemed like a spectacular dream that the viewer was having. And he did a good job, but i bet if i went and asked him what things represent he'd be like ""well you see the noface character represented a creature that eats everything"". Thats exactly what it is, nothing more or less. See the reason its #48 on crack list 2076 is because its just like every other Japanese movie and crazy but this ones animations and art were just so brilliant. Thats it and since its on it people think its an amazing movie.<br/><br/>OK no one believes me, heres what ill do, ill get some acid and speed, get incredibly high and film a movie. It will be exactly the same except it won't be animated.

","This movie has achieved many things in the world of animation. All hand drawn, this movie is stunning but only because of how long and hard it must've been to make. I do not like the story line and find the monsters to be confusing. There is a blurred line between good and evil and I was not able to comprehend the meaning of having an evil spirit trapped in a good spirit's body. I saw this once as a young child and I have just watched it again. I do not think this movie is appropriate for fragile children who are easily scared of monsters. <br/><br/>This movie is not worth watching unless you are a fan of awkward films that are not that good.

","this movie was dripping with lush background art and imaginative creatures. However, the story is difficult to fallow, goes off on uncalled for directions and such. But the thing I was the least impressed, with was the character animation. For a movie that is rated the #2 greatest animated movie I expected it to have lush and fluid animation, sure some of the creatures and liquid elements were well animated, but the characters ended up looking flat and choppy moments. When it boils down to it, it was just another anime film. Nothing new really. The day I see anime animation with smooth shading as a posed to that awful over-used sharp shading, is the day they gain my respect. Until that time, I will look to American and others for the great animation in an animated movie."

","This is the rare bird thats better in English. I had picked up an import copy of this film prior to the English Disney release and was stunned at how much I didn't like it. Thinking I was mad after all the hype I watched the film seven times in the next seven days and was underwhelmed each time. When the John Lasseter supervised dub was finally released to theaters I went more to show support than out of desire to see the film again. Seeing the film in English was a revelation. Even for some one who has watched thousands of anime in Japanese I had to admit that the tiny little touches that were added made the film better and more understandable on an emotional level. This is a great film for everyone, but if English is your first language see it in English its so much better."
"Peter_Gunz","6","3","8","1 January 2004"," Visually stunning. Plot... lacking, to say the least
","(Contains spoilers ahead) No one can throw down shots about this movie as far as animation style and artistic vision.  The color and fluidity of the scenes are amazing, I'm sure providing a source of inspiration for many young animators and animation directors.  But all throughout the film, I could not help but think ""for the love of God, pick up the pace"".  Now, I'm a big fan of the anime style, and I can certainly appreciate good craftsmanship (as is demonstrated in this movie), but the storyline was terrible.  I could hardly choke down the hacked up and ripped off Alice in Wonderland plot.  Throw in a cheshire cat and some more metaphors of narcotic consumption and you're right back at the old Disney classic.  The pace of the movie crawled.  Simply crawled.  Even during what were supposed to be the most dramatic sequences, I found myself grasping at straws in the consciousness department.  The character development was terrible outside of Sen (or Chihiro, whichever you prefer).  Her development from a whiny clumsy oaf to a confident clumsy oaf was at least half-way decent.  She was the only semi-rounded character in a world of static one dimensional characters. The only character that I found moderately interesting was the Boiler Room Man, Kamaji.  His sudden shift from being a surly old (6-armed) man to a caring sort of uncle figure to Sen was a little bit inexplicable, but forgivable.  The most ridiculous transition in this film was when No-Face chases Sen through the bathhouse in a seemingly murderous rampage, and then Sen forgets about that within about 90 seconds and invites him onto a train with her!  This goes unexplained, and the character of No-Face just suddenly becomes friendly and everyone seems to forget that he ate 3 people, and destroyed large areas of the bathhouse, but who needs a storyline when you can just cover it with pretty colors and nice backgrounds.<br/><br/>All in all, this film left me wondering how on Earth it won so many awards, and why so many people praise this film as a masterpiece.  No, I do not speak Japanese, and was therefore forced to watch the English translation (and I realize there is always something lost in the translation of films, or anything for that matter), but I deeply hope that the Japanese version carries more meaning and a sense of continuity.  See this movie if you like animation.  If for nothing else, see it because then you can know what some of the anime nuts are talking about.  Expect great animation, expect some strange creatures, but don't bother trying to string any of the events together in any kind of logical story.  Just enjoy the fluidity of the pretty colors, and try to forget that little things like ""plot"" actually matter.<br/><br/>6/10"

The characters were not developed well at all. They were just a sketch; more of dialogue delivering automatons than creatures of flesh and blood. By that I mean none of the characters were really thought out."

","The Concept: 'City of Lost Children' meets 'They Live' meets 'Beauty and the Beast'<br/><br/>Spoiler Warning...<br/><br/>If there's one good thing the insipid 'Harry Potter' series has done, it's helped marginally raise our understanding of magic.  Lynch tried explaining it with 'Dune'--the best attempt in a sci-fi setting.  None of that understanding is taken into account here, its only a lightshow.<br/><br/>I am continuing my study of animation styles and this was one of several anime that I examined (the others being 'Vampire Hunter D', 'Akira', 'Golgo 13', and 'Mononoke Hime').  I noticed one consistent theme: the art styles are all the same.  Characters suffer from 'Pokemon' design.  One motif is interesting: giant, amorphous blobs.<br/><br/>Here in America I've found at least four styles--the exaggeration method of Disney & Bluth, the CGI teams, the TV method of 'Heavy Metal' and its ilk, and the reality obsession of Bakshi.  It's taken us 80 years to reach this point.  Will the Japanese catch up?<br/><br/>What really frustrates is the scant material in anime stories.  If a story leaves enough open ends for me to create another interpretation, I've just found my entertainment.  Example: 'Falling Down' is really a dream by Michael Douglas in the midst of a traffic jam.  Duvall is just a mental extension of himself that shoots him in the end.  Layman's terms: Douglas dreams of rampage, stalking and killing himself.  How good is that?<br/><br/>We get no such opportunities here.  This isn't even 'Alice.'  Alice was about wordplay, integration of reality into fantasy, and surrealism.  Here we get some simple surrealism and nothing else, even the protagonist is sexless.<br/><br/>The most interesting part is that Disney and Pixar managed the American release.  Since Disney's conventional team has quit, they are taking stock in anime in order to ride the popularity wave.  <br/><br/>Disney should produce their own anime under Tony Scott or John Carpentar (since anime is identical to their styles).  The story would have the layering of 'eXistenZ' and the visual philosophy of 'Fight Club.'  Wouldn't that be cool?<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

"MyOpinionIsFact","5","5","17","26 May 2003"," I really wanted to like this movie more.
","I can count on one hand the number of animated films I thought achieved the potential of the medium. I am almost always disappointed by them; so much so that I've started to actively dislike the genre. After hearing all the praise for this movie, I really, really wanted to be proved wrong. Even though I found myself admiring some of the artistry in Spirited Away, overall I felt very letdown. First, like during almost every animated film that I see, I got a bad headache while watching it (if this always happens to anybody else, please contact me). Second, the main characters look far too cartoony compared to the lavishness of the background scenes. If someone can enlighten me as to *why* animators, from an artistic point of view, not pragmatic, choose to do this, let me know. Third, why do animated characters always have to be so clumsy? Here, it was part of Sen's development, but animated characters are always dropping things, slipping here, fumbling there. Sure, it can be used to convey dynamicism to the inanimate drawings but, for me, it is at the expense of realism. Lastly, besides the most trite of statements (e.g., pollution is bad, whining is bad, gluttony is bad, greed is bad, etc.), I find the movie without a deeper message. Or, among the messages it does hold, I find none of them presented movingly enough such that offenders would change their lifestyle. I did like the music and some of the comedy. And I admit that many of the visuals will stick with me for a long time. My favorite moment (no real spoiler) is when the hamster interacts with the footprint and the sootballs. What's puzzling about this little scene is that it is completely unnecessary and even detracts from the storytelling; yet it works. I gave the movie 5/10."
"diac228","8","6","22","1 May 2006"," Not exactly easy to be ""Spirited Away"" by this film when it takes so long and has too many slow moments in between
","Spirited Away is best-known for being the film that out of nowhere steals the Academy Award for best animated film from Lilo and Stitch and Ice Age, two very successful animated flicks that had come out at the same year. When I mean stole it, I do in fact mean stole it. Spirited Away is the kind of film that really points out what is wrong with animation today: not that much of a story, very inconsistent animation, lack of closure, and just too many slow moments. Clocking in at over two hours long, this is one of the longer animated movies to come out in recent years, and despite the few humorous moments, it isn't that great overall. Making an astonishing 200 million dollars overseas, it established Hayao Miyazaki as the ""Walt Disney of Japan.""<br/><br/>This movie revolves around a clumsy yet courageous little girl named Chihiro who loses her parents because they ate food that belonged to spirits. As a result of this, she goes through a series of trials and adventures to get back to the regular world, or else be doomed to forever work in a bathhouse for spirits. Along the way, she meets up with Haku, a boy determined to take her back into the real world. Throughout the film, she meets an astonishingly large cast of characters, ranging from a greedy old lady that runs the bathhouse to some cute little spider-like critters. Along the way some of these critters help, some try to kill her, and others carry awful curses that plague their soul and also threatens to ruin the bathhouse.<br/><br/>Miyazaki weaves an interestingly bizarre story, yet he stretches it way too long resulting in many dull and many, many slow moments. There are some scenes that way too prolonged and others that some may find utterly pointless. On the technical side though, there is a mixed bag. Unlike most translated animated films, this one stands out with very good voice work, and that is partly thanks to John Lasseter, otherwise known as one of the leading men of Pixar and director of the Toy Story movies.<br/><br/>The animation on the other hand, is quite inconsistent. In several points of the film, there is an ugly mix of realistic animation with cartoony animation with an anime-style background. It doesn't mesh too well, seeing a realistically-drawn little girl with two goofy-looking animals and a very detailed old woman all together, sharing the spotlight for a minute or two. The mix of computer animation and regular animation doesn't work either. If you are going to work on a film, make it consistent, or at least make it look consistent. Beauty and the Beast contains some computer animation, but it is almost impossible to notice because it is done so well (The Beast dancing with Belle has the most computer animation in the film).<br/><br/>As the climax rapidly approaches, it is hard to even find the mood. While on one hand there is suffering, in the corner of the screen there is some funny animation involving a hamster and a small bird trying so hard to keep up with the main character, Chihiro. It is hard to feel sorry and be saddened by the depressing cries of Chihiro, when we see the hamster trying to knit but to no avail. I found myself laughing during scenes in which there was supposed to be a gloomy mood, which is both frustrating and also embarrassing since I was watching it with some other people.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Best animated film of 2001? I don't think so, that title belongs to Ice Age. While it is an interesting and at times intriguing story, it is ruined by the conflicting animation, the amount of time it takes to tell the tale, and the failure to bring any drama when it is supposed to because of what is going on. The ending also arrives rather unexpectedly and comes up a bit short. While it sometimes looks pretty and sometimes is fun to watch, overall it is still lacking. At least it finally breaks the trend of Asian-made movies with bad dubbing by proving some excellent English-speaking voice talent. Spirited Away: won't blow you away, it will not totally frustrate you, but will not convince you to watch it again."
"azzurra-ying","3","5","18","8 June 2006"," Eye candy to some extent but not memorable
","Maybe it's the dubbing (for it's the English version that I watched). I had high hopes this time that Japanese anime characters are going to be finally lovable, and it failed once again. The story wasn't too bad when Chihiro first got into the bathhouse and when all the funny, innovative characters, a lot of whom taken probably from traditionally Japanese legends and folk tales, are introduced. But most of them were simply introduced and left alone, not making any difference to what would go on. Perhaps the smooth and ""predictable"" story-telling of American animes that gives some significance to every character that they care to put in front of the audience is addictive. As for the main character Chihiro, I'm slightly consoled at her pretty much genuine appearance (small eyes, build and height of a child). However when the little boy comes in I sadly knew where this movie is going right away. There just can't be a proper Japanese anime without a hint of dubious relationship between their male and female pre-teen leads. And it's always just a hint, for the little girl and boy do seem to remain incredibly pure and innocent and righteous against all odds. Then again it might be the translation and dubbing - but when Chihiro finally learnt her lesson of ""love"" in the sky when flying with Haku, it truly made me wince and spoilt whatever innocent fun the movie offered earlier. The dark, childlike qualities of Japanese animes always make it difficult for me to believe that they are totally healthy.<br/><br/>Aside from the lack of convincing character development I would have liked the plot to be a little tighter. The interesting array of characters presented at the beginning was rather dearly missed throughout the film. When Chihiro went to look for Yubaba's sister I thought it almost came to a standstill and could use a second episode to explain a whole lot more things. Perhaps it's, again, the training of every-part-fits-in-nicely American animes that makes me miss the point about a lot of things in Spirited Away."

Some of the scenery was wonderful, but the choppiness of the characters took away from the beauty of the scenery for me. Also, the fantasy part of the story was just plain weird for me. I understand the ""Alice in Wonderland"" reference, but in that story, we still have animals and people as the strange characters. In ""Spirited Away,"" there are strange characters that don't seem to make sense, for example, the witch's baby. How does she have a baby and why is he ""huge?""

","I remember watching this movie when I was around eight or nine years old for the first time and it was the first movie that both scared the living crap out of me and also stunned me with its vivid animations. As a kid this mix of feelings made me fall in love with this movie.The story was a bit beyond me at that age. Than one night I remembered this movie and how much I liked it as a kid so I made it my goal to find the movie, I rented it as soon as I could. Watching it now I am still just amazed at what a great movie it is and the story is wonderful! It's the kind of movie that really doesn't change with age, Hayao Miyazaki created a true masterpiece with this that can be enjoyed by children and grandparents alike. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!"
"lauhmalfoy","9","2","5","30 May 2011"," Marry me, Hayao!
","This was the second film from Hayao Miyazaki I watched (being the first ""Howl's Moving Castle""). I have to say I didn't love this film as much as the first one (that's way I gave a 9 and not a 10): the end doesn't quite satisfy me and I didn't find the story as surprising as in HMC. However, I could I give less than 9 when the graphics are so beautiful and the creatures he creates are awesome and the characters are stunning? How could I ignore the metaphors he's always doing? Well, I couldn't, so I gave it a 9.<br/><br/>For those who are wondering if this is worth it: just watch it. I mean, right now. You will certainly like it and it will make you remember your childhood, your dreams and fantasies. I just wished someone had showed me this before."
"Rectangular_businessman","10","2","5","17 June 2010"," One of the best films ever made!
","Spirited Away is a totally unique celebration of friendship, love, and learning responsibility. Beautiful animation and a superb score supplement a fantastic story. A young girl gets trapped in a world of spirits and she has adventures. It's a bit like a Japanese Alice In Wonderland. What cannot be explained so easily is the depth of feeling to this film. The world of the film contains so many eccentricities small and large. Motifs are carried through here and there, woven throughout. Characters come and go and switch and change. The atmosphere shifts and the feelings created ebb and flow. How can it make me feel so exuberant and sad? Why am I so nostalgic for something I cannot name? This movie is the rush of life as an adventureÂ…the people you touch becoming friends and then leaving suddenly. It is the forgotten moments of childhood shimmering through the haze of adulthood. It is the journey of maturing that we all must take. We are the masters and authors of our own life, but damn, it is the people in it that make it worth mastering. I am always thrilled to remember that a Japanese ""children's"" film illustrates this so subtly and elegantly."

","Spirited Away has just been televised this year on Sky Movies (in the uk) but before like Princess Mononoke it was on Channel 4's (in the uk). This film made it in the top ten (8 it reached. So once televised on Sky Movies. I watched the opening but I was rudely interrupted by my mate and I had to go out for an hour missing the parts but I'm glad I did but I tell you about it later but the next time it was televised I did get to watch and it was brilliant though the story is a little bit weak. If you like anime Spirited Away is no. 1. on your list. Music by Joe Hisaishi is wonderful. Reprise is a wicked instrumental, Chihiro's Theme is sweet & Solitude (Not in the film must have been a bonus) is outstanding. This was a definite Oscar winning animation. Overall-Super Hit."

","Eastern storytelling always seems so much more open ended compared to the West. A good Japanese story in my experience is a lot harder to both pigeon hole and second guess.<br/><br/>Animation was quite beautiful, as was the general pace and the characters. The music was delightful also.<br/><br/>My only gripe in this story is it felt as if it would benefit from being two movies. One that dealt with the Bathhouse and one that took her on her quest to the sister. The dynamic of the 4 travellers seemed worthy of more time however the film had run out.. and so the pace picks up a little too much after she leaves the bathhouse - as if they are squeezing this final section in. It would have been nice if they had made the film a little shorter and followed with a sequel. I found the train journey was captivating and made me wish she could explore more of the spirit world, however there was no time to do so.<br/><br/>Great pity. Fantastic feel nevertheless. Worthy of it's hype."

Sen to Chihiro no Kamakakushi is worth watching if you have an active imagination, enjoy fantasy stories and appreciate nice music.<br/><br/>Be careful though, I have heard that in the English dubbed version the voices are really annoying.

","I was very disappointed with this movie. It falls in line with all the other pitfalls any anime would produce. Poor dialog, poor plot, and very unstable characters. The story is at best the spawn of an elementary school child's imagination. How this movie made the IMDb top 100 is beyond my comprehension. I really think the rating formula is flawed if this movie beat out Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and Forrest Gump. How did that happen? Flawed rating system maybe? The only thing remotely good about this ""movie"" was that the animation was good, but if I wanted just the art and no good story or plot, then I'd just go to an art gallery instead. I cant stand it when in ALL Japanimation films, the camera angle will just focus on an inanimate object for like TEN SECONDS! There is a part in this movie were the girl says goodbye to the ""River Spirit Boy"" and their hands pull away from each other as they part. After their hands leave the frame, the director seams fit to film the ground for another 5 grueling seconds! The whole movie is like this!"
"Chibichasechan","1","14","82","6 June 2007"," Not Impressed at all.
","This movie did not impress me at all. Unlike the other movies by this company, this one by far had to be the worst they ever made. I thought it to be very weird, and pointless. The characters were very weird, like for example, the parents turning into pigs. Like what is up with that? There is NO reason for them to turn into pigs, and they just do, out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Hated the animation, worst of them all. Nasicaa is definitely better than this piece of crap. I know that many people will disagree with me on this, since it is a very popular movie and everyone likes it, but I am going to stick with my opinion on this one. I believe it to have no story and it's just about a random, weird 2 year old running around meeting the weirdest and most retarded people, no not people THINGS I have ever seen in my life. Like what is up with that old women. She's HUGE, and she has to be weirdest person a anime company has ever made, and she is the weirdest animated person ever. Also what is with that Prince guy? Talk about a transvestite! I seriously thought it was a girl when I first watched this, but I stopped 3 quarters of the way through because I couldn't take it anymore! It just bugged me and made me think that the company is crap because of that one movie. Like what kind of sick twisted mind can someone have to make these kind of people? Another weird person was the tall man that helps the little girl get a job. Now what the heck is that? Is that even human? No it's not because NOTHING is human in that world, not even the girl because she is definitely weird.<br/><br/>1/10. Should get lower. I would give it a negative 100.

It is messed up Japanese, violent behavior that in no way teaches children anything but fear, submission, inappropriate behavior and that it is OK to treat people badly. How horrible !!!! I can't believe it has so many good reviews . Such a twisted, sad story. I would not recommend this movie. Calling people names is not nice, telling people that they will be killed is not nice. Children should not live in fear, even if it is just a movie character. As soon as the movie started, I wanted to stop but I decided to give it another chance and I regret it so bad.

","IT is so sad to see animated films that are just a waste of time. Might as well waste time watching new and dumpy cartoons on television. The director has gone crazy with this one, creating odd looking hags, vomiting freaks and a dumb protagonist. There was no point to the magical elements or even imagination that might have been in this movie because it was bloated with eccentricity.<br/><br/>I wonder why, though, because his other film, Princess Mononoke is a wonderful film with a good theme, meaning and character development. It seems that if you want to see animated films, you should just skip over Spiritied Away and try the Triplets of Belleville - that is truly a fine film."

The ending. *spoiler alert* Just imagine, if instead of the okay ending, this ending. Sen (chihiro) had one extra train ticket. Say she gives this ticket to Haku, and he says that his river was paved over etc., but she gives it to him and leaves...fast forward to next day at school, the teacher tells her to sit in the only extra spot.

I did like the girl, Sen. She was very natural and believable. I also liked the use of water surrounding the spirit island very much, it was beautiful. I almost bought the dvd sight unseen, so sure was I that I'd love it. I'm really glad I didn't because I'd never watch it again."

","I describe this movie as a ""collision"" between Alice in Wonderland, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and a role-playing video adventure game.<br/><br/>Alice because of the story.  Mononoke because of the look-and-feel and the tone of urgency.  Totoro because of the variety of walking wandering teddy-bears.  And video game because of the episodic way in which missions/quests are doled out to the main character.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't already watched other Miyazaki films.  But since I have, I consider Spirited Away to be merely a G-rated (more G than PG) version of Princess Mononoke.  Good for the kids, but not the best Miyazaki film for adults."

A half-hour went by, then another half-hour, then<br/><br/>another and eventually another.  Nope, can't be the story.  The<br/><br/>story's nice, heroic, a little scary, a good morality tale for little kids. <br/><br/>But on a school night there were no little kids in the theater.  There<br/><br/>were some technically brilliant flashes of animation, especially in<br/><br/>Sen's facial expressions.  All told, maybe 5 seconds' worth.  I'd call<br/><br/>it a 50/50 movie.  50% YES for kids, 50% NO for adults out for an<br/><br/>evening on their own.<br/><br/>So if you've got 6-year olds take them to the Saturday matinee. <br/><br/>Otherwise stay home, save the baby sitter money, tuck them in and<br/><br/>read them a book.

","Short review: Spirited Away is the best movie ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it.
Long review: I came across Spirited Away while I was reading the Guinness World Records 2012 book (the world cinema section, which also featured Crocodile Dundee and Das Boot), and one of my teachers saw it. She said it was awesome. I had initially not watched it, but I did mention that I saw My Neighbour Totoro, another movie that kicks ass (though not as much as this). Turns out she was a Ghibli fan and requested me to do the movies she wanted me to see (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo).<br/><br/>So the plot is this: A girl named Chihiro and her parents take a wrong turn and end up in what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. They go investigate it only to discover food there. The parents eat the food, only to be turned into pigs because that food was intended for the spirits. So Chihiro ends up trapped in the spirit world and has to try and escape from there before her parents are turned into food for the spirits. The animation is nice, there are excellent plot twists (like when it turns out Chihiro met Sen (the river spirit) as a child) and the soundtrack is lovely. It's the most awesome film ever, and I'm glad my teacher introduced me to it."

","Although I don't like the anime style of animation, it didn't bother me this time. The story, if it is literal, does not make much sense, the characterization is lousy, and the motivation of the characters' actions is completely unclear. If the story is symbolic, maybe I did not understand it. One of the reasons for this may be that there was no script for the film, but it was written along the way. There is also a cultural gap between the East and the West. The authors were aware of this, so English-language synchronization contains more text than the original Japanese version, in order to explain to the Western audience some of the things that the Japanese perceive. But I was watching the original Japanese version, so I was deprived of these explanations. Based on what I have written so far, it looks like I didn't like it, but it's not so. All objections are negligible before the unique beauty of this accomplishment. Rationally, I would impose an average grade of five, or perhaps six, but this film does not aim at reason, but wins at a much deeper level. That's why in 2003 it won the award that suits it the best - Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up. In addition, it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as the first anime ever nominated in this category. It is also one of the two animated films that have ever won Japan Academy Prize for picture of the year, and it holds the 27th place on the IMDb Top 250. Deserved.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Spirited away steals the spectators interest and brings them to a whole new magical world where spirits roam. With every second of this movie the spectator gets drawn more and more into the fascinating world of the spirits. A terrific film with very beautifull and touching scenes and even far more beatiful musical accomponation. Everyone who haven't seen it yet, should drop everything and go watch it."
"borghe-23388","10","1","2","15 March 2018"," Summary of the Movie (English Cast Mentioned) and Thoughts
","This film follows the adventure of a young Girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) who is moving to another town with her parents, but along the way is transported to the spirit realm via an abandoned amusement park. She soon meets a mysterious boy named Haku (Jason Marsden) outside a bath house who tries to get her back home before sunset and fails. He then tells Chihiro to find the boiler man Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers) and ask for work to survive. Chihiro soon makes a friend in worker Lin (Susan Egan) and an uneasy contract relationship with the owner Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette). After Chihiro starts working under the name Sen, she accidentally lets in a demon known as No-Face (Bob Bergen) who eventually terrorizes the bath house customers and staff. Chihiro eventually learns that Haku is a dragon that is being hunted by Yubaba's sister Zeniba (Pleshette) for stealing her golden seal. After Chihiro resolves to return the seal for Haku she confronts No-Face and succeeds in vacating him from the bath house. Chihiro boards a train bound for Zeniba's home and returns the seal and is delighted to see her friend Haku back and healthy again. While on their way from Zeniba's home to the bath house, Chihiro remembers a time when she was a young child and how she was saved from drowning in a river. When she recounts the story she mentions the name of the river being the Kohaku River and how Haku was the one that saved her. Haku thanks Chihiro dearly for remembering his name and returns her to the bath house so she may rescue her parents and leave the spirit world, never to look back and start her new life in her new town and home.<br/><br/>This movie is one of a coming of age story for the main character. She starts out as a rude, scared, and childish but grows to be much braver and kinder to the people around her as the movie goes on. Some scenes that focus on this include her willingness to help a dirty river spirit despite his stench and the difficulty of the task, her growing confidence when traveling the long stairway on the side of the building, and her resolve to help her friend Haku. This coming of age for young girls is common in Studio Ghibli films such as Keke's delivery service and Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>The viewer can very much see the coming of age in the movie via long shots of Chihiro's demeanor when walking up and down the stairs on the building. She becomes more and more confident about traveling these seemingly dangerous stairs compared to her first reaction to running down them screaming in the early minutes. This coming of age reaches a climax when she bravely runs across a decrepit water pipe that crumbles as she runs across.<br/><br/>This movie shows how much even a child can adapt to their new environment when they meet friends along the way and how they can positively affect each other's behavior. Chihiro was scared and depressed about moving to a new town but becomes more confident about it at the end of the film thanks to her experiences in the spirit realm."

"elicopperman","10","1","2","4 February 2018"," Hayao Miyazaki's Magnum Opus
","Like many people, I adore the work of Hayao Miyazaki, let alone Studio Ghibli. Not only are the worlds he creates through animation highly imaginative and gorgeous, but his characters and stories really make one think, especially with such themes like finding yourself, dangers towards the environment, survival, courage, over consumption, etc. So with that said, I not only deem his 2001 feature Spirited Away his best work, but also one of my personal favorite films of all time (and no Academy Award will ever be the reason why).<br/><br/>The story is that after getting lost on the drive to their new home, a couple and their 10 year old girl named Chihiro enter a tunnel passage that leads them into some spirit world. After eating a bunch of the spirit's food, the parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, the head of a bathhouse that many of the spirits work at. In order to save herself and her family, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse in order to get back to the human world, while also building up her courage and rediscovering memories she lost long ago. <br/><br/>I think this is the perfect set up for a great fantasy film, and the film does not fail in its execution. While the film focuses more on the plot, there are just enough fantasy moments to keep one's interest. Whether they be dark like the parents turning into pigs or Yubaba taking center stage, disgusting like the famous bath scene or the spirit No-Face hurling excruciatingly, or amusing like Chihiro working in the bathhouse, the film never holds back in letting its imagination run wild.<br/><br/>That being said, what really makes this film for me are the characters themselves. Chihiro could have easily been annoying, but the film managed to balance her anxious fear and emotions to where you relate to her in situations like....well, having to save your parents and overcome your biggest fears. The spirit Haku, while sometimes thieving, only does so to find his way home and remember who he is, considering how much he despises working under Yubaba's wing. Speaking of Yubaba, while she can be very threatening and rather bossy, she also tries her darnedest to keep her workforce stable, so one can relate to such pandemonium (even if one could resent her). <br/><br/>As for the other cast, No-Face is essentially a spirit who wants to get into the hearts of others, but simply doesn't know how. This is what causes him to go somewhat insane in the bathhouse and start consuming everything uncontrollably; good thing Chihiro came along to snap him out of reality. Sometimes, we can fly off the handle and only those who care for us can really make us feel better. In terms of supporting players, Lin can be saucy but does have a big heart and also has dreams of her own, Kamaji has a bit of a temper but also cares much for the support of Chihiro, Yubaba's baby goes from being a whiner to a kind soul through a spell that turns him into a mouse in order to teach him some manners, and the other spirits can range from weird to rather rude. Spirits sure are prejudice to humans, aren't they?<br/><br/>Given that this is a Studio Ghibli flick, it's no surprise that the animation is splendid beyond reason. The designs of the spirits are highly imaginative and strange, Chihiro's movements look very much like that of a little girl, the backgrounds are breathtaking, the effects are lavish, the CGI blends very well with the 2D environments, and the world building really makes one wish the film showed more. Each scene (whether comedic, dramatic or frightening) are all played up with just the right amount of tension to detail. I think the train scene with Chihiro, No-Face and the baby is one of the greatest scenes in all of cinema if only for how quiet and atmospheric it is, just letting the scenery do the talking for the audience rather than dialogue. <br/><br/>Lastly, the music score by Joe Hisaishi is a melodious treat. Like the animation, each track fits perfectly with whichever scene comes afloat, especially the train scene where it's more somber and mellow. The flying scenes have a lot of emotional appeal from the highly enchanting score that define just how gorgeous they look. Not to mention, the ending song might be stuck in your head for quite some time as it's heartwarming and symphonic enough to hit the right emotional spot for viewers.<br/><br/>To quote Rotten Tomatoes, Spirited Away is a ""gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by our world"". There's a reason this film still remains one of the greatest accomplishments in all of animation, let alone film. Not only does it embrace the world of fantasy to such an emotional and thought provoking degree, but it makes one think how they themselves would overcome moments of losing loved ones, or having to work to save themselves, or remembering who they are. Of all the wonderful features that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have cranked out, none of them will ever leave the same impact on me as this masterpiece did. If you are yet to see this film, track it down as soon as you can. You yourself might be inspired by your own personal struggles that would fit in the world of fantasy, just like what Miyazaki did with this gem."
"noraauditore","10","1","2","29 December 2016"," One of the greatest
","This masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki can be interpreted from so many aspects like sociology and psychoanalysis. I read many articles about the psychoanalytic interpretation of Spirited Away which basically tells that the bath house is actually a brothel and it symbolizes sex industry. Still, I prefer to focus another interpretation of this movie. There are very clear references to the pollution of nature in Japan and Hayao himself is being known as very sensitive for these kind of issues. He is very critical of his society and by Faceless, he tries to show this greed of capitalist societies, in my opinion. Also, Hayao loves to use child characters as protagonists (as we can see from Howl's moving castle, princess Mononoke, Kiki's delivery service and etc...) especially we can say it for girl characters. He used a random 10-years-old girl for this movie as protagonist and showed her development mentally."

","This movie is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. There are so many twists and turns through the story, each character is memorable with interesting traits and personalities. Each character is likable and you want to see them succeed and have a happy ending. The designs are beautiful, everything in this movie looks 100% original some creatures being adorable or scary but each being very creative and interesting and each with their own goals, flaws and strengths. The main character Chihiro is very relative and reacts like a real girl. The film is beautifully colored from start to finish and its a movie I could watch anywhere anytime. The only flaw of the movie is that it has to end."

","The film deals with the transition from child to adolescence of conflicts in the life of small Sen , a ten year old girl who moves to town accompany his father changed jobs . The film brings a vitality amazing, a study of colors serving as basis for study animators from around the world, and an animation system that modifies how we learn to watch Japanese cartoons .<br/><br/>The script is a bit like Alice's dilemma in Wonderland, chihiro have to grow and learn to turn, and only with maturity you can try to save his parents, steeped in a mystical universe very different from Western standards the film leaves no lover open mouth animation and eager to watch the film several times.<br/><br/>Recommend art lovers to watch the making of the film, true class animation."
"panteliskassotis","10","1","2","10 May 2016"," Hayao Miyazaki is the heir of Walt Disney. His films depict worlds in which nature in particular is more important than humans themselves.
","Its a solid story that hooks multiple generations. The musical score is great too. There are a ton of anime's and American animated films with great scores, but what I love about Spirited Away's score is the stuff centered around No Face. That weird set of repeating notes as he tries to give her gold is great. It is creepy the first time you see it, but the second time, when you know a little about No Face, its changes to something less dark and more mysterious which I find really hard to do with music. Usually creepy stays creepy. It's almost flawless though in the animation department. In the same way some movies are amazing from a cinematography perspective, Spirited Away is amazing because of the detail in the animation."
"khamphanthirathkaren","10","1","2","5 May 2016"," One of the best animated films, ever made
","Being nominated for the 2003 Academy Award for best animated feature film and winning, Spirited Away stars a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro and her start of a new life and meeting mysterious creatures:Gods, witches, and spirits.<br/><br/>This movie was created by the legendary movie maker Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli on the 20th of July, 2001. Chihiro and her parents have just moved to a small town; after trying to take a short cut, they become lost. They decide to explore an ""abandoned amusement park"". Chihiro's parents discover food and decide to eat and then pay later. Chihiro leaves to go exploring and finds a bath house. A boy named Haku finds Chihiro and tells her it isn't safe there and her and her parents must leave. Chihiro goes to find her parents and discovers that they have been turned into pigs and runs away in fear. Haku finds her and decides to help her into finding her parents. To do this, Chihiro must take up a job at a bath house.Chihiro goes to meet with the boss of the bath house, Yubaba. Yubaba wants Chihiro to work there forever so she tells Chihiro she owns her name now and her new name is Sen. While working at the bath house, Chihiro meets some interesting people and spirits such as a a woman named Lin, a radish spirit, a river spirit, and a spirit called No-face. The rest of the story revolves around Chihiro trying to rescue her parents, making new friends, and growing up.<br/><br/>The music and animation are spot on in the movie. The animation team had to go far as getting a scene with a dragon and examining a dog's mouth in order to get every particular aspect right. Miyazaki had based Chihiro off of one of his friend's daughter and wanted girls to connect to Chihiro. The animation is beautiful and perfect. The music also adds to the movie by giving it a sense of whimsical and magical elements. The plot was amazing and would've been longer if Miyazaki hadn't decided that a movie over 2 hours wouldn't be that well.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the movie is the theme of growing up and maturing. We see this as Chihiro takes on every challenge coming her way and transform from her childish self from the beginning, to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Spirited Away has such little details that seem unimportant at first, but only develop more to the story. Chihiro is a girl that girls around her age can easily relate because of her personality. The adventure revolves around growing up and trust. The characters all are very magical and both children and adults enjoy.<br/><br/>The rating I give this movie is 10/10!"
"nickpolsinelli","10","1","2","23 March 2016"," Hands Down: Best Animated Movie of All Time
","Spirited Away is easily the greatest animated movie ever made, and one of the greatest movies ever made, period.<br/><br/>Absolutely stunning. Amazing soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, possibly one of the best ever made. I remember watching this at age 14, when I was getting into anime. I'd been a fan of Miyazaki even since childhood; I grew up on My Neighbor Totoro and Castle in the Sky and all of his other films. I wasn't expecting much for this film at the time to be honest. But I was so wrong. <br/><br/>Spirited Away is everything, from it's mature themes about growing up, clever and revolutionary animation, gorgeous detail and colors, characters, imagination. Nothing can really describe this film, you have to watch it for yourself. <br/><br/>I would recommend this film to absolutely everyone, whether it be an anime fan or your average moviegoer. 10/10"

","I loved it. Great animations to a great story. Recommended 10/10.<br/><br/>The characters have great deep and nothing in the story is there for no reason. The whole movie has a feel of ""everything is thought of"", every detail has a purpose.<br/><br/>I was struck by a quality between generosity and love.<br/><br/>Again, animation is a painstaking process, and there is a tendency to simplify its visual elements. Miyazaki, in contrast, offers complexity. His backgrounds are rich in detail, his canvas embraces space liberally, and it is all drawn with meticulous attention.<br/><br/>Viewers, too, will escape the boredom of predictable animated fare. Director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke) treats his audience as imaginative and intelligent human beings, rather than catering to kids with rote displays of silliness, stunts and scares.<br/><br/>SPIRITED AWAY Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki; United States director, Kirk Wise; English language adaptation by Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H.

"timeacadm","8","1","2","8 March 2016"," Beautiful movie, like a fairytale but better!
","I really enjoyed this film and would watch it over and over again. Even though the ending left me feeling hollow, and the parents seem to change from the first and last scenes, it is funny and dramatic at the same time. It teaches the importance of work, and the gluttony of humanity -though it is not cynical in any way.- It is a good watch for the animation alone. A magical movie, it feels like a fairytale that was put into the modern world. I would have liked to see it in it's original Japanese because I feel it might have been more whole. Even so, if you want to see a movie by Studio Gibli, this one should be your foot in the door."

As they are exploring the area they come across festival grounds where Chihiro's parents find a booth with some food, after eating the food they are turned into pigs. The rest of the film centers around Chihiro trying to find a way to get her parents back to normal and return home. Along the way she meets a boy who becomes a dragon, a good witch and her evil twin sister and a no faced ghost like creature. I absolutely adore this film it is probably my first Studio Ghibli movie and really got me hooked into the world of anime. I give it a solid 10/10."
"willwoodmill","10","1","2","14 February 2016"," One the most beautiful and imaginative films ever.
","Every once in a while, someone with a great talent, and a beautiful vision gets the tools and funding they need to realize their vision, Spirited Away was one of those few, times. <br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki needs no introduction, he is the main director and co-founder of the best animation studio in the world, studio Ghibli. He made 10 films at studio Ghibli, nearly all of them masterpieces, Spirited Away was his 7th film, and his best. Spirited Away is one of the most original and creative films, scene after scene, there is nothing but new strand creatures, locations, and adventures, each scene is completely unforgettable and would be the high point in almost any other film. <br/><br/>Spirited Away is about a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, who, after moving to a new town, finds herself lost in the spirit world, and has to find her way out. Chihiro is one of the most likable protagonists of any film ever, and she has one of the most well done character arcs ever. As the film goes on ever about slowly changes, from her attitude, speech, and even little things like her stance and facial expressions. She goes from being a weak willed child, to a strong, intelligent, hero. <br/><br/>The animation in Spirited Away is probably some of, if not they best in any movie ever, with some of the best creature designs, and locations ever, not to mention the vivid background animation, and character movement, that flows so naturally during the more exciting scenes. Also apparently Hayao Miyazaki animated the film without a finished script and sort of made it up as he went along. <br/><br/>Spirited Away was insanely well received every where around the world, it became the highest grossing film in Japan, beating movies like titanic, and in America it became the first non American film to ever win the Academy Award best animated feature, made it onto Roger Ebert's ""great movies."" And is often listed as one of the best animated films of all time, rightfully so. <br/><br/>In my opinion the Best scenes in Spirited Away are the quiet ones where Chihiro just sits and takes in the amazing surroundings, like when she rides the train, and when she sits on the balcony of the bath-house during the night, these scenes have such a subtle beauty that can never be described in words. <br/><br/>10/10"
"carsonwfink","10","1","2","17 January 2016"," I'm a little bias
","Now let me just say that I love Spirited Away. It has been my favorite movie to watch from when it came out to now. I grew up watching it and the story is really interesting but a little hard to follow. This isn't something that any person would watch since the story is a little out there but if you are looking for something interesting to watch this is my top pick. I would honestly recommend this to anyone willing to watch it. I may be a little bias towards but thats because the story really got me into it and now i cant stop watch it. Really worth the watch and if you say it was a waste of your time. Well hey at least you gave it a try."
"nymeria-meliae","10","1","2","17 January 2016"," Hand drawn
","Sometimes I really wished that you could reply to other reviewers rather than have to write a full review yourself. <br/><br/>Being married to a Japanese person means that Miyazaki has God-like status in our household. I remember the first time I ever saw Princess Mononoke on TV in Japan and I was blown away by it... the detail in the animation was unbelievable and I just watched it and watched it again and again... I could not believe that anything would ever come close to beating that film as the greatest piece of animation ever created. I was wrong... Spirited Away blew it out of the water. <br/><br/>The first thing I want to address though... if like my family, you buy every Miyazaki film ever released from Japan with all the extras then you will know that Spirited Away may have been animated using computers but every scene was hand drawn first. The second disc in the full DVD package includes the entire film with soundtrack but using the hand drawn pages for the animation. This film is NOT some computer generated excuse for animation like one Tom and Jerry fan suggested. This was all hand drawn and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the animation genius that is Miyazaki. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>Secondly, story line. The overall plot might have similarities to Alice in Wonderland but it is nowhere near a direct copy of the book. To suggest that it is an Alice in Wonderland rip off is like me suggesting you pulled that reference straight off of Wikipedia. So she goes through a tunnel into another world... big wow... Alice is not the only adventure that goes through a tunnel into another world. If we are going to draw very loose references to stories then it is a rip off of Homer's Odyssey when the crew get turned into pigs for eating forbidden food on the island. I don't remember Alice's parents ever entering Wonderland or the plot of the story centering about Alice trying to restore her family to humans. Alice is essentially about the play of language... and the only similarity other than entering a tunnel to Spirited Away is the power of names. <br/><br/>The plot of Spirited Away is complex... there are several subplots surrounding a main plot. The main story is about Chihiro trying to rescue her parents while trying to survive in a hostile world full of prejudice. The main message of the film, however, is about the evils of greed. Each subplot in the film demonstrates the evil of greed. Just like Mononoke was about the environment. In Spirited Away there is an environmental message included as there is in almost all Miyazaki films - the river God being cleaned... but the main message is that greed leads to bad things happening. However, for me the most outstanding piece was the power of names. My only regret was that Miyazaki didn't take this further. <br/><br/>END OF SPOILER<br/><br/>So overall, the film is quite possibly the greatest piece of animation ever created. It has a story and it has a message if you bother to look for them beyond the bedazzlement of the art work and soundtrack. With Mononoke I watched the film several times and then started getting bored with it as the magic waned... I have yet to get bored of Spirited Away and have watched it almost twice as much as Mononoke. <br/><br/>It is scary for a child but no more so than a Disney film. My 4 year old will leave the room when Maleficent comes on screen in Sleeping Beauty, and she will cover her eyes when the evil Queen appears in Snow White. She covers her eyes at parts of Spirited Away too... but she watches the film to the end. It is definitely a film to be watched with adults though... it is not a film to put your child down and leave them with the TV as a babysitter... but who is to say that all animation is designed solely for children?"
"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","2","15 January 2016"," Simply Magical
","I could start this off with a fun fact, but I have something better: a story. The first time I watched this movie was in a Gifted and Talented class in school. My teacher, Mr. Gagnon, was a cool guy with great taste in film, so he showed us this film at the end of the year. I had never seen a film like this before, and I was put off. It weirded me out and made me wonder why everyone thought it was so great.<br/><br/>If I could, and it wouldn't throw a wrench into the time-space continuum, I would go back and time and strangle younger me.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this now, I am blown away by how magical it is. Some people call this the greatest animated movie of all time, and I do not particularly disagree. In any way films can be measured, this is spectacular. It almost seems too good to be real, like it's the kind of movie that only exists in your dreams.<br/><br/>2001 was a horrible year for the world thanks to the 9/11 attacks. But it was a great year for art, particularly non-American art. The Harry Potter film franchise kicked off in a big way. So did the LoTR franchise, which I will be getting to as we edge closer to my all-time favorite films. Amelie came out in France. And Japan got both this masterpiece and my favorite video game of all time, Final Fantasy X.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is Chihiro, a young girl moving to a new home. On their way there, her family takes a detour through some woods and ends up in a rundown amusement park. Upon seeing plates upon plates of unguarded food, her parents make the absolute worst decision a character can make in a film like this and eat it. As a result, they turn into pigs, for that food was meant for the spirits. Left alone, Chihiro is forced to navigate this treacherous world and look for them.<br/><br/>Character development is important in all tales, but particularly these kinds. And this movie has bucketloads of it. If you want to turn off the movie in the first ten minutes because you don't like Chihiro: don't. She experiences more and better done character growth than almost any character I've ever seen. It's not constantly pointed out (thankfully), but you can't miss it.<br/><br/>There are movies that you know from the first five minutes that you're gonna hate. There are movies that disappoint you. There are movies that you grow to like as they play on. And then there are movies that you know from the first five seconds are going to be amazing (if you're not a kid with no taste in film like I was). This film falls firmly into that fourth category.<br/><br/>One Summer's Day is quite possibly the most beautiful piece Joe Hisaishi has ever composed, and that is saying something. It is our guide through this film, popping up when it is most needed. I always welcome it, but it has by far the most impact right at the start of the film. If you have any doubt that you're in for a magical adventure, it should disappear instantaneously.<br/><br/>All the characters in this are three-dimensional and unique and interesting. You're invested in these people and creatures. You want to see what happens to them. This is sort of strange because they're all based on standard character types, and they don't throw in crazy twists or turns, but the way they carefully develop each and every character makes them fascinating.<br/><br/>I am imagine many parents threw this film to entertain their kid while they did their work, told their kid they'd watched the first five minutes, and ended up watching all of it. It's that kind of movie.<br/><br/>This doesn't need to be said considering it is a Miyazaki film, but the art is amazing. There is one sequence in particular, where Chihiro is following a boy named Haru through a field of flowers, that blows my mind away. Even the first time I watched this, I had to admit that scene was incredible. By the early two-thousands, Miyazaki had begun to incorporate a lot of 3-D animation into these 2-D animated movies, and it shows. The lines are crisper, the colors are deeper, and the awe is deeper. And even if you prefer the old, completely 2-D Miyazaki films like Lapita, you can't don't that the flower sequence would not have been possible without it.<br/><br/>Mr. Miyazaki planned to retire after making Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. I'm glad he didn't. If he had stopped creating art, we would not have gotten Ponyo, Howl's Moving Castle, the phenomenal The Wind Rises, or this masterwork. And most of the old Miyazaki movies would have never gotten released in the States.<br/><br/>After this movie pulled off a surprising Best Animated Feature win at the Oscars (the first time a non-American animated movie had ever been awarded with that), a new interest in Miyazaki's work rose in the West, enabling Lasseter and Co. to bring the movies over and get them all good-to-great English dubs.<br/><br/>Great movies draw me into their worlds. This movie keeps me in its."

","Beautiful movie. Touching, artistic and full of depth. Not a children's movie by any means, but a good family film, and an excellent discussion piece. The animation is amazing, and the story line engaging. Definitely recommend. The characters are all detailed, and easy to relate to. The story has a good message, and is complex enough to keep adults engaged, and moves quick enough to keep children engaged. Lots of discussion topics can be taken from this film if you decided that you wanted to discuss it with other people. I've found that this film is a very individual experience from watching this film, everyone takes something else from this movie. The world that has been created in this movie is fantastical and amazing. There is a lot of layers to the world, and it's a wonderful addition to the world of fantasy. Engaging, beautiful and a touching story. Everyone should watch, I think it's a film that needs to be watched and appreciated, especially if you enjoy beautiful films."

","The movie sets itself as a very amusing movie about a young girl. And the plot and setting of scene is a beautiful part of Japan that I know of. I also know that the color, intensity and the movie itself was brilliant. But it wasn't the best. Although there are many other movies (Japanese Anime) that are related to this stuff this doesn't top them all. As I have seen most anime's and the American dubbing I will admit kind of spoils the point of the movie to a direction where you can't watch all of it. It's not anything against American accents it's just that I prefer the Japanese over the American situation. Other then that there is nothing else that I wouldn't like besides as I said the ideal and setting of the movie is amazing."
"gheremond","10","1","2","18 August 2015"," The best animated movie money can buy
","If you know an animated film that is truly superior to Spirited Away, please please let me know asap for I cannot think of anything that can even remotely compete with this incredible gem from Studio Ghibli and the great Hayao Miyazaki (and I've watched all the usual suspects). Not only does it represent the very best in animated storytelling available, it also puts most live action features to shame! Miyazaki has delivered some amazing movies in the past (like Laputa, Naussica and Princess Mononoke), but this time around his story and execution are so brilliant that Spirited Away soars in stratospheric altitudes. By the time Chihiro and friends embark that train during the third act, under Hisaishi's haunting score, you are certain you are witnessing a monumental epic."

","In Spirited Away one can watch the amazing adventure of ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino, who enters a magic world with her parents by accident. Frightened and alone, she observes as the world she ventured into reveals itself as a luxurious retreat for spirits to revitalize themselves. Definitely one of the best animated movies ever made by Hayao Miyazaki, Spirited Away is meant for both young and old audiences. Though fascinating, the script is pretty difficult to fully understand the first time you watch the movie. The animation, voice-overs and characters' depth are all excellent, making this film a top quality one. Personally, this is one of my favourite movies."
"asandor","10","1","2","14 July 2015"," One of Animations greatest achievements
","Spirited Away is a film directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, and animated by Studio Ghibli. It is also one of my favourite films. The animations are absolutely breath-taking, which is a staple from many Ghibli films. However, Spirited Away does something special, creating a world that will consistently amaze with its attention to detail, and the magical fantasy it brings to the table.<br/><br/>The film is about a young girl, Chihiro, who is trapped in the spirit world, and has to save her parents from a calculating witch, Yubaba. She is helped by a colourful cast of characters who are all charming, but all morally ambiguous as well. This film is detailed to the extreme in the story and character department as well!<br/><br/>As mentioned, this is one of my favourite films. It is an absolute work of art, and should be recognized as a classic. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, adult and (maybe more mature) children alike. This film does contain scenes that may frighten young children, but the fantasy elements capture even my imagination. This film will definitely expand your horizons.<br/><br/>This is a flawless film for families. It is absolutely recommended. 10/10"
"Nookielet","10","1","2","1 March 2015"," Spirited Away
","The film ""Spirited Away"" by Hiyao Miyazaki is an excellent example of Japanese animation for multiple reasons such as the overall message, musical content, colorful visual arts, character depiction, and underline backstory. Spirited away is an animated fantasy about a ten year old girl named Chihiro who was moving to a new home in an unfamiliar place with her parents. She enters a fantasy world where she takes a journey with Haku a mysterious boy who helps her map through this unknown world.<br/><br/>The film begins with Chihiro and her parents driving to their new home where they end up lost when her father decides to take a shortcut through the woods. They stumbled upon an abandoned amusement park. They discovered a shack filled with delicious food in which Chihiro's parents indulged themselves until they literally turned into pigs. As the day turned night you could see the spirits come to life as the seemingly abandoned amusement park comes to life. While trying to find a job Chihiro is assisted by Lin who was bribed into taking her to see Yubaba. The whole time Chihiro was in the bathhouse she was sneaking around usually with the assistance of someone else. It didn't really help that the whole time hungry spirits could smell her human scent which made it difficult for her to hide anywhere. <br/><br/>When she finally reached Yubaba and convinced her to give her a job, Yubaba made Chihiro sign a contract in which she stole characters from her name renaming her to Sen. This was probably the most adventurous scene of the entire movie. There was a scene midway through the movie where Haku takes Chihiro to see her parents. He wants her to remember which of the pigs her parents were. At the end of the scene Haku turns into a dragon and flies away. Chihiro also sees the faceless spirit known as ""No Face"" who has been stalking her since she first arrived at the bathhouse. This scene quickly reminds you that this story is very much a fantasy story.<br/><br/>Another important scene from the movie involves ""No Face"" the mysterious creature who has been obsessed with Sen. He started eating all of the bathhouse employees after Sen rejected his money offering. Upset Sen will not acknowledge him he attempts to eat her. Sen gave him a piece of magical cake she received from a water spirit. This gluttonous angered spirit chased her all over the bathhouse puking all of the things he has swallowed. ""No Face"" turned back to normal and assisted Sen on her journey to return the stolen scroll to Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba. This scene is the epitome of what a fantasy adventure should be.<br/><br/>The final scene ends with Chihiro and Haku leaving Zeniba's home. Haku is in dragon form and Chihiro is on his back. As they are flying back Chihiro remembers when she first met Haku and that his real name was the Kohaku River because he was the Kohaku River spirit. This broke the spell turning Kohaku back into human form. Kohaku's dragon scales disappear as Chihiro and Kohaku free fall from the sky remembering everything they had forgotten.<br/><br/>There are many reviews on the ""imdb"" website that would almost completely disagree with me. They have gripes that the movie story line was not complete enough. Complaints that ""Spirited Away"" was never direct in delivering messages; one in particular the love story between the two main characters. Some people simply did not like the English voice actors. Even though the ""Hated it"" section has a lot of hate for the movie, their love for the visual works of the movie are consistent. Most of them really enjoyed the visual works of Hiyao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>Not only did this film have a beautiful message it was accompanied by a beautiful musical soundtrack. The music was composed and produced by Joe Hisaishi and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. Some of the songs include ""One Summer's Day"" and ""Always with Me."" These songs give the film a nostalgic, calming and a fairytale like feeling; it really helps the viewer get in the correct mind state to effectively grasp the concept of the movie.<br/><br/>In addition to wonderful music, the exquisite visual arts the director provides only enhances the viewing experience. The visual arts showcases the Japanese culture in the best way possible. It gives you a look into the beautiful colors and the architectural aspect of a Japanese city while still maintaining to give the amusement park an American familiarity. The way the characters are drawn does the same thing as well, watching the movie in English you might forget that the movie originally came from Japan but the director was sure to infuse his culture into the movie so subtly yet heavily that it is difficult to forget where the movie originated.<br/><br/>Chihiro is the main character of the movie. When the movie starts she is a typical scared young girl. As the movie progresses she becomes a hardworking, responsible, and brave young girl. She is also very kind hearted in nature. Many times throughout the movie her kindness gets her into trouble but it usually equals out to her kindness getting her out of trouble.<br/><br/>Haku is another main character in the movie. He is a few years older than Chihiro and carries the title of my favorite character in the movie. At a glance he seems a bit rude and he is very serious when it comes to his job. When you come to know his true character he is very kind hearted and considerate.<br/><br/>""Spirited Away"" has and always will be one of my favorite childhood movies. Weather it is the breath taking art work, the phenomenal story line or the amazing music, I will always watch this movie over again to remind myself why I love this excellent animated film."
"deadmousefetish","10","1","2","24 November 2014"," One of my all time favorites
","Hayao Miyazaki at his best. I find new things about this movie every time I watch it. I can not say enough good things about this movie. The animation as always for Miyazaki is breath taking and his sparse use of computer animation only emphasizes the beauty of it's use. This is a very magical movie for me with a rich story and relatable characters in an unbelievable setting. Miyazaki's long carer of making wonderful stories is showcased in this movie. With hidden massages and wonderful surprises thru out the movie. You can see the craft and care Miyazaki takes with his movies in this particular film. Well I don't have enough lines for IMDb so I am now going to add this to make them happy. I really did not want to give away the plot or any spoilers so yeah."
"owlcity-angels-rainbowve","10","1","2","9 September 2014"," One of the best films. Period.
","First off, I don't watch much anime (or at least I used too) but spirited away blew me away. It's the film that got me into anime movie (mainly Ghibli's). <br/><br/>(MINOR spoilers) A girl and her family (mom,dad) are moving to a new city, when they get lost trying to find their new house, they find what seems to (to the father at least) to be an abandoned carnival. The parents find food laying out in the open at one of the shops; they eat it vowing to pay later. It turns out the food is ghosts/spirits food and they get turned into pigs. The daughter, Chichiro, is casts into a new world filled with spirits, monsters, ghosts, witches and more! She must learn how to escape and save her parents.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film is very well done, it doesn't go fast nor slow but rather naturally progresses. The animation style seems sort of westernized, so it might be easier to watch if you're used to western animation. The two things that really stood out for me though where the soundtrack and the characters. The soundtrack sets the tone for each scene amazingly. The music for the scenes with no face really get you into it, the song Kaonashi ( or no face) has a sort of mystery and ambiance in it that fully engage you in the film. Second, all of the characters are so full of life and personality; from the simple soot balls to chichiro, even no face who can't even talk has a big personality! Overall I loved this film to death, No face, was an amazing character that intrigued me. Go watch spirited away if you haven't! even if you hate anime!"

A realization of brilliant fantasy and imagination, this animated feature is a realistic depiction of strange tales with plenty remarkable animated scenes that are everlasting. <br/><br/>There is nothing much one can complain about this film because it is just perfect in various aspects; from the character creations, art direction, running time and to the storyline. Besides the magnificent film making and cinematography, this film is everlasting as it is also filled with plenty of expressive themes and elements that everyone could relate to as well as being entertained.<br/><br/>Even more, this film is filled with a lot of strange and adorable magical creatures or spirits such as Susuwatari, Kaonashi, Shikigami, Ootori-sama, Kashira, witches, yuna, giant baby, river spirit, radish spirit and many others which are quite funny to watch. Each of these spirits have their own purpose of existence and you may be able to learn a little about them from this film!<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with strange tales, you may find this film overwhelming but in the end, Spirited Away (2001) is nothing short of breathtaking and you may eventually come to love it.<br/><br/>PS.

"iambatwoman","9","1","2","22 August 2014"," You don't have to be a child to feel awe over Spirited Away!
","Beautiful creatures and monsters fill the screen in bright colours, even if the story isn't to your taste the animation is cute and creative. The first Ghibli movie I ever saw was Howl's Moving Castle and I had never seen anything like it, with a childhood mostly made up of Disney animation how could I? I think most people will fall in love with Studio Ghibli at first watch.<br/><br/>I will never know how it will feel to watch Spirited Away as a child, unfortunately, but as an adult it still encapsulates feelings of wonder, adventure, scariness and awe. I must also add that the score by Joe Hisaishi is as equally beautiful as the animation, with track Dragon Boy being the most inspiring artistically."

I have watched it in English and Japanese and think both are wonderful. No Face was a bit creepy but interestingly so. Boh was annoying to me at first but I started to like him.

","This movie is one of the most well-known Studio Ghibli movies in the world. A regular girl in Japan slip into this unreal ""the other side"" of the world where people in Japan always talked about from ancient time. This movie has such unique Japanese elements. The story is well-written, too. The director, Hayao Miyazaki did wonderful expressing/drawing that there are so many gods in Japan and how they might have been treated, if they were existing. Also, it shows how some societies are worked out nowadays whether in Japan or anywhere else. It's kind of ironic. A very interesting way of seeing/understanding the world."
"MMRvT","10","1","2","21 June 2014"," Astounding Movie
","I first watched this movie when it aired on cartoon network a few years ago. I absolutely loved it, the soundtrack and effects work perfectly with the story. The characters are lovable and easy to associate with. When No Face starts going crazy I was on the edge of my seat hoping he wouldn't get Chihiro. The ending was absolutely perfect with Chihiro finding out who Haku really was. It was also quite comical when Yubaba couldn't recognize her own son. This movie is a perfect film throughout and has no flaws. When Chihiro found Zeniba's house I found that part of the movie quite touching and loving. Zeniba the complete opposite of her sister provided Chihiro with the love and affection she was missing. Giving No Face a new home. The movie has a lot of life lessons that should be taken to heart. Studio Ghibli struck gold with this and I'll always thank Disney for getting this to the states."
"eklavya-cwk","10","1","2","16 June 2014"," Animation and its power.........beyond ordinary imaginaton
","Spirited away, what a weird movie, what a boring animation.....this is what dead body will call it because no one in his right mind can leave without appreciating something or the other of this movie. Extraordinary animation, brave and completely unique script, amazing characters and dialogues. Each and everything in this movie was perfect.<br/><br/>I am surprised that such things are so common in the outside world. Spirited Away provides with a brilliant story in a non-physical world which becomes physical, but nothing of that is so good as compared to its killer animation. The transformation of figures, the expressions, ideas like one way train and what not. Its a fantasy world that will not just shiver and thrill your brain but whole back and spine will be quenched in mystery. Its better to watch this movie than to read about it. Very few movies have capacities of entertaining for whole length and this is one of it."

And though confirmation of any sequel to Spirited Away has burned to the ground now that Hayao Miyazaki has retired, my hopes will still live on. Together Ghilbli studios and Hayao Miyazaki have dominated the anime world. I don't know how they come up with these stories, and I probably don't understand all of what it represents, but maybe that's why I can watch it repeatedly. I learn something new or notice something different every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Just amazing. It's heartbreaking, adorable, comedic, intriguing and visually aesthetic all in one.

"benthelazar","10","1","2","26 March 2014"," The Great Masterpiece
","If I were to watch one movie as I lay dieing, it would definitely be Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001). I would like to die right at the moment when Chihiro and No Face are the last ones on the train. But in all honesty, any moment in this movie would be a great final sight. It has some of the most impressive animation in the history of the art, but it also tells one of the greatest stories in movie history. It's a basic coming of age story, but with such imagination, emotion and well made characters that it is one that will be watched and enjoyed a hundred years from now, that I have no doubt.<br/><br/>The story follows a ten year old girl named Chihiro and her quest to save her parents from a bathhouse running witch named Yubaba. If that does not hook you, I don't know what will. Add some beautifully drawn river spirits and bizarre creatures that would shock even Lewis Carroll, and you've got the makings of a great movie.<br/><br/>Besides the fantastic story and characters, the thing that makes this a masterpiece is that it's a tremendous labor of love that is. Not that it was difficult to make, considering the fact that Miyazaki is animated gold, but that there are hundreds of unnecessary little details that cement the movies beauty. The way water moves and reflects, for example. It is so realistic that we became totally engrossed in the story. Or look in the windows of the bathhouse. You will find whole stories that have no connection to the central one, but they give such a feeling of busyness and movement that I couldn't imagine the movie without them. Most backgrounds in animated movies are very still, they can't distract from the story. But the ones in Spirited Away demand your attention. It's a good thing that the story is so compelling.<br/><br/>The story is a basic coming of age type deal. But most of us take a long time to make the progress that that Chihiro makes of the course of the movie. Sometimes we wish there was an event like this one that would inspire us to take action. But usually a single event that causes maturity is a tragic or traumatic one, where as Chihiro's is one of spectacular adventure. Scary, yes, but she faces it with great bravery so that the trauma questions that usually pop up in the back of my head in movies like this never come up in Spirited Away.<br/><br/>I mentioned fantastic creatures, and this movie delivers them, I think more than any other movie. They are powerful creatures of few words, who let their very existence be their power. My personal favorite is the Radish Spirit. He looks vaguely like Meat Loaf in Fight Club (1999) and does little except for ride in an elevator with Chihiro and do a happy dance. But the tantalizing possibility of the existence of such an incredible creature has elevated him to one of my favorite movie characters. The most affecting is Stink God. I remember a tremendous feeling of sadness hit me when he slimed in the rain towards the bath house. He was so alone and hated, you can't help but feel sympathy for him (plus, he inspires a great reaction from Chihiro). But the most memorable is No Face. He is one one of the great misunderstood monsters of the screen. When Chihiro shows him a little kindness, he tries to repay her in any way he can, which involves hurting some people on accident. With minimal noise, he inspires great sympathy and awe. He is also a wonder of animation, disappearing from scene to scene, rapidly changing in size and seemingly texture.<br/><br/>As the story draws to it's conclusion, it's an interesting to note that we want Chihiro to return to the human world. This is a snag that many children's movies hit. Why would you want human friends if you have Totoro or why would you go back to Kansas if you have Oz? But there is enough peril in the bathhouse and Chihiro is human enough that she needs to return to the human world; she has no place with the spirits.<br/><br/>Consider the title. Nobody ever says that in the movie, in fact Chihiro takes her entry into this fantastic world very rationally. But the title is directed to us, the audience. We are spirited away to a place beyond the imagining of mere mortals. Miyazaki lets us in on his mad dreams, and we couldn't care less."
"supratim86","10","1","2","11 February 2014"," There is no other word to describe this movie, but to Experience it.
","I have always been a lover of animated films all my life. I got a DVD of this movie from my friend Hillol when I was doing my grad. He said, ""Don't ask question, watch it."" and the same I did. I was not concentrating too much at the start. I will not lie, I thought how much good can a Japanese movie can be? <br/><br/>By the end, I was sitting still with my eyes open all the time. Phenomenal story, Magical music direction from Mr. Joe Hisaishi and the effort in designing the world, what studio Ghibli have put, can not be overstated. From the starting to the end the story went on like a river leaving me blind to everything else. The attention to detail in every scene is so well managed, in which our little Chihiro runs, cries, laughs. <br/><br/>I became so fond of Japanese animated movies, I bought all the movies made by Mr. Miyazaki. I have seen Spirited Away about 10 times and each time I watch this, I become happy every time forgetting everything else."

","I have to say this first, I am a huge Hayao Miyazaki fan, and this film is his best. I also really like Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but Spirited Away beats them all. I fist watched this film in 2012 and I regret not watching it sooner in life, as I am a movie goer. I am 17 years old now and I still think that this is one of the most sophisticated film ever. Spirited Away does as the title intends to do with yours. I was lifted into the dazzling world full of complex thoughts and characters. The characters in this film are so well formed and developed. My favorites have to be Haku, Chihiro, Yubaba, and Lin. The animation in this film is spectacular, some of the best hand drawn animation ever. I can see myself watching this movie with my kids in the future or just watching it by myself to reflect on life. If I could give this movie a 12 I would, but I can not. Spirited Away is a must watch. IT'S AMAZING.

"lenii1337","7","1","2","31 December 2013"," Hayao Miyazaki is a genius and it really shines in this masterpiece
","When I first saw the movie, I didn't see what the big deal was. All right, so a girl gets whisked away to a fantasy world? We've heard that story before. And, unlike many other movies, there's no dramatic love story or epic battles and action scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. Consequently, I didn't think of it as being very exciting.<br/><br/>Still, I watched it again and, for some reason, I got it the second time around. Spirited Away isn't meant to be anything grand, with all the bells and whistles. It has a quiet, subdued way of telling a simple story about a simple girl in a very strange world. Instead of expecting something huge, just sit back, watch, and appreciate the world and story Miyazaki has finely crafted for us all to enjoy.<br/><br/>To get to the technical aspects...<br/><br/>The art is, of course, amazing. The colors are rich and the animation is fluid. When Chihiro and her family first walk into the spirit world, you can practically feel the breeze as you watch it whisk through the grass. The lights of the spirit world at night are breathtaking. And watching the train ride closer to the end of the movie, coupled with the amazing music score (the track is called ""The Sixth Station""), remains one of my most favorite animation sequences out of anything I've seen. Which brings me to another point: the music.<br/><br/>I will get this out of the way first - Joe Hisaishi is one of my favorite composers. His music style is very simple, but he makes every note count. Most of his music is quite subdued in nature and takes a careful ear to notice when your eyes are being captivated by what's going on in the screen, but do take notice if you have the chance. Or search on YouTube for videos of his live performances. His music is a joy to listen to. Like with Spirited Away, Hisaishi's music lacks all the ""bells and whistles"" per se, but it's beauty lies in its simplicity. Hisaishi has not failed here in Spirited Away.<br/><br/>I dearly loved the characters. One of the best parts of this movie, for me, was that it lacked any clear good or evil characters. Everyone has a bit of both, though perhaps some allow the evil sides of them to come out a bit more obviously than others. In this way, it's very realistic. Granted, the characters were all quite predictable and Chihiro grated on my nerves at times, but overall, I enjoyed each and every one of the characters Miyazaki has create here."
"FernandaToro","10","1","2","10 August 2013"," Spirited Away, a Miyazaki's dream?
","In 2004, I had the opportunity to see Spirited Away by the first time a Saturday morning, though I did not pay much attention and I jumped it like a ""good movie"", nothing more.<br/><br/>Nine years later, I came across this tape again by chance and to be older and more aware I observed carefully and tried to warn even the smallest item. It was impossible, of course, as I could see Spirited Away up to 10 times and each time I'd discover new details.<br/><br/>To define this magnificent piece, of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki who is perhaps the most consistent filmmaker I know, you don't need more than thinking of the strangest and surprising dream you've ever hat and there it is, it is essentially this film, a dream in its purest essence, a surreal dream world that never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>Beyond what has already been said about Spirited Away, I don't think my notes are a revelation, but I just share them: for me, Chihiro is to Hayao Miyazaki what Alice is to Lewis Carroll, both stories are fantasy and display of creativity at its finest expression."
"anushasherchan","10","1","2","14 June 2012"," This is a review of spirited away
","Spirited Away (""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro"") is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy- adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. Since the Japanese anime movie was translated in English, the actual stars that did the voices were different. The main character of the movie is Chihiro voice by Rumi Hiiragi (Japanese version) and Daveigh Chase (English version), Haku voice by Miyu Irino (Japanese version) and Jason Marsden (English version), Yubaba/ Zeniba voice by Mari Natsuki (Japanese version) and Suzanne Pleshett (English Version) and other minor characters like Lin (worker in the bathhouse), Kamajii (boiler man), Chihiro's mom and Chihiro's dad. The setting of Spirited away is during the 1990's in a traditional Japanese bathhouse. This movie is full of Adventure/Fantasy. <br/><br/>The movie starts when Chihiro,a 10 year old girl is in the car with her parents and they are on their way to their new house in the suburbs when her father takes a shortcut and they end up in a abandoned theme park. Chihiro's father wants to explore it so Chihiro's mother goes along with him but, Chihiro doesn't think it's a good idea so she tries to stop them but they don't listen to her and they end up going anyways and she follows them since she doesn't want to stay alone in the car. While exploring it they find a deserted stall piled with food and they start eating. They insists Chihiro to eat with them but she has a bad feeling about it so she refuses and she wanders away by herself and finds a grand bathhouse, a boy warns her to leave before its nightfall. When she runs back to her parents, they have been turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro now takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and escape back to the human world.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about the movie was the animation. Miyazaki and his staff had been experimenting with the process of computer animation. They started learning more about the computer and its programs like soft image but each character was largely animated by hand. During the process of editing the movie they had difficulty cutting down the length of the movie. Miyazaki learned that if he made the movie according to his plot it would be 3 hours long so he had to delete many different scenes so that the movie was simple. I love how he made the characters,the characters were very unique. In most of the movies the main character is usually very ""pretty"" but i liked how Miyazaki made her very plain and simple because it shows even plain and simple can be ""charming"".<br/><br/>I loved the background Music that was used in the movie because it also helps the movie be successful. The music helps the audience convey the feelings of fear,joy, and relief. One example is when Haku tells Chihiro to leave before its nightfall and she is running to her parents and she finds out her parents have been turned into pigs and she is alone and she doesn't know what is going on. The music conveys the fear from Chihiro into the audience. Another example is when she was walking down the stairs and she was so scared because she thought she was going to fall so she was going down the stairs very slowly and one of the stairs broke and she ran down the stairs very fast. For this the music also coveys the fear of chihiro into the audience. <br/><br/>In my opinion I think Spirited away was a Fantastic movie. I really love everything about the movie I don't have any complains about this movie. I strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it. It one of my favorite movies and I have watched it more than 1000 times. It's such a beautiful movie and the story line is just perfect. I think Hayao Miyazaki is genius because I have seen most of the movies he wrote and I have fallen in love with each and every one of them. To be honest I used to hate adventure movies, I was like obsessed about romantic movies but after I saw his movie I fell in love with it. I highly highly recommend this movie and hope people watch it because there is NOTHING bad about this movie and you will love it."

","This film requires viewers with philosophical mindsets, those who are true to understanding artistic nature of a piece of motion art.<br/><br/>I first saw Spirited Away on TV 8 years ago, and at that time i didn't even know anything about anime.. the moment i saw this, i was transfixed, because this was really different from anything i saw.... i am not saying it has only added new concepts, or new layers of animation technology, or a very original story.... I am saying this movie is more special than any other movie because it has no ancestors and no descendants... (imagine visiting mars, and watching any film that those martians see, just saying, and then importing them to earth)<br/><br/>And of course, this is a complete movie, with no recognizable flaws seen whatsoever... it is full of philosophy and magical undertones... by magic, i don't mean it is a literary fictional piece... in fact, for most of the viewers, this film can get more personal than ever, because it transports them to a place that has been unimagined and then lures them to believe such a philosophical setting exists in reality... i mean, this film is that much absorbing.... at the end, you cannot discard it being just a fictional story, rather it exists on your list of miracles that has now become a favorite part of your memory.<br/><br/>Art exists everywhere, you just need to experience it, feel it, and then understand it... things like production values, use of neat dialogues, or fine use of music really don't matter after all... they all just come naturally with the movie, but they are not main factors.. just like understanding another person, when you watch a movie, what you really appreciate is the heart at the core of the film, what the story and the characters and the settings really mean to you and your heart.... and i believe, Hayao Miyazaki has really developed the heart of this film to its full entity...... No wonder this film gets all the praise that it deserves.....<br/><br/>It is a visionary masterpiece, with philosophical greatness, and a really really wonderful film to enjoy, chill and cherish about....."

","After seeing the whole movie, i didn't have to think twice about going back and watching it again, it was an awesome experience. Some of the characters were beyond strange, but of everything i did absolutely adore the little things between Haku and Chihiro they were beyond cute. <br/><br/>I do recommend this, to all ages, it gives you quite the perspective of adventure and a new sense in realizing the differences in everything. <br/><br/>The movie was really thrilling it was a bridge from our world to another. it absolutely was, i want to get it on DVD. <br/><br/>Anyone, anyone at all would love it, at times it seems like a little kiddie then other times it appears more mature and more advanced but its in the middle its really good for all ages. I guess you just need to understand it. Wonderful characters (well, some of them), effects were good, designs were something i haven't seen before, it was all pleasant.<br/><br/>All i can really say to explain it is that its; A bridge from our world to another."
"estreet-eva","8","1","2","5 December 2011"," Miyazaki's Classic
","We caught the next in the continuing series of Hayao Miyazaki?s animated children?s movies playing at our town theater this weekend. ?Spirited Away? is considered his masterwork and features his classic themes including environmentalism, a plucky young girl, witches and other magical creatures and the consequences of an older generation?s greed. Unlike other of his films there is no backdrop of war in a fanciful land but rather a move to the suburbs by an ordinary family. Chihiro, who is renamed Sen by the evil witch Yubaba, must face the mostly hideous other-worldly creatures of what appears to the outside world as an abandoned amusement park in her quest to return her parents to their original species. She is befriended by the Miyazaki?s compulsory flawed but brilliant wizard, in this case called Haku. Unlike his other films, there is a non-magical (muggle?) female lead called Lin who also aids Chihiro. As usual the animation is amazing and is made frightening by surrealistically outsized facial features on the evil Yubaba and her ridiculously sized baby. Conversely, the six-armed boiler-tender called Kamajii is disturbing because of a fluidity of his movements which give the impression that we might be OK to go ahead an evolve a few more limbs. Most impressive is a train which travels through the lonely, flooded plains which surround the bathhouse and the other station stops. The train is peopled by ghostly passengers rendered as dark silhouettes who slowly depart until only Chihiro and her small party of creatures remain. This sequence is the most truly dream-like I?m seen on film. Chihiro eventually rescues her parents and reclaims her name by rejecting conventional reactions to seemingly evil characters and understanding what is causing them to behave the way they do. In one sequence she removes a literal gigantic tangle of junk from a river spirit which all the rest of the cast avoids due to his smell. In another, she rejects the gold gobbled up by the rest of the cast when offered by a character called ?No-Face.? After No-Face goes berserk and his gold turns out to be an illusion she lures him out of the bathhouse because she understands that the greed of the staff is causing him to tear the place apart. Finally, when Haku returns dying and in dragon form from Yubaba?s twin sister, Chihiro pulls out of him the golden seal he stole which is killing him. ?Spirited Away? received a 94 on Metacritic putting it 11th all time. It was also, apparently, the biggest money making in Japanese film history. I?m not sure I would rank it quite that high but it does an amazing job of relating its story of environmentalism, pacifism, and understanding through pictures that transcend the language barrier."

","I'm usually not that into anime/manga styled cartoons but this one blew me away. I found this title on IMDb's top 250 list, so I had to see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>This movie is about a little girl Chihiro who wanders in to a mysterious world of wonders. Humans aren't welcome in this world, when discovered they get transformed into animals. Chihiro's parents have been transformed into sloppy pigs, and Chihiro is now on a mission to get her parents back and return to her home.<br/><br/>This movie takes you on a wild ride through the depths of imagination. The thing that impressed me the most were the visual effects, the characters and wild imagination of the designers/animators. The characters are all lovable in each way and the mystery is remarkable. I did not expect to get such a good experience and I do not at all regret watching the movie. This is an must see classic."

I loved Spirited Away the first time i saw it and from that day could not get enough of it. Still Spirited is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen in my life and i hope it continues to inspire more people... I like how the animations are done in this movie its much clearer (for me that is)and is the background music is just awesome. It goes excellent with the scenes that they are played in and combined makes a fine movie. E.g. when Chihiro was running for her life in the spirit world the music was steadily rising until a point of loud sounds joined in to add the extra thing needed"

","The story begins with Chihiro and her family moving to a new home, when her father decides that it would be best to take a short cut, and he goes down a odd looking road, and comes along to a tunnel. They get out and walk through the tunnel and stumble upon a seemingly deserted town, and come across a few restaurants, not hesitating to eat the food with no workers present. Chihiro leaves her parents, and happens to find a boy named Haku. He immediately tells her that she needs to leave the place before night comes, so she runs back to find her parents have turned into pigs. Haku tells Chihiro that he will help her get home and save her parents, but she must face many difficult tasks in this new world before she can leave.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is the first film I have seen by Miyazaki, and let me tell you it blew my mind from how good it was. This film was absolutely beautiful. The art work is stunning, it was just plain mind boggling. I loved it. This movie was filled with so much imagination, I do not see how anyone could not like it. Both adults and children will love this movie. The performances were fantastic, it was hard to believe at times, and I must say that this film has to be one of the best animated films I have ever seen. The story was terrific, and I loved every bit of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, Spirited Away is not just filled with imagination, but is also some of the best storytelling you will ever see. I recommend this film to anyone who loves movies, and especially anyone who loves animated films. You will love this movie."

","""Now go, and don't look back.""<br/><br/>Some movies diminish with time and repeated viewings. When you find one that doesn't, you know you have a true classic on your hands. That's exactly what Spirited Away is.<br/><br/>The animation and art are as impressive as any other animated movie that I've seen - including stop-motion movies, computer animation, and other traditional animation. The character designs are so imaginative that it makes me thoroughly jealous that I don't have the talent that these talented artists do. Every background and frame of animation is beautiful, and that's no exaggeration.     <br/><br/>The story is simple, engaging, and charming. There no grand story arc, just a spoiled girl who matures a bit as she seeks a way back to her world for herself and her parents, and the trials that Chihiro and the various denizens she meets at the spirit bathhouse face. There are light morals about pollution, discrimination, and greed, but they're never presented in a way that's heavy-handed or blatant.<br/><br/>All that praise, and I haven't even mentioned the score (one of the best in any animated movie that I've heard) and the voice work (very good in both English and Japanese) Spirited Away was a labor of love, and it shows. It's a masterpiece for Studio Ghibli, and a movie that anyone with heart can love, be they young or old."
"colebt33-780-179547","10","1","2","10 July 2010"," This is the Godfather of Animated Features
","Up and till now I've never been much of an 'anime' fan. I didn't even know the name Hayao Miyazaki. But after reading the compliments given to his movie Spirited Away I had to check it out. And I have to say I was really surprised in how much I enjoyed this film. I can understand why it was such a big hit at the 2002 Oscars. This has got to be one the greatest animated films ever made. It's wonderfully imaginative and visual dazzling. It's a masterpiece in animation that is destined to be called a classic.<br/><br/>I found myself taken in by the adorably helpless little girl Chihiro who must obtain the courage that she thought she never had in order to survive the strange but fabulous world of spirits and gods. In her time in the alternate reality she comes across unique delectable characters, faces many challenges, and uncovers things about her past that she had forgotten. It's a fantastically enchanting story and if that's not good enough it's packed full of themes that can attract even the most small-mined of people, like for example the coming of age plot line. Chihiro was a spoiled and somewhat selfish little girl when we first met her, as a lot of kids are now a days. Then she stumbles into another world where she makes her transformation from childhood to adulthood. She learned courage in which she learnt independence, respect and assurance. That's just one of the many things themes that Hayao talked about and one of the many reasons why I loved this movie. Hayao also concerns the ecology of modern Japan. When we first enter the next world it's a vast and beautiful landscape, it seemed to me like a depiction of the traditional Japan that had been forgotten and replaced with something like New York City or Tokyo, that's what it felt like when darkness came. There was also an indication of pollution in the scene with the River God and the bathhouse. And I loved that because not only is this happening in Japan but it's also happening around the world, and the fact that Hayao expressed in such a creative and fun way makes it even more appealing. He also sets a very good example for the future generations of kids, maybe this movie will be the encouragement that cleans up this world.<br/><br/>One thing that has been specifically noted about this movie apart from it's themes is it's unique animation techniques and artistic style. Truthfully I rather enjoyed the animation in this movie much more than I have in any other animated feature. At times I found the images to be a bit scary and disturbing, but they're just minor distractions from it's true, unique beauty that is so wonderful to watch. The fascinating thing was how Miyazaki incorporated those two very different lines so well. In one scene you can have Chirhiro and Haku falling through a timeless, star-filled sky, and then in another scene you can have Haku spiting up blood and Chihiro trying to restrain him. It's as if these two opposites exist in perfect harmony, creating not only something to look at, but to think about and that's something that's not easy to pull off.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki has touched me in so many ways with his brilliantly thematic, charmingly beautiful, and visually stunning movie, Spirited Away. It's a one in a million movies."

","One of my favorite movies of all time. That is really all there is to say about it. Since I need to have a certain number of words I will just put a few things in even though I could go on and on about this movie. First of all this movie above all else looks fantastic. It looks like nothing else and really understand that film is a visual medium that can be used to tell a story and introduce a viewer to characters that they are able to become invested in. I do not know how much I relate to Chihiro, but I was completely invested in her adventure. There was so much character growth shown in obvious actions and behaviors, but it felt genuine and never forced. No Face will always be one of my favorite characters of all time and that is because of what he achieves with so little time on screen and almost no dialog. I love everything about this movie and there are no weak points in the film. This movie will always maintain a special spot in my heart and is truly one of the finest films ever made in my opinion."
"eddycree-ed","10","1","2","19 March 2010"," Miyazaki's Spirited Away
","As you can see from my rating, I do not have any problems with Hayao Miyazaki's animated film ""Spirited Away"". Nor do I have a problem with the original Japanese; ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"". My problem is with IMDb's choice to use the Japanese title without reference to the title ""Spirited Away"" in the headlines, on ratings lists, on ""best of"" polls, etc. Disney negotiated for a long time, and spent an enormous amount of money, to be able to take Miyazaki's films and properly translate them (any fan of anime knows how important a proper, professional translation is). They then hired some of the best voice actors in the business, along with some Hollywood stars. The voices are fantastic, and absolutely fit the characters. The soundtrack is wonderful. Disney has taken one of the ""Gods"" of the animation world, and made his art available to people who normally would not be exposed to his work. Someone at IMDb decided to disregard the English title for the Japanese title, most likely to be ""politically correct"". Yet all that they have done has caused confusion. You can go on any auction site and find ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" with English subtitles, and believe me, watching it is a different experience. If that was your goal is one thing, but if you thought you were getting the Disney version, you will feel disappointed (or worse). People rely on IMDb for information, and in my opinion IMDb missed the boat on this one - and many other of Miyazaki's films. MY advise would be to LOOK to make sure you are getting the Disney version of his films. LOOK for the English titles. If you take these precautions, You will not be disappointed."

I saw it like 3 years ago and was blown away and I think that it was one of my influences that made me appreciate anime outside of Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!. I would give a higher rating if it wasn't for the ending which was that...(like hell I would give away the ending here). I have to say that the story was okay but the characters, creatures, art, animation and everything else kicked my notion of the movie in the teeth.

The misery within their family during and after this tragedy was astounding. I tried with all my might to bring some light into the darkness there, and by showing them this movie I actually managed to do that. Watching this movie made them laugh, made them gasp in awe and cry out in joy and appreciation, something I hadn't seen them doing in a long, long time. It actually managed to lift some of their misery. Any movie capable of achieving something like this is worth a 10 in my book.<br/><br/>As for myself, as the title says, I was deeply moved by the film and it's soundtrack when I saw it for the first time. It was recommended to me by a friend and I had no idea what to expect. Needless to say this movie has firmly pointed me towards the spectacular work of Studio Ghibli and their master animator, Hayao Myazaki.<br/><br/>Much has been said about this movie, and I'll say it again. I find it one of the most spectacular pieces of animation and sound ever created, equaling and surpassing the finest work of Walt Disney himself and Pixar studios. The characters are round and charming, the storyline is complex and involving, and the imagery is from the highest echelon of what current Japanese animation has to offer. Furthermore, the movie has brilliant sound editing and a masterful soundtrack, which by itself is almost compulsory to listen to for any serious movie music lover.<br/><br/>If you love animation movies, you simply cannot let this movie pass you by.

","After seeing 'Mononoke-hime' the bar of my expectations was pretty high. 'Mononoke-hime' is absolutely one of the best all-around films I've ever seen. I did so want 'Spirited Away' to take me to that same place...and it almost did....almost. I watched the English translated version and occasionally got the distinct impression that what was being said and what was going on didn't quite jive. I don't believe in giving out 'spoilers' unless I am discussing directly with someone who doesn't care and I won't start here. All I will say is that I wasn't satisfied with the revelations/resolutions/explanations. Like most films of this genre it is allegory and metaphor. Usually I am able to bridge to a successful interpretation as I did in 'Mononoke...'. I viewed this twice to see if I was missing something. No. It is what it is. I was not compelled nor was I satisfied with the central characterizations. They didn't seem rooted. Maybe that was part of the problem here - that being reality merging into and becoming part of a so-called alternate reality. The reality wasn't established very well. No lessons were learned. Explanations for the metaphors kind of fell to the wayside. Then it ended. Groan. However, it is an entertaining film and I do recommend it! 'Mononoke..' is still my first love."
"Kuba_D","8","1","2","7 June 2007"," Suggestive dream
","A master story - ambiguous, multi-level, fascinating and both visually and musically beautiful.<br/><br/>Awarded with an Oscar surrealistic story from the Japanese master of the genre ('Princess Mononoke') was likely compared with 'Alice in Wonderland'. Truly, the main character is a little girl who gets into a world populated by strange creatures and ruled by mysterious laws. However this is where similarities end.<br/><br/>10-year-old Chihiro - a girl, to be honest, quite spoiled and whimsical, is on her way with her parent to her new place of accommodation. At one time the father who is driving, decides to take a short-cut through the forest, drives through an odd tunnel and the whole family lands in a strange place that resembles an abandoned entertainment park. Meanwhile Chihiro ends up in an enormous bath-house which is a place of relaxation for all the ghosts of the world. She is threatened that she will be turned into an animal and eaten at the nearest ghost feast. Having that as an alternative, she decides to work in the bathhouse...<br/><br/>It sounds a bit eccentric and it in fact is (I must add that I really simplified the main plot of the film). ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" mostly resembles a dream (or a fantasy taken out of a child's mind) and it is like a suggestive dream and arbitrary in its solutions. The characters here change both shape and identity. Magical power shows up and disappears. Everything has its own soul and it lives equally in the real and the phantom world. Beauty and grotesque ugliness, or charm and fear are not opposites in here. They adjoin each other by an inch and create a feeling of that wacky world's unity. It is an exotic experience and it is rather not for babies."
"grkracer35","10","1","2","31 May 2007"," Cartoons for Adults?
","Yes, director Hayao Miyazaki gives us an excellent anime film without the children's themes and still keeps it entertaining. Miyazaki starts the film in an understandable situation for anyone who as ever moved in their life, immediately making the viewer wonder what next; which is an underlying theme to this film. Chihiro reluctantly follows her parents into the gateway to the spirit world where her parents become entranced by the food they found and Chihiro is lost in the spirit world upon the darkness of the night and his forced to sell her name, which becomes Sen, and is then forced to work in hopes of recovering her parents who had turned into pigs.<br/><br/>Chihiro is clearly the main character and simply steals the film. While this time lapse of this movie is about 3-5 days, to see her rapid growth in maturity is outstanding and Miyazaki clearly portrays this by putting her through several tests, but this film center's around much more than Chihiro and her struggle. Miyazaki's main purpose of this film was to show his criticism for today's society. From consumer greed to modern pollution, tradition vs. modernistic themes, Miyazaki covered his bases in this one. Not only is the animation simply outstanding, but all the characters are as well.<br/><br/>This film is great for anyone, it maybe too difficult for some children to follow as the themes run deep within the movie. It is sure to keep you entertained whether you are watching for fun or for social critique. If you do watch this movie, I suggest taking a moment to really understand the themes and recall what you have just watched."

","A girl is traveling with her parent to their new home when they come across an old gate and cross over into a world populated by spirits. She loses her parents and must pass three tests in order to save them.<br/><br/>The structure of the movie is that of a Modern Japanese Narrative with deep Traditional Japanese elements and symbolism. The story is told from multiple perspectives that flow smoothly throughout the film. The is a time discontinuity which begins at the moment the family passes through the gated tunnel until they return to their car at the end of the movie. The movie is based on the Japanese religion of Shinto which believes there are spirits in all things, from organic to inorganic, natural and manned. All of the spirits that the main character Chihiro encounters are such spirits.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the conflict between the traditional values of Japan with the modern values of Japan. It is clear that Miyazaki believes that modern Japanese society is selfish, greedy, and polluted. He believes that the only way to correct these problems is by incorporating the traditional values of: politeness/manners, hard work and dedication, helping others /self-sacrifice without personal gain, and finally, love and devotion to friends and family.<br/><br/>These three values are established throughout the movie in simple life lessons. The first of the three values is a lesson on being hardworking and steadfast by completely what you start. She picks up a large piece of coal, which he can barely carry due to its weight, and drop it into the broiler. Next, was cleaning the river spirit that stank to high heaven from the pollution of the modern world, and the job of freeing her parents, which she set out to do at the beginning of the movie, for example.<br/><br/>The second value that she learns is politeness/manners. She learns to thank those who have helped her along the way by bowing and giving thanks. She does this with the broiler man that helped her get her foot in the door in getting a job at the bathhouse and Jin for teaching her everything she needs to know for her job and for helping her out when he was in trouble, to name a few.<br/><br/>The third value, helping other/self-sacrifice, is most evident in Chihiro's desire to save the life of Haiku, the dragon, even though she knows she may get hurt. She climbs the side of the bathhouse, gives half of her plum, a gift, to help heal him, and travels on a long journey to save his life.<br/><br/>The three tests given to Chihiro, by Yubaba, deal with overcoming the pollution, greed, and selfishness of the modern world, which are all in the form of monsters or beasts. The first monster is a monster that has been corrupted by the pollution of the modern world. The monster is filled with garbage, discarded objects and industrial waste. Chihiro rids the monster of the pollution and he is cleaned and become whole, as things should be. The second monster is a monster of greed. The monster, No Face, offers Chihiro many bath tokens far more than she needs (During the cleansing of the first monster, she had a bucketful but only used what she needed) and offers her lots of gold, which she declines. No Face goes crazy from being in the bathhouse (many things of the modern world) and leads him away into the rural land around the bath house, which is clean and pure and beautiful (aka traditional values). The final test comes when Chihiro has to figure out which of the beastly pigs are her parents. Because she has learned to love her parents and her friends unconditionally, she has renewed/cleaned sight and she passes the test by seeing that none of the pigs were her parents.<br/><br/>In the end, she learns all of the traditional values that have been lost in Modern Japan and becomes a better and stronger person because of them. She takes that knowledge and the values she learned and incorporates it into herself then travels away from tradition and enters the modern world. (She doesn't lose the traditional values; they simply became a part of her. Like reading, you don't think about the process of reading, you just read."
"brendanjeffrey","10","1","2","31 May 2007"," Cultural References Are Not All A Film Is About
","Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away) by Hayao Miyazaki is one of the better Anime out there. It's a tale of a girl named Chihiro and her parent's misguided ways and what happens to her as a result of it. Looking at this film at just its face value will make the message all but disappear. The first time I watched it, I didn't have much of the cultural background to understand all the references to Asian Culture nor did I think it had a real underlying message other than what was present in the actual story. After looking at the film from the viewpoint of conflicting modern and traditional values, with knowledge of the culture, everything that the film represents can begin to be deciphered.<br/><br/>This message may be lost on some, its something needed to receive the full message and meaning of Miyazaki's films. For example in Miyazaki's Mononoke-Hime (Princess Mononoke) there is a more obvious conflict between tradition and modernity, because of the industrialization of the land. There are some obvious points in all of his films but without knowing what Miyazaki's point is the full message can be lost. His films can be seen as just interesting and entertaining Anime but there is a deeper meaning to them other than just purely entertainment.<br/><br/>I'd recommend Spirited Away to anyone who has an open mind and is able to enjoy Anime or Cartoon films in general. There are a lot of messages that will be lost on most people but this shouldn't throw anyone off. The film has an underlying message to it but that's not the only thing the film deals with. Without knowing anything about the culture, or very little about it, people can still find what the message is. This is what is great about Miyazaki's films even without much knowledge of the cultural reference the meaning of the movie can still be seen. Modernity corrupts everything and that no matter what people do the younger generation is the only generation who can actually change the world for the better."
"mkaser21","7","1","2","29 May 2007"," Chihiro the Brave Hero
","Chihiro, or Sen, is the hero in Spirited Away. Her hard work and bravery is the saving element to her life, and her parents. The film, Spirited Away, is an anime movie that won a 2003 Oscar. The film lived up to its Oscar hype by delivering good framing, pace, and characters. Chihiro is the main character who has to work in the bathhouse to save her life, and her parents. She is portrayed in a good way, although her voice can be a little annoying, but this could be the product of bad translation. She is later given the Shinto name Sen, which means 1000. In addition to Shinto, the nature spirits are used throughout the film. The Anime was phenomenal throughout the movie, helping to add to the already good plot. The pace was surprisingly steady and smooth, which is not normal for Japanese or Chinese films.<br/><br/>The films literary elements were very good. The plot seemed to have a good direction, although the audience should be aware that there is a discontinuous narrative (flashbacks) and a time disjunct. However, the film is very easy to follow along for most ages. The characters of the movie were very clever. Besides Chihiro, there was Haku (who she falls in love with), the polluted river spirit, the witch who ran the bathhouse, and so forth. The polluted river spirit was a way to show that the modern world is being polluted by people's greed. Throughout the film, the director displays problems with modernity, and fixes them with more traditional ideas. The ideas of modernity verse tradition present the underlying conflict in the film. The conflict that most people will see is Chihiro trying to get back her parents. However, there is more to it than just that. It is important to note the tests she must go through in order to be free and save her parents. For example, the stink creature shows the destruction of modernity through his pollution of modern materials.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all audiences. The anime was particularly good, and the pace was very pleasant, even to westerners. The plot and characters kept me entertained throughout the film. In addition, the audience should pay particular attention to the modern views that are criticized and corrected by traditional views. Even if you're not educated about the traditional values, modern values, or Shintoism, you can still enjoy the film."

","I would give everything in my life to sustain the feeling I get from watching the minute and a half sequence of Chihiro taking the ghost train submerged in water... You know what I'm talking about. This moment is one of the most special I've ever seen, it evokes a mystical feeling deep inside myself, and it's a feeling that I might live for. It's a carefully orchestrated affair, this moment could only work after experiencing the hour that came before, in the key that came before, everything about this minute, from the music, the subtle taint of computer animation, to the magical imagery might be what Werner Herzog means when he talks about 'an ecstatic truth'. Not many films achieve this moment, and it is incredibly hard to define, but it strikes deep in a person's core, in his soul..."
"I_am_Jacks_Revenge","10","1","2","13 March 2007"," Miyazaki, you have created an animated movie I will REMEMBER for a long time
","This movie made me love Hayao Miyazaki, because I hadn't even heard of him when I first watched the movie entirely (When I first watched it, I only saw part of it). I really love the title since it goes well with Chihiro's experience of being sent away by some sort of 'spirit' to a magical world. For some reason, I haven't seen 'Howl's Moving Castle' and I so want to see this movie because, like this movie, I am really interested in it. Okay. So, Chihiro gets into this mess because, as we could relate, her dad doesn't look for directions to their new home (the, uhh, scenic route). They enter a 'market'like place and Chihiro's parents start eating the food. Chihiro wonders off, and finds the bathhouse when who should appear but Haku, telling her to get out before it's too late, and she finds her parents turned into pigs. Haku tells her to look for a job, or she'll be sent to Yubaba, the head honcho of the whole bath house. There, her name is changed to Sen. She meets Lin, who is her roommate/helper to help her with her job. A spirit named No-face comes and starts eating customers and workers, but is really interested in Sen. She refuses, and No-face goes berserk (I think). She leaves to find Yubaba's twin sister, Zeniba. Haku (who can turn into a dragon, as he is a dragon when we see him at this part), shows up and gives Chihiro a ride back to the bath house. Along the way, Chihiro remembers a time when she thinks Haku saved her and she reveals his name, Kohaku River. She makes a deal with Yubaba, and tries to figure out which pigs out the group are her parents. She realizes that none of them are her parents. The contract she signed is ripped, and she's free. She meets her parents at the end, and looks back when they reach the end of the tunnel where their car was left. She looks back and gets into the car, ready to begin her life in her new home. And that does it. Thank you, Miyazaki, for a great movie."

"arkif1","10","1","2","10 February 2007"," The Richard Wagner of the animation business
","Hayao Miyazaki has an ambition that is seldom met these days in popular art. He uses every element of his films to bear a meaning that is part of the film's vision of society.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is about the working world. The English translation does castrate him here and there - in the original there's no talk of ""a deal"" between Haku and Yubaba, which, in effect, changes Yubaba's character from benevolent to malicious and also removes an important lesson that Chihiro has learned - but the entangledness of relations, the almost mystical whole, a world whose true meaning lies in the places that its inhabitants owe it, overwhelms the viewer even so.<br/><br/>A world that might be endangered by those, who subscribe to ideas forgetting about themselves. This single thing, used in the film in a twofold way, as both the beginning and the end of this world, on one end Yubaba and her lock on names and individuality and on the other No-Face and his seduction by something that looks more valuable than it really is, is already reason enough to consider Hayao Miyazaki a t r u e artist.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to rate other great films worse only because there is one Hayao Miyazaki, so I'm not doing that. But what I do, and I can only encourage anybody to do alike, is to look at his films with the same respect that I look at a Picasso or listen to a Wagner opera."

","Yes..I would have to say Spirited Away was one of Miyazaki's best movie so far. It's that type of fantasy movie that the feeling you get while watching it is so mind - blowing. Like you actually feel like your in the movie, like the movie it's self is so wonderful. Yes also i would have to say the first time i had watched this film was on television and in fact I had cried three times while watching it. It's an movie with that feeling you get {as I say again} that just actually lifts your own spirit, cause it's sad, it makes you happy, and it's quit funny.<br/><br/>The movie is just filled with astonishing animation, high detailed creation, and it's just an masterpiece. Most people may agree, with this statement, but it's really an movie i will never forget.With the little sweet girl Chihiro, I just adore that girl, because hes's brave, courageous, and gold - hearted. Also you got to love Haku, some what mysterious, but also intense and very wonderful boy.<br/><br/>So over-all, Spirited Away, really can in a way, change your perspective in movies, and in real life. I feel as if the movie it's self real did change my ways. For an girl who actually fought her fears and did something know one else could ever do, is quit interesting. It's something i wish i could do. So Spirited Away, basically like the best Japanese movie ever for me!"

Im not saying it should be all easy like buildings burn river reborn I mean like in the first one you know how every moment is filled with suspense and then when they get together in the end its all YAY! please do consider because I would love to see this come to pass on film"

","Just awesome. It does take some time to get accustomed to the voice of the characters, but the plot is so complete and complex that you won't have any problems with voice issues. The beginning gives you a sense of uneasiness that you can't quite pinpoint. Not fun at all, but if anything , this is not a ""fun"" movie. Think of it more like a stir up to your senses and your soul. Your senses will be refreshed for sure;your soul might have a lot of questions afterwards. The bathhouse and the scenes with the ""evil"" witch and her baby might be disturbing but my Japanese friends found it not so. This leads me to believe a cultural component in understanding the whole plot is there.<br/><br/>The train ride is by far one of the best scenes considering colors, camera and the music that in a subtle way complements it.<br/><br/>Watch this movie by yourself the first time, then you'll be free to share it with others.

Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs and Chihiro must get a job at a bath house for the gods to save them. She does get the job but she is renamed Sen.

Her adventure is helped by a boy that can turn into a dragon and various other strange and wonderful creatures. The story whips along at a great pace and everyone that i manage to persuade to watch this film always are confused by the fact that they have never heard of it or studio ghibli(the studio that produces this and many other great classics).<br/><br/>Why are great classics like this not rewarded with the publicity they deserve and require here in the west? , i am quite sure that in its native country these films are greatly loved.

","I haven't really been a fan of Hayao Miyazaki but i at least know how much time the guy spend on drawing. Ever since Disney changed to computer animation, i have felt a bit sad to see hand drawn animation become extinct. After viewing this movie (Subbed and Dubbed), It shows me that there is still people doing hand drawn animation. First lets compare the difference between the subbed version and the dubbed version.<br/><br/>In the subbed version, Chiro is portrayed as a 10 year old girl who is trying her best to save her parents and at the same time working in the bath house. In the dubbed version, Chiro is portrayed as a whiny spoiled girl whose voice dosn't seem to fit with the character. There were some changes in the dilague but overall, the story is the same.<br/><br/>Many people have said this is the best animation film they've ever seen, for that, it must depend on the point of view. I don't think its the best animation I've ever seen but it certainly the most creative."

The storyline is such that both a child and an adult can enjoy. Up to this point, my favorite animation was Monsters Inc., which I also rated a ""TEN"". It is amazing how animation transcends the differences between the ""REAL WORLD"" where we live and the ""FANSTASY WORLD"" where Chihiro/Sen, Yubaba/Zeniba, Mike and Sully all were created and live, and manages to for us in the real world to visit the fantastic realm of imagination.

"remittanceman-1","10","1","2","6 April 2006"," Best film ever, bar none.
","I don't know what to say about the grandeur of this masterpiece that hasn't already been said, except that you haven't truly lived until you've seen Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki is renowned as a filmmaker. He's never make a film that was anything short of fantastic...until this. This film is beyond fantastic. This film is quintessential. Okay, enough with the gushing. What's good about this movie? Let's see... The animation is the best I've ever seen, without exception. You all talk about the attention to detail that is paid by films such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Screw you. You can do anything with a computer with very little skill involved. It takes true passion and devotion to hand-draw something this good. Every scene, every camera shot has at least five things going on at any given time. That's a minimum. Even when they're just showing a place with no people in it. Take, for example, the shot of the food stand at the beginning of the film, just as Chihiro's mother and father are about to enter and gorge themselves. There is steam rising from the food and that steam distorts the imagery directly behind it. In the back of the stand, a fan can be seen turning clumsily. This is just one example of the phenomenal animation that is, as I said, the best I've ever seen. The story is genuinely unique. A young girl is moving to a new home with her mother and father. Due to a navigational error, they end up in what the father says is an abandoned theme park. The girl, Chihiro, realizes there's something wrong, but her parents don't pay attention. Soon, they have both undergone a mysterious enchantment, and Chihiro, trapped in a world of spirits, must call upon the inner strength she never knew she had. This is the story in a nutshell, but there's so much more than that. You can see Chihiro grow from a scared little girl into a confident young woman. You can see the love that Chihiro develops for this new place and its inhabitants, particularly an enigmatic boy called Haku. You can see her struggles, her pain, her joy. That brings me into the next category: voice acting. The voice acting is superb. Particularly notable are Daveigh Chase as Chihiro and Susan Egan as Rin, but everyone shines, right down to the bit parts. One of the most magical aspects of this film is the score, which can move me to tears if I'm in the right mood. Listen in particular to the score at the very beginning of the film, as Chihiro and her parents are driving, and DEFINITELY listen to the score as she, the baby mouse, the little bird, and No-Face are riding on the train. Not much happens in that scene, but it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful five minutes in the history of cinema. Finally, the score at the very, very end of the film is what makes me cry. I won't give away the ending, but the music accentuates the mood. It's strangely tragic, and one of only three films that has ever made me cry. The others, in case you're interested, were an obscure anime film called Battle Angel...and the other was Rent. In conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone. Young, old, male, female, anime fan or not. You will like this film. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't."

","This movie is amazing. Miyazaki is one of the most talented animation directors and one of the best directors in general of all time. This movie may not make sense to a lot of people, but is beautiful to me. This movie is not just about some girl who is transported to a magical land. No! This movie is about a girl facing her fears to help the ones she loves, and helping even the ones she doesn't. Romance, adventure, suspense, and comedy are perfectly fused together in an intoxicating mix. There were even scenes when I was on the verge of tears, and I usually do not cry during movies. In fact, this was the first one I ever even felt sad about! While the movie was a bit confusing at times, it was great. The voice acting in English was perfectly executed, and even though I've never seen it in Japanese, I'm sure it's just as good or better. If you ever come across this movie at Blockbuster or any movie store, please, please, rent it. It is absolutely beautiful. This has to be one of the best movies ever made."

I can guarantee you that you will fall in love with this movie. Maybe not after the first time you see it, but maybe after the 2nd 3rd or 4th. Chihiro is a little girl who is moving. She is a drama queen in the car as her parents are driving her to her new home. Then her father gets lost and Chihiro and her parents wind up at a building in the woods.. they walk through the structure and enter a world of wonder with spirits and magical creatures. She overcomes many obstacles in this odd world and changes her attitude and perspective on things. I do have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what was going on. After a while I just stopped paying attention to the plot and just focused on the brilliant art of the movie. But after the second time watching it, I totally got the movie. It made me feel good about myself. And now every time I watch the movie, I see so many things I haven't seen before. I PROMISE you that you will not regret seeing this masterpiece."

They play a lot of anime shows on cartoon network, and I've tried to get into them, but usually watch a minute or so, find them irritating, and easily turn to something else.<br/><br/>I tuned into a showing of this film however, and was instantly captivated. Its so very unique and wonderful I simply could not turn it off. I couldn't even partake of my usual channel surfing for fear of missing a minute of its goodness when it came back from commercial! Although I think it loses some of its magic when Chihiro/Sen starts to get used to her new surroundings, it stays genuinely entertaining to the end. I would recommend this film to anyone as a good jumping off point for exploring Anime."
"mysteriousauger","10","1","2","18 February 2006"," It's a Family Movie that you'll Actually Like. Trust Me.
","The best compliment I can give this film is to say that it deserves to stand next to classics such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" In fact it is similar to these two titles in many ways. The protagonist is clearly a young girl, not a teenager or adult, so that may have you thinking that the tone of the movie will be immature and that it will be an animated feature full of the sort of hyperactive barrage of goofiness that most modern ""family cartoons"" contain. However, like the two movies I mentioned above, the main character serves to bring a perspective of innocence and wonder but still has to overcome many real obstacles. Some of these obstacles threaten her safety and, indeed, her life. I will warn parents that some of the scenes do feature violence and/or the threat of death but let me assure you that it is not done mindlessly or even purely for excitement. It should also be noted as a positive that the main character does not ever resort to force or violence to solve her problems. She uses kindness or bravery to face down her challenges and I can't imagine any parent objecting to letting their (11-12+) children get a break from the villain-smashing fare that dominates the youth action-adventure market."

"Queen_of_Shadows","9","1","2","13 November 2005"," An amazing Miyazaki film.*May contain spoilers*
","Once I saw the trailer,I knew this movie had what it takes to be apart of the Miyazaki collection.I watched this movie with my family and explained what the movie was about.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is about a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro who is arriving in a town which is now her home.Like any other kid at Chihiro's age,she is very sullen and whiny about moving from her friends and her home.When her dad tries taking a shortcut to the house instead,they end up at a strange tunnel.Both her parents decide to take a look around and as reluctant as Chihiro is,she tags along.Beyond the tunnel lies an old theme park.It seems like a beautiful and peaceful place but when night falls,another world awakens from their sleep.Unfortunately,Chihiro and her parents are trapped in this world.Her parents are transformed into pigs after feasting on the delicious food originally cooked for the spirits.However,they are not completely doomed.Chihiro meets a boy around her age named Haku and is told that she must get a job to survive in this world of spirits,sorcery and self-discovery.Who is Haku? What will happen to Chihiro's parents? How will Chihiro escape back to the human world? I won't spoil any of you anymore,just watch the movie and be spellbound.<br/><br/>What doesn't this movie have? It has deep and hidden themes,great animation,music with different moods,a well-developed storyline and an innocent childhood romance.<br/><br/>Themes:There are so many themes but there was one which is expressed much more.Personally,I felt that this movie was based on people who are ""two-faced"".Chihiro begins as a spoiled,whiny and cowardly brat but later,the viewers see that she is compassionate,loyal and filled with great courage beyond belief.Although Haku appears to be sinister and cold,he is still a protective and trustworthy friend to Chihiro.No Face is normally a lone wanderer but when exposed to the bathhouse,he is literately a monster.There is Yubaba and Zeniba.In this movie,Zeniba is the good twin and Yubaba is the bad twin.However,Zeniba is just as selfish as Yubaba and Yubaba is just as trustworthy as Zeniba.They both just happen to show just one of those sides.What I'm trying to say is that now matter how people appear to be,they are neither good nor bad but they simply lie in the middle.<br/><br/>Animation:Like many of Miyazaki's films,each character is drawn with great care.Chihiro is drawn just like a typical 10-year-old.Her expressions also add an anime touch.Haku is the most beautifully drawn character in both dragon and human form.As a dragon,he was drawn so gracefully like the kind of dragon you see in your dreams and fantasies.Even as a human,his eyes were so beautifully.The animation brings each scene to life.You could just feel the rush of Haku and Chihiro running,you could just feel the sludge of the Stink Spirit and you could just feel the joy and serenity of Haku and Chihiro flying and falling through the sky.<br/><br/>Music:Some music was sad,some was happy and some were just plain freaky but no matter which music was playing in the movie,you would somehow feel the emotion in each scene.<br/><br/>Romance:If none of you have never seen a Miyazaki film,then you probably wouldn't known that in most of his films,the two main characters have some sort of romance.It is the same in this case.That may seem a bit predictable but you don't care because of what he makes out of the romance.In his type of romances,there is always depth, innocent love and a good beginning friendship.The romance is never forced upon them.I also don't know how but he makes the characters say the word ""I love you"" without actually using those exact words.<br/><br/>I have watched this movie about seven times and to my surprise,I have not been bored yet.My favorite scenes had to be when Chihiro and Haku fall down together and when Haku comforts Chihiro near the flower area. I'll be honest,there are some scenes which may be scary but there are only about two scenes which may frighten the younger audience.I still recommend this movie for the whole family but maybe not for kids younger than five.Trust me,my five-year-old cousin did not find all of it scary. I'll give this a 9.5/10."

","I first stumbled upon Miyazaki's films when I found myself watching 'Kiki's Delivery Service' one night ... the thing that struck me in particular about that film was the stunning artwork. 'Spirited Away' features perhaps even higher quality animation, along with a fantastic and imaginative storyline, and the characters are interesting and charismatic. Some of the scenery created by the artwork is simply stunning; Miyazaki and his team have the ability to create or change mood and feel with a single image, with a very classical and realistic drawing style which in particular captures the beauty of natural things like trees, water, etc ... the musical score is terrific as well.<br/><br/>This is only the second Miyazaki movie I have seen so far, but it certainly won't be the last."

","This American adapted anime film strait from Japan didn't do to well here in the states. I can honestly ask... why? The film was great. It had a original tale of an ambitious little girl, obviously not wanting to move from her old home, who wanders off into a mythological land of strange beasts where souls trapped and transformed. At this point you understand the little girl wants to get back to her parents, who were transformed as well. <br/><br/>The art amazing and oh-so colorful. Whoever Miyazaki, director, hired to illustrate this movie should be rich. And yes, I know that more than one person helped. But still, the art is faced past during the right times and slow sometimes too. The slower scenes I actually prefer because you get more time to gaze in wonder at the scenery. The creatures all seem to be from Japanese mythology and stories of some kind.<br/><br/>The movie is truly magical and will captivate anyone who watches the first 15 minutes of it."

","Spirited away must be Miyazaki's best creation, aside from Princess Mononoke and Laputa. It was really magical and the story was very original. There a lot of awkward creatures and disturbing scenes. But i think this is what makes it magical from the start.The characters in the story are very likable and real, in spite the fantasy concept in the movie. It has also a lot of confusing scenes though and you have to watch it again to be able to understand. One must also be able to understand Japan's culture to be to understand the movie really well. It is really a great masterpiece of Miyazaki and it also moved a lot of audiences. I think that this is one of those movies that portrayed fantasy at it's best, like the never ending story, and Lord of the rings and a local television series in the Philippines called, ENCANTADIA. Musical score was very good too."

But Miyazaki's works have captured my soul constantly.<br/><br/>I first saw Princess Mononoke when I was searching for a good film, my mum bought it for me and I watched it. I was instantly in love. This brand of anime was unreal, it moved with a fluidity unlike anything I've seen before.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is the story of a young 10 year old girl called Chihiro who is moving house with her parents. They get lost and find an empty ""theme park"" which is really the land of spirits. Upon her parents receiving their punishment, Chihiro gets trapped in the spirit world but is saved from fading away by a strange boy called Haku. The story unfolds as Chihiro faces her fears and faces Yubaba, The staff of the bath house and the demon, No Face.<br/><br/>My personal favorite parts are the battle against No Face as Chihiro fights off by simply using a medicene she was given and teaching him the importance of friendship. Also, revealing who Haku really is and showing such loyalty to someone.<br/><br/>The moral of this story is that sometimes, you need to mature and learn that you can't rely on someone else to save you. You must also cherish your friends and keep loyal to the end. At least that's it to me None the less, it's a fantastic animation with beautiful music, charming characters, a storyline that sucks you in and animation quality beyond possibility.<br/><br/>Who needs 3D these days? ^_^"
"emasterslake","Null","1","2","15 March 2005"," One of Miyazaki's best films yet.
","Spirited Away is an excellent anime film. I didn't see the film till I learned about Miyazaki and the films he did. After I rented the movie, I was blown away. The animation, storyline, characters, and voice talents are perfect. I would consider it one of the best anime films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's something to watch and enjoy again and again. What's special about it is Miyazaki made it for a 10 year old girl he knew. This movie is also made for people about to become 10 or people who use to be 10, because the main character is 10 years old and goes on this magical adventure.<br/><br/>It's taken place in Modern Day Japan, it focuses on a little girl named Chihiro who's moving to a new town. She's not very comfident or happy about moving. Most kids would feel that way when they miss their old home. Her family is driving to their new home, only her dad couldn't find the right road that leads to their new home. They ended up going through a path that leads to an old building, on the other side of it is an Abandon theme park, or at least that's what Chihiro's Dad thinks. <br/><br/>I recommend renting, buying orborrow this movie. If you like Miyazaki's other films, then you gotta see this one. You won't be disappointed, I guaranty it.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9.5/10"

All this in a rich and wonderfully detailed setting. <br/><br/>This probably the only film that I have made others watch, and every last one of them enjoyed it on some level.<br/><br/>My kids aren't going to grow up watching stale old Disney, its Miyazaki all the way. <br/><br/>10/10"

","(This may have spoilers)<br/><br/>From the first mention of this name I wanted to watch it. To me it seemed very interesting to see what the creator of Mononoke Hime would come up with next. He did not disappoint, but in my (humble) opinion, he did not quite surpass some of his earlier works. Some might claim the winning of an Oscar as the pinnacle - but having been a fan of anime and anything related for the last 5 or 6 years I know that it's only just about now that all of this is becoming appreciated, much like Hong Kong/Chinese kung fu movies that are coming out all the time now. <br/><br/>The designs, backgrounds and art was absolutely breathtaking - the storyline seemed quite straightforward (although children may not be able to understand it) and the only thing wrong about the whole thing is that it might have been a little slow. After 10 minutes (exaggeration lol) of seeing the water train travel, I just wished I had it on DVD to fast forward to the good bits. Some of the little side plots had morals - almost as if it was a storytelling (which would be in keeping with the dreamy Alice in Wonderland sort of setting). My favourite was the part where the River God rewarded the bath house with an ostentatious display of gold pieces (such as one might find in a river whilst panning for gold), but gave Sen the most valuable present (a ball of herbs) which didn't look like much, certainly tasted bad but in the end helped save a life.<br/><br/>All in all, brilliant design, innovative settings and a good storyline make this a good, strong and most importantly entertaining movie."
"TremulousElysium","Null","1","2","21 September 2004"," Fantastic
","I have to say that this is one of my favorite Anime movies of all time.<br/><br/>First off I have to admit that I watched the subtitled version, so I have no idea what was done with the dubbed version and how well that was handled. Still, the movie itself (plot, characters, design, animation, etc) I found to be incredible.<br/><br/>The most obvious comparison is to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, although Spirited Away is quite unique in its own right. I personally did not find Spirited Away to be significantly darker than Alice in Wonderland. After all, Alice in Wonderland had drug references, an insane murderous queen, a creepy disappearing cat, the monstrous Jabberwocky, and other surreal characters. While the characters of Spirited Away are probably a lot more surreal it's not any harder to deal with than your typical fantasy.<br/><br/>It does indeed seem like child's nightmare, which works quite well. It is about Chihiro's journey from a sullen child with a child's reaction to hardship (which in her life is moving to a new town) to becoming a young woman, able to handle difficult situations with much more grace and independence.<br/><br/>Not to say that it's not weird, because it is. Then again, most fantasies are. I found the characters intriguing and imaginative, and many of them lovable. The art was amazing and the overall story was enjoyable and intelligent (if rather bizarre). The pacing was well done. All in all, a good execution of a cool concept. I'd definitely recommend it. Of course, if you're the type of person who prefers movies more grounded in reality this might not be your cup of tea. If you like a bit of fantasy, however, it's more likely you'll love this movie."
"northrnpilchard","Null","1","2","10 September 2004"," A meticulously crafted, charming masterpiece!
","Before seeing this movie, my experience of anime mostly consisted of cute women, giant robots and dudes with guns. Entertaining, but sometimes clichéd and lacking in the visuals. After buying the DVD of 'Castle in the Sky' (which i remember vividly as a child) I was interested in Miyazaki's latest, Oscar winning movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, if you're the type of anime fan who's looking for fast-paced action, look elsewhere. If, however, you are prepared to watch this, you will be treated to some of the most imaginative storytelling and the most astonishing visuals ever to put to cel (or screen for that matter).<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough, following the adventures of a strong-willed and (it has to be said) bratty ten-year-old girl who becomes separated from her parents in a spirit world while moving house. As the story progresses, she gradually grows emotionally into a better person. Although it sounds far-fetched, the way the story is told is in a class of its own. The animators' attention to detail in backgrounds, character design and the animation itself are breath-taking, and the merging of CGI and traditional drawing styles is remarkably well-done. It is this attention to detail which gives more and more to see on repeated viewings, and prevents the viewer noticing the leasurely pace of the story. To say this is merely a kid's film is selling it short. I'm 22 and I LOVE this movie! Hiyao Miyazaki and the rest of the staff at Studio Ghibli have created yet another unforgettable experience. This is how animated movies should be done."
"mdoulton","Null","1","2","2 September 2004"," Chihiro's not the only one who's spirited away
","As with most of Miyazaki's work, he creates surreal worlds and makes us believe in them. With Spirited Away, he transports us into a world where parents turn into pigs, spirits and gods need spa treatments, and little girls display incredible courage, faith, and kindness.<br/><br/>Apart from the fantastic animation, it was refreshing to watch a ""grainy"" children's adventure, where the bad are not all bad and the good are not all good. Compared to the Disney and Dreamworks flicks, which take the feel good factor to mawkish levels, Spirited Away is filled with eccentric characters (and spirits :) who make you laugh with their refusal to behave as expected."
"beltanegirl","10","1","2","16 July 2004"," Absolutely amazing
","As someone relatively new to the world of Japanese style anime it seemed a little odd to me. However, this did nothing to detract to the excellent quality of the story it is well written and I really found myself feeling for the characters involved. It manages to be funny, tender, exciting and a little frightening all at the same time which is no small feat for any film and it manages to come across even when watching it in the original Japanese with subtitles again something I've rarely experienced.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is excellent and gives a little something extra to the movie although it could work just as well with no music. The quality of the artwork is superb. A little disjointed at times and yes it does last maybe a little longer than strictly necessary. However, it's kept me riveted every time I've watched it and got me doing stupid things like seeing if I could hold my breath when Chihiro is crossing the bridge and I'm 17. The simplicity of the story is such that it can be enjoyed by children whilst it is also complex enough to keep their parents entertained. All in all a real family film and well deserving of the Oscar it won and, in my opinion, many more."

","""Spirited Away"" is the story on a young girl, her parents, and their magical journey into a world inhabited by spirits from the living world. The parents, who have ignorantly taken food from the spirits, have been warped into pigs as punishment. Chihiro is left alone in a world that is foreign to her. Help arrives from Haku, who helps Chihiro find a safe place in the spirit world. Together, they try and find a way home for Chihiro and her parents. I had high expectations for this movie, seeing it in the top 50 of the Top 250 list on this site. But I had no idea that this movie would blow me away like it did. I hear some people complaining that this is a nightmarish movie that doesn't present a compelling story and is too scary for children. I think that they just need to open up to this movie and realize that this is competely different that what America is used to. The Japanese (even with such abominations as Pokemon, Power Rangers, Digimon, etc.) have such a broad imagination and such a unique way of story telling, something that is not often seen here in the U.S. In order to enjoy this movie, the viewer must open their mind and accept the world in which Chihiro travels to. The animation is nothing short of perfection. And the story is one of the best not only in the world of animation, but all of cinema. Chihiro begins as a sort of whiny little girl who complains about the major changes she is going through (She is moving to a new city). But the adventures she must endure in the spirit world change her. She begins to grow up and mature, while coming to understand the importance of selflessness. When Haku is attacked near the end of the film, she decides to put off everything else, even her parents, to try to save him.    This is a must for any movie collection. The Japanese have given us very good things and very bad things. This, however, is truly their gem.<br/><br/>

","If you don't like this film (and it is a film, not an anime or a cartoon or a child's movie) then I pity you for you have become so cynical, so deeply pretentious and portentous that you have lost the ability to feel or believe. <br/><br/>First of, from the opening DVD screen, you realize quite how stunningly beautiful Spirited Away is. I do not have the words to describe the pure majesty of the animation. If, at first, one feels a little out of place, this is soon conquered as Chihiro's tale grabs an enthralls. <br/><br/>The plot is entertaining enough for the adult viewer. The soundtrack is achingly gorgeous, and many of the characters deeply compelling. No-Face, the anonymous melancholy man child being one of the most vivid. There are also undertones of Dante's Inferno, as a series of ethereal spirits guide young Chihiro through her quest to save her parents.<br/><br/>Those expecting a linear narrative (most of the critics of this, it would seem) have obviously seen too many Disney cartoon, and know little of the eastern spirituality which pervades Spirited Away. Those with an open mind, a willingness to learn and to escape, will be utterly moved by the astonishingly beautiful, melancholy and captivating visual poetry.<br/><br/>To me, Spirited Away sits alongside Life Is Beautiful in the ""happy section"" of my DVD collection."
"Tessa-7","9","1","2","3 April 2004"," A child's introduction to loss
","I watched 'Spirited Away' with the translated original script subtitles. Out of curiosity, I then switched to the US dub to discover that Disney had made some rather crass and pointless changes to the script - spoken by poorly cast voiceover actors. This is, I presume, Disney's decision to make the film ""more accessible to the American public"" who, if Hollywood were to be believed, are a bunch of numb-minded cretins. <br/><br/>One of the things that's most appealing about Japanese anime is exactly the stuff that's - excuse the pun - lost in translation, which allows non-Japanese-speaking audiences to use their imagination and develop their own interpretation. Disney just misses the point on this, resulting in ironic moments in the film, such as the parents literally pigging out on theme park food. I'm sure Western audiences aren't so dumb as to not pick up on these references.<br/><br/>As for my own interpretation of the film, I think it's about how children must learn very early on to accept and adapt to change, and how their own imaginations are far better equipped than an adult's to deal with loss and mourning. I even wondered if the film is trying to explain death to children. No Face would be a likely candidate for that role: Chihiro lets him in and does not fear him like the adults because she doesn't understand what he is. Interestingly, No Face travels on the ghost train and is, consequently, the only companion invited to stay with 'Granny' when the friends decide to make their return journey. However, I'd be very interested to read other people's interpretations.<br/><br/>I found this film to be hugely moving and, in many ways, a return to more rounded and thought-provoking narratives which were once far more commonplace in children's fiction. It reminded me of many treasured books from my childhood and, by encouraging me to use my imagination and suspend disbelief, allowed me to watch with the same wonderment I had back then."

I would have been satisfied if, at the end of the movie, Chihiro (Sen) had saved a train ticket and given it to Lin  for her support and friendship. It just left me thinking that Lin was a good character, but wasn't in the movie enough. That's just a thought, though. Just write back and tell me what you think. If you agree, tell me why.

","Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece is a very foreign film--and not simply because it comes from another country (Japan); there's an imagination at work that's so organic and remote that it seems to spring from an individual's subconscious and as such feels as if it has no immediate relation to a single culture. But it connects universally, speaking as it does in a language that suggests anything's possible and children of all cultures will respond to it instinctively. (And it will touch the inner child of adults.) There's a stunning clarity in Miyazaki's hand-drawn animation and it's clear that a painstaking effort is made to detail every frame. His use of color is striking and gratifying: rather than depend on the bright, flashy pastels that seem to be the choice of computer animators, he uses a rich but muted palate that emphasizes the dreamlike aspects of the story (a young girl must rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs by angry spirits and in turn discovers her capabilities for self-reliance; in this regard, it's not unlike most Disney films) and finds its pleasures in the darker aspects of the settings and the characters. The story takes its time to develop and though some may find it more arduous than entertaining (and, admittedly, its mildly humorous moments are few and far between), as it builds the rewards become more and more evident until, by its simply beautiful conclusion, it's overwhelmed you and left you dazed. Unique, infused with wisdom and love."

","A movie like Spirited Away restores my confidence in the filmmakers of today. Movies like this only come along every once in awhile. Forget that it's absolutely gorgeous looking and has an equally beautiful-sounding soundtrack - what makes this movie special is its story and characters, wrapped in a wonderful presentation. <br/><br/>Chihiro stands out from other child protagonists in movies in that she really grows as a character throughout the film, going from a listless girl who lacks confidence and believes that there is little she can do to make her life better to a brave, compassionate person ready to meet new challenges. I'll admit that it sure was one weird way to learn about one's self and grow but that's part of the movie's charm. The world Chihiro becomes trapped in is fascinating. It's whimsical and fantastic but it can also be kind of scary and grave at times too. Despite its rather heavy and serious themes, Spirited Away never gets too bogged down as there's lot of humour to be found. It's not a comedy by any stretch and it doesn't contain what I would call jokes, but I found myself laughing at the sheer quirkiness of some of its characters and moments. Few films have ever shown such imagination without being baffling, artsy or simply too ""out there"" to be enjoyable. I don't see how anyone could have trouble grasping any of this movie's concepts. True, its presentation is quite different but the themes are universal. Anyone using the fact that this is a Japanese film as an excuse to say they didn't understand it would probably have trouble understanding lots of North American movies as well. My guess is that these people simply haven't seen a whole lot of movies outside of the usual crap Hollywood churns out these days. I'd recommend this movie to anyone of any age. It's got a lot of heart but I don't think it ever gets sappy. It comes close sometimes but something seems to balance it all out. For me, watching this movie gave me this uplifting feeling that one might get from a coming of age movie like Stand by Me or even something Like The Shawshank Redemption. What I mean is, like those 2 movies, it's a feel-good movie but that's not all there is to it. A true work of art."

","Classical animation is alive and well in Miyazaki's latest anime masterpiece. There were no big explosions or extended CGI or 3-D figures, but it has plenty of rich imagery, a wacky yet poignant story and great animation. The dubbed version got Americanized a little with a few unnecessary jokes thrown in, but the original subtitled Japanese version is the best. Don't miss it on DVD."

","This film reminds us that great animation is not about excessive CGI and overblown special effects, but is about sheer imagination and creativity.  I love how japanese animation makes serious issues about life accessible to children to understand, yet have a deeper level which adults can also appreciate through the symbolism and rich imagery.   Being enthralling for children and deep for adults makes this film exceptional.  Only negative would be the length which left some of the youngsters abit restless but the imagery really is  wonderful and will intruige even the the most cynical audience.  <br/><br/>

","This movie was not the ""end all and be all"" of Anime movies that<br/><br/>all the hype (and the Oscar win) has boosted it to be, but good<br/><br/>none-the-less.  It's an imaginative story and a nice change of pace<br/><br/>from the largely Disney-style narratives and animation that the<br/><br/>majority of North American audiences have become so familiar<br/><br/>with.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I have never been a fan of Anime, based solely on what I consider<br/><br/>to be sub-standard animation and over-stylization (dime-sized<br/><br/>mouths & saucer-sized eyes?!?!), and again those factors did play<br/><br/>a part in my rating SPIRITED AWAY lower than I could have.  On<br/><br/>one hand, there is a wealth of interesting looking characters,<br/><br/>absolutely fantastic backgrounds, and incredible attention payed to<br/><br/>animating the 'spirit world' in the movie (including some<br/><br/>breathtaking CGI combinations), but then the actual character<br/><br/>animation itself is rendered in obvious 12-frame rather than 24- frame motion.  That just makes no sense to me.  It's comparable<br/><br/>to setting a sumptuous table for a regal dinner party, then cracking<br/><br/>open a can of pork and beans and slopping it out onto the good<br/><br/>china.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The shining achievements in SPIRITED AWAY are the characterizations and, above all, the story.  The young heroine<br/><br/>Chihiro/Sen is played with exceptional realism in attitudes and<br/><br/>abilities to a ten or eleven year girl; in the way she talks, feels,<br/><br/>moves and reacts one gets the feeling that she is indeed the<br/><br/>daughter, grand-daughter, young sister, neighbour, school chum<br/><br/>that they might know and love.  And the film is littered with a<br/><br/>plethora of memorable characters that fascinate and help carry the<br/><br/>story along.  Where the movie really shows its MAGIC is in the<br/><br/>wonderful and incredibly imaginative story though.  Strange<br/><br/>creatures and magical beings, living in a world so removed from<br/><br/>the typical Hollywood/Disney attempts at ""wacky & weird"".  The<br/><br/>makers of SPIRITED AWAY didn't try to dumb-it-down or pander to<br/><br/>delicacies of the PC crowd (as evidenced by the sight of blood and<br/><br/>vomit and a ""Stink-Monster"" that was quite obviously a giant,<br/><br/>walking mound of feces!).  Nor did you have to sit through a<br/><br/>cookie-cutter love-story cemented together with 10 songs by Elton<br/><br/>John or Celine Dion that ends with a horrible but justifiable villain- death and everyone else living ""happily ever after"" together forever,<br/><br/>etc....<br/><br/><br/><br/>I laughed a few times, marveled at some of the creativity, and<br/><br/>noticed that it held the attention of both younger and older viewers<br/><br/>alike throughout its unfolding on the screen.  I wouldn't knock it, but<br/><br/>I didn't fall in love with it either.  It was just ""good"".<br/><br/><br/><br/>7/10.  A nice effort and a good change of animated fare."

","Spirited Away is the best anime by Miyazaki that I've ever seen.  Miyazaki is well known for embedding thought provoking messages in his animations, and this one is no exception.  Coming from an Asian background (I'm a Chinese), I can really appreciate ideas that Miyazaki wants to get across in the movie: over weighted kids, the negative aspects of a capitalistic world, the love of money over the love of a love one, the power of love, the ""bubble economy"", etc.  This is a movie for everyone.  The more experience you get from life, the more complex the movie will appear to you.  If you watch the movie for once and you don't think it is any different then any other anime, watch it for a second time.  If watching it for two times is still not getting you anywhere, watch it for a third time.  Indeed, watch it for as many times as you need until you complete digest the movie, and you will find yourself learning something new every time.  Watch for the metaphors between the lines and the symbolic meanings of every character, and get ready to surprise yourself!<br/><br/>If you just want to spend two hours in the theater for some good entertainment, this anime is not going to disappoint you either.  The characters are beautiful, the backgrounds are lavishing, and the storyline is entertaining.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this anime deserves the Oscar.  If you like Amelie or Chacolat, Spirited Away is the anime that you will love!"

This isn't just an animated film, it's a great animated film, easily the best I've ever seen. Comparing this film to, oh, say Beauty and the Beast, that would be like comparing Taxi Driver to Dumb and Dumber. That's just how strongly I feel about this film. This coming from a person who isn't neccessarily enamored with anime. I find it a bit too quirky and way too convoluted. Most of the time. My great love affair with Studio Ghibli, which produced this film, began with Grave of the Fireflies. That movie was my favorite of all time. That is, until I saw Spirited Away. I was expecting great things, after all, this was coming from the man who gave us Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro. Let me tell you, I was completely and utterly blown away at how much Miyazaki outdid himself. This film feels epic, unfolding slowly and endearing itself to us in ways I've never seen before. Easily tied with Adaptation and Gangs of New York as best film of 2002. I love this movie, and I love Disney, Ghibli, and Miyazaki for allowing me to experience it. The only words I can use, and they are not enough, is; ""WOW!"" Score: A Perfect 10/10"

I found this to be a very well done piece, very plot and character driven, while still retaining a good amount of the action that is almost always present in most of the anime. It is also a very well presented love story. The ending leaves a lot of room for a sequal, though I'm not sure if one will ever be made.

"R. J.","Null","1","2","18 March 2003"," No other way to describe it: A masterpiece
","By now Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki must be animation's best-kept secret; Pixar's John Lasseter and any number of Disney animators simply revere him, the venerable Mouse House has even decided to help finance him and 1997's ""Princess Mononoke"" raised his Western profile. For all of that, though, Miyazaki is still a secret and it would be a shame that, because of it, this touching and incredibly powerful fantasy shouldn't find the international audience it rightfully deserves. Not that Miyazaki is that bothered about it, since ""Spirited Away"" has become the all-time Japanese box-office champ, was the first animated film to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and had already cleared $200 million in international box-office before even opening in America (in France alone the film played to two million viewers). Basically, ""Spirited Away"" is a modified fairy-tale in the Japanese tradition, following the adventures of ten-year old Chihiro, a moody, spoilt young girl who finds herself trapped in the world of Japanese gods and spirits after her parents take a wrong turn with their car. The only way out of a dismal fate for the girl and her parents is for Chihiro to work in the bathhouse of the gods, where she will live through a series of fantastical adventures. Although what I've just written may make it seem childish, the story is practically unresumable and a lot more strange than it seems, recapturing the edgy nature of the earlier fairytales without ever allowing violence or wickedness inside; even so, it's probably good to leave younger kids at home since some of the images are far too weird for easy explanation. The film works best as a Japanese version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" without the witticisms and with an added heart, and is directed by Miyazaki in an effortlessly painterly style that enchants and intrigues at the same time. From its rather non-descript beginnings, ""Spirited Away"" develops into a moving parable about learning to know yourself that surprises you at each turn and ends up tugging your heart strings as much as it can without ever yielding to any sort of concessions. There's no other word: this is a masterpiece."

At the same time, her love story with Haku is charming in its progression; the little fur balls down in the boiler were very cute as well. The movie is, I'm sure, very enjoyable to any children, it took me right back to being a kid watching The Lion King again. yet, for an adult, the movie can also be perceived and enjoyed in many different planes.

","Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro, a young Japanese girl, who stumbles upon another realm whilst moving to a new house with her parents. She stumbles upon the realm with her parents and can sense something is wrong, whereas her parents don't seem to notice. She loses her parents and gets sucked into the realm which is full of strange creatures, Gods, witches, dragons etc. This particular area of the realm is a bath house for Gods, and she initially seems stuck here, but is determined to escape with her parents and return to the real world, but has many fascinating adventures on the way.<br/><br/>I found this movie was wonderful. A lot of comparison is made between Spirited Away (and others) and Disney movies, in that Spirited Away is far better, but in my opinion this is far from being related to a Disney feature. Firstly it seemed quite adult to me, and I wouldn't be happy with anyone younger than a teenager watching this. On several levels it isn't suitable for someone younger, and I don't think would be understood by someone younger either. Other than this the story is fantastic and imaginative, although there are definite parallels with the Wizard of Oz (young girl taken from ""parents"", wicked witch character, strange creatures). The animation is also good in the main. 4/5"

","*MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>Almost everyone has come across a movie where they love and will want to see again, and again, and again...etc. Spirited Away is one of those movies that is stunning, exciting, and magical. It has been a while since I have a seen a movie where I have no words to describe it. I watched the dubbed chinese version with my sister and a friend at home and by the end, I was enchanted by the magic it holds. The characters were uniquely created and so was the plot. Who else would think of a girl working in a Bath House, in a mysterious land, in order to save her parents who are turned into pigs!! I doubt anyone would ever think of a boy dragon, and mysterious beings like No Face, the gods, and Yubaba.<br/><br/>The animation was wonderful such as the part where Chihiro was following Haku through the flower bushes to visit her parents. Chibli used computer animation in just the right parts, unlike other films where computer animation is 'necessary' throughout the film.<br/><br/>But the true essence of the film is the music. Without the music, this movie wouldn't be as great as it would be. The composer, Joe Hisaishi, has written music that should be recognized all over the world. The songs and pieces used in this film are very enchanting. They are so unique, that I cannot find the words to describe it. Download it from Kazaa or any place where you can download music like AudioGalaxy.<br/><br/>Despite the grace and charm, there are parts in this film where it is not all lush and beauty. My sister[who is only 7 years old], despises the part where No Face swallows the workers at the Bathhouse. This part is a rather gruesome part for younger children. Other flaws were confusion. While watching the subtitled version, my friends kept asking 'what' and 'why' questions--such as, ""what are those things?""[in referrence to the gods and spirits] And why No Face kept following Chihiro.<br/><br/>This film is an exciting film for everyone to watch--though parental guidence is advised for young children. I give it a 15/10 for it's originality, animation, plot, and music. If you're stuck on a weekend with nothing to do, I suggest you go to the nearest theature showing Spirited Away, and watch it--and if you're smart--go buy it so you can watch it any time you want. Spirited Away is a movie you will remember for the rest of your life."
"Micio Nero","10","1","2","26 November 2002"," The Master's Masterpiece
","First of all, I must say that I grew up with the works of Hayao Miyazaki. ""Future Boy Conan"" has been at the #1 spot in my Top 10 of anime series for a long time, and I also enjoyed movies like Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro and Princess Mononoke, which means that my expectations of Spirited Away were very high, almost to the point that I started to fear that the movie wouldn't be able to match them.<br/><br/>This said, I must admit that I almost fell off my chair while watching Spirited Away for the first time... Totoro is maybe a little too childish and slow paced, and you may say that there is too much graphic violence in Mononoke, you could even protest that there is too little magic in Kiki, but Spirited Away is almost pure perfection. There is action, love, magic, and fun. The story is well paced (when it ended it seemed much shorter than 2 hours), the graphics are great, the characters, even the secondary ones, are well developed.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a wonderful fairytale, one that can be watched by children and adults alike, not difficult to follow, but elaborated enough to keep a grown-up interested in it.<br/><br/>As I said, perfection is *almost* reached here. Almost, because a few (very few) things could have been done better, in my opinion. First of all the CGI. Generally very good, but not so good in some scenes. Second, I personally would have liked to know a little more about the relation between Yubaba and Zeniba, but I watched the japanese version with english subtitles, so maybe some parts of the dialogue haven't been fully translated...<br/><br/>This is really a great movie, no wonder it won a Golden Bear in Berlin.

"LaurieMann","9","1","2","2 November 2002"," Disney Ought to Be Ashamed...
","Ya gotta wonder - Disney is the US distributor, Disney knows how to market animated features - why has this breathtaking animated feature not been promoted at all in this country?<br/><br/>It's a great movie, but really not for small children and it really doesn't have the toy/gadget possibilities of Disney flicks as most of the characters are not at all cute (except for Chihiro, of course).  And, perhaps, since animated features are now eligible for an Oscar, perhaps Disney decided to dump this movie, keep it forgotten in America, so they can promote the amusing (but hardly great) Lilo and Stitch come Oscar time.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the most breathtaking backgrounds and animation I've ever seen.  True, here and there it has the kind of stilted animation of '60s TV animation.  But once Chihiro starts her adventures in the bathhouse, the animation practically leaps off the screen.  The level of detail in the backgrounds, particularly in the ""witch's lair"" is unlike anything I've ever seen (even better than Beauty and the Beast, which set the bar pretty high for outstanding detail).<br/><br/>I don't know much about Japanese myth/legend, and I suspect that the Japanese moviegoers got much more out of this movie than I did.   Still, it was great fun to watch.  Chihiro is a genuinely annoying kid early in the film, and showed more character development during the course of the movie than some live actors I could mention.  Early in the movie, her parents are enchanted by a witch, and the rest of the movie is about little Chihiro almost going through hell to bring them back.<br/><br/>This is probably not a good movie for sensitive children, but most kids much above six or seven should have a ball with it."
"meverettlane","Null","1","2","22 October 2002"," A fairy tale for a complex world
","*Ending Spoiler*<br/><br/>What an amazing film. I'd only seen one of Hayao Miyazaki's movies before, ""Princess Mononoke."" Like ""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Spirited Away"" is gorgeously drawn, with images that are beautiful and haunting (and, when necessary, terrifying). But while ""Mononoke"" was an epic, Hayao Miyazaki's latest is a true fairy tale, and that is high praise.<br/><br/>The story of ""Spirited Away"" is similar to ""The Wizard of Oz"": an ordinary girl is transported to a magic realm, and must rely on the brains, heart, and courage that she didn't know she had, in order to get home. Chihiro shares some of Dorothy's spirit, but the rich and strange realm she enters is more like ""Alice in Wonderland"" -- a dream world with its own logic that must be obeyed, but which makes perfect sense taken on its own terms. (I was also reminded of ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" -- the novel, not the Byrne / Eno album -- although Tutola's spirit world seems much more threatening). Like Dogdson writing his stories to amuse Alice Liddell (and her sisters), Miyazaki has made a movie for his ""young friends"":<br/><br/>""I have five young female friends who are about the same age as Hiiragi-san [Hiiragi Rumi, the 13-year-old voice actress of Chihiro] and I spend every summer with them at my mountain cabin. I wanted to make a movie they could enjoy. That is why I started this film, and that is my true purpose. I felt this country [Japan, I take it] only offered such things as crushes and romance to 10-year-old girls, though, and looking at my young friends, I felt this was not what they held dear in their hearts, not what they wanted. And so I wondered if I could make a movie in which they could be heroines.""<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about ""Spirited Away"" (and it's a film full of wonders) is that Chiriho is an ordinary girl. She doesn't wake up one morning to discover she's got superpowers, or that she's really a wizard, or that she's really the key to the fate of the universe.<br/><br/>""Until now, I made 'I wish there was such a person' leading characters. This time, however, I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize, someone about whom they can say, 'Yes, it's like that.' It's very important to make it plain and unexaggerated. Starting with that, it's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them."" (Miyazaki)<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about ""Princess Mononoke"" was that it refused to have any villains. Characters did good and bad things, but for reasons more complex than their being ""good"" or ""evil"". Miyazaki does the same with ""Spirited Away"". Like Chihiro (and Ashitaka in ""Mononoke""), the audience must learn to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" to see both good and bad.<br/><br/>**Ending Spoiler**<br/><br/>""This film is an adventure story, although the characters neither swing weapons around, nor use supernatural powers in battle. It is an adventure story, but its theme is not a confrontation between good and evil. It will be a story of a girl who was thrown into a world where both good and evil exist. She gets trained, learns about friendship and devotion, and survives by using her wisdom. She finds her way out, dodges, and comes back to her old daily life for the time being. However, it is not because evil was destroyed -- just as the world does not disappear, (evil does not disappear). It is because she gained the power to live."" (Miyazaki).<br/><br/>I don't know enough about Japanese culture to say that it's generally opposed to our Manichean, good-versus-evil worldview. But at a time when our leaders clearly have this way of looking at the world, its refreshing to see a story that shows things can be more complicated than that, and that wisdom is more important than righteousness. If you have the chance, go see this extraordinary film."

So rather than attempt to do that, I'm just going to express the ways in which I disagree with other reviews.<br/><br/>First of all, although I thought the dub was acceptable, I didn't find it particularly good.  In fact, there is really only one actor that I can say I actually liked, that being Susan Egan as Lin.  I've known people like her character, and they all sounded somewhat like her.  The way she conveyed the transitions really made me appreciate the depth of her character.  Egan has range, something I wish I could say for Jason Marsden, as Haku, who appears only able to convey two vocal inflections, both belonging to a single emotion.  Haku is supposed to be somewhat serious and grim, but not unrealistically so.  Even when the character's supposed to be cheerful and/or helpful, he's still got that ""grim"" vocal pattern.  Miyu Irino (the Japanese actor) had ten thousand times the range of this TV commercial narrator.  The only time  you hear his intonation rise is when he's asking a question.  Daveigh Chase seemed to have a similar affliction, but for some reason I wasn't particularly bothered by it.  The voice was right for the character, so I didn't mind.  Other actors were decent, but otherwise not outstanding.<br/><br/>On a different note, am I the only one who doesn't quite feel comfortable with this ""Alice in Wonderland"" analogy that people keep bringing up?  I mean, sure, they both involve a child going into another world, and both are fairly unpredictable, but I feel Spirited Away has a depth of character and sentimentality to it that Alice lacks.  Not that I don't like Alice, quite the contrary, some of my best times were spent reading it.  However, I believe Spirited Away bears more resemblance to Terry Gilliam's film, ""Time Bandits.""  There's a sort of whimsical feeling that everybody knows what's going on but the main character, and vicariously, the audience.  The way the plot moves is much more contiguous than Alice, as well, the feel being more introspective.  In Alice, the audience isn't given much time alone with the character, so the viewer doesn't quite feel the same depth of bond.  In addition, Alice just doesn't have the same kind of feeling of genuine good and evil that SA and Time Bandits have.  In Alice, everything feels like one big cruel joke, and it's easy to dismiss it as one.  But as much as SA may seem like a joke from time to time, both the main character and the viewer are reminded from time to time that this is not a dream; Chihiro's perils are bizarre, but very real, and that adds a sort of macabre feeling to the entire movie.  It's a subtle distinction, but it's there.<br/><br/>All in all, this is quickly rising on my list of favorite films of all time. I agree fully with the movie's marketing line, ""for everyone who is, has ever been, or ever will be 11 years old.""  Go see this movie, subtitled or dubbed.  Unless you're like that one guy who thought it wasn't coherent enough, you'll love it."
"Jeremy Bristol","9","1","2","20 October 2002"," A breath of fresh animated air
","I drove 200 miles with my brother just to see this movie in Kansas City, and it was worth the trip.  I still don't know why Disney is expanding the release so slowly, as this is one of the best theatrical animated movies to come along in years, even in its dubbed form.<br/><br/>The dub is all right.  I thought that Daveigh Chase did well most of the time, but I liked her better as Lilo (but then, that character was basically created around her).  Lin's attitude was a bit cliche (like a hard-nosed heroine from the 1940s), but it wasn't distracting or detracting.  Yubaba and her sister, though initially irritating, grew on me by the end.  Haku was rather dull, like a zombie, but it turns out that maybe that had something to do with a certain plot element that I won't spoil.  Anyway, at the end, he sounds like a different person, and that worked for me.<br/><br/>The animation is amazing, with the characters having far more to say with their body language than in any of Miyazaki's previous films.  The character designs are fantastic and beautiful.  I can sort of understand why everyone keeps comparing it to Alice in Wonderland, except that most there are fewer references to that book in Spirited Away than there was in My Neighbor Totoro.  Besides, the gods/spirits/monsters are very Japanese (take the concept of the river spirits being dragons, or the Noh spirit (""the No Face"") that eats people that was used by Rumiko Takahashi in Inu-Yasha) and have less to do with the illogic logic of Wonderland than it does with traditional Japanese folklore.  I'm not Japanese, so I really can't say, but I'd just about bet that most of it makes sense to the Japanese, even whatever stuff Miyazaki made up.<br/><br/>Spoilers: One interesting thing I noticed were the references to Night on the Galactic Railroad by Kenji Miyazawa, especially the ride on the train with the see through spirits.  This reference really helped me get a better idea about the alternate world Miyazaki created, and why it is what it is (the little girl spirit at the train station was extremely eerie for me).<br/><br/>Anyway, Miyazaki supposedly created this movie because he saw the young daughter of an aquaintance who seemed dispassionate about the world, but, I'm not sure how successful this movie will be about changing the minds of girls like her (I don't know who came up with the idea of ""love"" breaking the spells, because I seriously doubt it was Miyazaki, who generally doesn't rely on those kinds of abstract ideas (he would prefer to show, I'm sure--where in Mononoke Hime does San or Ashitaka say they love each other, yet you know they do by the end).  It's interesting, though, that at the end Chihiro seems scared to be returning to her own world, holding onto her mother exactly the way she held onto her at the beginning of the movie, and there's something oddly hopeful about that.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars, for the dub version."

","I took my son to see this movie a few days ago, as the coming attractions looked innocuous enough (hey, it's distributed by Disney, right?).  Little did I know that the images would be so frightening and grotesque.  Don't get me wrong, animation was GORGEOUS, right down to the rippling water in the stream, although Chihiro looked more like your standard anime character than did her parents.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this for a child under 9 years old (my son is 7), as the images and theme are a bit overwhelming.  After a bathroom break, my son told me he didn't want to watch the movie.  Mommy Dearest that I am, I made him go back in, reminding him that it was a fantasy and that everything would work out in the end.

"dan-549","Null","1","2","9 October 2002"," What a rich movie
","Before we left the theater, after watching the film with our mouths hanging open, we were making plans to see it again. What a rich movie. The story is of a 10 year old girl who reluctantly follows her parents down a short cut to their new home, and become trapped in the world of the spirits. The girl's strength, determination, judgment, trust, love and friendship are put to the test as she works and struggles to free her family. But of course, the film isn't only about that. Every moment is filled with symbolism and imagery on multiple levels. Themes of the sprits relation to the living, stewardship of our world, identity, greed, prejudice loyalty, love, journey, and the healing power of hard work - play throughout. Perhaps what I like most is that it shows us a story of how to be true to yourself and knowing who you are,  and how that enables you beyond fear. I am sure this story is based somewhere in mythology, but to call it a fantasy or fairytale would be selling short of the *perspective* firmly grounded in reality. This is not animated in the lush 24 frames we are used to seeing in big studio releases. But it much smoother than the expected Speed Racer style movements. They carefully worked the English dubbing to the mouth movements and it shows. Backgrounds are lush and beautiful and clearly display the artists hand. It is directed by Hayao Miyazaki who has also directed Princess Mononoke among others. What a master of the art. I don't think this is a film for young kids. The 10 year old is often in serious danger and left on her own. Her parents are disrespectful to her. The sprit world has necessary imagery that youngsters would find disturbing and confusing. I know it is not in general release, but keep your eye out for it. It would be a shame to miss this movie that is so pure in heart."
"divaclv","Null","1","2","9 October 2002"," Swept Away
","I'm no expert on anime, but I know what I like.  And I liked ""Spirited Away,"" Hayao Miyazaki's elegantly surreal fable of a girl who finds herself by becoming lost in a strange world.  The plot has been compared to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and I see no reason to dispute the analogy--like Lewis Carrol's story, ""Spirited"" creates a universe which is alien, yet echoes the truths of our own reality.<br/><br/>Alice in this case is Chihiro, voiced here in the States by Daviegh Chase. Chase also provided the voice of Lilo in ""Lilo and Stich,"" and here again creates a child who is ultimately endearing despite (or perhaps because of) a tendency towards bratiness.  Chihiro is sulking because her family is moving, and she isn't embracing the change in her life.  Her parents aren't much help, waving off her fears instead of helping her cope with them.  But en route to the new home, the family comes across what seems to be an abandoned theme park, but is in truth a sort of Club Med for spirits presided over by Yubaba, who looks rather like something you'd find on a Mardi Gras float.  Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs for eating the spirits' food, and Chihiro has to install herself in Yubaba's domain--and do a lot of growing up--in order to get them back, while the various occupants of the bathhouse offer help and hinderance.<br/><br/>Underlying the story are distinct yet nicely understated themes on the dangers of selfishness and materialism, and the power of compassion.  One visitor to the bathhouse is a creature so weighed down with commercial waste that it trails slime and stench in its wake.  The other employees give the beast a wide berth but Chihiro, in the manner of all fairytale heroines, goes where the rest fear to tread and is rewarded for her kindness.  In another instance, an initially kind spirit becomes poisoned with greed and transforms into a gluttonous beast.  Yubaba has a child in the form of a big baby (in more ways than one) who reflects Chihiro's own unwillingness to change back onto her.<br/><br/>The film's pace is inconsistant, but the journey is a lovely one, filled with images charming and disturbing and an excellent visual style.  It's a great film to get lost in."

","A fine quality piece of Japanese animation! I have watched this movie twice. The animation, visual effects, colors, and voices are all outstanding. I'd be surprised if it had not won any awards for production quality. However, the story line leaves something to be desired. It's like watching Mulholland Drive...it's interesting, characters are fascinating, the events are dreamlike...you WANT something to happen, you WANT all the wierdness to make sense in the end, but when the end arrives, you see it was just a bunch of surreal adventures all strung together. It has a happy ending but it's still a bit of a letdown at the end. It held the attention of my 6-year old but it wouldn't for most. I would recommend it more for 7-12 year olds, if it's not important to them for the story to make any sense (which isn't for most kids). I rate it 6 out of 10."

"mondoshivan386","Null","1","2","30 September 2002"," a wonderfully crafted film for all ages.
","I just saw this film tonight in the theater. It was the English-dubbed version, and to my surprise, this didn't spoil the movie. In fact the characters and voicing were very convincing and the animation quality and detail strengthened that aspect. The movie is about a young girl named chihiro moving to a new house with her mother and father. They get lost on a side road that leads them to what looks like an abandoned amusement park. It actually turns out to be a spa for spirits and under-world creatures. Soon, chihiro's parents are locked under a spell and she must save them by negotiating with the spirits. I have not seen Miyazaki's earlier films but this encourages me greatly to check them out. I saw this film as a blend of fairy tales and mythology. I even saw aspects of Russian folk tales added in. (The name Yubaba strikes a bell in my mind). I thought the plot lines were nicely weaved together to make a solid story. This is a story that should please everyone. It has morals and symbolism adults should understand, and great animation and cute characters for children and adults alike! It has suspense, fantasy, comedy, and mythology all rolled up into one. There are heartfelt parts, scary parts and cute laughable parts (i.e. the mouse and his bird companion!) I have always been interested in the notion of finding a separate little world within your own world that sweeps you away from reality and takes you to a whole separate place, like a dream. Until a little before the end of the movie, I forgot about my own life!! A great movie if you want to escape reality. The story does a good job of sweeping you away through a variety of characters and plot lines that mystify you. (The frog aprentices were some of my favorite characters). The hidden morals are cleverly incorporated unlike many linear paper-thin hollywood movies. Key themes to look for: gluttony, love, courage, power, perserverence, and other themes I probably missed. That's very likely because this movie takes on so many ideas, you'd have to watch it a few times to get everything! This movie is definitely worth the money and time!"

Take another look and focus the details he shows us: the breath of characters, the look they express, comic timing, the imagery, the subtle philosophy, etc, etc.  His films never assume his audience as immature, unlike today's American animation.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with the mindframe that anything can happen in this world.

","I've never seen animation art to compare with the art in ""Spirited Away."" The detail, the perspectives, and the colors - especially the colors - are extraordinary. Miyazaki has never done better.<br/><br/>This movie, however, is not the one to use to attract new Miyazaki fans. It's for those of us who know and admire his work already. Those who are not familiar with anime will not find ""Spirited Away"" as accessible as Miyazaki's other works.  There are more surreal images, more symbolism, and more layers here.<br/><br/>Gluttony seems to be a theme in this movie. Sen's parents are imprisoned in the form of pigs, punished for gluttony. Miyazaki seems to be making a connection between gluttony and misuse of the environment.<br/><br/>A vast, stinking, filthy creature that seems made of pure corruption comes to the bath where Sen, stripped of her name, is forced to work; with Sen's aid he vomits up much of the debris of our world. A faceless spirit eats everything in sight until Sen stops him.<br/><br/>Despite these images, the movie is visually stunning.  I've never seen colors so intense and vibrant, or such clear-line detail.<br/><br/>Go see this movie while you can; it is in very limited release.

I expected good character development and I wasn't disappointed there either. What I didn't expect was the giggles and the belly laughs from watching some of the activities of the secondary characters.

","It's really interesting.  Princess Mononoke was so amazing that it forced me to seek out and see as many of Miyazaki's other films as I could get my hands on.  This wasn't as easy as it sounds, since even though Disney owns the American distribution rights to all his earlier Studio Gibli works, they keep not releasing most of them. However, after watching a number of his films, I really came to love and appreciate what Miyazaki does as a film maker, and to really be in awe of his talent and mastery of dramatic story telling. I awaited this film's release in the U.S. with much anticipation, and I got the chance to see it last night at an advance screening here in L.A.  I wasn't disappointed. There are many review on here, so I'm not going to go into plot details, but I'd like to say, in response to some other user comments that I didn't find the story structure episodic at all, but rather extremely tightly crafted, with not a wasted beat.  Everything was setup and paid off beautifully, and the story structure blossomed like a flower.  We were transported deeper and deeper into this beautiful universe out of Miyazaki's imagination, and allowed to see such amazing things. I was particularly moved by both the polluted river and the train transporting dead souls.  Both poetic anthropomorphisms were subtly expressed, and masterfully expressed. Ten out of ten.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile."

The screen is filled to bursting with little details, even in the painted backgrounds.<br/><br/>It's funny in parts, and even cute at times, but it never detracts from the story. Again, the details do it. And the voice acting was excellent, better than it was on Miyazaki's Mononoke, IMO. The main characters are all well-drawn and interesting, each one animated with enough personality to make them all very different.<br/><br/>While the story follows some of the elements of the Hero's Journey, it's a lot more about a young girl overcoming her fears and doing what she feels is right. The girl is no superhero, just a regular person who finds a lot more courage inside her than she would have ever guessed was there.<br/><br/>It's superb filmmaking, and if it is playing in a theater within an hour's drive of you, I promise you that it is worth the trip. If you don't leave with a smile on your face, feeling a fair bit better than you did when you sat down, I'd be stunned."
"Inu_Ranma","10","1","2","20 September 2002"," Quite Excellent...
","I went to one of the first showings of Spirited Away today, and was completely blown away. The animation quality blew even artistic gems like Mononoke Hime far out of the water, with quite a few scenes that left me completely without breath in their complete awe-inspiring detail and beauty. The story is complex, well-developed, and easy to understand due to the pacing that brought the film to a whopping two hours and twenty minutes of running time.<br/><br/>The music was by the always-amazing Joe Hisaishi, who has been with Ghibli for all 13 of their films, and there was even some VERY well placed CG by America's own Studio, Dreamworks. The Dreamworks guys loved working with Miyazaki, they said, but they also noted that another partnership is not likely.<br/><br/>So here's my lowdown:<br/><br/>Music: 10/10. Freakin' incredibly done. Japan's 'New Philharmonic' was conducted by Joe Hisaishi, along with a few solo piano moments by Hisaishi himself to mix in an Audio masterpiece alone.<br/><br/>Animation: 10/10. Again. Perfect in every single minute detail. Miyazaki is one of the few Animators in the world who has never used a repeat frame, never had a lack of continuity, and never used a still cel. He continues this tradition and accents upon his true talent by HAND DRAWING many frames that excelled even the very few computer generated scenes in detail, depth, and beauty.<br/><br/>Story: 9/10: Fiercely original with a few twists of The Time Bandits crossed with Alice In Wonderland. The story is complex and amazing, but there are small bits where it may be a bit hard to follow. Sound: 7/10: The foley was done quite perfectly, making sure that every single movement, even the silly ones, was obviously coming how, where, and when it was supposed to. (another thing Disney can take a hint on.) The dubbing was quite good, but it was not great. It didn't get annoying though, so I only took off a few marks for it ^__^<br/><br/>Characterization: 10/10: It takes a true master to create a story without a villain. Enough said.<br/><br/>Overall: 46/50- This movie was nearly perfect. So perfect, as a matter of fact, that is was as good, in my opinion, as THIS film can get while being THIS film. See it now, or forever know that you missed seeing a masterpiece such as this on the big screen."
"JG2001","10","1","2","17 September 2002"," A perfect follow up to Princess Mononoke.
","After Miyazaki created the more maturely minded Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an excellent return to some of his earlier themes, such as childhood innocence and how love and friendship can save the day, all without the typical shmaltz that infects Hollywood childrens' films. The film is a blast for older audiences, whether they watch the film with children or others their own age.<br/><br/>Die hard Miyazaki fans will recognize the soot balls from the director's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro, which also strongly focused on childhood. Though, where Totoro was a lighthearted romp, Spirited Away is definitely darker, much in the sense of Alice in Wonderland, though it has nothing to do with Lewis Carrol's work. The atmosphere is entirely Miyazaki's own, and after watching it, it's easy to see how the film set a box office record, becoming the highest grossing domestic film in Japanese history, right ahead of Princess Mononoke."
"THXboy","10","1","2","14 September 2002"," Unlike anything Disney has ever done before
","Spirited Away, or as it's called in Japan, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, is a remarkable animated feature. Sure, rarely any anime films get released in theaters (except for the other kiddie anime films which shall not be named), and one of the most popular animated features in Japan will eventually make it over here, courtousy of the brilliant minds at Disney and Pixar.<br/><br/>
The film, in ways,shares a similar storyline with Alice in Wonderland, but it is much more Japanese in almost everything involved. The color, as with almost every other anime film, is very vivid and detailed. But, don't start thinking it's a music-filled Disney trademark film.<br/><br/>
Contradictory to most Disney films, it's a darker animated feature, both in the script and the on-screen graphics. It didn't get rated PG for just anything. There are some parts in this movie that will scare younger kids, but there are also some other parts in the film that have the right fantasy elements to them, and kids will appreciate that.<br/><br/>
Concluding, both the young kids and the hardcore anime fans should check this one out for not only it's subject matter but for it's vividness and superbity. (Sure,it's dubbed into english, but that doesn't mean that it's the end of the world. Most dubbed films are okay to watch, anyway.)"

","I just got the HK DVD (japanese with english subtitles) of this and compared to all of the Miyazaki films, this is a small departure but excellent in all new ways.<br/><br/>Usually Miyazaki has strong lead female characters, but Chihiro (Sen) is quite shy and weak, but transforms which is exactly the point of the movie.  It's a great teaching film for kids and never gets heavy moralistic or filled with tacked-on adult issues.  Its about being pushed and accepting the challenge and dealing with hardship in a noble way.<br/><br/>Its also got a good amount of scary stuff thrown in, which I recall, made my childhood stories all that more better (Slovenly Peter and Beatrix Potter and Roald Dahl scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid).  Scary yes, but once adjusted, the frightening spirit world which the small girl Sen is suddenly trapped in contains very human-esque monsters, and cute critters as well for laughs. I like the concept in the story that the sprit world inhabitants are repulsed by humans and are more scared of Sen than Sen is of these monsters.<br/><br/>We know that Miyazaki aint pulling any punches when dealing with kids stories.  No sappy Disney crap here.  People bleed, die and suffer in Miyazaki's films, but like any good epic adventure, suffering builds character and creates strong-willed and sophisticated people out of mere children.<br/><br/>Sen is an amazing fantasy. You are sucked in almost immediately and really identify with the protagonist, who must figure out how to survive and eventually escape back to her own world.  Its surrealism to the highest level in the definition of being dreamlike. Its a vivid dream you'll remember for days if not a lifetime."

","I enjoyed this movie very much. I can still recall when I was watching it the first time round, I could not take my eyes off the spell binding visuals and ended up missing some of the subtitles. Its that good!<br/><br/> In Spirited Away, a little girl was marooned in a spiritual world and subsequently enslaved by an 'Enterprising' Witch to work in a bath house for gods and demons. Literally signing her name away in this strange new world, we join the little girl in her fascinating journey to regain her freedom(name) and save her parents( who were unceremoniously turned into pigs by the evil witch prior) along the way.<br/><br/> Spirited Away's awesome sights and sound elevates it into a classic amongst animated films. The film can be enjoyed solely on the level of a family entertainment/ kid flick. Which is why I admired the director(Japanese Master animator Hayao Miyazaki) even more as he has also  crafted a fabled story with shaded hues, where nothing presented is clearcut black or white. I particularly liked the way they treat gods and spirits in a manner befitting its heritage. Infact, this unpretentious film can also be viewed as an allegorical meditation on innocence, Asian values, spirituality and existentialism - deep issues worth pondering for folks out there.<br/><br/> Anyone from 6yrs to 106yrs old will enjoy Spirited Away as it brings out a child like wonder within you, while simultaneously offering a wealth of wisdom and insights. However cynical you are of 'cartoons',  you will be charmed. This should be one reason why this CARTOON has become the All time Biggest Box Office Hit in Japanese History, grossing more than US$200million in Japan alone!!"

","Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki doesn't necessarily hit the<br/><br/>target every time he makes a film (though anime mavens may<br/><br/>disagree), but SPIRITED AWAY is a charming and inventive return<br/><br/>to form. When a young girl and her parents move to to the country,<br/><br/>they unwittingly come upon a spirit city that has the parents soon<br/><br/>looking like hopelessly inflated versions of PORCO ROSSO. The<br/><br/>sheepish girl now has to face a world of witches, cannibals, spirit<br/><br/>stealers, and shape-shifters to find a way out of the mess before<br/><br/>her parent turn into hash. The spirit city is an enchanting (and<br/><br/>somewhat menacing) riff on the theme park theme, but its<br/><br/>denizens are so varied that every encounter becomes an<br/><br/>adventure. SPIRITED AWAY sustains a mood of gentleness<br/><br/>despite some harrowing episodes, and the visuals are so<br/><br/>extravagantly inventive that they're almost druggy. See the film<br/><br/>before Disney dubs it...but definitely see it."

Like in Mononoke, the imaginary world of Miyazaki of filled with enchanted creatures and gods, all of them extraordinarily original. However, Miyazaki now introduces humour to his film.

","I watched the English language version of this nightmarish film and I can't understand the lavish praise bestowed on this Japanese animated fantasy. Its colors have a muted, washed-out look as it tells at great length the murky story of a little girl (with a screechingly high-pitched voice that gets on the nerves) who gets separated from her parents and enters the dark world of an abandoned amusement park. None of it makes any sense--at least not to American minds--so there must be something either lost in the translation or lost in the vast differences between American and Japanese culture. If this is a picture kids can relate to, I can only suppose that more kids than I thought are living in a nightmarish world ruled by adults.<br/><br/>The story goes on for two hours without presenting anything except turning the girl's world into a nightmare of dead spirits and mean-spirited elders against which she is supposed to eventually be reunited with parents who have been turned into pigs. <br/><br/>It's all so weirdly incomprehensible to adults and let me say firmly that there is no enchantment here. Perhaps you have to have the imagination of a ten-year old to see what's fun about this strange and fearsome world. Instead of entertaining us in the manner Lewis Carroll did with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and his cast of weird characters, it is much too dark and intense to be called anything but a Japanese nightmare of epic proportions with elements of other famous fairy-tales working their way through the tale.<br/><br/>The dubbing for the English version should have used a different voice than the grating one used for the little girl. Definitely not a charmer."

It uses a lot more CG that previous Miyazaki films, and there are some quite impressive scenes because of it. I don't mean the obnoxious CG that stands out from everything else, but the kind that blends in perfectly. Graphic-wise, it's a very beautiful film. Story-wise, well, I wouldn't call it Miyazaki's best work, but it is still very entertaining. There are many ""interesting"" creatures in this movie, along with a few that you might recognize from previous Miyazaki movies. All in all, entertaining, but nothing spectacular. The thing that bugged the the most were some of the voices. In particular, the black guy that kind of looks like the villain from the ""Scream"" movies. That had to be one of the worst casting jobs I've ever seen. It's worth seeing at least once, but seeing how movies cost $15 a pop here, I'll probably be seeing it only once. 6 out of 10."
"johnral321","2","2","8","24 April 2018"," Torturous -- over-rated
","I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to say something about this one. I have seen this ranked high on IMDB for years and I could not bring myself to watch a Japanese animated film. But I ran out of things to watch and thought, ""heck -- it's very highly rated so how bad can it be."" Well -- famous last words. I got about 1 hour into this mess and I had to stop and read some reviews to see if I was missing something, or if I could find out how the ratings were so high. I saw several strong reviews which seemed legitimate, and so I forwarded about 40 minutes toward the end to see if something cool happened in the last 20 minutes to justify the preceding two hours. (Sorry -- I would not normally review a movie I did not watch in toto, but I saw 75% of this and that was enough of a sample size...) Basically this was bad. The plot was bad, the lines were bad, the characters were weird. I understand that people see a lot of symbolism in this movie and that it speaks to deeper themes. But any message is so buried in this bizarre plot and these incomprehensible characters that it is lost through all the muck. I'm not quite sure why this fails where things like Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz work. Those movies (stories) arguably have bizarre plots, characters etc., but somehow those work and this does not. (Perhaps the animation is a part of it.) I was tempted to say that this is just a children's movie; but then I realized that I would not even put a child through this. Even if this entertained a child, I don't know that it would be good for their development to sit through this nonsense. They might as well watch four episodes of Scooby Doo; at least that has a plot and some semi-logical resolution. Part of this could be cultural too; perhaps this plot and symbolism work better in the Orient; not sure. But now I'm regretting that I did not stay with my gut feeling and dodge this one. I was inclined to give it a 1/10 just to counter-balance some of the high ratings here, but I don't want to go that far; 3/10 seems right. Maybe I'll try this again in 20 years and see if I perceive it differently; but for the next two decades this one is on the shelf..."
"tfrizzell","Null","2","8","28 May 2003"," Too Many Fundamentals Got ""Spirited Away"" Here.
","The Best Animated Feature Oscar winner of 2002 is an odd cinematic product that makes very little sense and seems interminable at times (running approximately 125 minutes total). The film comes from Asian writer/director Hayao Miyazaki, a noted animator who has been in the medium for over 30 years. ""Spirited Away"" concerns a young girl who is moving with her parents to a new home, but a detour along the way forces the youth to grow up quicker than expected. An old abandoned theme park is discovered and soon her parents have turned into pigs and she is forced into a mystical world of large frogs and other strange creatures. Now she must find a way to get her parents back to their human forms and return to her rightful place in the world. Overall the animation goes beyond the Toonami realm and is technologically impressive. Also the musical score is reminiscent of that from ""The Last Emperor"" and it gives the film an added dimension that it desperately needed. The look and sound of the movie definitely save the day as the story is a pure mess. ""Spirited Away"" is too long and dull for children and is much too disjointed for most adults to get anything out of. Still an interesting movie, but far from as great as many would lead you to believe. 4 stars out of 5."

"c0mputergenius7","3","4","24","30 May 2007"," Not a masterpiece for young children
","Young kids usually don't find any movies to be weird, but this is a film young kids agree is too weird. This film was not produced with American kids in mind. Young kids don't care about symbolism or subtle details, they want action or comedy all the way through. If you're a parent who wants to entertain your child, rent Good Burger, Pirates of the Caribbean, or The Pink Panther remake instead.<br/><br/>In Japan, animation has a very broad appeal which extends into a higher age range, Japanese children also have background knowledge on the spirits of Shinto and the spirits' harmony with nature. This means that in Japan, this film can be appreciated and marketed well to a large demographic, young to old.<br/><br/>American children however are less fortunate, kids aren't even in tune with their own cultural heritage, much less be expected to understand the Japanese style of this film.<br/><br/>This film is ranked 1 better than ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in the IMDb top 250, I'm not going to say ""Kwai"" is an inherently better film, but it does appeal better to its intended audience. The intended audience for ""Kwai"" is someone who likes war films, and possess a degree of patience. Most people who watch ""Kwai"" will meet this standard. A knowledge of Japanese culture is not required, but does help if one wants to appreciate subtle details such as Japanese officers making sure not to turn their backs to Commander Saito when they leave a room.<br/><br/>""Spirited Away"" almost requires some knowledge of Japanese culture, and this is asked to children, many of whom have been outside their own backyard. American parents are often just as oblivious, and sometimes less so, as they have no prior exposure to anime.<br/><br/>A majority of American adults who don't understand this movie may be intrigued by the unfamiliarity of the style and message. This can lead to a positive overall feeling and review. Children, however, don't have the patience to watch a film twice, nor the capacity to understand a film's deeper meaning. Young children who like this film are usually already into anime. Even if a kid is into anime but doesn't like this film, they will kid themselves into believing they liked it even though they don't. This is because saying they like it matches the expectations children have of themselves due to their still-developing personalities. eg. If a kid likes anime, he wants to like all anime.<br/><br/>Miyazaki has always had ""Made in Japan"" stamped over his films, which limit their global appeal. He has never made, for instance, a film about Africa, and if he did, it would be made in Japanese animation style, not made to look like African art.<br/><br/>Ironically, Miyazaki randomly references non-Japanese cultures, confusing American children even more-so. The witch is based on Russian lore, so what are the chances of an American child knowing this? If he is such a brilliant film-maker, he should find a way to explain the cultural references to foreign audiences who are unfamiliar to it within the film, not only on DVD extras."

"ninopereirapt","4","1","3","26 March 2020"," Very scary for young children.
","I would say this is a movie for over 12. The first 10 minutes are extremely intense, building up a lot of mystery and suspense. There is a particularly disturbing (very visual) scene involving the parents of the little girl. All of this is amplified by the raw graphics and rough drawings. Other movies for children with intense/violent scenes limit those to a few seconds followed by relaxing and calming scenes. I found the initial scenes to be far over the acceptable limit (in duration) for children under 12. After you get used to the graphics and story you might enjoy it but overall it's not an exceptional story. I certainly recognize the creativity and originality of the graphics but personally I never got engaged by it. As a piece of advice, if you are a responsible parent don't let your child/children watch this movie alone or at night. It might upset/distress them."

"lmpindy","5","1","3","23 April 2015"," Spirited Away
","There are plenty of strengths from movies being animated. They have free reign to show whatever they want to. Meaning, nothing is out of the limits, they can create any monster, person, or item they wish. One limitation would be the creditability of the film. Most critics will often over look animated films simply because they are animated. If Spirited Away was live action, almost all of the magic in the movie would be removed. Most of the characters shown in the movie would not be possible to use without animation. One of the key elements to Spirited Away is its strange storyline and overall theme of the movie. The uniqueness of the film is by far the main engine driving this movie. I for one have not seen a story like this before, especially not in any Pixar or Disney films. I was not expecting the story to play out in the way it did. I thought she would casually discover these monsters as she was adjusting to the new school. I did not expect her to be trapped with all of these monsters and would not be allowed to escape. I also did not expect the film to take place in a bath house. This is by far one of the reasons as to why this film separates itself from Disney and Pixar. At times the movie was pretty graphic and blood was shown. Blood is rarely shown in animated movies directed towards a younger audience. As far as approaches to animation, I could see a difference in the way the movies are made. Pixar animation seems brighter, bolder, more defined. It has been a while since I have seen an animated Disney film. I cannot find a clear cut political or environmental message in the movie. The only theme that really stood out to me was when her parents got transformed in to pigs because they were eating too much."

"Alex_Hodgkinson","9","1","3","5 April 2014"," A Beautiful Film
","This film was part of my childhood. As a young boy, I was enthralled by it. I'm sorry, but this is something many of you will not understand as you will no doubt have been at least ten when this masterpiece came out. For some reason, the surreal creepiness of Spirited Away left me entranced as a child. There was something unexplainable and satisfying whilst watching this when I was younger. When I looked back at the movie, having not seen it in many years, I could only remember certain moments of it and how I felt during the moments. I cannot put into words how much this affected me as a child; the movie had a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed a nigh perfect film. It all feels magical and focuses on the characters, all of whom are wonderfully wrote and portrayed. You can connect with Chihiro, whether you're an adult or a child, and know her feelings as she progresses through the unique and strange story. This film is, in a way, a coming of age film. It shows Chihiro turn from a spoilt child into a well mannered young woman due to the events of the strange, but satisfying story.<br/><br/>Miyazaki directed the film perfectly, in my opinion. This was possibly my favourite thing about it. He didn't focus on the amazing, majestic buildings and architecture, he focused on the characters. He treated the artwork as if it wasn't important, which is the perfect way to go about it. Beautiful buildings and scenes that could be explored, but are left to the imagination and aren't widely focused on.<br/><br/>I also adored the music for the film. It was always there in the background, but never was it obnoxious or annoying. It fit perfectly with the scenes and helped the story along. Credit goes to Joe Hisaishi here. He scored a perfect soundtrack to the film. Without it the magic is gone, in my opinion. My favourite is definitely the haunting, rather bittersweet main theme to the film. The music fills me with nostalgia and is so calming and touching.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is extremely well known for his animations. Sadly, I've never been into Japanese animated films or TV shows. The only animations I'm well versed in are Disney films, such as 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. This is the only Japanese animated film I've ever watched beginning to end. Fitting that my first is one of Miyazaki's, and arguably his most famous and well known as well.<br/><br/>I watched the film as a child in English dub. After hearing everything about the Americanisation, I viewed both the Japanese with subtitles and the English dub. I honestly cannot see how the English dub ruins the film, as purists say. I was fine with the voices, not even Chihiro annoyed me, and the added lines were not terrible. I in fact enjoyed the added two last lines at the end. They added a wholeness to the film, linking the beginning and the end. <br/><br/>The only added line I did not like was when Chihiro recognised the dragon as Haku when this was not apparent yet. I actually preferred the dubbed version because with it I could enjoy the scenes without constantly reading the subtitles. Spirited Away is the one film where you simply must see the beautiful scenes without the distraction of subtitles. I see no problem with the dub in this particular film. It makes it much better to those who cannot speak Japanese, in my opinion.<br/><br/>So, did the film live up to my nostalgic memories? No, of course not. When does anything? But I certainly enjoyed filling the gaps and I'm happy that I didn't skip this in fear of ruining nostalgia. This is truly an amazing film. Not perfect, as the plot just seems unnecessarily weird at times and I can't say I fully enjoyed everything. I'd say that if this were a film for adults, I'd give it a 8/10. But this is a film for children, and I remember watching it as a child. I loved it to an extent which I cannot describe. That would give it a perfect 10/10. This film brought the child out of me. Truly beautiful, in almost every sense of the word."
"bbmermaidlover","10","1","3","2 December 2013"," A movie deserving of its acclaim
","Even among all of Studio Ghibli's—and Director Miyuzaki's— brilliant movies, Spirited Away sets itself apart. At the surface, it's no more than an Alice in Wonderland-esque journey with a Japanese twist, but the film is so much more beautiful and profound than that. We discover a whole world unlike anything we've ever known, and find humanness in the most unlikely of places. Through Chihiro, the story's protagonist, the movie expresses everything from the folly of youth, to first love, to the uncertainty of life itself. And though this may all sound overly decedent to describe an animated movie created over a decade ago, I assure you, It's a well-deserved description. From the start, in the first five minutes of the film, Miyazaki somehow manages to tell us all about who Chihiro is and what state of mind she's in—the anxiety of leaving a life behind, frustration with the breezy parents taking it all in stride, uneasiness about the future, the moodiness of adolescence; all rolling together to express that ""immaturity"" and ""loneliness"" that is combated and altered throughout the rest of the movie. For as Chihiro struggles through a world even more alien than the one she had being driving toward at the beginning, she makes the unlikeliest of friends, toughens up, matures, and learns to face the unknown. Spirited Away is a tale not to be underestimated or overlooked. But aside from the story itself, the film is masterfully created, starting with the animation. Though at first it may seem very odd to Western eyes, used to Mickey Mouse and the like, the style of story-telling is very interesting and apt. The use of cartoon animation to express such deep and meaningful themes is very demonstrative of what anime—Japanese cartoons—can do as a medium. And the animation, style aside, is very well done. The flow of movement is smooth and eye-catching. From Chihiro tapping her shoe to get it on better to Haku gliding through the air to Baba casting her spells; every movement almost entrances the watcher in a way live action could not do. The color schemes from scene to scene are quite atmospheric, and it's quite interesting how they may contrast the mood in some parts of the movie and compliment it completely in others, such as (spoiler alert!) when Chihiro is weeping in a vibrant garden full of flowers versus when she sits basically on her own, in a dim and unremarkable train, headed to a place that she does not know or fully understand. Of course, the animation isn't the only thing that gives this movie its unique and poignant feel. The sound is remarkable as well. Joe Hisaishi, the one behind the soundtrack, captures the mood of every moment with a perfect and moving piece. The train scene would not be the same without his beautiful ""The Sixth Station."" I find that, even listening to his music alone, without the film to accompany it, the emotion behind Spirited Away comes clear as day. And the voice acting is good too, though the quality varies depending on if you watch it in the original Japanese or not. Over all, Spirited Away has more than earned the awards it has received over the years. It's a fantastic film to watch at any age. If you're lucky enough to grow up with it, you'll notice that it seems to grow and mature as you do; you'll notice more in it the older you become. And it's certainly mature enough to watch for the first time as an adult. There's no ""wrong"" time for it. It's a movie almost as mysterious and timeless as the setting in which it takes place."

She befriends a spirit by the name of Haku and meets many others as well, including: Yubaba, the head of the bathhouse; Lin, a worker at the bathhouse who becomes Chihiro's caretaker; No-Face, a spirit who becomes attached to her; and many others. The film contains many morals, such as the effects of gluttony and the outcome of pollution. The art was brilliant and the writing was superb. Spirited Away was livened by an unforgettable soundtrack by long-time Hayao Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi. I would recommend this film to everybody."

","Roll over Walt Disney, Miyazaki is a genius and an original auteur, with a penchant for uncovering the human conscience through thought provoking characters, who subvert in every shape and form, their stereotype. <br/><br/>Spirited Away's visceral pleasure derives from the lush iconography, and the poetic expression of the down to earth characters. Yet it pushes the boundaries of cinema. Godard might describe this as a dull, populist drug, with one purpose- pleasure, but this film provokes thematic issues that plague the everyday world. Themes of the environment, water, coming-of age, the imagination, and history merging with the present, stitch the viewer into a sublime world, which makes us reconsider our own. <br/><br/>A masterpiece of Japanese cinema, when the search for the 21st century Citizen Kane begins, I will sit the masses down, and point towards Spirited Away."
"jose-cruz53","10","1","3","7 October 2012"," Perhaps the best one shot film experience a person can have!
","First I note that one should watch this film subtitled, while the American dub is rather high quality, it simply doesn't approach the quality of the Japanese voice acting in terms of conveying emotions. The same applies to any other language.<br/><br/>Take one individual, one screen and 125 minutes. What's the best possible experience this individual could have by looking at the screen for 125 minutes? This is the best. Yep, while I could argue there are films one can get a better long experience by watching them over and over, gradually digesting it, the best ""one shot"" film ever made (that I have seem yet, from the thousands of films I have seem) is this.<br/><br/>The experience I had watching this film for the first time was never equaled by any other film, I could say that only stuff like Beethoven's 9th Symphony had impressed me to a comparable degree. This is not a simple film, it is an spectacle of colors, sounds (with one of the best film scores ever) and emotions. It possesses an immersive power that I didn't though was possible for a film before watching it. <br/><br/>Its sort of like 2001: A Space Odyssey on crack but with much more emotion and characterization. This is truly the best film of the 21st century (while I would put ""There Will be Blood"" is in a distant 2nd place).<br/><br/>Also, I should note that I had never seem a feature length Japanese animated film before I saw this one. Those that say one needs to ""understand"" anime before watching this are clearly wrong. However, its true that this film doesn't match the preferences of everyone, specially those Americans that have had their brains programmed by a lifetime watching only American films to only like the canned products of Hollywood."

","I have seen ""Sen to Chichiro no kamikakushi"" (Spirited Away in Disney's English translation) once now, and I am planning on seeing it many more times, and I am planning to write a review for every time I see it, so that I can add new things I found, and new emotions I experienced.<br/><br/>It all started for me when I got more interested in Japanese culture by reading Haruki Murakami's book The Wind-Up Bird Chronichle. The next name I stumbled upon googling for Japanese masters of art was his, director Hayao Miyazaki. I started watching his first full movie, ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"", and became touched by his detailed (the best explanatory word) way of drawing and exploring theme's. I have now followed through all of his 90-minute-+ works, and I think I can say I feel his intentions and humanism in every of his films.<br/><br/>Miyaki makes two kinds of films: the epic, and the emotional. To me, Spirited Away, is his most innocent emotional artwork. It has two perfect, settings (witch Yubaba's commercial bathing house for the ghosts of the country and witch Zeniba's peaceful residence on the country side), both demonstrating an extreme in the human world. It has a pleasant speed of action, accustomed in children films - a speed which already takes motion at the start with a moving car in a motile environment - that continues to entertain until the end. This is both due to the wonderful Alice in Wonderland-like story and the appealing characters, but also to the magical, colorful and (still the best word) detailed drawings and the unstoppable fantasy floating through the screen.<br/><br/>An important mention is that the fact that this film is an animation (anime) film, and that it is a children's story with a child hero, does not take away that it is a film only enjoyable for children. None of Miyazaki's films are. If you are a western man or woman, this film (and I highly recommend ""My Neighbour Totoru"" or ""Tonari no Totoro"" too), this film will introduce you to the vagarious Japanese culture aspects of shape-shifting and the rest of the ghastly occupied spiritual worlds. A world in which you are guided by the young heroine Chichiro and her (humanistic) relationship with Haku, through the frames covering the essence of emotions that go from loneliness (Kaonashi / No-Face), to love (expressed in its purest form by Chichiro, to her parents, and to her soul mate); through frames half criticism, half teachings (in the form of The ghost of the River, Okutaresama); but most of all through the frame of Imagination. A frame you will never forget.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Quite often I'll use the IMDb reviews and ratings to recommend a film, and that was the case here. With a ranking in the Top #50 as I write this I was anticipating something really special but was left somewhat disillusioned when it was all over. Probably the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a coherent story line, or more specifically, the way the story veered off in completely different directions as if it was being written while the filming was already in progress. Story continuity seemed unimportant, one such example would be Master Haku's insistence with Chihiro that she must persist in getting a job from Kamajii the Boiler Man and refuse to take no for an answer. Failing to do so so would put her in jeopardy with Yubaba, but Kamajii simply recommends that Chihiro request a job from Yubaba directly, which she does.<br/><br/>There's also the instance when Chihiro, now Sen, recognizes the bloody dragon serpent as Haku. How did she know that, and more importantly, how does the viewer come to that same conclusion, other than Sen's say so? There was enough of this kind of stuff to bother me in terms of effective story telling.<br/><br/>I would surmise that Japanese anime is directed specifically at teenagers and young adults, and that's OK, just as it was back in the Fifties and Sixties with the explosion of monster films a la Mothra, Rodan and Godzilla. But to elevate ""Spirited Away"" to the level of masterpiece as some would suggest is carrying things a bit far to my mind. Perhaps in terms of technical achievement, one would have a point. The film is beautifully made and quite colorful, and some of the concepts seem original like the bathhouse for the spirits, but overall I was left unimpressed. Perhaps this is an acquired taste or maybe I'm too old to appreciate the genre, but this film didn't really do it for me. But you know what, I watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and I thought that was more thoughtful and insightful, so I'm not closed minded about the whole thing. I guess I'll have to try some other titles to see what works for me."

","When her parent's spirits are consumed by their own greed, Chihiro must work in a bath house to find a way to rescue them, only for her to become sidetracked in a troubled place The first anime film to win an Academy Award brings together a collection of vivid imagination and collective youthful experience and innocence from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki that is certainly worth seeing for numerous reasons.<br/><br/>This film to me has a somewhat emotional impact. When I was young I loved watching the Pokémon series along with Card Captors and others and having been absent from such animation for many years, watching this film revives that love of careful and beautiful cartoon styling with an exuberant fantasy and imagination that is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>This was partly the reason I watched it but for a better reason reviewers had critically acclaimed this picture as a work of genius and it is easy to see why.<br/><br/>Pixar are the current global kings of animation seemingly unbeaten in box office records across the world. Creating stories revolving around real world issues but containing imagination adds to their appeal, none more so than Toy Story and Wall-E. Spirited Away follows a similar attraction, bringing in many traditions of its Japanese maker.<br/><br/>The film is a spirited fantasy that creates wonderful illusions of possibilities. There are brilliantly designed soot like spiders, a humungous Granny typed villain, pig parents, a gold given anything eating no faced monster and a floating train ride. The design is something otherworldly that can' be explained unless seen. However it is what these pictures and designs symbolise in the stories' context.<br/><br/>The greedy self obsessed parents, the contemplation of thoughts and a slowdown on the train, the impact of friendship against adversity and the manipulation of gold and other riches in a working environment. This is not just fancy showy art this is meaningful and picturesque entertainment.<br/><br/>Whilst the same could be said for Pixar this 2001 release has in my opinion one of the finest scores to grace an animation. The complete juxtaposition of music and moment may bring tears to your eyes. The train scene near the end is the best moment as signs fly by and the day turns into night and people move on, a heavenly scene of pure movie magic.<br/><br/>On first viewing I was astounded by the film's conformity to many ideologies such as magic, parenthood, slavery, love, lust, youth and manipulation. Come the final showdown there was a multitude of quick fired ideologies that mashed everything together and left the film hovering for the viewer's personal interpretation.<br/><br/>There are a few unanswered questions and a few eyebrows may rise and that's also part of the beauty as this, without a shadow of a doubt, contains all the necessary elements to entertain anyone of any age, truly brilliant."

","While I have not yet watched an awful lot of Animé, I can say that this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. The animation is crisp and gorgeous, the style is excellent and with the right amount of motion to it, and design is impeccable, with beautiful, grotesque and amazing images presented for us to take in. Lighting and color palette are broad and well-chosen. An immense amount of imagination and creativity went into this, and you can feel it from start to finish. We are presented with a fascinating, strange world, an our trip to and around it is engaging. With a running time of just over two hours, this is the longest of its kind. However, it has spot-on pacing, never boring or overstimulating the audience members to the point where you take a break from your viewing, in spite of the odd, and once or twice even disgusting, things that this shows us. It is also open to interpretation. And in spite of that, it also tells a story so that anyone, of any age, can follow it. Not everyone will understand everything that's going on, but we can all enjoy it. I can only comment on the original actors, as I did not choose a dubbed version; their work is marvelous, and that goes for every performance. The dialog is well-written. Apart from some potentially scary and/or disturbing content, there is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with 18 minutes(!) worth of trailers for it, and, on the second disc, the whole movie in storyboard form, with a commentary track, subtitled in English, a well-done, informative and entertaining 47 minute making-of featurette made up of behind the scenes footage, concept art, clips and narration(in Japanese, subtitled). I recommend this to anyone who can let go of the expectation of realism in their fiction. 10/10"

","I saw the movie ""Re-Cycle"" not that long ago and people on boards for that film talked about two scenes that resembled each other so I wanted to see this one. I have seen another film made by this company ""Nausica"" and I could tell there were similarities in music and animation style. Well the bridge scene was a bit similar, but my girlfriend says there are a lot of tales in Asian culture of holding your breath so the spirits can not see you so it really was not to a like. Actually, I found this movie while a bit flawed here and there for my tastes more entertaining than that other film and much more whimsical. A girl and her parents are driving to their new home and get detoured along the way and end up at what appears to be the entrance to a long abandoned theme park. Well the daughter, named Chihiro has a bad feeling about this place, but her parents just have to explore. Suffice to say the daughter's bad premonition about this place turns out to be correct as the parents stumble upon a lot of food in one of the buildings in this place and proceed to eat the food like Goku eats in Dragonball Z. In the end the girl ends up trapped in what is the spirit world, and this theme park which is actually a bath house for the spirits. The girl ends up getting employed by the witch who runs the bath house and has her name basically stolen by her as she goes from Chihiro to Sen, a boy named Haku at times seems to want to help her and at others seems cold to her. Her parents are pigs, a strange creature seems to really like her and she gets to meet all sorts of interesting new chaps. The problems I found with the piece you ask? Well despite a rather lengthy runtime of 125 minutes it still feels like it needed more. Many interesting plot points wrapped up with not enough development, like No-Face. The twin sister's strange turnaround in they way she acted and treated the girl. The way she gets back seems a tad rushed too, however for the most part this movie was simply a delight."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","3","4 October 2008"," A fiercely imaginative animated odyssey from Miyazaki
","Coming into this film I had recently watched a trio of Miyazaki's earlier efforts and was looking forward to seeing his most highly regarded film. I can now say that I have never seen anything quite like this, though the unbridled creativity turned out to be a bit of a double-edged sword in my case.<br/><br/>Outwardly the story is simple enough as Chihiro and her parents stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park and unwittingly trespass into a world governed by spirits. It is then up to Chihiro to gain passage for herself and her parents back to the real world.<br/><br/>The story's characters and events are probably not as original to Japanese viewers but as a North American viewer I found the content to be exceptionally weird and imaginative. In fact, I found it so original that I was half the time slack-jawed, saying to myself, ""What is going on here?"" Thankfully, by the end of the film the world of ""Spirited Away"" made a bit more sense.<br/><br/>The voice cast (for the Disney dub) is fine but unremarkable. There's no-one worth singling out, either for a stand-out performance or a particularly lackluster one.<br/><br/>The visuals are top-notch, as is typical of Studio Ghibli. I don't know if Disney meddled with the score like they did with other Miyazaki films but, if they did, it is none the worse for their efforts.<br/><br/>If you're looking for originality, look no further. ""Spirited Away"" was a more-than-worthy winner of the 2003 Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Definitely a must-see for animation fans young and old."

"meb9000","10","1","3","11 April 2008"," A masterpiece in every meaning of the word!
","~Potential Spoilers below~ As you probably have read/heard, millions of people around the world are raving about Spirited Away. They ought to, since it is most certainly a masterpiece that will remain as such for many years to come.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie, it was on a TV airing and it was right in the middle. I only watched for a bit, but the stunning animation made me come back for more. I rented the film, and I was completely amazed. The best way to describe this film is that of a dream sequence, with seamless transitions, gentle rolling musical tones, and perfect visuals. The imagination of Miyazaki apparently knows no bounds, as the array of spirits and characters shown in the film put Alice in Wonderland to shame.<br/><br/>The main plot of this film involves the 10-year old girl Chihiro moving to a new house with her parents. Along the way, they find an ""abandoned theme park"" and investigate. However, things are not as they seem when Chihiro's parents get turned into pigs for eating the food of the spirits and Chihiro herself is trapped in the spirit world and is completely alone. In order to survive, she must get a job in the spirit bath house, ruled by the witch Yubaba. From that point, she must demonstrate her inner strength and flexibility in order to survive and rescue her parents.<br/><br/>By far, my favorite part of the movie is the first quarter of it, the introduction of Chihiro to the Spirit World. The main reason is that it is a perfectly presented transition of a girl who lives in OUR world (as evidenced by the Audi her father drives) to the bizarre spirit world. Her reactions, emotions, and the subtle yet important contributions of characters like Lin and Haku just resonate within the viewer. Simply plugging yourself into Chihiro's shoes can let you feel an eerie connection with the emotions presented in the film.<br/><br/>After countless viewings of this film, I continue to be enthralled by the subtleties in the animation by Studio Ghibli. Some may say that the characters have the lesser amount of detail compared to the agreed-upon majesty of the backgrounds, but I disagree. Every emotion on Chihiro was captured, whether it is the nervous jitters you can see on her shoulders when asking Yubaba for a job, or the way she grabs her shirt when anxious. Every aspect combines to create a sort of realism that is no different than live-action films. The fact that most of it was hand-drawn is also amazing. In terms of story, the deep moral growth that Chihiro demonstrates and the various underlying morals injected by Miyazaki help to make this film a feel-good story for sure. I myself feel extremely at peace when watching this film. It is that good! <br/><br/>The main debate that goes on over fanatics of the film is whether or not to watch the English dub. Personally, I can agree on some levels that Daveigh Chase's voice can be irritating, but she also captured the emotions very well in my opinion, which is what counts. Also, her voice sounds much more appropriate given Chihiro's age, rather than Japanese VA Rumi's obviously older tones. The other main problem is the changing of certain dialog between the 2 versions. This is certainly evident, but I think it is mostly beneficial and helps to give a tad more explanation in certain places when needed, except with the final added line, ""I think I can handle it"" (This contradicts the statement by Miyazaki that Chihiro doesn't directly remember her experience at the end). I enjoy the Japanese version with subtitles as well, but it is more difficult to concentrate on the visuals of the film with the subtitles in the way...I say, enjoy both versions, and don't worry about it!<br/><br/>Don't get left out-watch this film. It may take a few viewings, but it is a true blessing to be able to understand its deeper meanings!"

","I am my blood, Asian, so it is just natural for me to watch anime movies. The first one I saw was Princess Mononoke, so it was just natural for me to watch this one next, since it is from Miyazaki. I must say, this film really touched my heart. I haven't been captivated this way by a movie since I saw King Kong two years ago. Any way, I'll get to my points. The idea was actually very original, the main character was a typical cute and quirky little girl, and the film just blew me out of the water. First of all, Miyazaki's art style is really something to look at: he makes the bathhouse really believable, along with all its inhabitants. The struggle of a ten-year old girl to set things straight is something we can all relate to. The music was top-notch, bringing back memories (to me) of home, which would be Asia. Finally, Spirited Away shows, for people like me, that you don't always have to watch action movies with tons of violence. This movie had almost no violence, yet it was better than a lot of action-war movies I watch.<br/><br/>Closing Comments: 10/10. Miyazaki's crowning achievement. Really well done. I think everyone should watch this movie."

Compare the Witch Yubbaba to the Alicia's clowny Queen of the Cards, then you can have a clue of the profoundity this movie breaths.

I wasn't sure why I wanted to watch it, but I told my mum I wanted to go see it. She didn't like the look of it, so I put it out of my mind until a year or so later I saw it premiere on Sky and decided to watch it. I was absolutely blown away by it. I made it my mission to get my friends and family to watch it. I then devoured every Miyazaki film I could get my hands on. Contrary to most people's opinion, I think his films have gotten better. Whilst his other films, notably Nausicaa, have wonderfully rich stories, the feel of his later films are more complete and stand up to the test of a wider audience. There is an indescribable feeling of awe that struck me when I first saw this film, the same I got from Akira.<br/><br/>Obviously, being a big fan of animation makes me inclined to enjoy this film and a desperate love of cel animation that makes me long for another golden age of Disney is going to make me love it that much more, but putting aside the technical wonder of this film, it's visually compelling and has a beautiful story. If you like a departure from reality and have an appreciation of animation as an art form rather than a tool to keep kids quiet, I'm sure you have already seen this film, if not, then I suggest you watch it (subtitled, the screechy dub is unbearable). Years later, I still love this film as much as I did when I first saw it. My rating is obviously just my personal preference, of course not everyone will like this film, but I believe it is a breath of fresh air and a step in the right direction for making classic animation relevant again."

"stefanbe","10","1","3","5 July 2007"," Spirited Away is an amazing and impressive film that all families should certainly see as it stands as an absolutely brilliant work of art.
","Animated films are typically looked down upon as juvenile, especially those in which children play the protagonists. This is highly unfortunate, because that means that people with that frame of mind will miss the majestically beautiful Spirited Away. Hayao Miyasaki is an animation genius and Spirited Away stands as the masterpiece of the Japanese filmmaker. No animation director in the future will be able to match the carefulness and supervision with which Miyasaki makes his films. He is not only responsible for directing and writing a lot of his works, but also working on the animation. It's also wonderful to see a filmmaker who is not afraid to work with traditional cell animation, making Spirited Away is very refreshing to watch in this CGI-drenched world.<br/><br/>Chihiro is moving to a new house and a new school, but she is not in the least bit excited to go. However, she begins to enter a new world when her parents decide to eat the food of the spirits, which soon turns them into pigs. Aided by Haku, a young boy working in the city's complex bathhouse, she goes to the owner Yubaba to ask for a job so she is able to stay there. She annoyingly gives it to her and so begins the adventures of Chihiro (now re-named Sen) in a bathhouse full of mythical creatures and monsters. However, all she has on her mind is to survive her new job, return her parents back to normal and help her new friend Haku. This is all about the journey that Miyasaki takes us on in Spirited Away, one of the most magical and best animated films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't seem like much, but Miyasaki manages to weave a beautiful story with many charming and funny moments. Credit should also go to his screenplay for creating a main character who is much more charming and realistic than whatever Disney releases each year on their direct-to-video lineups. The English voice cast allows the film to work well with Daviegh Chase doing very effective work, even surpassing the previous work she had done as the voice of Lilo in Lilo & Stitch. It is a shame that she has not done more voice-over work for animated films lately. Meanwhile, regular voice artists David Ogden Stiers, Jason Marsden and John Ratzenberger provide their usual fantastic pipes and Miyasaki regular Joe Hisaishi composes one of his most beautiful and memorable scores. However, as with all of Miyasaki's films, the magic comes in the form of the animation which proves that Japan provides some of the best and most beautiful in the world, even rivaling Disney. Spirited Away is an amazing and impressive film that all families should certainly see as it stands as an absolutely brilliant work of art."
"bigseth0420","8","1","3","3 June 2007"," A walk into a different tradition
","Spirited Away has all of the elements that make up a great animated film. The art work is amazing, using the ability to draw movement around movement and multiple movement in the same shot. The artist of Spirited Away has more skill than most I have seen. The film itself is enthralled in traditions from all over Asia, stealing from everywhere to layout architecture design and clothing. But with all films it is not the surroundings that make a film, it is the characters that make a film worth watching in the end.<br/><br/>The characters in this film stick to the traditional anime style character's, which have always seemed to me to be a bit over the top. Where as subtle acting is used in most animation, letting the voice actor bring the spirit on the character out, in Anime I have always noticed an over abundance in drawn, over acted reactions that steal from the format and it's amazing art work. Most of the characters looked familiar and little surprised me even though I have little interest, or experience with anime. This film brought me to the same conclusion that I have had about many Anime features, and I can explain what that feeling is.<br/><br/>Anime is influenced and inspired by the rich cultures or Asia,which include China, Japan, and India, along with many others. These countries have a long rich tradition that they reach to when they are crafting their artwork and entertainment. You can find wonderful examples of this in Spirited Away with all of the SPirits for everything including crap. But right here is my problem. I am sure this film gives many people in Asia that warm feeling in the top of their stomach as every frame lays out things that mean a lot to them. They don't mean anything to me, I'm not Asian in anyway and my traditions and value are somewhat different since my origins come from Europe. I don't possess the heart felt feelings about these stories so I feel that a lot is lost in translation for me. I have tried for years to enjoy anime, but it doesn't work. And this is why I think I have this problem. If I saw Braveheart made into an anime, maybe then I would feel that feeling, but it's unlikely they will be remaking a Scottish legend when they have so many of their own to recreate.<br/><br/>For final comments I say this. Spirited Away was entertaining and well crafted. I am sure the story will work better for other people, especially those who enjoy anime. I suppose I will only be able to enjoy a small part of this films magic since I enjoyed it to a degree. I would suggest this to any anime fan looking for something a little less bloody and sex oriented and more like an anime style Disney film."

Ice age is meant to be a family fun, almost comic animation with the use of cgi whilst spirited away is more serious and a darker form of animation so its not good to compare against each other.<br/><br/>compared to other films done by the same director.... i found this to be his best... ie. the baby being changed to a rat,girls angst at her parents being pig, and the evil black ghost(?)thing which keeps on swallowing people in the bath house.<br/><br/>although howls castle (dubbed version) is extremely good visually with funny characters such as calcifer (fire demon) although has a slightly weaker story than spirited away and princess monokee is a very clever film and almost rivals that of spirited away in the sense of it talking about mans destruction of animal habitats and the conflicts that ensure..<br/><br/>in all spirited away may not suit everyone as yes it lacks the Americans use of cgi and yes it can confuse those don't watch it more than once... bit very entertaining still... but if not to your cup of tea try some of his other works or just stick to American animation"
"Global_Marketing_Pros","7","1","3","19 October 2005"," Analyzing Analysts and East Asian mythological spiritualology
","This animated film reminds me of the visual nature of East Asian people. This is captured on the front cover as the story theme seems to continue the notion that the Japanese spirit must strive and survive in its totality as a unique ethnic way. <br/><br/>The front cover seems to capture the innocence of the Japanese youth in an over stressful atmosphere of proximity of Japan. Looking aside from the direct view that the world in front of her displays as opportunity given the ""time frame"". Moving forward never the less because of a sense of duty to Ryu the friendly dragon. But taking personal time to look aside to the attention of the curious viewer.<br/><br/>The confrontation with the boiler maker seems negotiated as the small black spider like beings escort the youth home. The spirit of a tradesman, or craftsman, burns very earnestly in their own spirited way of life. <br/><br/>Perhaps it is this mystery of faith that is the will to devoutly follow all that is pure like the white kami of Shinto religion, water clear sake, spirit of decisive action of Samurai Budo, and even the thoughts in any craftsman's mind that produces the way of human righteousness via their art.<br/><br/>Its this same sense of duty that if followed blindly will bring you virtue and honor like the concept of a perfect society which a citizen calls government. Always fear the politician with this East Asian budo spirit because they seek to establish a virtuous government as a noble virtuous citizen by example of their deeds that they may sign their oaths of duty. It is their selfless spirit that brings unification of all government duty. <br/><br/>I think this movie A Spirited Way brings many different characters under the same common theme of duty with spirit."

","When I first saw this movie I did not have much of an appreciation for it. Although I loved the animation, and did get a few laughs, the story as a whole did not really intrigue me. It seems as though there wasn't much done to really differentiate this movie from a typical Alice-In-Wonderland story. Although the animation was unique, animation alone is not enough to make a movie. I did enjoy watching the movie and I understand it's artistic excellence, but I feel there is no way this movie ranks as the top animated movie of all-time. The story is so simplistic that at best this movie could be the top 10. I am going to watch this movie again, because I was very interested in the animation, but story-wise I don't think this movie cuts it."

I use that as an example to sort of obscure what people think my view on anime is. <br/><br/>But I am actually very knowledgeable. Spirited Away is one of those movies that is so loaded up with magic that it cannot be good for your health. Unfortunately, amidst this magic something is lacking. This film picks at environmental issues, but does not have any real insight. It has little real insight on anything.<br/><br/>Eye candy is great for some, but I was hoping to come out of the movie the same way I did when I saw Princess Mononoke: Awestruck, Trying to keep track of the numerous themes of the movie. <br/><br/>The story of Spirited Away is all there really is. Chihiro, a bratty young girl, is moving into a new town. Her parents take a 'shortcut' (people should stop doing that in movies) and end up at a Buffet table. They eat. Become pigs. Good for them. Now, Chihiro finds herself working at a bath house for spirits, where she must work until the witch who runs the bathhouse frees her parents. And of course, we get memorable characters. Not nearly as memorably as those from Miyazaki's earlier pig Film Porco Rosso.<br/><br/>Its a good family film, but those who wish for something more will ultimately find it unsatisfying. **1/2/****"

","This is some of the best hand-drawn animation you'll ever see--period. Unfortunately, the plot seems to befuddle a lot of Americans and I don't know why. Why can't American audiences grasp that this entire film is simply a parody of Alice in Wonderland translated for eastern audiences.  If you liked Alice in Wonderland, with all of it's bizarre characters and nonsensical plot diversions, then this movie should be somewhat familiar to you. Also, in the east, cartoons are not just for kids. That's slowly becoming true in the USA as well, thanks to Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. The only cultural hint some Americans might need to completely understand the film is this: There is a Chinese legend in which some dragons decided help out human farmers by bringing them rain clouds and for this, the dragons were punished by the Jade Emperor. The dragons escaped, and decided to become rivers so they could help human farmers forever, safe from the Jade Emperor. --there, that hint should make the ending of the film a bazillion times more logical for you Americans who don't know anything about eastern cultures.  The rest of the film is straight forward fantasy."

The plot summary doesn't do it justice: A girl and her parents wander into the spirit world, her folks get turned into hogs, and she has to figure out how to rescue them. But this is really a beautiful coming of age story about trust, seeing the good in people, being kind when it isn't expected, and, of course, facing new challenges.

","The things I enjoyed most about this Japanese animated feature are it's pleasing visual qualities and it's interesting characters. I've heard it compared to Alice in Wonderland which I can definitely see, but I was also reminded of The Neverending Story as I watched it...maybe because of the dragon/boy character Haku. Regardless of what you might compare it to, it's a tale of a young girl who is thrust into an alternate world full of strange, but interesting characters. If it has a flaw, I felt it ran a bit long at over 2 hours...though I admit I was a bit tired while watching it. It's quirky characters and stunning animation are pleasing to watch, but it didn't quite live up to the hype I had heard about the movie prior to watching it. One other note, I've read others say it's good for the entire family, I think really young kids might not appreciate it that much.<br/><br/>

","I was looking forward to this, the same way I was told to go see ""Princess Mononoke"", which was also quite dull. Well, if this is the pinnacle of high art in the realm of Japanese Abomination, I'll go back to Disney. Maybe something got lost in the translation - like the entire plot. Ocha-roll (later called Sen for no apparent reason) becomes lost in the land of the spirits. She is forced to haul coal against any rational child labor laws, is insulted for smelling bad like a foreigner, and finally finds work in food service and cleaning. So, it's apparently the story of immigration in Japan. Only the Japanese could use multiculturalism as an excuse to make fun of as many races as possible. There's fat Polynesian women, French frogs, and more eastern European stereotypes than you can shake a Punch-and-Judy stick at. There's an import Russian old-woman-crone figure (voices by the amazing Elaine Stritch) named Abba, who is the ""witch who rules the bathhouse"". Yeah, I have some gay friends like that, too. True, the Japanese are masters of ""kowaii kawaii"" cuteness, and there's a great flying gerbil and some funny split-second monster cameos. However, Americans won't understand the daikon creature mistranslated as a ""turnip spirit"", the whole setting of the bathhouse, or the way the idea of spirits, little ""spirit houses"" and guardian statues fit Japanese culture. Personally, I don't understand why everyone told me to go see it... I'd rather have watched ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" instead. ** (out of 5)"

Fantastic animated fantasy by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki constructs a unique story about a little girl who winds up in an amusement park for the spirit world and must save her parents' fate of being turned into swine all the while encountering odd characters, both benevolent and malevolent.

"Quinoa1984","9","1","3","27 September 2002"," An anime treat
","Spirited Away, the latest film from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki (a genius to Disney animators, such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US), is a wonderful family film, that works on numerous levels for kids, not the least being the creative storyline, and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of, well, an anime movie. The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. <br/><br/>A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion (perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination. Even those strident fans of maturer (err extra violent) anime pictures will want to look, maybe more than once. Works on many levels and I recommend it of course, if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke. Grade: A (or 9.5/10)"

"ebiros2","5","3","18","17 October 2005"," Too monotone for me
","I kind of understand the world this movie is trying to express. The world and the characters that appears in this movie are caricature of archetype Japanese personalities. But it's in the area of what I would call emotional human waste dump. I think Japanese also has healthier world views in them asides from the one expressed in this movie. The loneliness, sadness, cruelty expressed in this movie is what kids in the feudal era of Japan would have experienced when they were sent away to serve at a large merchant's house at a very young age. If your family was too poor to support you, that was your only option. This is a fictional modern day version of many stories like this a child might have experienced even as recently as 60 years ago in Japan.<br/><br/>To me, the movie basically had no message. I'm surprised that it was embraced so well by the audiences here. I'm pretty sure western audience are not aware of the psychological connotation of this movie which only have meaning to the Japanese. Hayao Miyazaki has been at producing anime movies for 30 years, and he's been digging a lot into the dark side of Japanese psyche for the past 5 years. It might help to remember things that are almost being forgotten today, but for me I'm not sure if remembering these things are even healthy to begin with. Wouldn't it be nice if a child discovers how to grow up in the world as citizen of earth instead of remembering the saddest memory of the past ?"

"KnightsofNi11","9","1","4","19 August 2011"," Beautiful, touching, immaculate, awesome
","Unprecedented creativity and imagination abound in this glorious fantasy adventure from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki. Spirited Away tells the story of a little girl named Chihiro who finds herself reluctantly moving to a new home with her parents at the beginning of the film. On the way they make a stop at a mysterious ghost town and Chihiro's parents indulge themselves with some food left out on a counter. This causes them to turn into pigs and Chihiro runs away in fear, only to find herself in a strange new world full of gods and spirits all coming across the river to visit the luxurious bath house that Chihiro must find work in if she is to stay safe in the other world. In this strange fantasy land she meets gods of all shapes and sizes, evil witches, giant babies, and even dragons. It is an immaculate and beautiful film, but it is also an incredibly touching story that gleams with love and compassion. It's a true work of visual and emotional art.<br/><br/>It is amazing how much the great Hayao Miyazaki can immerse us in his fantasy world. There's something so incredible about the look of the world and just how every last bit of it stays true to a unique style that Miyazaki has assigned it. Every creature is as astoundingly awesome as the last, which is saying a lot because of the vast diversity of every character and creature in this movie. You have everything from the employees of the bath house which look like offbeat crosses between frogs and humans, to the shadowy No Face who is, in a way, just a black blob with a mask, but is also fascinating to watch because of the unique flare which presides over the entire atmosphere of the film. Even the characters that serve no real purpose to the storyline and are in a way just animated extras look amazing. The bath house is full of these strange looking characters that never become uninteresting to look at.<br/><br/>It's also nice that these fascinating characters fit in with an amazing story and a great concept. The whole idea of a bath house for the spirits just baffles me as to how they came up with that. And the way the concept provides such a great backdrop for the rest of the story is perfect. The story is incredibly unique anyways, but making the main setting a spirit world bath house is, to me, ingenious in all sorts of ways. I'm not sure why it works so perfectly, but it does.<br/><br/>The film also has an excellent sense of humor that is totally appropriate at all times. It never distracts from the story and only adds a charming and lovable quality to the characters and the concept of the film. There are plenty of great moments that received a great laugh from me and in just the right quantities, never impeding on the rest of the film's brilliance. It is always a joy for me when I can laugh so hard and yet be moved so much. That is the precise effect Spirited Away has on me. There are absolutely beautiful moments of this film that possess a kind of sophistication and eloquence that rivals that of a more adult oriented film of this calibre. Spirited Away isn't just good for a kid's movie, it's just plain good.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is nothing less than a genius. His imagination is so powerful and so influential that to not be astounded by something he has accomplished would make me question your humanity. Spirited Away is undoubtedly one of his greatest triumphs, and for good reasons. There is practically nothing wrong with this film. It is a masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be hailed as a classic for years to come. It is so creative, so beautiful, so touching, and so fun. It's everything you could ask for in a film, plus a little more."

There is so much clever animation going on that it is visually a stunning movie to watch.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is renowned for his imagination, but what separates him from other animators and movie makers is that he doesn't invent for the sake of invention or to show off his intellect. There is real purpose to every scene, every character, every set and every bit of dialog.<br/><br/>As others have stated, there are a lot of parallels and commentary on pollution, social etiquette, greed and consumerism, but it's done in such a subtle and clever way that it never comes across as preaching.<br/><br/>The music is perfect and to get the real essence of the film, you have to watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The story, about a girl who goes in search of her missing parents only to end up in a bizarre spirit world, is simple yet brilliantly told.<br/><br/>Animation is superior to most of the CGI driven animations from Hollywood. The fact that Miyazaki insists on hand-drawn material for his movies really comes across in the characters. There is real depth to the sequences. This was my first Miyazaki film and I became an instant fan, having now watched a lot of Studio Ghibli titles.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is fantastic, storyline simple but clever and the animation is absolutely mesmerising at times. Great for kids and adults, don't miss it."

This is one of those movies you don't understand unless you're older. I suggest everyone watch this movie.

This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie was a terrific anime style film that shared the story of one girl's journey through a mystical land full of spirits and magic on one level and on another level discussed the issue of tradition and modernity in Japan. The film was cleverly titled Spirited Away, and presents every aspect of the film as a symbol which correlates with the prevalent issues that are present in today's society and more centrally in Japan. Some of the issues that were presented to the audience were consumption, population, and tradition. It was very interesting that the film's director chose to present these issues through a medium that an unsuspecting audience would merely see a children's film with a child-like plot but as someone who is more familiar with Japanese culture I was able to recognize the hints towards the religious presence of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. I especially liked the fact that the little girl, Chihiro, who represented the heroine of the story was put into situations that she had no control of a from mother who showed next to no affection to traveling through a spirit world where she is responsible for restoring the order that the world once contained. I appreciate the many levels of the film and I realize that the movie would probably have seemed immature to me had I not been aware of what is happening in Japan."

Sometimes i get that feeling when watching a movie, like if the film-makers enjoyed themselves immensely while making the movie. I get that feeling here, there are just so many good ideas.<br/><br/>The animation itself is strange in the same way that Japanese animation often is. It's quite far removed both from the regular Disney-style animation as well as from the computer-animation of Pixars movies. It's a style hard to describe since it seems like a mix between different styles as well. It looks nice though and works very well.<br/><br/>I could write a lot more about this movie, but i won't.

I am an adult now, by definition, and I don't have the same imagination I used to have when I was younger, however this movie brings that imaginative youngster out of me (sheesh I sound like a senior citizen). The movie has beautiful animation and a wonderful score. The music throughout the film captures the atmosphere impeccably. Some people have given this movie negative reviews saying that there was no clear plot, well I say when does a dream have a clear plot? It really does'nt now does it? Not that I am saying that this movie is plotless, in fact the simple plot is all that is needed here, nothing else. There is even some bias mainly because it is not a ""western"" story, and it deals with some aspects of shintoism and eastern belief in spirits...etc. I was discussing this movie with a friend who did not like it saying he thought it was ""weird"" with all those ""spirits and monsters"" in it. So I asked him if he liked 'Alice in wonderland' and 'Wizard of Oz'? Guess what he answered? In fact he became aware of his bias.

At least the American version has John Ratzenberger."

","'Spirited Away' is a haunting and imaginative story (a Japanese animation) about a young girl who ends up in a world filled with gods and amusing creatures and characters. She must save her parents, which have been turned into pigs by a witch, and she must avoid getting caught herself. 'Spirited Away' is a unique look at culture and at imagination; some of the concepts are completely different, so the film may seem odd to some who do not understand some of the elements behind it. 'Spirited Away' is an enchanting little story which engages the viewer at all times with its particular characters and situations, and it is a film that gives us hope. The animation is also done very well. This film is truly a gem!"
"obsidian-8","9","1","5","23 July 2001"," Well, it's not Mononoke Hime but...
","Although the epic measures of his previous work can't be matched (and maybe he wants it that way), Miyazaki's new Sen is an equal beautiful movie to look at. It's a kind of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" story that can only be executed in Japanese animation. The character design is wonderful as ever and now that it's not of that grim undertone that Mononoke had, it's full of strange characters doing funny things (or vice-versa). And some of them are cute as might be. Furthermore all the while (2 hours and 20 minutes) there's no singing or disturbingly silly behaviour on any part. So let's hope to see this movie in an adequate way in the west as well for it's not your usual for-the-kids-summer-animated-feature. But, then again, no one would have expected this, right?"
"Jexxon","6","2","17","19 December 2004"," Half of a great film
","A truly bizarre film (whose English title, Spirited Away, perfectly sums up the film) about a little girls adventures in a bath house for gods and demons. There isn't much in the way of plot, but it sure makes for some interesting viewing.<br/><br/>It really feels like stepping into someone's dreams (or rather, nightmares). The film had a kind of warped sense of humour that I really enjoyed. Sadly, it also has some elements that left me completely in the dark. If this is due to the fact that I'm not used to this kind of films and mythology, or if things just get lost in translation, I'm not sure. But the first hour is really good, while the second one drags on forever and loses much of the charm of the earlier bits.<br/><br/>The animation takes a little time getting used to. At first, I thought it looked pretty crappy (growing up with Disney and 3D-animation will do that to you), but after a while I could thoroughly enjoy the movie. The animation on the film's heroine Chihrio is especially amazing. All in all, I wasn't blown away by it, but it was still much more entertaining than expected. [6/10]"
"bhcesl","Null","1","6","26 October 2004"," I don't get it.
","Maybe it's just that I am not a fan of anime. I'm not saying I don't like it; I just haven't seen enough of it to make any comparisons. What follows is based on that background.<br/><br/>I have seen a few small anime bits in the past. The Matrix short they were doing in the theaters before movies, and the little bit in Kill Bill come to mind. Those two were incredible to me. Maybe they aren't true anime, I don't know, but they were good. The scenes were smooth, the characters were clearly done, and, while short, everything seemed to fit together well.<br/><br/>'Spirited Away' doesn't seem like that, to me. The drawings are good and, at times, excellent, but the rest seemed sloppy. Unique plot points and characters often seemed stretched and arbitrary, there are scenes about 'love' that don't make a heck of a lot sense, and the characters were often schizophrenic, even those that weren't supposed to be.<br/><br/>In short, I'm not sure why this made it to feature-length. I'm not sure why fans of anime find it so intriguing. I wouldn't watch it again unless I had to. I'm not saying that it was incredibly stinky; rather, it just isn't enough to claim the title of 'great' or even 'good'.<br/><br/>If you are an anime fan, check out other user comments--they might make more sense to you."

","Spirited Away is often considered as the best of great Hayao Miyazaki's animated films. I do not agree, but off course it is also excellent. The very beginning is true horror, none of his other movies I have warched could fit this genre as this one. However, unfortunately in my point of view, the film changes the atmosphere after Chihiro meets Yubaba. The story becomes more confusing than I would appreciate too. One interesting issue I would like to highlight are Lewis Carroll's influences on Miyazaki's work. Clearly inspired in Alice, Japanese master included the Cat and the Hole in My Neighbor Totoro.

","Spirited Away- Always thought that this was the name of two people, and the result was one person, the former one was given the name, and the latter one was resourced.

Okay, not brutal, not terrible, not built for destruction.
1. When xiaobai appeared, I completely fell in love with him and chihiro. When it was dark, someone took my hand and side, let's go, the lights of the city were left behind. Xiaobai ran out and said to chihrio, hurry up, hurry up. The. The lantern was lit. I didn't see his face clearly, xiaobai was very handsome
2. We are transparent until the body disappears. This time I changed to nothingness, this time I reached out my hand and couldn't touch it . Yes, I love TOUGH, I hope arms will drown me like the boundless sea
3. Chihiro burst into tears while eating rice balls, choked and couldn't swallow food. Xiaobai touched her hair, but Chihiro was really strong. Although girls can't help crying and crying so hard, they are really strong.
4. Sometimes I'm more like that injured dragon, struggling, angry, and biting everyone. There are no tears, only blood can flow. But I can become calm, as long as you hold me tightly.
5. I fell in love with a river, and he fell in love with me, and we met when my red shoes fell. Amber River, this is your name, Chihiro, this is my name. Don't forget the name, because forgetting the name will forget everything, forgetting what we once met, forgetting our love. I used to be in your arms."

","Sorry, but I will call anime a cartoon by old habit. I don't understand the varieties of cartoons and think simply: if drawn, it means a cartoon.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is Miyazaki's very impressive world. In general, people who invent and realize their worlds, admire. Everything they have there is thought out: characters, terrain, laws, traditions, sometimes even language, gestures and much more. Only the thoughtful is not always shown, and the more so is not always explained to the viewer, they say, just look and everything, enjoy something different than what you used to see every day. From this point of view, this cartoon really takes to the magical world of cinema.<br/><br/>Despite all the fabulousness and magic, the cartoon does not at all try to clothe everything in light fairy tones. On the contrary, it is scary. The transformation of the parents of the main character, for example. Here the projection effect works more when you put yourself in the place of the heroine and round your eyes with her. And indeed there was a lot of that.<br/><br/>The finest film (the cartoon somehow does not turn the language to call)!<br/><br/>A purely oriental vision of things, so different from ours, is so unusual and fresh. The talent of the genius of our time Miyazaki. The amazing work of animators. Grotesque, but very symbolic characters and images. The theme of friendship, love, betrayal. Beautiful music behind the scenes. I can enumerate the advantages of this masterpiece for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>Compared with ""Spirited Away"" can only be compared with the ""Moving Castle"" of the same Miyazaki .. Although not, I even liked the story about little Tehiro a little more. This story is very simple, beautiful, but at the same time, incredibly wise and heartfelt. I think it can be revised a great number of times, but you will constantly find something new that you did not notice the first, second, third time.<br/><br/>After viewing, there remains a feeling of some kind of childish inspiration and adult thoughtfulness. Reflecting on the actions and words of Tehiro and other heroes, you begin to look at the world around you a little differently. Remembering the live embers and other creatures, you begin to smile. And believe that fairy tales do exist."

"bluemainecoon","10","0","1","11 October 2018"," A beautifully composed film
","Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is the perfect film for anyone who loves adventure. This movie follows Chihiro Ogino, a young girl who enters a mysterious spirit world after her family wanders into a bathhouse village. Terrified but determined to get back to her own world, Chihiro risks everything, even if it means becoming a servant to spirits. This beautifully composed movie is a work of art by Miyazaki, who is well known around the world for producing similarly breath-taking movies such as My Neighbor, Totoro and Howl's Moving Castle. Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a beautifully animated film full of Japanese culture, explores the mysteries of the Japanese kamikakushi, and shows its audience the character development of the protagonist, Chihiro, who goes from grateful in a matter of 125 minutes. 
 To the western eye, many might think that the characters that appear in Spirited Away are bizarre and monster-like. This is only true, however, if you don't have a deep understanding of Japanese culture. The bathhouse portrayed in the movie is something that might have been found during the Taisho period (1912-1926), and it creates a parallel to the modern world that Chihiro comes form. In addition to traditional architecture, Japanese folklore serves as a key aspect to the film. The bathhouse is for gods, or kami, of the Shinto religion. An example of a prominent god is the stink spirit, an enormous, smelly brown pile of runny mud-like substance. Determined to satisfy her first customer, Chihiro scrubs the spirit with all her might, until it reveals itself as the god of a polluted river. By watching this movie, you will find yourself enchanted by the wondrous artwork portraying traditional Japanese buildings and folklore, as well as diving deeper into Japanese beliefs. 
 Many may not be familiar with the Japanese term, ""kamikakushi"". Kamikakushi means ""hidden by god"", or in this movie's case, ""Spirited Away"". It refers to the mysterious disappearance or death that occurs when an angered god snatches a person away. These people's who disappear are usually not found again, but there are some instances where these people show up against out of the blue with no memory of ever being gone. Chihiro, a spoiled girl who acts out against her parents during their move, somehow finds herself in a spirit world, as if she is being punished by gods for disrespecting her parents and therefore taken away. The concept kamikakushi is thrilling as it might remind westerners of Alice in Wonderland, and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wonder the fate of Chihiro and her parents until the very end. One of the most rewarding parts of the movie, however, is not that Chihiro and her parents manage to get back to their own world; it is that Chihiro finds her identity. 
 Chihiro is portrayed as a normal, spoiled ten-year-old girl who is bitter and bratty towards her parents for making her leave behind a comfortable life in a town full of friends. The way she whines and grumbles certainly makes her someone the audience doesn't sympathize with. However, when her parents turn into pigs and Chihiro is left alone in the spirit world to fend for herself, there is a noticeable change in her character. As a slave, Yubaba, the witch who runs the spirit world's bathhouse, renames Chihiro as Sen, stripping Sen of the person she used to be. Although Yubaba's intent was to weaken Sen to enslave her forever, Sen, in reality, actually becomes stronger. Sen is perhaps the only character entrapped in the spirit world to not fall under the world's spell and become greedy. Additionally, Sen becomes willing to sacrifice herself for the new friends she makes, such as Haku, the mysterious man who first helps her adjust to the spirit world. By the time you realize Chihiro/Sen's development in the movie, you will find that you are emotionally invested in her character. There is a particular scene in the movie where Sen visits her transformed parents in a pig pen behind the bathhouse. The tears that spill out as this lost child cries for her parents will make you feel like your heart is being stabbed a million times by a hot dagger. Although bratty at the beginning of the movie, her good intentions and determination helps Chihiro/Sen grow on you.
 Spirited Away is a masterpiece full of Japanese culture, explores the mysteries of the Japanese kamikakushi, and shows the audience the character development of the protagonist, Chihiro, who goes from bratty to grateful. It is no wonder that this film won awards such as the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film and the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year. Spirited Away is one of those movies that is just entertaining to watch the first time. But the more you watch it, the message of the movie gets deeper.With his film's arrival overseas, the rest of the world received a taste of the potential that foreign films have to offer."

Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away tells thr story of a young girl entertaining this world of wonder. It reminded me of Alice in wonderland, but it's a much better film. This film has nearly no faults.

","This is my favorite movie of all times. As other Miyazaki movies, the main character is a girl who goes through a lot during the story, resulting in great change and growing of the character. But, unlike other movies do, Chihiro's change is subtle. By the time we get to the end, we are not actually informed that she has grown. In order to perceive it, we need to pay a lot of attention to her actions and words from the beginning to the end. Not only her character is very well constructed, but all the main characters. Even the secondary ones, I' d say. The meaning behind No Face's actions is one of my favorite things of the story. 
The japanese culture is so well presented in this movie, it makes my Japan-lover heart trembles everytime I watch it. Those who don't know Japan very well may not realize it, but even the way the names are chosen is related to the japanese language. 
Another Strong point is the amazing soundtrack, composed mainly by Joe Hisaishi, one of my favorite musicians of the world. ""The name of life"" gets me to the movie feels even when at the most random moments."

I saw both the english dubbed and the Original japanese version. I think I liked the japanese version more because of the mystery that is added. Subtitles don't mind me. If you have not seen it. Do it! You will understand why this movie is still rated so high after al these years."

","This is made by Studio Ghibly and has a certain look about it. There's so much detail in places. It's colourful, rainbow gorgeous, bright, and pleasing for the eye, even if the story is quite hard. The main character is a girl who loses her parents in a strange place, and she feels lost and alone. A boy befriends her and protects her from the weird ghosts and spirits that haunt the place at night. By haunting, I mean ghosts treating the night as a carnival. I won't spoil the rest but it's basically nightmarish if you ignore the funny bits, like the amusing frog character, 8 legged engine man, and the cute spiders, or susuwatari, who carry coal and eat sweets. I love it and will never get bored watching this."

"CliffFraser","10","0","1","3 January 2018"," Hollywood Animators, Eat Your Hearts Out
","It's some time since I was moved to comment on a movie, but Spirited Away has moved me. I downloaded this movie several weeks ago and noticing that it was an animation I subliminally shelved it. Why? Because for several years I have avoided animated movies emanating from Hollywood. OK, in the early days of computer animation the technology was enough to make the 'new animation' movies interesting. But then, the fact that there was no real story left them with just the technology, which like all things, soon becomes, 'ordinary'. What is missing from all the animated movies I have sampled since is the 'same-ole' animation techniques with overactive characters bouncing around and moving at un-natural speeds. Wow, a seventeen-year-old movie out of 'who knows where' (all the credits are in some far eastern language), that blows all the current animated movies out of the water. In Spirited Away, the attention to detail in every aspect of the story, and there really is a story, is impressive. I will say no more, if you are an enlightened individual, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. More than once. A message for the Hollywood new century Jellyheads, stop basking in the technology, it's just a tool, it's the story and the attention to detail that really matters."

"She_is_my_Sin84","10","0","1","29 October 2017"," The finest animated film of all time
","Animation is a tricky genre and always has been. While the medium is designed to appeal to a wider audience, including children, there have undoubtedly been animated films that capture the true heart of the stylistic choice. That is, animated films have the ability to be more artful than live action. Entire worlds can be created like paint on a canvas.<br/><br/>That's where Spirited Away comes in, Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece from 2001. It was released over 15 years ago and still it stands alone in the genre. That's a bold statement, given the historical animated films, like Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, the golden age of Disney, like The Lion King, or Pixar's deep catalog, particularly films like Inside Out. Even now, we are in a wealthy age of animated films and television.<br/><br/>Yet Spirited Away still holds its own. Why is that? The obvious reasons are the same arguments critics used when this film came out in 2001. It is beautifully drawn, powerfully scored with an excellent story and fantastic acting from the voice actors. None of that has diminished in the years since its release.<br/><br/>But there is also a deeper reason why this film is as close to perfect as you can find. It is undeniably genuine in its message and its reflection of the world we know. Struggle is a part of life, especially for children. Change brings struggle and how we react to those struggles defines who each of us is as a person. We have all been Chihiro at one point or another in our life. <br/><br/>Spirited Away is on the same level as The Wizard Of Oz when it comes to showing us the most important challenge in life in a fantastical environment. I could watch this film over and over, and the emotional impact will be acute every time. That is a testament to Miyazaki's care and passion as a filmmaker. Spirited Away is without a doubt his masterpiece and one of the finest animated films, nay, finest films ever produced."

"vtorviana","10","0","1","20 March 2017"," Spirited Away
","A masterpiece from beginning to end. I watched the movie a few years ago, but only now did I have time to stop writing my review of it.<br/><br/>With a hypnotic script and captivating and deep characters, he builds a pure and true narrative, with the details that one does not expect a typical photograph of the Ghibli Studios, that leave you hypnotized and stunned. Chihiro is a brave and strong girl, who does not give up trying to regain her parents at any moment, and goes through harrowing adversities and leaves you jumping from the chair in fervor, while blindly twisting for her.<br/><br/>All supporting characters have their context line and this gives richness to the long, outgoing Hollywood standards of digital animations and very polished. There is representatives here. We have no masked elements, everything here is very visible and explicit, greed, selfishness, egocentricity and even envy. All very well placed and accessible to anyone who wants to see. From the owner of the spa to the toad that takes care of the aromatic tablets. Anyway, Spirited Away's journey is abstract, sensitive and profound. It contains a unique and playful universe that holds attention and eyes until the last scene. A must-see movie."

","Right after watching the movie I knew I had to write a review about this movie. I was so stunned to see just how beautiful Spirited Away was, especially an anime film from 2001. A true 10 out of 10 film. A MUST SEE!!<br/><br/>Graphics/Animation- Was just so amazing. Hayao Miyazaki, really outdid himself with this film. In fact all of his films. His movies are a must see. It is beyond beautiful, the way the characters move, run, talk, eat... a masterpiece. Almost every little detail on this movie was carefully crafted. You will be awed.<br/><br/>The Adventure- Chihiro's(main character) adventure throughout the movie was indeed mind blowing and fun to watch. The characters and spirits were very unique. I seen many anime that had bizarre story lines or characters but nothing like this. You are drawn to each character in a way. Alongside the characters, the adventure you watch is stuff I love to watch. Beautiful fantasy world. Makes you wish you kept seeing more of this world that she goes exploring through. <br/><br/>Music- So with the gorgeous animation and lovable characters, the music is just perfect. It fits so well into the movie that you won't even need to hear them talk but just listen to the music and watch the adventure and it will still be a perfect movie. It makes the scenes either even more stunning or intense. <br/><br/>Great Laughs and Feels- Not only is it a heartwarming movie that gives you feels. But it makes you laugh. Chihiro is not only cute but you feel for her and the characters. I laughed pretty good at some parts that surprised me. You know you pulled it off when you have a movie you can laugh and at the same time feel all sort of emotions really. And the food shown was so good looking I really wanted to go out and get some grub.<br/><br/>All in all I couldn't think of anything bad to say about the movie. The only thing that had me wonder was the ending, don't get me wrong. A well done ending, but I had a few questions. But I look over it with how everything else was. So with that I couldn't come up with a reason why you shouldn't take the time to watch this or any other Hayao Miyazaki's movies. I know for sure I am gonna be watching the rest of his films."

","Released in 2002, Spirited Away, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, demonstrates the characteristic of determination which is a quality used to overcome adversity. This animated movie is hands down my childhood favorite. Growing up in Japan, I originally watched this film in Japanese rather then English. As a young five year old boy, I was completely in love with Spirited Away. As I got older, I made it a mission to completely watch all of Hayao Miyazaki's films. The meticulous detail that he creates within each and every character in his film is just astonishing. The endless flow of the story line that he created was so smooth as he incorporated many obstacles and successful moments. He masterfully creates such a dynamic personality within each character. Chihiro, the main character, was a twelve year old girl. I personally don't know Mrs. Chihiro, however after watching this film, I feel like I do. After watching this film over a hundred times in my life, Miyazaki created such a powerful image and a realistic feel as if though I was living in every one of Chihiro' footsteps. Her strong desire and unique/different personality kept my eyes glued to the big screen. The little girl never ran away from a challenge because of her motivation to save her cursed parents. If you are reading this movie review... I'm guessing you didn't watch this yet... You're missing out. Watch this magical movie and be prepared to experience the magical world that is, ""Spirited Away"""

They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.<br/><br/>This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best.

Movie just gets interesting with every minute that passes and constant discoveries of new world keeps us speechless. While Chihiro is new to all she adapts very fast and tries to solve mysteries that are going on. She does everything to help her family and it's just nice to watch. Intelligent writing of Hayao and plot development is beyond a lot of movies created by powerful companies. As Chihiro is involved in everything and she goes around trying to figure out how to help her parents, save them and herself and leave that world at the same time she tries to help a Haku and other characters that are trapped in magical land. Finally at the end when Haku realized that his name is Kohaku river and as Set (Chihiros name in magical world) is brought to tell which of the pigs are her parents she does it correctly and sets her parents free. As she has brought to river and crosses, runs to her parents with joy and happiness. Their ignorance about everything shows us that Chihiro is strong character as she realizes that she saved them but they do not know that and anyway she is happy.

","What can be said about ""Spirited Away"" that has not been stated before? This is one of the best animated films ever created and arguably the highlight of Hayao Miyazaki's extraordinary career. This incredibly imaginative work is combined with an emotional story that really makes this one special.<br/><br/>This is the story of Chihiro, a 10 year old girl who is moving to a new city when her parents decide to take a quick detour to what seems to be an abandoned amusement park. However, the park is filled with magical creatures and her parents are turned into pigs. Chihiro must grow up quickly in this exotic world not only to save her parents, but to survive.<br/><br/>I cannot speak enough about the story itself which is expertly crafted or the beautiful animation that includes some wonderful scenes at the bath house, the strange characters that fill the screen and my favorite, the train on the flooded tracks which provides views of the distant clouds that almost had me feeling the cool breeze blowing past. This is a must-see film for sure."

","The movie, ""Spirited Away"" is Hayao Miyazaki's greatest masterpiece to date. The story follows a sullen young girl, Chihiro, who is on her way to her new home with her family. While traveling in the car, her father decided to take a detour and they end up in what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Once there, Chihiro's parents begin eating food and turn into pigs. Chihiro runs off in terror and runs into a young boy, Haku. He informs her that the amusement park is in fact a town inhabited by spirits and demons. The main part of the town is a bath house where the spirits go to relax. Chihiro must work there to save herself and her parents. The cast does a great job at voicing the characters, and the animation is spectacular. Pixar native, John Lasseter, did an excellent job at translating and interpreting Miyazaki's original message of the film. The English version of this film easily highlights the themes of love and never looking back. I believe that these are two themes that Hayao Miyazaki envisioned when writing and directing this movie, and John Lasseter perfectly integrated these themes into the movie when he helped translate the film from Japanese. This film is beautiful and imaginative. Audiences seem to think the same thing since this film is considered to be the highest grossing movie in Japanese history and is considered to be one of the best animated films of all time. ""Spirited Away"" is a light hearted film that everyone should see at some point in their life."

","I thought this film was dazzling, as regards the characters, story, and the animation behind all of it. It contains well-made characters that draw you in and make you feel as if you've known them a lifetime. The story was well paced and did not draw out too long. It allowed each character their fair share of screen time and showed as much of the 'sprit' world as possible. The animation, as it is with Studio Ghibli, was masterfully executed and greatly depicted the characters in the story. I thought this film was expertly made and carries you off to another world while you watch it. It's a joyful adventure for the most part that offers a warm experience in another world."

","Spirited Away is most certainly on the surface a fascinating movie, but inside it baffles those who think that only American animation is good (but to be fair, other films like April and The Extraordinary World and The Little Fox can do that too). The animation works excellently with the character designs and surreal tone of the setting. The characters are mysterious and can engage the audience constantly, if they don't execute it in the style you'd expect. The story seems so familiar yet features so many twists that it simultaneously feels inventive. Despite some dull moments (which weren't helped by the fact that I watched it on a particularly cruddy day), Studio Ghibli is, thankfully, in the vein of DreamWorks and Disney in that they recognize that animation should appeal to all, not only to children, and with all the imagination put into making this, it very clearly shows. This is a film that, no matter how hard the people at Studio Ghibli worked to make it, I imagine they had so much fun doing so. While not my personal favorite Miyazaki movie, this is still one of those animated movies that you should see before you die."

","I've never been good at writing, or voicing my opinion, but this movie is so beautiful and powerful, that I guess I'll have to try my best. So where to start? The amazing, intricate hand drawn animation? The pure creativity and genius of the world and characters of Miyazaki's imagination? The gloomy, underlying themes of good/evil, and of greed? Or the not so gloomy themes of courage, and the power of friendship and love? Even the soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly fitting for the film. Everything about Spirited Away is so perfectly perfect (I know I know). Every scene, animation, note of a song, is filled with true creativity and imagination, and that's one of the best things about this film.

","This is a great movie start to finish. Gives me serious nostalgia every time I watch it. The soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking just by itself. Then to add such visual talent, with just the most in depth, thought-provoking story line, is just the cherry on top of this timeless Anime. Truly a masterpiece!<br/><br/>I love all Hayao Miyazaki works. This one in particular resonates with me because it was the first of his films I'd seen as a kid. Soon following, came Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service. This story never gets old as it only reminds us of the ongoing struggle between or souls and our minds. Who we are physically, spiritually, and mentally. How do we impact those around us and more so, those who came before us. How do we carry their legacies and ideas and morals that make us think a certain way and recall certain memories accordingly. <br/><br/>Funny how an event that is hard to adjust to tends to bring you back to old memories; smells, touch, sight.. all our senses can trigger a memory. This is our instinct reaction to coping or dealing with these difficult, negative emotions; to help us feel better. It also could help us let go or help someone else let go by looking back and remembering something that was once forgotten. It really is quite deep. <br/><br/>Word from the Bird: ""Once you've met someone you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memories to return."" - Hayao Miyazaki"

","Spirited Away is one of my favourite animated films. It is one of the best films that Studio Ghibli has produced. The animation is wonderful, the music is brilliant, but it is far more than just a children's film. It has enough symbolism and deeper meaning to appeal to an older audience too. One thing that did surprise me was how scary the film is. Watching the film now was terrifying compared to when I watched it as a child. Maybe you could argue that the main character Chihiro is quite annoying at first, but I think this is imperative to her character-arc.

"noremac-51039","10","0","1","24 April 2016"," Spirited Away is a great movie where you can see religious Shinto references.
","If you have ever watched the movie Spirited Away, you may have noticed some unusual things about it. As you watch the movie there are many odd and fascinating things. Some people only see the odd but for some there is a much deeper meaning. They see the movie as something with more symbolism than meets the eye. The Journal of Religion and Film does just that. In an article titled Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film ""Spirited Away."" James W. Boyd and Tetsuya Nishimura analyze the odd things you may encounter in the movie and explain them by referring to the Shinto religion. In the movie, for example, when the spirits go to a bathhouse to cleanse themselves. While this may be a strange and surreal moment for a Western viewer, it is deeply meaningful to practitioner of Shintoism, because a key tenet of that faith is the idea of purity. And this theme of purifying oneself runs throughout the film. The article explains that, like a mirror covered with dust, the disposition of our personality, becomes clouded and opaque. One would then have to purify oneself in order to become clean again. You can see this represented by the bathhouse in the movie.<br/><br/>It helps to analyze the symbolism within the movie Spirited Away. When you watch the movie pay attention to the details in the background. You then need to look at the many parallels between what you see in the movie and the Shinto religion. There is a lot to be learned by watching Miyazaki's movies. As you examine the lessons within his movies, you can begin to more fully understand Japanese culture and the values you grew up with.<br/><br/>With this new understanding of Spirited Away, one can see beyond the magical world created in the film. You don't just see a bathhouse, you see a symbol of purification as viewed in the Shinto religion. When you look at Chihiro you can see a girl who may also need to be purified in her own way. Of course when you see the multitude of spirits that come for a bath you are reminded that the world we live in may be more than we thought. You have a better appreciation for the work Miyazaki has done."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","28 January 2016"," My favourite film of all time
","To me, this is the most real film I've ever seen. And it's an animated fantasy film inhabited by spirits, witches and dragons. It takes place in a Japanese bathhouse of all things and is full of magic, strange and new worlds, gods and mystical events. And yet I've learned more from it, identified more with its characters, than from any other film. Hayao Miyazaki is that good of a storyteller.<br/><br/>Now, what do I mean by saying it's real? Simply put, it feels like I've known these characters my entire life. Chihiro, or main character, is a young girl moving to a new town, but on their way there, her family happens upon what seems like an abandoned holiday resort. Unfortunately, things are not as they seem, and her parents get captured into the spirit world, inhabited by gods and spirits. And now she has to accept responsibility for the first time in her life and stand on her own feet in order to rescue her parents.<br/><br/>But that's not the only story line. We also have Haku, her mysterious helper, who has been captured as well, in his own way. We have Yubaba, the witch owner of the bathhouse, who seeks to enslave Chihiro by stripping everything from her, including her name. We have Kamaji and Lin, who work at the bathhouse. And we have No-Face. All these characters seem like they could easily be the focus of the movie, each of them having a very detailed and rich backstory, which we get to explore as the movie goes on, but it never feels like it's too much. The story lines support one another in a way I've almost never seen anywhere else. Miyazaki has woven it tight and whenever I see the film I find new or forgotten ways in which the events work together.<br/><br/>It's also a beautiful film. Out of all Studio Ghibli films, only Princess Mononoke can compete with it in terms of beauty, quality and grandeur of animation. The colours, the character designs, the small touches and details. All wonderful. The score by Joe Hisaishi is also fantastic. It's a bit more downplayed than say Mononoke, not containing quite so memorable tunes and themes, but it's still beautiful and supports the storytelling perfectly.<br/><br/>This is about as close to a perfect film as you can get. At least, for me. I think Doug Walker said it best in his review. It's a film so good that it makes you jealous. It's a story so good that you wanted to be the one to tell it. Well, that might be true for me as well, but I still enjoy the film above all else. I love it, I respect it and I'm going to see it regularly for the rest of my life."

","While watching this movie I was enjoying its pace when I realised that there wasn't much run time left. As the movie progressed so did the amount of action and plot points, it felt a little rushed as it got toward the end but then slowed back again to a good pace. Some may say that this is the point of a movie but yes this is just an opinion of mine. Also the original film was allegedly going to be 3 hours long so this may explain the inconsistent plot line pace. <br/><br/>I have been told that the subbed version enhances the characters personalities which is next on my list to see.

The story really is all about growing up and how alien it can be. Going through the same process myself, I can relate to the character very easily and I wanted her to be able to get through this whole thing alright.

"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","1","18 December 2015"," A fantastic fantasy journey
","""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" or ""Spirited Away"" is probably the most famous work (especially abroad) by Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki, also because he won an Academy Award for it and non-English-language films winning in the Best Animated Feature category is certainly not the rule, which makes it an even more exceptional achievement. The film is already almost 15 years old and runs for roughly 2 hours. A little girl enters a fantastic world with her parents, but their greed makes them transform into pigs right away, the parents only, not the girl. And after that, she gets deeper and deeper into that fantastic world, makes friends and foes, both of which are the most fascinating creatures, including witches, dragons and many other mythical figures.<br/><br/>One of the aspects I liked most about this film was that basically no character was either completely black or white. Even the evil witch loves the big baby and has to follow certain rules in her last scene for example. She has a good twin sister by the way, also an interesting inclusion. The animation is really good and memorable here and I personally believe this film is a great choice if you want to take a deeper look into Studio Ghibli movies, something that is considered the best animation film production studio these days together with the big famous American Pixar company. You can certainly see a lot of heart in their works and, hands down, it does not get much more creative than ""Spirited Away"".<br/><br/>All in all, this film never dragged and that is always a decent achievement for films that cross the 2-hour mark. It has some nice lessons on friendship, motherhood, dedication and many other important subjects, which is probably the main reason this film is loved so much and so high in the IMDb top250. There is a lot lot more than wonderful animation here. I cannot really comment on the voice acting as I, of course, watched this one with subtitles as I don't understand a word Japanese, but I think they are probably doing a solid job as they are all fairly experienced and I never heard that this could be the film's one weakness. I cannot come up with a weakness while watching this. The drama was never over-the-top or unrealistic and even if it was, it could have been somewhat justified with all the fantastic stuff going on. Excellent watch and one of the best animated films of the 2000s. Highly recommended."

The story and characters are out of this world- literally, creating an ideal world of the spirit realm is not common and Hayao Miyazaki's imagination was definitely inspiring.

","Last Friday I received a homework from my English teacher which is to write a review on a movie you like/dislike and send him the link of it, so I decided to write him a review on one of my all-time favorite animation movie that was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>Spirited away is a story about a young girl name Chihiro, who's moving to a new town in the countryside with her parents but somehow end up discovering a mysterious tunnel. Her parents was curious and choose to take a look on the other side of the tunnel, Chihiro although feeling a bit peculiar follow after her parents, afraid to be left alone. As they went through the other side they stumble upon a field of grass with some old buildings which resemble that of an old theme park. Chihiro's adventure begins. <br/><br/>It was one of the most well-made movie I've watch. I love how the director and writer, Hayao Miyazaki, portrayed the personalities of the characters. They were all so lively, so heartwarming and funny that I actually felt like they were real people and sympathize with them. I was especially attached to the two lead characters, Chihiro and Haku, for their interactions throughout the movie. The shocking part though, was that the hidden message of the movie is actually about prostitution and the corruption of children in Japan. I was quite surprise at first but later on I thought it was smart of him to actually come up with the idea of sending such a message through an animation which is open to all ages to view. Therefore, I respect him for his effort on making the world knows. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was enchanting, sort of dreadful in some part, dreamlike and full of lessons for the society and if I were to compare the movie to a similar one it would be Howl's moving castle which is also one of his work. Both stories are set in a world where magic is a normal thing and was targeting the same type of audience. Last but not least, I would totally recommend Spirited away for those who want to go on a ride into a mystical and magical world."

Then a few months ago, I happened to remember a film I watched as a child, I couldn't remember the name of it at all, I asked family, friends, until one person knew the film I was describing and asked if I watched Howl's Moving Castle (They recommended me the film), I said yes (I really enjoyed the film as well), they then told me that the film I was looking for is Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away, They didn't know the name in English as their primary language is Norwegian) and was Produced by Hayao Miyazaki along with Studio Ghibli (Who made Howl's Moving Castle). I was impressed at his knowledge and then looked to research a bit into Miyazaki/Ghibli films. This is a review..not a life story..sorry. SO anyway back to the review, After reliving an amazing childhood memory by re-watching this masterpiece, I noticed ""TheAnimeMan"" on you-tube had uploaded a video about this very film and I learned about the ""Lore"" of the film and what it is about, being shocked and having my childhood ruined in the space of 5 minutes is quite an experience. Did you know that Spirited Away is about prostitution? I think not, I did not know and did some research about the film and Miyazaki. One of the scenes that was pointed out, was at the beginning when Chiro's parents ""Pig out"" on the feast and turn into, well, their meal, represents greed and when Chiro tries to escape and fails, that represents abduction or something similar. When she begins to work in the bath house, thats representing the prostitution (Selling services for money which only the old crow gets, I really don't like her) . Then a bit later in the film, ""NoFace"" tries to 'buy' Sen (Chiro) for a mountain of gold, but she refuses since she has to work to save her parents from there greed...anyway, I gave this Anime Film a 10/10 because it is just amazing (Which is an understatement), many people agree it should of won more awards than it should of...I'm one of them many people."

","This is Studio Ghibli's best work by far. I've seen it multiple times in three different languages (Swedish, English and Japanese with subtitles) and the dubbing is perfect, which is strange since most movies dubbed from Japanese to Swedish are usually terrible. This is a movie I never get bored with. Will forever be entertaining to watch. Fits children as well as grown-ups, it also fits people who are used to animated movies and those who aren't. The amount of details within the movie always take my break away, especially when the animators depict the food. They truly went all out on this movie, and they got everything right. The only reason I wouldn't give this movie a 10 is because I only give my absolute favourite movies 10, but if I didn't have that as a rule - this would've gotten a clear 10, no doubt."
"Irishchatter","7","0","1","7 September 2015"," I actually like the film but it involved a lot of abuse!
","From the first time, I had watched this film and of course heard that it was brilliant, I honestly thought it was gonna be a pretty crappy film. It really put me off with hearing Chihiro whining and whinny over absolute nothing and pretty much trying to do my head in. I was never going to enjoy this film properly with her whining! I didn't like the other character Lin either, she was so bitchy that she should be one of the mean girls. She apologised but I would've said too late to show her how it feels! <br/><br/>At least she settled down more as the movie went on and of course there were a few funny scene's, especially when that dirty monster absolutely made everyone feel so sick by his stinking smell! Of course, two faced was odd but seemed very greedy like he ate the whole food just to grow bigger. I have never seen such a demon like spirit eat so much food ever in films before! <br/><br/>From what I looked in the film, I think kids over 12 should only look at this since there is a lotta name calling, blood and of course some scary scene's that appear throughout!"

","Everything about this film makes it really enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. Everything about it shines through but in a gentle sort of way. The film has some beautiful and loving characters the setting and the level of colour in this film just superb. Some might say that Hayao Miyazaki is better than Walt Disney. Miyazaki has a wonderful way of blending the characters together I really think he loves his hero's to well be heroines that is he likes female's to be the lead in his films. And I am all for supporting Women in Film. In this film Chihiro doesn't disappoint us. This is a beautiful little film, I really would advise anybody to check it out and give it a watch its truly wonderful."
"dan-maher18","Null","0","1","9 August 2015"," Miyazaki's Magical Masterpiece Is The Irrefutable Pinnacle Of Animation
","I have never experienced a film that had such a spectacular sense of imagination as Spirited Away. To my knowledge this picture is entirely original (although inspiration can be sourced to aspects of Japanese culture) and, for a picture as perfectly crafted as this, that has to be celebrated.<br/><br/>Spirited Away follows ten year-old Chihiro as she and her parents are moving to a new home. On the way they come across an abandoned amusement park and find themselves thrown into the spirit world. With her parents literally turned into pigs and trapped in a world she does not understand Chihiro must navigate a bathhouse of spirits, its devious owner Ubaba and the enigmatic no-face if she wishes to save her parents and return home.<br/><br/>The film can be analyzed endlessly but what makes it great can be boiled down to three key elements.<br/><br/>The first of which is the mythology that Miyazaki creates. Setting the film in a bathhouse not only helps visualize the unpleasantness of Chihiro's trials but also gives an interesting view of the creatures of the spirit world. They may be threatening outside but seeing them relaxing, eating and in their bathrobes creates a disarming view on them, giving them more of a personality. <br/><br/>In addition to this there are so many creative concepts in this movie that it would be impossible to list them all. A train that runs across an endless ocean, the half-spider boiler-man Kamaji, signing a contract means to sign away your name and eating too much will turn you into a massive pig (literally) – just to name a few. What makes the world feel so real is the lack of explanation. You never truly know why Ubaba and Zeneba are twin sisters in appearance and so different in personality or who the figures on the train are; Miyazaki knows that the exposition would ruin the pace of the story so gives the audience just enough explication and just enough implication to work. Suffice to say, he gets it perfect.<br/><br/>The second success is the atmosphere. As I have already said, the world is fascinating but it truly enters the world of mythology when the visual flair kicks in. The darkened entrance to the park sets the tone but it is when Chihiro runs to the edge of the park and sees the distant lights of a barge full of spirits that the film becomes something beautiful. The balance between genuinely frightening and comforting is maintained brilliantly but all gives way to an overwhelming sense of mysticism. The whole film feels like it is taking you on a series of emotions; from anxiety to fear to inspiration to awe to the perfect bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>I cannot even begin to describe the stunning design and animation, so I won't. All I will say is that it has been 14 years since Spirited Away came out and no film has managed to match its animations and designs.<br/><br/>The final and possibly most fundamental thing that this film does so well is the main character. Chihiro is a brilliant example of a child character. At first she is petulant, whining about moving, complaining about her flowers dying and clinging to her mother. Although this deliberately sets her up as a petulant child it is not graining – she is a child in a situation where children are unhappy. However, throughout her journey in the story, she grows into a mature adult. Not only is this done literally with her getting a job but in the symbolic bathhouse – hearkening to baptism and rebirth in water. What makes her so likable is her willingness and determination. Very rarely does she refuse work and is always willing to give over her rewards to her friends and even her enemies. She is a remarkably kind-hearted character and the traditional coming of age story is so well done that it feels as if you're watching it for the first time.<br/><br/>There is a scene in which Chihiro rides on a train for about two to three minutes that sums up the film brilliantly. It's stunningly beautiful, eerie, fascinating and almost mythical. Although you can analyze the implications of Chihiro riding a train as her becoming an adult, a sign of her confidence that she has gained throughout her journey. Perhaps it can be seen as a representation of the hollowness of adulthood and, inversely the joyous imagination of childhood.<br/><br/>There is an undeniable mysticism that compels us to watch and entices analysis of Spirited Away. However you see this film it is hard to deny Miyazaki this remarkable masterpiece."

","This movie was such a fun movie. I never knew that this movie would be so good. I wish everyone could watch it. The movie is about this little girl and she goes on this adventure and everywhere she goes she sees ghosts and they all want to help her. There's also this witch and the witch takes away the girls parents so the girl stays in the place and so she can find them again. I can't believe that her parents were turned into pigs. And the witch said that if she guessed which pig was her parent all the pigs would become humans and I really thought that she would never guess which pig was her parents since there was so much pigs, but she actually guessed right."
"pggirasole","10","0","1","27 June 2015"," When Chihiro becomes real
","Before writing this review I was reading some news from Japan about an antiwar demonstration organized by a 19 years-old girl in Sapporo, Hokkaido. The first thing that I realized was that a young female leading a political issue is an important achievement for a country still traditional and hierarchical as actually Japan is. The second thing I thought was Chihiro, the main character of ""Spirited Away"".<br/><br/>Miyazaki, in the already far 2001, at the begging of the Western crisis due to terrorism, before, and economic factor, later, depicted an adventure of a young girl in a imaginary as well symbolic world. The idea behind the movie, in fact, is the strive to survive of a female character in a world made of mostly masculine and adult hierarchy and tradition.But also consumerism and egocentric values. This struggle, however, will lead not to the defeat of this bad habits but to a peaceful harmony without nobody defected but everyone understood and accepted more. <br/><br/>If we think well, Chihiro starts her adventure when the parents eat too much to end transformed in pigs. They were punished both because they swallowed too much and both because they forget their little daughter warning them. In the same way the destiny of wanderer of many young people,today, starts because of negligence of their parents. Then we have the meeting with Kohaku, the little guy that at the ends we realized being the river in which little Chihiro fall while was younger. He was controlled by Yubaba, the witch that leads the magical bath in which Chihiro worked, but his name, which leaded to his salvation, were reminded to him by the simple heart of Chihiro. Miyazaki inverted the leading role of the male character giving to the girl the power to save the boy. In the modern Japan, seems to be suggested by the director, girls must be no more considered as the shadowed support of the man but the light that can help them while they feel lost with no hopes or directions. Another important element is the stinky guest of the bath completely cleaned by Chihiro showing so the unexpected determination of a young girl that, even if broke some rules, completed her task going beyond the general etiquette but making really satisfied the costumer. Who have said that a young girl cannot do what was achieved by old and experienced men? Miyazaki shows us the fragility of traditional code of manner as well the development a pure heart can bring to change a stable world. But, at the end, we cannot forget the figure of Faceless, the character most feared and loved, the one more easy to identify but more difficult to understand. It stands for the people, for the lost Japan of the after war without a line to follow, an ideal to fight for. He can makes money but will be lonely if not loved by a simple soul. As the one of Chihiro is.<br/><br/>Today Japan, as explained through the allegory of Faceless, is something with no stability, something that can makes money but also destroyed by the loneliness.Something neither bad neither good. Then, people work, as in the bath, in a fixed order when creativity of the others, in this case young people as well as women, risks to be killed by the ordinary routine and society tends to be hedonistic and egoistic forgetting the simplicity of the nature as well that of children. As the parents of Chihiro did.<br/><br/>However, one day a group of young guys, leaded by a young girl, organized a demo against the conservatory shift of Japanese government. And this day is today. And this revolution started in 2001 when Miyazaki trough Chihiro showed us an alternative society made on equality and peace. A new Japan. From a faceless to a warless one."

","First of all, I've gotta a lot to say about this film. This movie will change who you are, not just as a person, but as a individual. It will change your outlook of life, letting you know that every single spec on this earth has a purpose. Yeah, I think this film is in the same category as of Pixar films, well... Most of them. It will change your perspective on death. Maybe I'm being a bit confusing, let me explain. A 10 year old girl, is moving to a new town. The family comes a crossed an abandoned amusement park. The family to go and check out the place. By the way, the Pacing in this film is very well done. The family finally get in to the amusement park, and the plot begins. The Animation in this film is one of the best that I've see. The scene where the parents eat made me hungry. The girl goes looking around, and sees a human that is a human, because he a spirit. The spirit sends her off, and the girl finds out that her parents are now pigs. That's probably one of only scariest parts of the film. This is what the films perspective of death is, a ""misunderstood consequence"". Overall the film is amazing, and full of heart, the film my be done but the legacy is still going!"

","This movie is simply astonishing, the detail produced into the various buildings are helpful to what would be inside. If you think when they got out the car at the old mysterious building, you knew something big will happen in the story, and when Chihiro reached the bath house (like before in your head) that it was the main building.<br/><br/>However the story is genius, the amount of lessons this movie gave us was a lot, from greed to family, Ex: Chihiro's parents stuff themselves with the food of the spirits, Yubaba changes their attributes to those of a pig and places them neatly in with the other pigs.<br/><br/>Onto the soundtrack and firstly, this is the only reason I play keyboard now. Here is a piece torn from the Wikipedia ""The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.""

"kmk_k","9","0","1","17 May 2015"," this movie has a black story ?
","Well there's the 'urban legend' or theory behind Spirited Away. okay here is theory behind spirited away that i recently read.<br/><br/>Chihiro, who gets trapped in this mystical world inhabited by witches, spirits, monsters, etc. Her parents get turned into pigs after eating food they weren't supposed to so Chihiro works out a deal with the witch who transformed her parents to work in her oil- house. It's a very fun film to watch, and good artwork :b It won many awards so if you haven't watch it please do :) Well, over the years people have heard rumors and theories about Spirited Away, mostly dark theories, a Toshi Densetsu (都市伝説) an urban legend. Interesting nonetheless if you don't want this to change your opinion on this movie please do not read but if not, here it goes! I guess there is no point beating around the bush, so.. basically Spirited Away's story is basically said to be about prostitution. It's a children's movie, what? Yes, shocking. Like I stated earlier, little Chihiro starts working at an oil- house, or an Aburaya-ya (油屋). This oil-house is a portrayal of a old type bathhouse, or a Yuya (湯屋). Also, Chihiro is forced to work as a Yuna (湯女), this word is used in the Japanese version. Out of the many articles written for Spirited Away very few have touched on the naming. For those who don't know Japanese, the definition of a Yuna is ""women who assists bathers"" and ""bathhouse prostitutes"". Can't get more literal than that. These bathhouses were a big business in Edo Japan, or so I've read. And the patron of the bathhouses were all men, and the 'millions' of patrons that came to the oil-houses as well (they are all Otokogami, 男神, male deities). Fun Fact: After the movie's success the name Yuna became popular as a girl's name, but a lot of parents were running around trying to change their daughter's name after they found out what it really meant, lol. The oil-house Chihiro works for is run by the witch Yubaba. Chihiro is forced to adopt another same, ""Sen"", which comes from the first character of her name: Chihiro 千尋 and remove the second character and it reads Sen (千). It was common for prostitutes in the Edo period to work using a different name, something like a stripper name? Hahah.. So why did Miyazaki make a story about prostitution? Apparently the idea came from his producer, Suzuki Toshio. He gave Miyazaki an idea as: ""House about a story about a girl who can't even greet people properly working in a cabaret club? It would be like training to open her heart"" to which Miyazaki replied ""That's it!"" Later when interviewed why he chose the particular story, he replied, ""I think the Most appropriate way to symbolize the modern world is the sex industry. Hasn't Japanese society become like the sex industry?"" Never thought a children's film could have such provocative story line. Another theory behind the movie involves a kidnapping by North Korea and how the girl was being forced into a low-paying labor job, but there's not too much on this theory to give much credit to. But it's still interesting to know!"
"efrayn","7","0","1","15 May 2015"," Making a dream
","If we say ""a dream come true,"" would understand one trite slogan to say it's a lovely film, without giving turn many details. While ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" itself is lovely, what It is in the ""bizarre"" Eastern view mode. And it is in this sense that it's like having a dream and turn it into a movie. It's like getting up in the morning thinking ""what a strange dream I had, but it was interesting.""<br/><br/>That aura permeates the film, but most likely it was not the intention of the director, who explains with all the logic of the world, as the home of the world's illogical bathrooms works.<br/><br/>The whole film is summed up in an elaborate metaphor operation of the workplace: The bathhouse (the company) Yu-Baba (the boss), Zeniba (head relaxed when it has reached its home), Chihiro (an employee who loses his name to be considered another number) ... not make it any less interesting to watch. Although suffering the characteristic ""bottleneck"" as I call it, it seems that is in every one of his movies and that is a decline in vueleve narrative and slightly ""boring"" action for a moments. Because of this may be overlooked hobby as a director tanning as undisciplined, who writes the script on the fly, Instead of starting to produce when it is finished. Failure pretty reprehensible, but now seems to have become his hallmark.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the sum of all make a film of the mixture fascinatingly weird."

"Terol","8","0","1","19 April 2015"," Beautifully implemented fantasy adventure
","Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or Spirited Away in English, is animated fantasy adventure in the Alice in Wonderland fashion. The plot starts as a young girl, Chihiro, moves to a new town with her parents. Right away, after her father takes a wrong turn when trying to locate their new home, strange things start to happen. The pace of events leaves viewer genuinely wondering what is going on. Additionally, characters and settings are extremely inventive which further enhances the bizarre feeling. Drawing and animation are beautifully done. Music and sound effects are atmospheric.<br/><br/>However, much of the characters are left relatively superimposed. This of course leaves room for imagination but on the other hand, leaves quite a lot of open questions. The director Miyazaki has evidently admitted the hidden connotations of prostitution in the movie. However, it is not obvious.<br/><br/>The movie definitively deserves its place as one of the most loved Japanese animations done."

","There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.<br/><br/>This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."

","Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes – which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works – but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images – both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. <br/><br/>The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality."

","Spirited Away is nothing like anything else. It is a film about childhood, about growing older, about life. Chihiro is just like any kid her age, her world is small and her problems are much smaller. It is amazing to see Chihiro's change and become a more conscious person as she discovers that her world can be much bigger. it is absolutely recommended that any child, teenager or adult watch Spireted Away, so they can experience an adventure like no other. We learn to care about others together with Chihiro, we learn that our worries somethings mean nothing when we get to see the bigger picture. And of course, we learn that friendship plays an extremely important role on our lives."

","Whether or not you're a fan of anime, I guarantee you'll enjoy and love this movie.<br/><br/>It's a story of a young girl, who grows mentally into a young woman, filled with courage and kindness.<br/><br/>She travels with her parents to a new town, and on the way there, they find a shortcut, which leads them to a tunnel and an ""abandoned theme park"". This ""theme park"" is actually a gateway to the spirit world. Chihiro's (the protagonist) parents come across a deserted town, and while finding themselves starving, treat themselves to a huge sumptuous meal. As a result, they were turned into pigs.<br/><br/>Chihiro meets a boy named Haku (who's actually a spirit of a river), who helps her to get a job at the bathhouse which allows her to live there, whilst trying to find a way to save her parents.<br/><br/>One day, she meets a monster called No-Face. He's obsessed with Chihiro and tries to win her favour. He seems to reflect the personalities of spirits he's surrounded by, and that's the reason why he was so dangerous in the bathhouse as he was surrounded by greedy and not-so-good spirits. Later on he actually becomes a nice person, well I mean, a nice spirit who is no longer dangerous.<br/><br/>In the end, Chihiro finds a way to save her parents, and even helps her friend Haku escape from the clutches of Yubaba, the evil witch who runs the bathhouse.<br/><br/>This movie is simply amazing. The adjectives in the English dictionary, although vast, can by no means express the simplicity and awesomeness of this movie. This is truly one of the best anime films I've ever seen, and is loved by all, young and old.<br/><br/>All I can say is, watching this won't be a waste of your time."

As an adult now I still watch and love it and because of this film I have become a huge fan of Studio Ghibli creations and Hayao Miyazaki's work. The story line is amazing and you have a great mixture of characters. The art work in this is beautiful it's so bright, colorful and creative and the supernatural element to this is great. Chihiro is an adorable character I love how you see a young girl being thrown into a strange place as a helpless child and leaves feeling confident and brave.She faces all sorts of challenges and she succeeds in all of them. I love the dust mites in this they are very cute characters and I love that they get used in other Ghibli films.<br/><br/>This film has gone on to become part of my collection I would happily recommend this film to anyone who loves anime but it's hard to find someone within the anime community that hasn't seen this film."

","This is supposed to be my 2015 challenge but I'm starting it a little bit earlier. I have decided to watch the top 100 Must-see films of the 21st century along with some other movies I just keep postponing And so, as a writing exercise, also for the fun of thinking not just passively watching and of course for the sake of committing to the challenge , I will be posting a short review on each movie on the list.<br/><br/>The first movie on the list is<br/><br/>#100 Spirited away<br/><br/>So as I was waiting for the movie to buffer, thanks to my very slow internet connection that gives me plenty of time to finish my online reading list, I searched spirited away and studio Ghibli. To be frank, I didn't know much about Studio Ghibli, but apparently it's the most famous Japanese animation studio in the world, up there with Pixar and Disney. It's like you can never be disappointed with a Studio Ghibli movie, they all about quality and they never allow their movies to be cut, so it's a sure thing you will get the original story from any translated version. <br/><br/>Also, I didn't know much about spirited away, I was surprised to know that it's the only anime film to win an Oscar! Where was I when that happened?<br/><br/>The movie itself is quite magical and you get absorbed from the very first start, you get the same feeling you get when watching anime not an animated movie. I usually get bored with animated movies but never with anime and this one was quite pleasant to watch. Each one interpret spirited away in his own way, some say it's the journey from childhood to adulthood, some say it's a symbol for the fight between ego, body and mind (most interesting interpretation I have read) but the most interesting thing is to discover that there is a hidden metaphor for prostitution, children prostitution in particular intended in it. That's why I love this movie, there is more to it than meets the eye.<br/><br/>During the entire film I put myself in Sen's shoe and wondered what would be my reaction, I guess when you are an adult your decisions and reactions become more and more practical and less and less kind. Chihiro was always herself and took and asked only for what she needed and didn't over think any decision she took. I found that the greatness of this movie lies in the ability of the writer to look and feel the world from the eyes of a child, which is pretty hard to master. I think it's essential we look at the world from the eyes of a child every now and then, there lies creativity and kindness and a world that's still full of places to discover.<br/><br/>Favorite quote; ""Zeniba: Once you do something, you never forget. Even if you can't remember.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth watching and re-watching."

","I actually received this movie from my dad because he found it on sale. He knew how much I enjoyed Howl's Moving Castle and thought this was that movie. When he gave it to me I was reluctant to watch it but when I did, I was hooked! I love the story. People can find metaphors and relate their own life to Chihiro's story or other characters in the story.. People moving to new homes, countries, schools, childhood to adulthood, new jobs, pretty much anyone can relate. Change is scary. But this movie shows a small, unsure of herself girl who goes through scary and interesting tasks to find herself and her confidence. The art is amazing. The music is beautiful. It is a movie for any age. I am so glad my dad accidentally bought me this DVD :D"
"JaydoDre","8","0","1","22 December 2014"," Captivating and pretty
","Spirited Away was the strangest acid trip I ever had.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is the master of the gorgeous and lively animation with a kooky side and Spirited Away is arguably his magnum opus. As such it is also the kookiest.<br/><br/>The story is a little hard to describe. The basic premise is that a girl gets stuck in the spirit world, but the larger part of the rest of the story can be described as ""random stuff happens"". Or sometimes the problem is that for a while not much happens while the mood or tension is being set. This is not necessarily a problem. The story is an experience of exploration and discovery of the world and of the girl's character and that experience is really good.<br/><br/>Also, I may be reading more into this film than there is but there seems to be something more in Spirited Away besides the events at hand. Certain images and characters appear to comment on or be inspired by real life, perhaps specifically of contemporary Japan. There is a ghost character that eventually starts talking with an old person's voice and really wants to be with the little girl, gets offensive and invasive but then explains that he is just really lonely....I don't know.<br/><br/>As the movie was drawing to a close, though, the story started getting wrapped up rather unnaturally. It felt sappy, which is fine for the kids but may be a bit harder to swallow for adults.<br/><br/>There are also some issues with the characters. They are interesting but their behavior changes suddenly, as well as the attitude of other characters towards them. This is possible to attribute to the fact that the characters are spirits, but they behave consistently otherwise so the occasional sudden shift is weird.<br/><br/>Visually...well, visually is what this anime is all about. Miyazaki's style of drawing is a matter of taste, but it can be argued that it is not particular sexy or detailed. The eyes are round, the mouths are simple. However the movement and the colors are great. The animation is very lively. Miyazaki achieves this in part by adding little details, little extra movements that are not necessary but add realism, like someone stumbling briefly. Effort is made to animate the main character's movements that show fear and hesitation, which again gives more life.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is every trippy beautiful experience that requires some patience on the part of the viewer, since actual plot points are somewhat vague, few and far between."

","Not even 5 minutes after the movie started, the main character finds herself already among creepy spirits and scary parents-turned-into-pigs. From that on, you can't stop watching. You can't help but feel amazed at the characters' look, the witch with the gigantic head and even bigger nose, the creepy No-Face that can only moan and IS ALWAYS SO DISTURBING, the disgusting river spirit that is so well portrayed as if it smelled really bad that it is almost as if you could actually smell it.<br/><br/>The more you are into the movie, the more hooked up you are. The plot is not the easiest to follow, and some scenes are more for the sake of exposing amazing visual effects than for the development of the plot, which sometimes seems like a thin layer of ice that can break at any moment. Even taking this into account, this movie deserves an almost perfect score: it is so beautiful it gives you goosebumps, for real."

","This was the film that introduced a whole lot of Americans, including myself to Miyazaki. While it isn't my favorite anymore, it's still one of his absolute best. The English VA is also pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The film starts with a whiny girl named Chihiru. As with many of his other films, the girl develops through magic and choreography. The visuals are stupendous with creatures of various sizes, colors, and shapes. No-face is probably the oddest character in the movie, and the one that could potentially give kids nightmares. I'd recommend this movie for 10 and up because of that guy alone.<br/><br/>My single complaint for the film is that the scene in Swamp Bottom is just a bit too happy for it's own good. It somewhat removes the watcher from the experience of the film and makes it a bit to sappy.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this film is well paced and well balanced.

","This was the first Miyazaki film I ever saw. I'll never forget the day my father brought it home from Blockbuster and was like ""Hey, I found this really high-rated animated film all the way from Japan""! The first time I watched it, I got sick to my stomach however, and there was a flu bug going around our house so it didn't sit well with me at first. The more times I watched it over the years however, the more it began to grow on me. It opened my eyes to another culture I'd never seen. The myths, the higher violence threshold Japanese people must have (this movie was written for young girls!) and the values were all very different to me. Miyazaki himself said that this film wasn't about growth as much as it is about finding what is already inherently in you. There are many symbols, some obvious ones about nature's importance, but also some more discrete ones about friendship and understanding others. This movie is very complex and something you could contemplate on and relive in your memory. I haven't even gotten to the voice actors and soundtrack, but needless to say, they're done very well! On the English dub, just to name a few, the main character is voiced by the same voice actor who voices Lilo (from Disney's Lilo and Stitch) and another character is voiced by the same actor who voices Mai (from Yu-Gi-Oh). Deep, emotional piano sweeps like ocean waves throughout the film, highlighting some of the characters' most deepest emotions. Miyazaki has created a very real dimension here. You're missing out if you never plan on watching it."

","A young girl is drawn into a transparent world populated by gods, spirits, monsters and fantasies, where she struggles to understand the ground rules amidst the bustle of a busy bath house. This setting - unmistakably Japanese - provides endless amounts of nourishment as a massive showpiece of imagination, attention to detail, fancy, delight and cultural lore. There's more going on in the backdrops of Spirited Away's throwaway scenes than many of its contemporaries can manage to plaster up-front and center. It's a bit less focused than Princess Mononoke, which preceded it in the Miyazaki timeline, but that's because it's such a decidedly different, strange creature altogether. Here we're taking the time to embrace and celebrate the inherent weirdness of Studio Ghibli's world, where I could happily sniff daisies and people-watch for the rest of my days. The primary storyline is steadfastly unpredictable, twisting and writhing like a wild beast caught on a leash, but is able to, with time, pluck most every last plot thread and leave us all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Ambitious, fiery, awe-inspiring and diverse, it's worth repeated viewings amidst audiences of all ages."

","My little sister convinced me to watch this; I'm a big fan of the books The Cat Returns and No Place For Eco-Sinners, she told me this movie was extremely similar.<br/><br/>A young girl, looking maybe 11 or 12, is sullen and angry at her mom and dad for moving her out to what appears to be a rural Japanese community. She is nervous of her new school and won't admit it. While driving, her mom and dad take a wrong turn and end up in the woods, finding a creepy and mysterious tunnel. They get out to explore, and not wanting to stay alone in the woods, Chihiro (the girl) follows along.<br/><br/>The family comes across a bizarre abandoned village and find a diner. The parents begin eating the food and get addicted, but Chihiro, disgusted by them and wanting to leave, wanders off to explore. She finds a bath house, and bumps into a strange boy who yells at her to leave. She tries, but by then a strange force has separated the village from the rest of the earth and her parents have somehow become pigs, leaving her to fend for herself. The strange boy turns out to be very caring towards her; his name is Haku and he shows her how to get a job at the bath house, which is run by a magical but greedy old lady and filled with the spirits of everyday objects. Chihiro has her name taken from her and becomes 'Sen', making friends with another worker there named Lin. She has no idea but a strange spirit called No-Face is following her around.<br/><br/>As days go by Sen gets used to the new world, even starts to like it. But one day she sees Haku being hunted down by an evil witch, and when he's injured and bleeding to death Chihiro has to undo the dark deal he has signed up for, while rescuing her parents at the same time.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is an amazing and spectacular adventure with lovely soundtrack and unforgettable characters. I've viewed both the Japanese version and the English dubbed version, both are pretty decent as far as voice acting. For the English one Jason Marsden (Dash-X from Eerie Indiana), voiced Haku. Lin's English voice actress was very good too, as was the greedy with Yobaba's.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes; if you don't know the religious and spiritual views and stories behind the movie it can be difficult to grip what is going on at times.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a great animated film, almost as good as Akira (1988). I think it's a beautiful adventure for all ages, although there is mild violence. And no, nothing dies in the movie, Chihiro gets home, rescues her mom and dad, helps Haku and leaves the spirit world. It's totally worth watching, a story of friendship, loss and reuniting."

","You need to know that Hayao Miyazaki's magical adventure is widely considered an animated masterpiece, but it can be a creepy and frightening experience for younger viewers. There are dozens of freaky looking creatures that threaten each other or the protagonist, who is trying to save her parents. Many, many scenes involve these strange beings, and younger children used to more sanitized characters may find them disturbing. One particularly scary scene involves a beloved character in the shape of a dragon who returns from a journey injured, bloody, and on the verge of death. One character smokes and in a dinner scene someone is offered sake.

This one movie that frightened me most as a child now warms my heart as a young adult. Sure, you may need some familiarity with Japanese culture to not be frightened yourself when you first watch it, but the more you do, the more attached you grow to it, especially considering how relevant its messages of environmentalism, complicated morality, and the power of love remain to this day.

","I have seen very few films this year, and I mean very few. Not even a dozen films in four months. Three little children can do that to you, although I've been reading a lot, too. Since I try to write reviews only on films I've recently seen, and the few films I have seen haven't been up to much, this film was the one I turned to.<br/><br/>I had glowing memories of this. Not only of its magic, both in the story and in the whole ambiance of the thing, but also its remarkable penetration of childhood imagination. Many powerful images remained in my mind, regardless that I hadn't seen the film since perhaps 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Well, this is every bit as good as I remembered, perhaps even better. It's Alice in Wonderland, an animated fantasy version of ""Bakumatsu taiyôden"" (1957). The apparently deserted spirit town more than reminds of ""Yôjinbô"" (1961). There's the sense of a growing up story, of letting go of the past, and finding love, and friendship, and how people who consider them insignificant, can do great things and not be rewarded for them. Let's not forget Miyazaki's own ""Tonari no Totoro"" (1988), either, which, at its core, is largely about the same thing.<br/><br/>I like to see this both as real and a dream, where the dream extends itself to reality because Sen, or Chihiro, carries it over with her much like the little paper-spy sent by Yubaba. <br/><br/>One last thing that captured my imagination. This is, in cinematic terms, an astounding celebration of the possibilities of animated colour, although ""Hauru no ugoku shiro"" (2004) might go even further. Another delicious aspect is the beauty of the water. It's as if the colours themselves were characters, either humans or spirits giving life to the image, or, in the idiom of the film, giving the images their names and identity. It's the evil twin, the enemy of imagination, that takes them away. What is that enemy of imagination, if not to forget what it was to be a child?"

","A marvel of originality, a standard of cinematic vision & a stunning work of art, Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away presents the master storyteller revelling at the prime of his filmmaking career by blending together all the ingredients of his previous works into one mystically magical adventure that'll have its viewers intrigued, transfixed & transported to a whole new different world from start to finish.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a coming-of-age drama, adventure, comedy, romance & fantasy, all merged into one, and concerns Chihiro; a 10-year old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood with her parents, gets stuck in the world of gods, witches & monsters. After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes up a job at the witch's bathhouse in order to free herself & her parents from the magic spell and return to the human world.<br/><br/>After setting an animation benchmark with his remarkable epic i.e. Princess Mononoke, writer-director Hayao Miyazaki comes out of his self-imposed retirement to set another standard & delivers the most artistic work of his glorious career. The film is abundant with his trademarks, recurrent themes, allegories & fascinating characters yet it retains the innocence & childlike sense of wonder to eventually deliver a truly spellbinding experience.<br/><br/>There isn't a single scene in the film that doesn't display the wonderful craftsmanship of the people working at Studio Ghibli, the themes of environmental pollution, greed & the passage to adulthood is carefully portrayed plus the 2D animation is simply astonishing. The plot is nicely structured & finely paced while the characters make the drama more compelling & are cleverly fleshed-out in the script. And Joe Hisaishi's score adds even more richness to an already amazing story.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of bold, creative & fearless imagination that takes its genre to a whole new level and despite its complexity, it can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. Many hail this anime as Miyazaki's magnum opus & even though I don't share the same view, I can see why it's called so. One of Miyazaki's most ambitious features, one of Studio Ghibli's greatest accomplishments & one of world cinema's highly treasured gems, Spirited Away will take your breath away.

","This was one of the very first Miyazaki films I had ever seen, and I was blown away by it. It shows everything that is perfect about this type of film. It has action and adventure, but it's also not overly complicated. Miyazaki creates a film that illustrates the true meaning of friendship and knowing oneself. The characters are well developed as is the storyline, and I believe that it's definitely a movie to be watched by child and adult, alike. <br/><br/>It's a great fantastical story of a young girl, Chihiro who moves with her parents to a new city. While on their way, they take a detour that leads them to an ancient area. Through twists and turns, she is thrown into a world very much unlike her own. She finds friendship in a few unlikely people and learns the value of hard work."

Soon, Chihiro is ends up in a world of magic, evil witches and strange creatures. Spirited away keeps you gripped from the very beginning. It is one of Miyazaki's many masterpieces and a movie that you will be able to watch several times. Also, this movie is not just for children, I'm sure that adults will love it too."
"Angels_Review","10","0","1","5 April 2014"," A wonderful masterpiece
","This show is very beautiful in both its art style and its story. I love Miyazaki's work and this was one of the very first I watched. The storyline feels as though it is a tale of growing up, facing your fears and learning how to take care of yourself. We start out with a girl sheltered by her parents slightly who doesn't want to move. She's grumpy, thinking that no one cares about her own feelings about the move and has some fears about going to a new place. Because of her father's stupidity (in a sense), they end up at an old abandoned gate in the middle of nowhere and go on in. Turns out this place is a gateway to the spiritual world and the family is swept away into a rather enchanting world where only Chihiro will remember. She is separated from her parents, forced to work in a bathhouse and learn what her own strength is. <br/><br/>In one of the reviewer's videos that I watch sometimes, JesuOtaku brought up the idea of the value of ones name. It is shown in many anime like xxxHOLiC and most importantly here. Chihiro's name is pretty much taken from her and she tries hard to remember it as the story goes on. There is a belief that your name is what makes you and weather you believe it or not, it's a belief I have. My real name is different then my name online and if anyone knew me in the real world, I am a little different then I am online. It is the thought that people do not know who exactly you are and as Chihiro seems to find out, she is a different person as Sen. She is a bathhouse attendant as Sen instead of the child Chihiro. When she becomes Chihiro again, she never really stops being Sen, showing the strength that she gained from her other side. It's a little heard to understand but I believe that we all have different personalities, though it depends on who we are around. When we are with friends, we are much different then when we are with family. When we are with older people like grandparent age, we are different then when we are with children. If you look at it this way, Sen was someone already within Chihiro. It just needed different people to show that it was there.<br/><br/>The artwork is astounding and you can really feel the love and attention that was given to this show. Even the detail of Chihiro putting her shoe on is done down to the small taps to make sure it's on well enough. When people say how beautiful this movie is, they don't exaggerate. I actually couldn't find any problems with it in consistencies or loops. It is what it is and its nothing more or less then what you would expect in a well made film. The character designs feel like they are out of a Japanese picture of demons but scaled back slightly for the children as none of the monsters have blood dripping from their fangs or wanting to kill anyone. <br/><br/>The voices are wonderful except for Chihiro, she just sounds a bit too whiny even when she grows up a little. She yells a lot and it pretty much throws me off when she is supposed to be gentler and thought full. I actually love how Haku sounds pretty young and gentle instead of harsh. Again, all the voices are the dubbed version since I have not seen the sub but they were still exceptional."
"Fahrenheit2710","10","0","1","26 March 2014"," Another animated poem.
","I watched this movie three or four times since 2001, when I was still a little kid. Back then, the only thing I could think of while watching it was: ""this is beautiful"". Even this evening as a teen girl I am now, the only thing I could think of was the same. Yes, the feelings and the details you are able to notice and remember increase as the years pass. Back then, I didn't pay too much attention to how rich is actually every single frame in this movie: if you stop during any moment inside the bathhouse, you will be able to notice that every single corner on the screen is actually filled with something. I'm talking about an incredible amount of different items that have a terminated location in every room and a whole lot of incredible creatures who (yes, why not?) are always busy doing something. If you think about it for a moment, you realize and understand how different Miyazaki's movies are from any other animated movie from any other studio. What every single character does just looks natural and spontaneous. If they don't say a single word in a scene, they won't just stand in the background, frozen in a static position just because they don't verbally take action. They are part of that world, they live their lives there, eat, walk around, quarrel, screw up, and you get naturally conscious of this fact while watching Spirited Away and any other Ghibli work. When you watch this kind of movie, you walk, cry and get anxious with the characters. You and your feelings and your thoughts participate, and you inevitably get kidnapped by its beauty. I am not writing this to spoil the plot that much. It's about an overage Japanese family who moves to a little town among green hills covered in green. The parents patiently deal with their stubborn 10-year-old daughter who restlessly recalls how she liked the place where they lived before and the friends she left. Then they get lost and find a strange passage among the trees. Obviously, they want to take a look and see what's on the other side, and when they get there an incredible adventure begins. The little lead character, Chihiro, will deal with spirits of every sort that want to take a good and restoring bath at the bathhouse lead by the creepiest, yet somehow amusing-looking witch you've ever seen. Chihiro is quite a though kid and she won't change a bit of her attitude through the whole movie, but this won't stop her from showing us the way she reacts with love, friendship, the unknown. And what's truly beautiful, is how delicately and genuinely all of this happens. You're going to be captured by the incredible sceneries this masterpiece contains, by its gentle and caressing soundtrack, by the bizarre creatures that populate the place and you will learn with simplicity that ""Once you've met someone, you never really forget them"". It's up to you in what situation you feel like applying this concept, if when trying to remember someone that is gone forever, someone you spoke with waiting at the bus stop. Your first love. Who you really are."

","This is my favorite movie EVER. I first saw it when my mom bought it for me in 2001/2002. Then, we lost it somehow and it took me years to figure out what it was. When I finally did, I bought it for like, $27. Anyway, this movie has everything: romance, scary-looking creatures/spirits, a man who is part spider. Here's my own personal synopsis: Chihiro has just moved to a new town with her family, but they stop because they hit a dead end. There is an old train tunnel and they decide to look around. On the other side of the tunnel is an old town. There is food out, but no one around, so her parents decide to eat the food. They turn into pigs and Chihiro meets Haku, who tells her she has to leave. She doesn't leave on time and has to stay and go against Yubaba, to save her parents. She also saves Haku by helping him remember who he was before he got to that world.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie and like it, I suggest watching some of Hayao Miyazaki's other films. He is the best. Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke are two of my other favorite's by Miyazaki."

","Who hasn't heard about Spirited Away? It's commonly referred to as one of the best animated films ever, if not the best ever. Well, I expected a more formulaic film regardless and what I got here is like a series of really fantastic, wonderfully unique, colorful segments. The animation is beautiful but so is the screenplay, so vividly written with very memorable characters. It's definitely like My Neighbor Totoro in that respect. The dialogue is charming and sort of dark, as is the film, but there's many moments of subtle humor that never relies on too much gags or easy comedy. I really loved this and the hype was warranted, it just too me too long."
"jwv-823-79715","8","0","2","6 January 2014"," Successful before a dual audience
","For starters, and because the movie is originally Japanese, I have to speak of my admiration for the work of the voice acting department who did a great job in translating the movie for English audiences. I applaud in particular the work of Daveigh Chase who lends her voice to Sin, and performs very convincingly.<br/><br/>The animations in Spirited Away are probably the best I have ever seen. They are simple yet beautiful, and the creators have a real knack for detail. They succeed in making Sin feel very believable and lifelike in her actions as a teen girl.<br/><br/>The world Spirited Away presents is weird, and even after sitting through the whole movie, more questions will remain a mystery than answered. Although this can be seen as a deficiency, I see it as a pro. The world is so magically beautiful and unknown that, having answered no questions, it will stick in your head a long time after watching - keeping you wondering.<br/><br/>The story doesn't amount as much to the magnificence of this movie as the animations and fantastical world do, and is a mere classical child narrative. The protagonist heroine gets in trouble because of a mistake, is brought into a prickly situation by an evil character, but the resilience of the good-natured heroine - and some good-natured helpers - win out over evil. The story is not bad, considering Spirited Away has a child audience, and even add enough nuance in its characters to make them more interesting than black-and-white stereotypes.<br/><br/>The use of the theme of love and it's effect on the story is cliché here and will not surprise anyone in any way, but is not mellow and its subtle enough to be enjoyed by an older audience.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a top-notch movie for children and can equally be enjoyed by an older audience. It successfully connects with a dual audience and should be applauded for that."

","Spirited Away was a breath taking adventure that was magical to watch. I recommend this to any one who is looking for a heart warming story or enjoys Hayao Miyazaki's films. The art style was beautiful making it a masterpiece. This is one of my favorite movies so I am hyping it up but no doubt it has good writing and great character development that is enjoyable to watch. I do admit the main character could get on my nerves but she is relate-able. Also the score was one of the aesthetics of this film that truly made it stand out. The story itself is original or at least something I had not seen before so it's interesting, keeping you're attention the whole time. The only downfall to spirited away is it target audience is not for everyone. I watched it as a kid and still enjoy it as a young adult but my father who is much older doesn't get it. I don't think it would be well received by people who don't know of Hayao Miyazaki's past film, but if you are interested it is a good movie to start with for Miyazaki's films. Spirited Away is something that can be watched time and time again and never gets old, definitely a film worth noting and good to add to a watch list."
"arisalove99","10","0","1","23 December 2013"," The best movie I've ever seen
","The most famous Japanese animation fantasy film ""Spirited away"" was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. This film overtook Titanic which is the top grossing film worldwide in the Japanese box office to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history. It won many prizes such as the Academy Award for Best Animation Feature. This film defeated formidable enemies such as Disney film, and won the Academy Award for the first time. This movie is the most wonderful and greatest animation movie I've ever seen. I fell in love with it when I saw it at first and I do not get tired of looking at and the more I watch, the more I will see, and the more interesting it will become.<br/><br/>The heroine Chihiro who is 10 years old and her parents lost their way to the new house and find a weird tunnel which leads them to the wonderful world. The heroine and her parents setting are modern people and their behavior tells us about nowadays people's behavior. This wonderful world setting is a wooden building hot spring with amazing world view and I was attracted by this amazing world view and spiritual fantasy story. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff inside of this wonderland, they decide to eat and pay later. However, this food is offer to god, therefore human must not to eat. Chihiro's parents make a big mistake and they turned into pig by the witch. Chihiro separated from her parents and started to work at the hot spring which is controlled by a witch, because human can't live in this wonderland if they don't have a job. She meets a mysterious boy named Haku, who promises to help her to return to their world . The witch steals employees names which means you lose yourself and she gave them a new name to control them with her magic. Chihiro's behavior is like a spoiled child at the first, but she grows up through her strange experience and this is the main point of this story. This film also tell the audience many things, for example saying ""Thank you"" to people who have helped you.<br/><br/>There are many characters who appear with a unique personality in this film. I was fascinated with their facial expression, movement and feeling. The most mysterious character I think in this mysterious world that human, witch, wizard, monster, Buddha and God spending together is No-Face. Some people feel unpleasant because of it weird form and action. However, in my opinion, No-Face is an important character who is a contrast with Chihiro. In contrast to Chihiro who has a purpose and knows what she should do to accomplish it, No-Face doesn't have a sense of self and place to stay and just wandered aimlessly. No face means to not have facial expression and words to communicate with somebody. There are some people who are on the way to success that have a job and friends to help them. However, there are also some people who are embarrassed at their life and feel fear and anxiety. If Chihiro is a heroine, in my opinion, No-Face is a dark hero.<br/><br/>Moreover, this animation film should be proud of the brilliant picture which portrays the characters dainty movement and emotion. The scene of the opening of the mouth of the dragon by force was so realistic and I was very impressed. Not only the characters but also the scenery is beautiful. The changing scenery outside the train is fabulous and it follows Japanese history towards modern era. The picture of the background is worthy of attention.<br/><br/>Portraying the reality in the fantasy and having a strong message related in the story is the feature of Hayao Miyazaki films. Among his film, ""Spirited away"" especially has a strong message that he want to tell to audience. Furthermore, it has a lot of ambiguous expression therefore interpretation is different to each person. However, it is too unclear to understand what he want to tell us. Children can enjoy watching this movie as a wonderful world and adventure story and adults can also enjoy it thinking about the story deeply."

So recently, While looking through the DVDs at the local thrift shop, I came across ""Spirited away"" and remembered reading about it when I was 12 when it was released over here in North America. I didn't think much of it then. But being that it was a studio Ghibli film and I had developed a love of anime since the 2000's, I spent the 3$ to buy and see this film. Little did I know I had picked up a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Spirited away is about 10 year old Chihiro, a somewhat spoilt brat who is forced to move away from her home to a new home for an unknown reason. Just as her family arrives in the new town, they go off-track and find themselves in a mysterious world after going through a tunnel. At first Chihiro's father thinks it's an abandoned theme park from the 90s, and he and Chihiro's mother find a restaurant and begin eating voraciously, much to Chihiro's dismay, because it's not long after when her parents turn into pigs, Forcing Chihiro to fend for herself. What leads is an adventure in which Chihiro must grow strong in herself and learn how to cope in a strange world.<br/><br/>To say it bluntly, Your life is incomplete until you've sat down and seen this masterpiece of anime. Even John Lasseter, the man behind the toy story movies even says at the beginning of the DVD - ""You are lucky. you get to see spirited away."" 10/10, This should be required viewing of generations to come."

","Rarely do children's films trump Disney but Hayao Miyazaki proves himself to be a master storyteller.<br/><br/>This story is about the immature ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino. She and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father takes a wrong turn. They unknowingly enter a magical world that Chihiro's father insists on exploring. While Chihiro's parents eat at an empty restaurant stall, Chihiro explores around and eventually finds an exquisite bathhouse. She meets a young boy, Haku, who warns her to return across the river before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have turned into pigs for eating food that is not theirs and she is unable to cross the flooded river, becoming trapped in the spirit world. She must survive and escape Yubaba, the owner of the bathhouse. Along the way she learns and grows, becoming a better person, by working hard and meeting new friends.<br/><br/>The animation is fluid and beautiful and the storyline moves at a good pace and leaves you satisfied.<br/><br/>The film does have some blood in it (a dragon suffers severe internal bleeding) but it shouldn't be disturbing to most young viewers.<br/><br/>This film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and definitely should not be missed.

","'Spirited Away' was a mere random movie I rented on a whim sometime during my days in middle school and the experience of watching it during that period of my life makes this one of my most sentimental films in which I dearly hold in my heart. Not knowing what to expect, my only assumption was that this looked like it could be a good movie, since I was getting a bit into anime/manga and anything that was a cartoon appealed to me more at the time, but what I got was something more. What I took away from this was an strange epic fairytale like no other. With so much memorable imagery, coupled with an atmosphere of mystery, this is one of those stories that manage to stick with you.<br/><br/>While my youth offered more of a sense of alienation than friendship at the time, it felt like this movie was there for me. Things have gotten a bit better externally, but if I were to talk about the highlights of my youth, it would definitely be times like this in which I made random discoveries where I was able to find unexpected comfort during those times where it felt hard for me in a world that wasn't exactly as bad as the real world I didn't even know of, until now. I will always hold this film dear in my heart, but this is definitely a film I look forward to revisiting again.<br/><br/>With its dreamy feel, the film holds so much surreal beauty while retaining all of its pure emotion. 'Spirited Away' to me feels like a milestone in the genre of animated films. What 'Spirited Away' proved is that you can convey so much through animation just as much as a live action film, and I would dare say it has gone places not a lot of live action films have even treaded on. The film immersed me into its animated world like no other animated film. 'Spirited Away' is not only a great anime film, but one of the greatest films in general."

I don't speak Japanese so maybe the subtitles I got were inaccurate or too literal that only a Japanese speaker would comprehend the real meaning behind what was said. Most of my confusion stemmed from the high ratings it received, which I looked up beforehand. So I just had to look up the themes involved in the film and now it all makes sense. I enjoyed the film despite the confusion, and I'm sure after giving it another go, maybe with English audio this time, I'll enjoy it even more. <br/><br/>After more thought, maybe I'm not cut out to watch movies with themes that aren't blatantly fed to me through the dialogue and that I should stick to movies similar to The Hangover."
"ChristianUnchained","10","0","1","23 April 2013"," One of the best animated films of all time
","Seeing Spirited away for the 12th time (rough estimate), I decided that it is time I write a review for this anime masterpiece. <br/><br/>Getting mildly nostalgic, I remember when I first found Spirited Away at Walmart in the Summer of 2003. My dad had read the paper earlier that day, and discovered a little film called Spirited Away, which came highly recommended from the Washington Post (along with winning an academy award for best animated feature that year). I was instantly eager to watch it, and we took a midnight Walmart run pick up this gem. My dad and I watched the film that very same night, and we knew we had been missing out on some of the most legendary animated films of this generation. But enough about the past...<br/><br/>Spirited Away is an absolute treat. If you have never seen this film, stop reading and watch it now. Spirited Away is a one of kind trip into another world that not only presents itself in a unique manner, but is also shown in a beautiful way: through the eyes of the legendary anime film director and artist Hayao Miyazaki. It is a tour de force of an animated film. <br/><br/>First off, let me say this: they don't animate films like this anymore. Not just animation, but the art itself. Every scene in Spirited Away is a piece of art in itself; Spirited Away is not only a hand drawn film, but it is also a moving work of art. I still get chills from some of the beautiful landscapes that are shown in the film. I want to frame and hang them up. The animation is not only beautiful, but also vastly beyond the imagination capacity of any other anime film I've seen. (More notables such as Metropolis and Howl's Moving Castle have come close).<br/><br/>The imagination of Hayao Miyazaki, unlike any other director, is innocent yet brilliant all at the same time. We see creatures for split seconds in Spirited Away that Miyazaki-san created in his mind. No short sticking was done here; everything, from the creatures and spirits of the bathhouse to the hand drawn world itself is magically and wonderfully crafted with so much heart. <br/><br/>Another notable quality of Spirited Away, like all other anime films directed under Studio Ghibli, is Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score. Accompanying nearly the entire film, Joe's score is fantastic from top to bottom. From the spine chilling rolled piano chords at the beginning to the wonderful and sweeping melodies that accompany the wonderful finale, the soundtrack to Spirited Away is one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>The wonderful creativity of the world transcends into the story itself: a simple and nostalgic tale, yet well told story of trials, growing up, and personal strength. While it may come across as simply silly to most American audiences, this is definitely one of the better, if not best, character driven stories in the anime universe. <br/><br/>If anything has caught your attention here that hasn't before, then hop to it. Spirited Away is a masterpiece, and out of all the 5 star reviews I've given, this is one score that stands the test of both multiple views and the test of time itself. This movie is watchable by anyone, despite your knowledge in Japanese Anime. It's the best of the best; start here and you'll only be seeing anime thats running for second. <br/><br/>But for those looking for simple tales, big filmmaking, and un-cultured romps through big action set pieces, skip this. Sadly, some are too uncultured to understand the brilliance and craftsmanship of an anime film of this proportion, and will disregard Spirited Away as a bizarre, strange, and dumb test of patience. If you think you're too old, too hip, too American, or too late to the party to see Spirited Away, then you're already too far gone. Get over yourself; shut up and watch it. <br/><br/>But for those who are about to see Spirited Away for the first time, I envy you. Spirited Away is like a steroid shot to the imagination, never failing, even after seeing it more than a dozen times, to reinvigorate the imagination of any viewer, no matter the age. The first time you see this wonderful film is a time I hope you'll forever remember and never forget. <br/><br/>Spirited Away achieves Masterpiece Status: 5/5 stars"

","Spirited Away is one of the most famous Japanese animes in the Western world. It became the first anime to be nominated for and to win an Oscar in 2003 for Best Animated Feature. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, had considered retiring from directing after finishing Princess Mononoke in 1997, but was fortunately inspired to make this movie after meeting a friend's daughter.<br/><br/>Chihiro (voice: Rumi Hiiragi) and her parents are driving to their new home when they take a wrong turn and end up in front of a tunnel in the middle of a forest. They decide to go in, and on the other side they find a street with lots of closed restaurants - apart from one, which is deserted but filled with food. Chihiro's parents start eating while she wanders around and finds a boy, Haku (voice: Miyu Irino), on a bridge in front of a bathhouse. He tells her to leave, so Chihiro goes back to her parents, and finds that they have turned into pigs. Dark spirits start appearing, and she tries to run back to where she came from, but can't because a great river blocks her way. Haku finds her and urges her to go ask Kamaji (voice: Bunta Sugawara), the boiler man, for a job, or else Yubaba (voice: Mari Natsuki), the witch that rules the bathhouse, will turn her into a pig too. Claiming he has all the help he needs, Kamaji sends Chihiro to Yubaba. Yubaba, reluctantly, decides to keep Chihiro as a worker in the bathhouse (whose guests are gods) and deprives her of her name, so that she can never go back home.<br/><br/>First of all, this cartoon is beautiful. Even if you don't enjoy the story, you'll be captivated by all the colors, the different characters, the landscapes. Everything is kept simple while put in a surreal, dream-like environment. Being a Japanese anime, this is not meant (only) for children: one of the many contemplated themes is how the rapidly growing sex industry in Japan negatively affects young children - we discover that the bathhouse is basically a brothel, and that Yubaba means ""hot water old woman"", and that a strange creature named No Face wanted to ""buy"" Chihiro with the gold he was offering her. Another important theme is ecology: the director Miyazaki once participated in the cleansing of a river, from which he removed a bicycle. In the anime, Chihiro helps removing a bicycle and various other objects from a river god. Also, an elaborated subject, very common among Japanese people, is the collapse of their traditional society: the greedy frog that takes gold from No Face is swallowed right after, as a sort of punishment. In order not to perceive this animated movie as an absurd collection of random characters, it should be remembered that it borrows a lot from traditional Japanese folklore, which the Western society is not familiar with.<br/><br/>I've noticed a lot of people don't like the English dubbed version. I have seen only the Japanese version, with subtitles, but I would still suggest you do the same. In my opinion, a dubbed movie is always worse than the original, it lacks ""that special something"". And in Spirited Away, the voice actors are amazing: the child characters are actually voiced by children, and an actress who voiced Chihiro's mother actually ate while speaking the dialogue in a scene where her character is eating. All of these little details give so much credibility to the anime, you feel as if you were watching a movie with real people. The soundtrack also helps establishing the amazing atmosphere, and the movie often easily switches from being a children's cartoon to an adult story, with many scary moments. I just think it would have been better if the ending had been a little longer and better developed - it seems a little abrupt.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com"

","With last having viewed Spirited Away a few years ago,I was please to learn that the film had been chosen as the IMDb's Indian Cinema board next joint viewing,which would give me a chance to re- visit the movie that cemented director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's presence on the world's stage.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Sitting in the car angry over having to leave all of her friends behind,Chihiro Ogino ignores her parents attempts to cheer her up,as they drive to their new location.Chihro's dad, Akio decides to take a short-cut down a newly discovered road.Speeding down the road,Akio suddenly stops the car in its tracks,when he sees the entrance,for what looks to be a ""lost"" forgotten building.Curious about this new discovery,Ogino's mum and dad decide to get out of the car and take a look around.Reluctantly joining her parents search, Chihiro and her family soon discover that the ""lost"" building is actually not a building but is in fact a ""closed down"" theme park!.Walking round the abounded ""theme park"" , Chihiro's family are shocked to find tables filled with freshly made food.Calling out to check if anyone's around,the parents start to eat everything,whilst Chihiro stays away from the food,due to being nervous about where the food has come from.Walking round the ""theme park"", Chihiro is surprised to find out that the abounded ""theme park"" is really a still-running bathhouse.Heading to the building which she suspects is the main bathhouse, Chihiro is shocked,when a strange boy appears and tells her that she and her family must get away from this place right away.Rushing back to her family, Chihiro begins to fear that this place is far from normal,when she discovers that her parents have transformed into pigs<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>For the screenplay of the movie,writer/director Hayao Miyazaki elegantly uses the film's 2 hour running time to create a magical dream/nightmare- logic world.Smartly not getting caught up in potentially overly complicated exposition about the various brilliant,strange monsters that co-inhabit the place with humans,Miyazaki instead allows the inhabitants to come fully alive,by spending a good amount of the time with focusing on the day to day activates of the workers in the bathhouse.Along with the daily activates.From the scene where Chihiro discovers that her parents have transformed into pigs,Miyazaki introduces a strong,dark fantasy element to the story as Chihiro begins to realise that she is going to have to leave her safe childhood behind,and face terrifyingly strange fears in order to save her parents.From the scene of Akio driving down the ""wrong turn"",Miyazaki uses a number of long tracking shots to cleverly fully show the skillful animation on display.Staying away from CGI animation as much as possible,the animators use warm,vivid colours to make the characters truly come alive in an unforgettable film."
"corey-richards-107-932760","10","0","1","6 August 2012"," 'A truly engrossing adventure'
","'Spirited Away' was the first and only animated feature (thus far) outside of America to win an Oscar for 'Best Animated Picture', and for good reason. Director, Hayao Miyazaki has managed to create a timeless and enchanting classic for kids and adults alike. In usual Studio Ghibli fashion, the feature bears similarities to classic tales, and Spirited Away is no exception. There a many comparisons that can be made to Lewis Caroll's, 'Alice In Wonderland'. However do not confuse this film for a mere retelling. 'Spirited Away' is a truly engrossing adventure that addresses a whole range of themes and emotions.<br/><br/>The film, that revolves around ten year old Chihiro whose parents are turned into pigs, follows this idea of a small girl lost in a magical world. However the way in which this is portrayed, the way Miyazaki makes this world unfold in front of your eyes is where the real magic is found. A world that is ""hidden by Gods""as the word 'kamikakushi' in the Japanese title would imply. It's a story about a small girls passage between childhood and adulthood, done in such a beautiful and invigorating way. The way the film embraces Japanese folklore and culture, while subtly referencing environmental concerns helps surround the films with more purpose and meaning, something many Western animations miss.<br/><br/>This is a film that has helped stamp the importance of Anime in western culture. While big films before, such as 'My Nieghbour Totoro' and 'Akira' have been huge successes, 'Spirited Away' really brought the magic of Japanese animation to the west. I for one consider 'Spirited Away' as my favorite film of all time, in both the original Japanese and American dub, the voice acting is perfect. The score is both magical and sublime and the animation is done in the exquisite Ghibli way.<br/><br/>Simply amazing, a must see for anyone."
"rorymacveigh","10","0","1","6 August 2012"," A Fantastic Piece of Animation that cannot be overlooked
","This truly is Japanese animation and story writing at it's finest, Spirited Away combines fantasy and romance through the magic that is animation, and when I say animation, what I really mean is absolutely fantastic animation! This film has so many brilliant aspects put together to create a piece of cinematic theatre that really does top the bill! The characters are complex and well developed, the soundtrack is brilliant, the scenery and layout of the locations is memorising and to top it all off, it has a fantastic story that is really very original.<br/><br/>The story begins with a lazy ne'er-do-well girl named Chihiro and her family arriving at their new town. Whilst en-route, they come across an old country lane which they mistake for being the way to their new house. At the end of the lane is a dark tunnel. They get out of the car and begin to walk down it on foot with Chihiro reluctantly in tow. At the other end they arrive in what appears to be an old train station and beyond that a wide open field with what appears to be an abandoned Amusement Park on the other side. As the trio explore the amusement park, the parents get an insatiable urge to eat all the food at one of the stalls. Even though Chihiro tries in vain to stop them, she eventually goes off to explore elsewhere. Finally she comes across a castle which is stood upon its own precipice with only a wooden bridge connecting it to the land. As she takes a step onto the bridge, she is suddenly confronted by a strange boy who demands that she leaves immediately. When she tries to get her parents, it is revealed that they have been transformed into Pigs and that the wide field has now been turned into a river the size of the English Channel. Unable to return to what could only be described as 'The Mainland', the strange boy from before assists her in reaching the strange castle without gathering the attention of the animal like spirits that have inhabited the Amusement Park. Successfully getting her onto the castle grounds, the boy leaves her to confront the Spider like Boiler-man Kamaji and demand a job from him. She is eventually taken upstairs by another woman named Lin. As she enters the castle, it is revealed that it is in fact a spiritual bath house where all kinds of spirits come to cleanse themselves. With the help of Lin and another Spirit, she eventually reaches the office of the evil witch Yubaba, the owner of the Bathhouse. Following the advice the boy gave her earlier, she demands that she be given a job to save her from being transformed into an animal. Yubaba reluctantly agrees in order to stop Chihiro's yelling from disturbing her over-sized baby and she is forced to work in the Bathhouse as a servant girl. Can Chihiro work for her freedom? What will become of her parents? Can she return to the normal world? You have to watch this masterpiece to find out!<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic piece of cinema that I recommend to people of all ages. Even if there was no dialogue, no sounds, just the soundtrack, I'm sure through the artistry and craftsmanship of the animation you'd be able to fathom what the story is. It is a wonderful film!"

","""Spirited Away"" is not a mere title, but an act in itself, for watching it, you become spirited away yourself. This film is truly magical, and although it's cliché, and although it's been said, undeservedly, of many films before, I feel there is no other way to describe Miyazaki's magnum opus. To watch ""Spirited Away"" is to give reason and to breath life to watching movies; it transcends all of which a film is capable.<br/><br/>It guides you through the story of Chihiro, a ten year girl moving to a new home, while her parents are sidetracked and she is swept into a bathhouse for the spirits. This bathhouse is the main location for much of the film, and a living entity all in itself. Never have I had the pleasure of meeting, however briefly, the staggering number of characters than in this film, from a six- armed boiler man to an unspoken radish spirit. Chihiro's story is given credence by its humanity and empathy, and achieves magic. It's a film you have to see to understand how wonderful it truly is, for describing does little at all. Watch it, rewatch it, and pay attention to the corners of the screen, it's well worth the effort."

","Spirited Away, otherwise known as the movie that catapulted Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki to international fame, is a terrific viewing experience. While I enjoyed the excellent Princess Mononoke more, I can easily say that this is the better movie. <br/><br/>This movie is about a young, slightly spoiled girl called Chihiro. While driving to her new house, her father accidentally turns down the wrong road. They come to a strange tunnel built into the hillside, and despite Chihiro's protests, both her parents decide to have a look. On the other side of the hill, they come across a strange looking town with no one in sight. Chihiro's father realizes it's an abandoned amusement park, and they begin to explore, although Chihiro herself wants to turn back. While in the amusement park, Chihiro's parents discover a large table set with delicious food, which they immediately start to eat, gorging on it. Chihiro wanders off alone, but then is approached by a young, handsome boy who warns her to leave. She returns to her parents, but is horrified to discover they have been turned into pigs. She is whisked away by the young boy (named Haku), who explains that after dark, the abandoned theme park turns into a refuge and bathhouse for spirits. At his advice, she gets a job in the lively bathhouse under the command of Ubaba, the boss of the house. Ubaba turned Chihiro's parents into pigs because they had gorged on a feast for the spirits. Chihiro begins working in the bathhouse, hopeful that her parents will be turned back into humans before it's too late. <br/><br/>Spirited Away won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film and it's not hard to see why. Every frame is filled with color and life and the characters are ones that you'll remember for a long time. As always with Studio Ghibli movies, the music is brilliant, with wonderfully beautiful songs like the piano solo ""Inochi No Namae"" (The Name Of Life) and ""Always With Me"", which is played during the end credits. A common theme that runs through Studio Ghibli movies is that of a strong female character. It's refreshing to see an anime girl that isn't loud and annoying. Chihiro is a great character: she's brave, smart and likable, with lots of life and spirit. <br/><br/>Spirited Away is (in my opinion) one of the greatest animated films ever made. Children will watch it for the vibrant color and animation, and adults will watch it for the compelling storyline. Whatever your age, you are sure to love this movie."

","Spirited Away is a special film because it tells the story in a unique way, through camera angles, facial expression and the relation of the environment to the story. The characters make the film one of my favourites. They are all likable and not one disappointed me. No face was my favourite character simply because its a blank figure, emotionless and faceless, until someone approaches it and it takes the characters trait e.g.Chihiro shows kindness and No face becomes kind. Every few minutes, a surprise is round every corner and something is added to the story every so often, making it more adventurous. Haku seems to be the thing that drives Chihiro to save her parents. The artwork is very unique. My favourites were Yubaba's baby, the paper birds, No face and the Radish spirit. The setting is somewhat surreal and unique. Who would of thought to have a film based around spirits and monsters cleaning others in a grand bath house? Everything about this masterpiece makes it more adventurous, magical and simply amazing.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Chihiro, a ten year old girl, and her parents happen upon an abandoned fairground while travelling to their new home. Chihiro is then spirited away into a magical world at the centre of which is a weird bathhouse populated by a gaggle of bizarre and wondrous beings.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki's feature is in many ways like an anime version of Alice in Wonderland. It's full of fantastical creatures and moments of surrealism. It benefits from the highly compelling way it uses Japanese mythology and imagery to create a strange and beautiful world. There are many visually splendid ideas, such as the ghostly train that travels over the sea. It's not just about the look and feel though, Spirited Away has very well drawn characters too and does have effective comedy at times too. Overall, it is a rather lovely film that does that most unusual thing in that it genuinely holds appeal for all ages. That in itself is a terrific achievement."
"mattbarwick-50-114586","10","0","1","20 May 2012"," My favourite animation of all time, second favourite overall film of all time.
","I first saw this film in cinemas when it came out in Australia. I had no idea what I was in store for. It shocked me and to be completely honest, I didn't like it. It was almost scarily different from anything I'd seen before. Just an odd sight. I assume everyone has the same experience their first time 'round.<br/><br/>However, on repeated viewings, this warms to you like a woollen rug. The beautiful beyond words animation (as usual from Studio Ghibli) is just mindblowing. Especially when this is your first Ghibli film. To see this film and experience its wonderous portrayal is something I wish I could experience for the first time again and again.<br/><br/>The character development is fairly normal for a Ghibli film, one of overcoming ones flaws and also defeating the inner-demons in order to become a better person. Chihiro accomplishes this well and while at the start you may judge her as a useless, frightened little girl, by the end of the film you're proud as punch that she has come as far as she has.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliant. Chihiro and her parents accidentally stumble upon a seemingly abandoned theme park when suddenly they see that one stand has piles of delicious food available. Chihiro's parents feast immediately, but she is far from comfortable with this. She wanders off to find a mysterious young boy who urges her to leave immediately. It is too late, however, as when she returns to her parents, they have turned into pigs! The story is about her journey to turn them back into humans. The rest I will leave for you to discover.<br/><br/>The music is composed by Studio Ghibli trademark, Joe Hisaishi. What can I say? This man has done what no other composer has ever done. He has moved me in such ways that would seem impossible. Other film composers like Clint Mansell, while brilliant, just don't compete. Joe Hisaishi completes every Ghibli film he works on and this is no different, in- fact it might just be his best score yet.<br/><br/>There are subtleties a-plenty throughout the film as far as themes, metaphors and imagery. Hayao Miyazaki, director of the film and founder of Studio Ghibli has always done this without campy, cliché or trite means or delivery. He has many things to say and he says them well and without shoving it down your throat.<br/><br/>After all of this, it really comes back to the amazing animation and art department. I would say that it's nothing new and that Ghibli always delivers this well, however it is something new. This was their first digitally composed piece and therefore seems a little different from their previous productions. It feels cleaner and more deliberate, while still holding that innocent charm and beauty that captivates you with every film they produce.<br/><br/>This film is flawless in my opinion. A must-see for anyone who is even remotely interested in an adventure story filled with courage, wonder and intrigue. And beautifully crafted imagery."

","When I was little, watching an animated Disney movie was an incredible, mind-blowing experience, the sad scenes so heart-wrenching I wanted to cry, the fight-scenes so intense I thought I was going to faint, and the happy endings so uplifting that I literally wanted to leap for joy. <br/><br/>Spirited Away is one of those rare movies which makes me feel like I am a child again, totally, utterly lost inside the movie. <br/><br/>The art and imagery is simply breathtaking, the score is haunting, the atmosphere and feeling is completely unique and captivating, the storyline is almost non-existent yet at the same time extremely compelling, the characters are fascinating and the dream-like world is at once so magically surreal but shockingly realistic. <br/><br/>No film I have watched as an adult has ever really come close to Spirited Away."

","Spirited Away is definitely the best film in all categories I've seen to date. In all his films, Miyazaki has always impressed me, with this one particularly.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the master plunges the viewer into an incredible and magical world, where humans, spirits and deities coexist. Thus began a journey into the heart of childhood, a world full of prohibitions and regulations, but also full of dreams and hopes. This film makes us understand that even if the childhood is not always an easy time, it is important to enjoy the moment and be happy.<br/><br/>In addition to animation quality beyond reproach and beautiful environments, the music composed by Joe Hisaishi allows us a total immersion into the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>The Art of Hayao Miyazaki peaked at the scene of the train. Using a scene of pure simplicity, Miyazaki accomplishes a masterpiece of poetry. During two minutes, the real world no longer exists, the viewer is totally absorbed by this scene of incomparable beauty, entranced by the awesome piano piece by Hisaishi : ""The Sixth Station"".<br/><br/>By combining the image, the universe and the music of two geniuses, Spirited Away promises the audience an unforgettable journey to the world of dreams.<br/><br/>We are so far from Disney or some Pixar with Miyazaki's movies. Infinitely more beautiful, more intelligent, more sincere, more humanistic, more creative, more poetic, more breathtaking, but never preachy or silly. Giver of hope and dreaming of a better world like no other cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dobrien4587","10","0","1","1 April 2010"," My favorite film of all time!
","There are times in life where we find a movie that we not only really like, but it touches us in a way no other movie could. As mushy as that sounds, the movie that touched me is Hayoa Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Not only is it magical, funny, romantic and just plain creative and enjoyable in every way, but it manages to be serious and light-hearted at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie follows a little girl named Chihiro, who, much to her displease, is moving with her family to a new home. On the way, her father takes a wrong turn and ends up at what looks like an entrance to a theme park. The parents are curious to go in so Chihiro follows. The parents find some delicious food and begins to gobble it down like pigs. Chihiro tries to talk them out of it claiming that they'll get in trouble. Since her parents wont listen, Chihiro talks a walk and notices a bath house, and a little boy notices her. He desperately tries to get her to leave before night falls as it will trap her in the spirit world. Chihiro tries to get her parents to leave but they have been turned into pigs by the Witch of the BathHouse named Yubaba as punishment for eating the food. The little boy that Chihiro met reveals himself to be named Haku, the right hand man and apprentice to Yubaba. He tells Chihiro that he wants to help her and tells her that in order to save her parents, she needs to get a job at the bathhouse until they can figure a way to get Yubaba to turn them back.<br/><br/>And what follows is an amazing adventure complete with strange but likable characters like Kamaji the boiler man or Lin, just your everyday employee, and other strange characters like Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, and Yubaba's giant baby, as well as a monster who just wants a friend called No-Face. All these characters help Chihiro grow dramatically overtime, and eventually Chihiro falls in love with Haku, and when Haku gets in fatal trouble, she goes out of her way to save him, risking her life for him. It touched me, and I'm sure it will touch you.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful. Its beautiful, remarkable and sometimes silly. But the visuals were just stunning through out the film, and its just another thing that I love about this film. The soundtrack is also incredible with wonderful pieces like ""Reprise"" or ""One Summer's Day"" the list goes on. Most of the characters are developed overtime. Kamaji becomes less grumpy, Lin becomes more caring, the Baby learns to work, Haku gets his name back, and No-Face finds himself both a home and a friend.<br/><br/>The Movie comes to a thrilling climax when Chihiro discovers that Haku is the spirit of a river that she almost drowned in, but Haku had saved her. This realization breaks Yubaba's control on Haku. Then Yubaba gives Her one test that if she passes, she and her parents will be free. Chihiro passes the test, and EVERYONE cheers. Haku leads Chihiro back to the human world, and her parents, (who didn't remember what had happened) get the car started, and with one final look, Chihiro bids a silent farewell to the amazing world, and all her new friends.<br/><br/>Overall: What more do I need to say? This is EASILY Miyazaki's best film, as well as my favorite. If you are a movie lover, and anime lover, or you just want to watch an amazing film, You should check out Spirited Away, you will NOT regret it!"
"moviesleuth2","10","0","1","27 January 2010"," Pure magic
","While the Walt Disney Company may have created some masterful animated films, and Pixar appears to be the new king in animation, neither one is really king. No one, and I mean NO ONE, tops Hayao Miyazaki. With his signature sense of magic and wonder, jaw-dropping imagery, and deep and involving storytelling, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a master. And this is easily his best film.<br/><br/>A young girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is moving with her parents (Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) to a new town, and she's not happy about it. Along the way to their new home, they make a wrong turn and end up in a mysterious place. To her horror, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, and she becomes trapped in a bathhouse for the gods! Worse, its run by Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), a ruthless caretaker who traps people into servitude by stealing their names. Now, in order to save her parents and make it back to the real world, the whiny and fearful girl has to grow up and survive in this strange new place.<br/><br/>The first thing that one recognizes when they begin to watch a Miyazaki film is that the animation is gorgeous. The imagery in his films (particularly this one) is nothing short of a work of art. This is the Mona Lisa of film animation. I am not exaggerating. Even if you watched the film on mute, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it. Every frame is so lovingly crafted and detailed that it takes many viewings to soak it all in.<br/><br/>The second thing one notices about his films is that they all have a strong sense of magic and wonder. Watching a Miyazaki film is like being taken back into the innocence of childhood dreams. All the fond memories one has of childhood are brought back to the forefront with this film. The mixture of the dreamy music and images is intoxicating. The sense of magic that this film exudes is indescribable, and only Miyazaki has been able to create it.<br/><br/>Finally comes the story, which is the heart of the film. His stories are always strong and engaging, but this one takes the cake. This is a brilliant (and unpredictable) story that will charm and captivate film goers of all ages. Most family films are meant for kids, but have a few one-liners or references aimed at adults. Not here. This story and its themes apply to everyone, regardless of age.<br/><br/>Like most top-quality anime films, ""Spirited Away"" has been dubbed by English language actors. Under the direction of John Lasseter (of Pixar fame), every theme and idea has been preserved, and the dubbed lines are beautifully written and acted by a talented cast. Daveigh Chase is probably most famous for her portrayal of the evil Samara Morgan from ""The Ring,"" but in that film, she didn't speak. As Chihiro, she demonstrates immense talent. In the beginning, she is whiny, nervous, and pretty obnoxious. But through Chase's vocal work, we are able to see her transformation. Chihiro is helped along by two friends, Haku (Jason Marsden) and Lin (Susan Egan), and both are brilliantly portrayed. Marsden has a unique, hypnotic voice, which he uses to good effect in the role. Haku is an authoritative young boy, but he really cares for Chihiro. Marsden is able to manipulate his signature voice to great effect to portray all facets of the character, and his voice is so seductive that it makes the low-key attraction between Haku and Chihiro come to the forefront. Likewise, Susan Egan is terrific as the sassy, but helpful Lin. Lin is a sassy girl who quickly befriends Chihiro in an older sister sort of way. Egan voices Lin in this exact way, and it works. As Zeniba, Suzanne Pleshette is a nasty piece of work. Zeniba is a vicious creature, and while she may look comical, Pleshette makes her anything but. When the characters say that Zeniba is dangerous, they aren't lying. However, she has a soft side, as she dotes incessantly on her 20 foot tall baby, Boh (Tara Strong).<br/><br/>Yet, the real star is unquestionably Miyazaki. There's more to making a film than writing, directing, and having a great cast. The film is well-paced, and NEVER boring (either visually or story-wise). Like all of his films, ""Spirited Away"" is thematically complex, dealing with such issues as identity, self-esteem, anxiety, over-coming obstacles, and environmentalism (a Miyazaki trademark). Yet, these are portrayed with such skill that no one will really miss them or misunderstand them (and they are illustrated with the correct amount of subtlety).<br/><br/>As good as this film is (and it's VERY good), it's not perfect. There's really only one complaint that I have, and it's with the ending. Without giving anything away, I will say that it is unexplained. We know what happens, but not how it happens. Most people weren't bothered by this, however, so this may be just the film critic speaking.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is a near-masterpiece, and regardless of the ending (the question left unanswered isn't especially important anyway), it is one of my favorite films, especially on a bad day."

This movie transcends age or time and i think it can be enjoyed by all age groups alike. The movie has an Alice in Wonderland like quality and it gets the viewer lost inside the parallel universe that it so effortlessly creates. The viewer is forced to feel all the pains felt by Chihiro and also cheer for every little victory that comes her way. <br/><br/>The underlying theme in the film is that love conquers all and the unconditional and pure love between Chihiro and Haku is portrayed very beautifully. <br/><br/>The colors and the landscapes used in the movie are beautiful as in all Japanese cinema and easily beats the Hollywood animation used these days.<br/><br/>This is the first movie of Hayao Miyazaki that i have seen, and i am sure to see many more."
"byte_my_lip","9","0","1","26 August 2009"," I honestly......
","I honestly love Hayao Miyazaki's work. The way he incorporates so much into his movies to include an ongoing theme, open ended questions and an actual story is really rare in a lot of animation.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that when it comes to Japanese and Chinese Manga and Anime style animation, i'm not the biggest fan, except when i find it actually worth the read or worth the time to watch it, and with Miyazaki's work, i love watching it again and again.<br/><br/>i can admit that i was a little confused with the character No-Face towards the end, but that's just an opinion due to the fact that, if it were me, and a giant spirit had just eaten a lot of people i was employed with, i wouldn't be the most willing to take a train ride with it.<br/><br/>i do have a question though, my husband told me that in the river-spirit bath scene, when Chihiro is cleaning the river spirit, everything that she pulls out of the spirit was actually found in a river-is that true?"
"bigtinylittle","9","0","1","16 August 2009"," Enchanting, near perfect piece of animation.
","Spirited Away is a near flawless creation from Hayao Miyazaki. The story is simple on paper, but is complex in execution. The character arcs are almost all perfectly developed. The world and the characters in it are all creative and incredibly drawn. <br/><br/>The story seems to be a simple lost and trying to find her way back home story but it's much more than that. It's a stroy about love, friendship, finding yourself and making hard sacrifices. Incredible imagery and symbolism add a whole other level to the movie. <br/><br/>3 great things about this movie. 1. Incredible characters 2. Stunning animation 3. Emersive story<br/><br/>1 thing that could have been improved. <br/><br/>1. The voice acting varied from great to annoying, overall not bad but could be better.<br/><br/>It was hard to find flaws in this movie, and I could have done more than three things that were great but I want you to discover it for yourself and form your own opinions.<br/><br/>Verdict: Rent this movie, buy it , look for it on youtube, just see it, it'll change your life!"

","This has got to be one of my more favorite anime's. Miyazaki is the greatest anime director out there and in my opinion there will never be a greater one. This is an anime however, so many Americans will find some of the characters and images a bit weird and disturbing in the sense of images. I honestly think that a child would be afraid of this film because of the main villain, so a child under 8 maybe is advised to not see this. I love anime's but the one thing that always gets me is the horrible dialog that English dubbed anime's contain, one being dragon ball z. This film, however, is not one of those films. The dialog is very well thought out and Americans will be pulled into the story more than if the film's dub made Americans go, ""What do they mean by that,"" or, ""Wow that was utterly obvious."" The voice-overs are perfectly done and performances will make you cry and laugh in many different scenes. This film has it all; love, comedy, horror, action, and especially mystery. I guarantee seeing this, the Oscar was much deserved."

","Hayao Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' was an unexpected international hit, but not an undeserved one. A charming Japanese fantasy story, the film is beautifully animated, full of delightful, original details and mercifully free of the universal Disney narrative of self-improvement and consequent reward, it deserves the praise lavished upon it. And I loved the doleful no-face, a most unlikely monster. At first, you do notice the static backgrounds of a traditional animation (compared with what computer animation can produce), but soon one is lost inside the magical world. One thing surprised me, though: how un-Japanese it felt, except for the tendency of the characters to bow, there was very little explicitly eastern about the story."

"artificeprime","8","0","1","4 September 2006"," A visually stunning, unique, and immersive childhood fantasy
","I gave this movie an unfavorable review several years ago and while I still feel that some of my criticisms were valid, upon watching it recently I really felt compelled to re-write my review. While there are some areas of the movie that I think are weak, I do consider it a masterpiece. Not because it is perfect but because it does things that almost no other film does and does certain things better than almost any other movie.I found it to be quite random the first time I saw it but that is only because of how different it is. Care and attention to detail have been put into almost every frame and it is bursting with creativity. The story is simple, on the surface, but is it is masterfully crafted with hidden depths. It is like a modern fairy tale. It encapsulates the feelings of childhood while expanding the imagination and offering inspirational ideas that both children and adults can appreciate. <br/><br/>Spirited Away does an excellent job of presenting a world through a child's eyes. I originally criticized it for not explaining many of the aspects of its world. I still think that is true but after multiple viewings I have come to appreciate the way that it puts the main character in a world that is alien while still giving that world substance and a sense of reason that the audience can discover. While the world isn't entirely explained it is very believably crafted. The bathhouse feels like a very real place. Each room feels like it was designed to be functional and that helps to make it feel very real immersive. Chihiro is very much lost in the world she is taken to and so to criticize the movie for being confusing is kind of unfair. Many aspects of the story and world are not well explained but that confusion is created to serve a purpose.<br/><br/>Another thing I criticized the movie for was the ending. I felt that the ending didn't seem to provide any real challenge to the main character and some of the reveals seemed a bit random. I still think that those criticisms are true, however, I think that the character does grow and change a lot through the story. The point of the ending isn't to challenge the Chihiro to accomplish something difficult, it is to get her to face her fear and take responsibility for her choices. In that the story succeeds. <br/><br/>Overall, Spirited Away is a one of a kind, magical experience that I really have learned to appreciate more over the years. When I reviewed it in the past I focused a lot on areas that I felt disappointed rather than focusing on the things that it does very well. Few movies do a better job of transporting the viewer to a fantasy world. Many of my past complaints came from my own lack of understanding rather than actual flaws in the movie. I have grown to appreciate this movie more over the years and I want to give it the credit it deserves."

","I watched this with my ten year old daughter and we both enjoyed it immensely. We have seen other animated films by this amazing director/writer/animator (Castle In The Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc.) but we both feel this is the best one we have seen (so far). The symbolism is there for you to make with it what you want - but for me - it is a wonderfully imaginative story about growing up - to go from when you are truly a child who is always taken care of, where every whine or sniffle or cry will eventually be tended to - but here - you slowly make steps to be your own person. T o learn - step by step - what you are capable of and how one can stand up for themselves in the world. It is so beautifully drawn - some of the images are breathtaking. Like the Wizard Of Oz, a little Harry Potter, and yet totally original - fantastic animated film!"

","Had the DVD offered by a friend gathering dust. I realized shortly after finally popping it in that waiting had been a mistake. This cute animation keeps you on your toes, and does make you smile and laugh, without going where most American-produced ""Shrek"" copycats go. The humor is cute, genuine, old-school, and does not try to outsmart its viewers.<br/><br/>The characters are superbly drawn, and each new arrival leaves its predecessors in the dust. The soundtrack is very effective in setting the mood, and the English version voice-over is very decent. My only negative comment would be about its length. At more than 2 hours, it really feels long, especially for an animation, especially considering the amount of intricate sub-plots happening at the same time.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad for the gift and recommend at the very least a rental to everyone."

","Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away) was a visually astounding film, appealing to children of all ages. There is the base of a Japanese legend that appeals to fans of asian myth, a wonderfully stylish artist to bring that legend to life with backgrounds beautifully rendered from pencil to CG, and a plucky heroine who faces a strange new world, masterfully blending CG and cel animation to produce a whimsical fantasy land that can only be described as something out of a dream. <br/><br/>A must see for any anime fan, or fan of Ghibli studios, and a film able to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, or Spirited Away will leave you breathless and satisfied."

","Spirited Away has got me hooked. It's like a drug, making you see things you've never seen before. Only this is better than any drug in the world, because this film is not making you hallucinate. After seeing this, I wanted to go to this world so much that I've even started writing my own novel based around the same idea: surviving in a beautiful but dangerous world. And unlike most of my ideas for novels, I'VE STUCK WITH IT. What's even more interesting about Spirited Away is that no matter how many times you see this film, you will always see something new in it. And everyone will create different ideas and theories about it. It's about our instincts to survive, friendship, greed, good and evil, innocence of the mind, who and what we are, what our own world is really like, the list goes on. You are not going to like this film, however, if you keep your mind closed to new things. This film has come from a place a long way away from Hollywood. To anyone who's used to Hollywood, this film is going to see very weird. Which is why I love it. Normality is being chucked out the window here, but then one of the things you'll learn from Spirited Away is that there is no such thing as 'normal'. Brilliant.

This piece starts out rather smooth and takes a quick roll into the story - and we're about to follow a little 10 year old girl who's entering a new realm, a new dimension of magic. I just love the vibe this piece brings, and it's really a Ghibli production! Well worth the good voting points at IMDb, and I suppose this really is one of the best animes ever, I can asure you it is in the top 5.

","It draws you right from the start and i didn't notice the passage of time. The characters are very well realized with their own individual mannerisms.

While the parents pig out at a food stall, their daughter goes exploring and discovers that the theme park is a place where spirits (e.g. river spirits) go for R&R. Because humans shouldn't be there, she finds herself trapped and has to take a job at the bath-house. With the help of some of the spirits, she has to face her fears and complete several tasks in order to win her freedom.<br/><br/>There are lots of lovely little sub-texts and details: the polluted river spirit, the over-cosseted baby, the spirit of old Japan driven to over-consume, the ghost train etc. Its Alice in Wonderland type qualities make it one of the most Western-friendly animes I've seen."

","What a wonderful film! I was completely captivated within minutes, and ""spirited away"" along with Chihiro into this wondrous and mad fantastical world. The main character initially seems disaffected and weak, but she rapidly finds her true self in this trial by fire (and water, and muck, and...).<br/><br/>The character development is as fast-paced as the rest of the wildly imaginative world, yet is somehow believable. I liked just about all the characters in the story, even the ""bad guys""; I suspect that's intentional.<br/><br/>Since I don't know much about Japanese culture, I have no idea how much if any of this is based on traditional mythology and how much is original, but either way it is enormously creative. It's also visually beautiful. The scenery alone is a sufficient reason. (Technical problems gave me a chance to view a still scene that only had a tree in it, and even that was fascinating to look at!)<br/><br/>Normally I'm not a huge fan of anime, and in particular this director's ""Princess Mononoke"" didn't do much for me, but this movie is really fantastic!

","Ok, admittedly I'm not Japanese, so I only saw the Americanized version of this, the one that Disney felt needed to be crammed full of all the voices from their previous movies and crappy sequels.  (I haven't seen a credited cast, but I am pretty sure Lilo, Kovu, Zira, Megara and many others are here.)  So that was a lame, *used* approach to take to this new, original work, but not that important. So, Spirited Away... Interesting, colorful, intricate, etc.  All you expect from Miyazaki, plus the usual unexplained things that just leave you hanging, tons of unanswered questions and plot details that would tie together nicely if only you could understand them.   Most of this guy's movies are just like... really artistic independent films.  Totally beautiful, but who knows what any of it is supposed to mean?<br/><br/>It's just meant to be a random slice of life, I guess, and that's ok if you like that kind of movie.  Maybe it is that Sen is childish in the beginning and ""grows up"" as the story moves on.  Well, probably there is some really deep message in ""Spirited Away"" that everyone else gets, but I do have to laugh at the mention of how technically brilliant it is that Sen and her mother look alike.  (Davy and his dad look alike in All Dogs go to Heaven 2, so that must be a technically brilliant film as well..?)<br/><br/>
Meanwhile it does have some cool, dramatic scenes and very cute characters (and delightfully scary and grotesque ones) so it's an excellent watch as a trip to the Creative Museum.  I give it an A for design but a D for overall story resolution, something I look for in a movie.<br/><br/>
And Disney... How about giving a listen to those millions of NEW voice actors who would love to audition for your stuff?<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Decent, but Kiki's Delivery Service is still the best I've seen from this director."

","Hayao Miyazaki is the greatest modern-day animator to ever hit the big and home-television sets of any coast.

His works such as, ""Princess Mononoke,"" and ""Laputa: The Castle in the Sky,"" have earned him international recognition.  His close association with another great animator/director, Isao Takahata who was responsible for ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is only another aspect of the tremendous respect and reputation he has built for himself.<br/><br/>Spirited Away captures the essence of great filmmaking by making the story important.  And while the animation is impressive, it does not take precedence over the grandeur, simplicity, and complexity of the overall plot.<br/><br/>Characters become well developed, and as we come to know the main character, Chihiro, we become at the same time both concerned and educated at the endeavor she has undertaken; only to come out wiser, and more apathetic to the world.<br/><br/>Studio Ghibli, and Mr. Miyazaki San have done it again; this animation master never ceases to amaze . . ."

","It is hard to review a movie, especially if it has received so many accolades prior to me seeing it.  I came into this movie knowing that it just won an academy award for best-animated picture.  Roger Ebert put it on his top 10 list of 2002, and the movie was one of the highest grossing films in Japan.  In other words how can I be neutral?  How can I give a bad review to a movie that the intelligentsia praised?  If I give it a bad review, does it mean I do not have the mental capacity to understand the movie?<br/><br/>Spirited Away reminds me of the surrealistic movies I saw as a kid. Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi.  Those movies made me uncomfortable.  There was something nightmarish about talking animals with human feelings.  Those movies sometimes felt like a bad dream put to film.  Horror writer Clive Barker listed Pinocchio as one of the best horror movies of all time. I got the same feeling watching Spirited Away.   From my viewpoint Spirited Away felt like a great horror movie and a bad dream.  It felt so much like a dream because you would see things that did not make sense.  For instance the three bouncing heads must have been from someone's nightmare.  That is something you see in a dream, and all the next day you are trying to understand the symbolism of them in your dream.  Throughout the movie I made the mistake of trying to grasp the symbolism of everything.  At the end I realized that maybe it symbolizes what you want it to be.  Maybe the director (Hayao Miyazaki) does not even know what it meant, but he and you are trying to grasp understanding.  The whole movie I was trying to grasp understanding, and so was the main character (Chihiro/Sen).  In my mind I was trying to put everything into the human world perspective, but this was not part of the human world.  Reality was massively altered for Chihiro, and she could fight it or come to terms with it.  Eventually she came to terms with the harsh new reality, and accepted it, and consequently she was able to escape it.<br/><br/>I feel this was a great movie, because it requires re-viewing over and over to gain greater understanding.  I am still trying to come to grips with some of the meaning of images I saw.  It was an uncomfortable movie to watch, because it felt nightmarish and surrealistic, but I will see it again because I want to gain a better comprehension of the nightmare.<br/><br/>Like I said this movie made me uncomfortable the same way early Disney surrealistic animation did.  It was a perfect recreation of a nightmare. But this definitely falls in the `great movie' category, because I probably will watch it over and over. 10/10"

","The story of one little girl, straying into the fantastically bizarre world of director Miyazaki's imagination, has turned into one of the decade's landmark releases.<br/><br/>Disney fully embraces the Japanese anime tradition and produces a 21st century classic to turn the head of many of their usual audience. The story begins normally enough with a little girl, named Chihiro (Rumi Hiragi), moving home with her parents before getting lost on a country road and winding up in front of suspicious tunnel. As the family pass through the tunnel, they arrive in a very desolate looking place that contains an old theme park.<br/><br/>The discovery invokes strange mysticism about the park that violently envelops her parents and leaves her left in a strange place to fight for her rite of passage in an unusual situation involving faceless spirits, ignorant toads, and two frightening grandmother figures who take the very name she has been born with.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, it proved that this was not going to be standard animated fare as the ideas the film presents to its audience are varied and well created, with more than a touch of twisted imagination to make this unlike any film Disney would produce.<br/><br/>It gave the audience a chance to laugh with and mourn the characters being shown on screen as they all change either physically or mentally with the removal of their names (such as Chihiro's case) and made drastically different personas for the viewer to absorb."

","Spirited Away is a gorgeous film--unlike Disney or other animated movies, each scene is meticulously laid out. It is easy to overlook simple effects, such as the wind rippling through the grass, but when you stop to think about it, you realize just how much work went into creating this strange little world.<br/><br/>If you loved other Miyazaki films, undoubtedly you will enjoy this one. I would even say it's his best yet. Non-anime fans object to illogicity of the film, yet these same people flock to the theaters to watch The Matrix and Spiderman...what you have to understand is ""Children's Movie"" does not equate ""childish."" This is a film that adults would enjoy. Some people say that the length is too long; I actually wish it were longer because Miyazaki creates a fantasy world you want to stay in. In the beginning, Chihiro's parents mistake the spirit world for an abandoned amusement park. At the end, you feel like you're leaving the best rides behind and you wish you could go back again.<br/><br/>This is the sort of film that keeps you thinking about it days after you've watched it. The significance of certain moments will come back to you and you will be amazed.<br/><br/>My only concern is the difference between the subtitled version and the Disney version. I think they took a few liberties with translation that made certain scenes sound silly, and no offense to Daveigh Chase but she makes Chihiro the whiniest little girl in the world. I would highly recommend watching the subtitled version, but the other one holds up pretty well."

Most of the emotion carried in drama is not just the words that are spoken, but in the intonation of HOW they are spoken.  This carries with every animation I watch as well as live-action movies.  I was utterly disgusted with Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon for their atrocious dubbing. However, with a movie like Spirited Away, it is truly a family movie, and I knew my little girl would be enchanted by it.  Can she read fast enough for subtitles?  No.  Can she understand Japanese?  No.  I was very pleased with the fact that it was even released in the United States and that she got to opportunity to see it on a big screen.  Though a long movie for a six year old, she was rapt.  She loved it so much she insisted on giving it to her friend for her birthday. This film is important because it introduces a whole new genre of art to a lot of people that would never have recognized it.  Second, it cannot be compared to Ghost in the Shell, or Princess Mononoke, etc.  It is a whole different kind of genre.  Do you compare Lawrence of Arabia with Citizen Kane or the Matrix?  Ghost in the Shell is one of the best anime's I've ever seen.  So is Spirited Away.  So is Princess Mononoke.  So is Cowboy Bebop. So is Akira.  So is Blood.  And so is Furi Kuri.  You just can't compare them because they are different genres. Also, No Face was attracted to Chihiro because she was kind to him.<br/><br/>I recommend Spirited Away to everyone, families, friends. *spoiler* If for no other reason that it is a poignant story of a girl finding her own strength.  All those seemingly non connected vignettes are very connected with her finding her own spirit.  This is not a movie about a little girl finding her parents.  It's about a girl finding herself.<br/><br/>Possibly one of the cleanest and most beautiful anime's I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Personally, my favorites were the soot creatures."

","Spirited Away, as with all Mayazaki films, it simply gorgeous.  The animation here is just superbly drawn and animated, and Miyazaki's eye for directing is as sharp as ever.   The script was light, as it should be, and like all children's films it tries to instill some moral lessons in its viewers.  These lessons are aimed at children, but are good for anyone to realize.  Some of the dialogue was a bit too kiddie, but it's not noticable or really a bad thing depending on preference.  The movie had a few scenes that are superfluous and stretch the movie thin.  That was really my only major complaint with the film.  Mononoke Hime is 20 minutes longer, but it never carries its weight as this film does.   And as I addressed in my title, I simply didn't feel the magic as much as others.  It's easy to be inspired by Mayazaki, and Princess Mononoke was a very magical film for me, but I just didn't connect with this movie the way most others did.  Don't get me wrong, it's a very fun movie and a great way to spend time (along with being extremely well made), but it never really lifted me out this world.  The magic was there for me, sure, but just not in the quantity it was for others.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>* * * 1/2/ * * * *"

","Roger Ebert gave `Spirited Away' four stars while most of the IMDb reviewers seem to dislike it. The DVD of the film contains adulatory, worshipful introductions by Disney animators who speak only in superlatives. My family stumbled on Miyazaki's work when I came across a copy of `Kiki's Delivery Service' in the video store and brought it home for my seven-year-old daughter. She enjoyed the story while I was amazed by the richness of the images. It seemed to take place in some imaginary European town of no particular provenance. `Spirited Away' is clearly set in Japan although, true to Japanese animation traditions, none of the characters looks typically Asian. The animation and imagery are dazzling. The story was very dreamlike, actually too dreamlike. What we noticed was that not only could my daughter not understand the plot, neither could I! The characters and relationships were often extremely confusing. And it seems odd that Miyazaki is held in such reverence by the Disney animators when in fact the animation is actually noticeably jerky, not fluid and natural in the way that is the pride of the Disney studios (`Peter Pan' and `Bambi' are good examples). Miyazaki seems to lavish most of his attention on the backgrounds and use reduced animation sequences for his characters, as in cheap American cartoons. Is this cultural, something to do with Japanese artistic or balletic traditions, or is it a matter of cost?"

","You've probably already seen my one line summary, and thought my review is just going to be me gushing. (probably still is...) But I'm going to go through why I think this movie is so great, so you'll be able to appreciate its merits too. I've heard people saying that perhaps teenagers would be averted from this movie because of it's idiosyncrasies, but I'm 16, and my class at school who watched it loved it too. We're a varying bunch ;-). By the way, I've seen mostly all of the top 150 movies in the IMDB list, so you can't say that I haven't seen enough movies... :spoilers:<br/><br/>Story line: A little girl (Chihiro), is spoilt and whiny, and is moving to the suburbs with her more adventurous parents. She moans over her flowers dying, and this is the start of our hints that she isn't the perfect little girl that usually inhabits Disney cartoons. The father accelerates through the more overgrown landscape, silencing Chihiro's worries by saying 'don't worry, I've got four-wheel-drive...' They stumble upon an opening, Chihiro is apprehensive, but her parents move on and the father is eager and childish. They come upon a massive field, and the mother identifies the place as an old Amusement Park, they move further on, Chihiro seems more at ease. This is until. they find some food and she finds herself surrounded by dark spirits, and her parents have transformed into pigs... Some critics have said that the storyline is far too random, but I say that almost every occurence is intricately woven into the story, and is one in a chain of events that helps Chihiro at the end of the film. The story is certainly original and never less that enthralling and compelling, it is pure fantasy, as Miyazaki said himself. We don't (or shouldn't...) expect it to make perfect sense. Another brilliant aspect of the story is witnessing Chihiro grow from being a clingy, crying girl into an independent and purpose-filled woman.<br/><br/>Animation: This is exquisite, and has almost unanimous acclaim to back it up. All of the cells are hand-drawn (except the very infrequent computer graphic aided sequences). Especially on the train, at one particular time, you will be hard pressed to feel that it is animation and not actual footage. The sunsets and backgrounds are simply beautiful and colorful. As illustrated in the DVD Bonus Features, we see how Miyazaki has made it so that the characters do not move mechanically, they feel around, and tap their shoes to make them more comfortable. This defines the animation, very well thought out, intricate and lifelike. In two words, it is pure art.<br/><br/>
Score: This enhanced my favorite scene in any film I have watched, (when Chihiro is riding Haku and they fall, her tears fall up instead of down) it is soaring and adventurous and hopeful. From the beginning of the film, the score is flowing like water, but it knows when to be silent: when Noh Face and Chihiro leave the train. This enhances the scene, making it feel contemplative and slightly suspenseful. It should have been at least nominated for Best Score at the Academy this year.<br/><br/>''Replayability'': You will have probably missed many of the details in this film the first time round, and it is so enjoyable that you won't be able to resist, it says on the back of my DVD case: 'Spirited Away is a spectacular DVD the whole family will want to experience over and over again', and this sums my review up.<br/><br/>Go see it. 10/10"

"ilovedolby","8","0","1","22 May 2003"," A story of incredible imagination that is filled with amusing and intriguing characters.
","Hayao Miyazaki, the writer/director of 1999s hit anime, `Princess Mononoke,' now brings us `Spirited Away,' the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature 2002. `Spirited Away' presents an interesting blend of traditional Japanese anime and computer animation with a fantastic story that is well drawn out. When broken down, the film resembles traditional mythology that has been handed down from generations and adds colorful characters full of wit and charm. The end result is a dazzling animated feature that not only entertains, but also gives the same morals that all classic fairy tales do.<br/><br/>	The story follows that of Chihiro, a young girl who is traveling with her parents to their new home, when they stumble across an abandoned theme park. When inside, her parents are transformed into pigs after eating freshly prepared foods set out in the park. Little do they know that they have entered a realm in which the unimaginable is possible. With the help of magical friends that she makes along the way, Chihiro has to find a way to transform her parents back into human form and ultimately save herself and her new friends from the clutches of vile Yubaba, a witch that Chihiro is forced to work for in the realm of the spirits. 	`Spirited Away' is filled with imagination that is reflected through its lively characters. Haku, a boy that aids Chihiro against the Yubaba, is able to transform himself into a dragon. Kamaji, a boiler room supervisor, has several arms that enable him to do several jobs at once. And Yubaba, a witch who is the boss of a bathhouse where spirits work, is a withered old lady whom although human in appearance, is much larger than any ordinary human.<br/><br/>	The most notable part of `Spirited Away' was the relationship that it has with other classic fairy tales-most notably, the stories of `Pinocchio,' and `Alice In Wonderland.' First off, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs while eating food in a disgusting manor. As was the case in `Pinocchio' in which runaway boys have their fill of fun at a secret amusement park called Pleasure Island, where after words, the boys become donkeys. The idea being that if you are going to act like an ass, you become it. As reflected in `Spirited Away,' if you're going to act like a pig, you become it. Secondly, the film is similar to the story of `Alice In Wonderland,' in that a little girl finds herself in an unusual world filled with strange creatures, and all she wants to do is find a way home.<br/><br/>	With its relationships to classic myths and fairy tales of yesteryear, `Spirited Away' is just as ground breaking as the original `Star Wars,' `The Lord Of the Rings,' and even `The Matrix,' in that all four of these films are representations of classic mythology and the fight of good conquering evil. The only difference between these films is the setting and characters, which is the reason that these stories can be made over and over again in film; there is an inherent fascination in people to discover new stories of heroes and villains. 	In the end, `Spirited Away' proves to be a story of incredible imagination that is filled with amusing and intriguing characters. ***"

"robertodandi","Null","0","1","19 May 2003"," go and see this movie
","I loved ""princess mononoke"" (the previous film of this director) and I love this one, even if less strongly. This is a strange movie, probably not targeted to a children audience, because there are some disturbing scenes and some hidden messages that can be faced only with an adult mind. Which kind of messages? First, I think that there is the idea (already present in Mononoke) that nature is good and industrialised world is bad. You can see this by comparing the two terrible big-nosed sisters of the movie, where the first runs a factory-like bath for spirits, the other one lives inside the nature and is far more good than the previous one. Another message is that our industrialised, capitalistic world has something wrong. I don't know if the director is left-wing or even communist but what I feel is that he - being a creative person - dislikes factories and tayloristic/beaurocratic organisations such as those shown in his movies. Low-level workers are like those little black balls that bring carbon to the fire for the rest of their lives. Or at least this is the message I want to see. Finally something related to the recent economic situation of Japan. The father says that what they are in is probably an amusement park that, with the advent of the economic crisis of first '90s, now is in abandon. The struggle of his daughter to find a job is something that probably now has become very present in Japan (as well as in Europe) due to this economic crisis. The movie thus becomes the representation of the end of childhood, when one has to get a job and become independent from its parents, who are accused to have lost country whealth, to have eaten all what is good (and destined to the spirits - that is ""the nature"") and to have become pigs.<br/><br/>I see those messages, but maybe I'm wrong and just so ""European"" (that is cervellotic) and I want to see messages everything also where there are not.<br/><br/>However in general this is a strange and maybe disturbing movie but I suggest every adult to see it."

","Spirited Away is simply a lovely movie.<br/><br/>It is a work of genius, but sort of a sneaky one.  Yes, the hand-drawn visuals are wonderful (each frame is a work of art).  There are some intriguing contrasts between natural beauty and mechanized squalor, and an implied environmental message.  <br/><br/>The plot isn't terribly important, but the characters are.  One of the things I love about this move is that Miyazaki doesn't consider it necessary to explain his characters.  They're just THERE, in a glory of imaginative output that somehow made me think of ""Being John Malkovich"" (not that the movies are similar in any way but their sheer imaginative breadth).<br/><br/>Some moments are very funny, others quite disturbing, yet others strangely touching.

","'Spirited Away' has the most beautiful, amazing, and even magical animation I have seen in a movie. The dazzling and thrilling storyline makes it even better. As I watched this movie I got caught up in the actions and emotions of the characters. The characters seemed so very real and alive that a person has no choice but to watch what happens to them, especially Chihiro. She's like a real girl really there trying to get through all of the crazy things that happen to her. Sometimes you feel 'I would do that too if I were her' or 'I would feel the same way' and that is part of what makes you feel this movie is actually real. Another part that I love about this movie is that every frame is like a painting. Each shot, foreground and background is both beautifully colored and drawn. The bright and vibrate colors of this film is the colors of imagination, of both kids and adults. This movie brings the imagination to life with realistic qualities, such as human emotion and human actions. There is no real villian in this movie, it's just an adventure in a mysterious and magical world with a strong and brave little girl trying to get through it meeting different kinds of people on the way.

No, it wants to crawl inside my head and stir up images, words, and concepts that I never knew were there.  It wants me to think, and think hard.  It wants to challenge those things I hold as ultimate virtues.  ""Spirited Away"" is such a movie.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes into the movie, I knew I was watching something unforgettable.  A half hour in, I was completely lost in this world, completely enchanted by the things I was seeing.  After the film was over, I staggered out of the theater in a daze, my mind trying to sort out the experience I'd just been through.  It wasn't easy.  There was so much symbolism and detail that I knew this was going to be one of my favorite films of all time.  Rarely had I been as challenged by any film, animated or otherwise, as I was by this one.<br/><br/>I won't recap the plot, since doing so is a gross oversimplification, and the film's power isn't in the storyline anyway.  It's in the mood, the tone, the feelings that you have as you watch Chihiro discover hidden virtues within herself.<br/><br/>For those who still haven't seen this movie, be forewarned that while this movie is indeed a masterpiece, it requires concentration and an open mind to fully grasp its power.  But is the personal effort worth it?  A hundred times over, yes."

","As an American resident of Japan, I have seen a fair amount of decent anime (anime considered anything that English translators took seriously during the redub).  Beside the point, I'd like to say this movie was a perfect blend of typical Japanese storyline and American studio attention to detail. This film by far exceeds my expectations in a Japanese anime!  It's not every day you can walk away from a movie you watched with a newer outlook on life, without being able to make any sense of this intangible film.  The character developement from beginning to end was near flawless, without the flamboyant, over-acting usually associated with characters in Japanese films.  Even in the Japanese version, it seemed very down-to-earth. Forgetting for a moment that this movie was a masterpiece, it has reached in and unlocked a piece of childhood I've forgotten about: not everything has to make sense; we all know what is really important in the world."
"e123000beta","Null","0","1","6 May 2003"," a true masterpiece: everything movies are meant to be
","Disclaimer: This review does not contain spoilers. However, if saying the names of the a couple of characters counts as a spoiler to you, then please do not read this.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece. Mr. Miyazaki is a genius. I know that I am not the first to say this, but it bears repeating. In Spirited Away, a young girl named Chihiro is brought, albeit unwillingly, into an imaginative world of spirits. Some reviewers have discredited the movie due to its rather nonlinear plot. However, I put it to them: in what world that they have lived in is there a linear plot? Miyazaki has created a world, with its own innerworkings and side stories. The reason that many works such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and The Lord Of The Rings have been so widely read, seen, and loved, is because the movies and books created entire universes. Spirited Away does the same. It is a world filled with colorful characters (double entendre intended) and wonderful emotions that few movies have ever been able to evoke from an audience. At the end of the movie, I, as well as the other people I know who have seen the movie, did not think the movie was too long. We wished it could have gone on longer. We care about the characters; when Chihiro is in trouble, we worry; when Haku (a friend/spirit/dragon - I can't elaborate more without giving spoilers)is shown to be healthy and well, we celebrate. The subplots that others have verbally dumped on flesh out the world, and allow the viewer to truly be spirited away. Add the plot, the world, and the characters to everything else, and this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>There is a wonderful score that, although simple, does more for the movie then almost any other music has done for any motion picture. The environment is wonderful: it takes a world from a child's imagination and makes it seem real. And the colors: man, the colors! Get this movie on DVD. The colors are beyond what most of us dream about. Some have criticized this movie for attempting to make complex subject matter in an animated form, but it works perfectly. Trust me, after 5 minutes of the movie, the only reason you may care about the animation is how well done it is.<br/><br/>Also, this movie is more imaginative than almost any other movie. I wish everyone who says that there are no original movies would see this. Of course, there are elements of other movies and books in this (most noteable are Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz), but Spirited Away is highly imaginative. The spirits in this film are realistic and impossible at once; both a child's dream and an adult's world. The environments are no less. This world is impossible: it is so wonderful and different from everything we know that no adult could ever accept its existence. However, we want this world to exist. Just think how happy we would all be in this imaginative world. It is, in many ways the desired to be part of this world and to know its characters that make the movie so wonderful.<br/><br/>Spirited Away is a wonderful movie. It certainly deserved the best animated picture oscar, and I believe that a best picture nod was also in order. A<br/><br/>child will love the movie for the characters they can relate to, adolescents will worship the movie as a film that embodies all they search for in a film, with a love story for the girls, and enough action for the boys, and the adults will appreciate and enjoy the movie for its imagination: movies as original, intelligent and complex as this do not come along every day. Everyone who loves movies should see this movie. It is truly a masterpiece. 12/10."

","I first fell in love with the work of Miyazaki when I saw Princess Mononoke about a year ago.  When I saw a preview for Spirited Away, I knew exactly who had made it.  I was enthralled.  The symbolism of Princess Mononoke blew me away then just as Spirited Away does now.  Many people have been saying that Spirited Away is ""Alice in Wonderland"" retold.  I beg to differ. Miyazaki's story has meaning whereas ""Alice in Wonderland"" doesn't. A lot of people brush off these movies because they are animated.  That is such a bad attitude.  It's art and art comes in all shapes and sizes. People love the Matrix but quite a bit of the film was falsified.  I just don't understand why Anime doesn't get the credit it deserves.  It's so challenging to sit down and draw an entire movie.  All in all Spirited Away is deserving of your viewing.  Tell me what you think of Noh Face at the end.

I've seen four of his movies previous to this, three of them dubbed in English, every time I was impressed.<br/><br/>This movie came to my attention when my anime-hating father suggested seeing it. That set off a dinger in my head alerting me that it must be good if my father wanted to see any animated product of Japan.<br/><br/>Anyway, I didn't see it until it came out on DVD. I watched it, then I watched it again, and immediately hightailed it to the Spirited Away fanfictions on fanfiction.net.<br/><br/>Then I saw the biggest of the few problems of creating a movie this great. The sickening magnitude of the 175 fanfictions were essentially the same plot ""Chihiro is an older, prettier teenager who goes back and falls in love with Haku"" that's the problem with many Miyazaki movies.

Everything about this movie shines. The wonderful animation style and backgrounds, the bizarre but compelling plot, the sympathetic main character (although she is annoying at the beginning of the film, we grow to like her as her character grows in turn), the great musical score- I can't pinpoint one flaw here, although some scenes are a little intense for small children- I'd say Ages 8 and up for this one. It honestly felt like being transported to an insane but compelling dreamworld. And for those who complain about the story or lack of explanation behind some of the elements, who cares?

","This is not the usual anime.  It is not angry in the way that most anime is. You can choose to brush it off as a cartoon; but most people will be touched.  Depending on your mood or inclination, you can find in it poignant echos of the human condition.  There are so many messages in it served up in such a gentle way that it engages without melodrama and influences without judging.<br/><br/>It is essentially a story about the triumph of innocence (a theme that seems to be close to director Miyazaki's heart, take ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate"" from his earlier ""Princess Mononoke"").  This is a story for everyone who ever was a child (and for those who missed it), and for every child who wants to grow up.  Look hard and you will see many of your friends and family (and more importantly perhaps, your enemies) in the cast of characters... look harder and you may even find a meaning of your life :)<br/><br/>8/10.

","Why is it that the Academy has such a difficult time giving awards to foreign films for the Best Picture category?  Being that ""Spirited Away"" is an animated feature film from Japan and was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the greatest animator alive, I am sure there was enough debate giving it a nomination.  Now that ""Spirited Away"" won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards this year, you get the feeling that perhaps this film was given the justice it deserved.  <br/><br/>That said, ""Spirited Away"" is a magnificent film.  I was totally blown away by it, as it was a lot better that I thought it would be.  The animation is beautiful, as that is always the case with Miyazaki films.

"Michael Kenmore","10","0","1","19 April 2003"," Repeating the cliche: one of the best animated movies ever made!
","Frankly, I haven't much to say about this film already heard in the positive comments below but I'll explain my feelings. I've seen it a total of six times in theatre and it never lost its power to astonish me. The audience's reaction, particularly developmentally mature children and skeptical older adults, was unanimously positive. Some of them even sat through the closing credit until the last frame, stunned that they saw a movie that's out-of-this-world strange and emotionally muted and that it beat the recent U.S.-animated movies they may have seen in terms of quality on authentic storytelling and vivid imagination without ever pandering to the children while simultaneously condescending adult viewers. <br/><br/>Subtle humor, scary moments and a couple of moving sequences towards the ending of the movie made us laugh, gasp (for children anyway - but it's good to be scared reminiscent of being told a horror story at bedtime) and, yes, cry. Fantastic story, impressive character development and sublime wisdom interjected in the feel and style of The Brothers Grimm's terrifying fables and Lewis Carroll's wondrous Alice's Adventures in Wonderland stories makes it one of the best animated films ever made. This is definitely a classic alongside Walt Disney's Pinocchio and Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.<br/><br/>
Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki deserves the awards, including the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, but he intended for the film to inspire the audiences to be compassionate, understand the importance of self-respect and be less selfish.<br/><br/>Forget the preconception about Japanese animation as violent and ugly, do yourself a favor and see this film. It's truly a rare epitome of an extraordinary work of art that actually makes you think and feel in the cinema. Don't deny yourself the opportunity to see why Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi is one of the increasingly rare best reasons we go to the movies for the simple fact of aesthetical pleasure and mind simulating magic."

The magical world of spirits that young Chihiro (Sen) is now trapped proved to be very satisfying for the eyes as well as imagination. No one could possibly claim this movie sucks because that is simply impossible... I will never forget this tale and I am happy I didn't pay attention to the laughs of my friend as I went up to buy a cartoon.

A rarity. For years many people in America have looked down their noses at anime, possibly for culture clashes, while ironically saying Disney movies are better, despite Disney annually trying to stay close to the quality of Japanese animation.<br/><br/>Some applaud Disney for recognizing this great film, which wasn't too hard considering the amount of awards it won and recognition it garnered the world over after being released in Japan, and bringing it to American audiences. Others are confused; they think this is a work of Walt Disney genius. The most important thing is that people who wouldn't even know this movie existed otherwise have a chance to watch a simply enchanting movie.<br/><br/>I implore you to find out for yourself just how great this movie is.

"TanjBennett","10","0","1","15 April 2003"," Sen falls into a dreamworld of beauty, horror, and bravery
","Miyazaki is in a class by himself, with an imagination the West is mostly unaware of.  This tale was somewhat unexpected, many thought Mononoke no Hime was his magnum opus and finale, but in many ways Sen is a more approachable and timeless piece, it is wonderful to see he has resumed. The imagination draws on a floating world of ghosts and demons which has a Japanese character while it is also uniquely Miyazake, and nothing like you have seen in western animations.  The story line is universal, even if the dreamscape is strange (even to a Japanese person, this is an unexpected world), a story of a child discovering her inner resources, honesty, loyalty, and bravery to save herself, her friends, and her parents.<br/><br/>And not to be forgotten, there is breathtakingly beautiful animation. The scenes of flight (a Miyazake hallmark), the riot of ghostly life, the vistas, the boat along the water .. both technical mastery and artistically balanced.  This is a film children can appreciate (though children too young to understand the abstractions may be truly scared) and has a depth to it that can allow an adult to watch it many times without tiring.<br/><br/>It is somewhat better with the Japanese dialog than the English, as usual. Probably this is because Miyazake gets involved in the casting and dialog work too, in the original, and this seems lost in the translation.  If you've understood the story line in English you may one day consider watching it again in Japanese, just for the feel of it."

","My first encounter with the director Hayao Miyazaki was 7 or 8 years back when Anime burst onto the American scene. That first encounter was the horribly butchered version of Miyazaki's ""Nausicaa of the valley of wind"", re-titled in the states as ""Warriors of the wind""<br/><br/>It was not until a few months ago, upon the initial release of Spirited away, did I realize I had seen one of his films (albeit terribly cut)<br/><br/>So this brings you up to date with my new appreciation of Miyazaki and Spirited away. Upon the lack-luster release that Disney did in fall 2002, I was unable to see the film before it disappeared from my local market (I came so extremely close several times)<br/><br/>So thank god for the Academy awards!<br/><br/>Because of it's win at the Oscars for best animated feature I was able to finally take witness to this oddity of a film. And I use the word in the best sense. The very best, indeed. To an American audience it most likely feels very strange, but incredibly familiar at the same moment. It is routed in the deepest and oldest places of, not just Japanese mythology, but all old world stories.<br/><br/>This is where we find the very human story of Chihiro, a ten year old girl in the midst of a move to a new home. For almost any kid, it is a real bummer. Old friends gone, new and scary things ahead. And this is in the most literal and metaphoric sense of the word. The world that Chihiro ends up traveling to is a full of spirits, witches, and other silly creatures, feels like any old fashion fairy tale. But amidst the magic there are strong messages of self-discovery, friendship, love, greed and acceptance among other things. The film runs deep and should require at least one repeat viewing for every one who sees it. As was the case with me, the film grows on you.<br/><br/>The animation is quite possibly the best in years coming from any country. It looks very different from your run of the mill Japanese Anime. The thoughts that had gone into all this detail is amazing and it is quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>Thus it is a film that will stand up to the test of time with an ardent air about it.

Chihiro and her parents move to a new town, find mysterious tunnel, strange things start to happen once they enter. Though that is the basic plot, the story runs deeper than you think. At first, Chihiro/Sen is bigoted by the creatures of the new world, because she is human and they are not human (possibly an anti-racism moral), but then, she gains their respect after solving Yuba'aba's riddle. There is also a scene where Chihiro and her boss save a old man's spirited trapped in a garbage pile, which I thought was rather poignant.<br/><br/>I love most of Miyazaki's stuff (except Momonoke Hime, wich IMO, is mediocre at best), and Sen did not dissapoint me one bit.

""Spirited Away"" has definitely made an exception here, marking a renaissance with help from its predecessor, ""Princess Mononoke"".  The best thing when viewing ""Spirited Away"" is simply to not expect anything in particular and just go with the dreamlike plot.

Every part of this film has been very carefully constructed with technical brilliance and subtle meaning. Besides the compelling story, characters and setting, Miyazaki has created one of the most inspirational films of all time. This film is an allegorical guide book of the best human qualities and a primer for all artists. Most likely it is composed of many personal battles that Miyazaki has ultimately triumphed over. Watching the film gives an insight to the mind of one of the best living artists in the world.<br/><br/>My only warning is that because of the allegorical nature of the film, some of the transitions and characters seem out of place. It is only with greater understanding of the messages that are being delivered that the film becomes cohesive. The film can be enjoyed on any level, but with deeper understanding of the themes it has much more impact.<br/><br/>Miyazaki has created a film that will mesmerize young children and the lessons it provides will source of strength throughout their life.

It bothers me somehow that the characters are drawn like Westerners with wide eyes, so at odds with the Japanese physical settings and cultural notions.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Spirited Away"" is, far and away, the most inventive, creative and imaginative animated film of the year. Its backdrops are designed with loving attention to detail, and Ubaba the witch is the greatest animated villainess since Ursula the sea-witch in ""The Little Mermaid"".<br/><br/>The young heroine of the film journeys from being a whiny, spoiled brat, clingy and fearful of adapting to a new environment, to a brave, spunky little girl who learns to think of others with pure love and generosity. She derives her newfound courage from within and from a young spirit-boy. The adults around her certainly are not role models. Even her parents fall victim to greed and are suitably punished for their failings.<br/><br/>The film has nothing in it that would frighten a young audience. The spirits are by and large kindly, and even Ubaba the witch is more avaricious that anything else.

Things don't go smoothly, and soon Chihiro is on her own, exploring what looks like an enormous bathhouse.<br/><br/>But this is no ordinary bathhouse. Soon Chihiro discovers that it is populated by many spirits, mostly in the form of creatures the likes of which she (and the audience) has never seen before. I'd love to tell you about some of them, but I don't want to spoil the wonderful surprises. Okay, I will mention the soot creatures, who look like little black Koosh balls with eyes and whose job it is to carry coal for the boiler.<br/><br/>I went into this film on 11/22/2002 with very high expectations, since it has gotten universally good reviews. Usually high expectations are a bad thing, and in fact during the very early parts of the film I wasn't convinced. The green line running down the middle of the screen for maybe 10 minutes didn't help either. But once the story entered the spirit world, the film became simply *magical*. I was just watching to see what wonderful thing Hayao Miyazaki (the writer/director of this film and also ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke"") would come up with next.<br/><br/>The animation is sometimes startlingly realistic and other times not at all, and the combination works wonderfully. About the only negative thing I can think to say is that the film seemed like it might have been a touch long, although I couldn't even begin to suggest anything to cut. I understand that this film is being distributed in subtitled form in addition to the dubbed version I saw, although for non-Japanese speakers the dubbed version is probably a better choice for the first viewing. Hopefully the eventual DVD will offer both options.<br/><br/>The United States doesn't consider animated films to be appropriate for anyone but children, but that's just wrong.

","This movie has the kind of wonderful, creative universe that many have come to associate with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. But where the movies of those series spend most of their time evoking their wonder and their dangers with a loud bang, Spirited Away explores its alternate reality more quietly.<br/><br/>That's not to say it isn't exciting at times. But the movie takes its time to evoke your curiosity, as you follow Sen into a strange realm. It becomes a real treat to watch the logic of this new world unfold in front of you, so that you feel like you begin to understand right in time with Sen. And each step of the way, fun details await you. I wouldn't want to give any of them away -- just watch this movie and explore each unexpected treasure for yourself. 9 of 10."

","There are very few movies that can engross both adults AND children without relying on dodgy double entendres to keep the adults amused. This is not a ""kid's film"" or even a ""family film"", it is ""film"" that adults will love, and if they happen to have kids, well, you can take the kids.  They will love it too!<br/><br/>My 6 year old sat rock still for the entire 2 hours.  She was mesmerised (as was I).  The 10 year old was slightly more critical - the soundtrack did not meet with his approval (is it different in the Japanese version?) but still, the narrative and animation had him in its grip.  Despite the daggy music, he was enthralled too.<br/><br/>This movie is stunning.  I can't wait for the DVD.  Any aussies reading this - put the movie on your ""must see"" list this summer holidays."

","It's all been said already so whatever praise I use will be redundant. But hell it's shear genius! I haven't cried in a movie in years, this doesn't count the movies that are so sentimental that the tears are forced. I felt a deep connection with the stories themes and messages about childhood, and love, about being strong. It matters very little that the story is Japanese, all that does is prove the universality of it's subject matter. Just like Alice fell down a rabbit hole, so does Chihiro enter her own rabbit whole.<br/><br/>The score by Joe Hisaishi is the first piece of music like the film, that has moved me to tears in a long long time. I recommend it to anyone as just music to listen to. And certainly seek out not only this film but the myths and monsters behind it. It will increase your enjoyment of this film to know why were the parents turned into pigs and not something else, what is a Kaonashi (no face)? Every detail from a bath house for spirits, to the river Sen has meaning and metaphor to the story and to our lives. This movie though enjoyable for children, is much better for an older audience in the way it shows us youth and how we ourselves have grown and the people and places that have shaped us and helped us to move into our new homes.<br/><br/>It requires several viewings to catch all the little themes and messages like when Chihiro pulls an old discarded bike out of the muck monster and it is finally able to breath again. This is the best film of the year and the best animated film I have ever seen. I will be showing it in my Mythology class and both my English and Poetry Classes. Live action would have hindered the story telling, animation allows a certain freedom, and Miyazaki doesn't pander to comic sidekicks and the intermission of songs to enthrall us. Nor does he resort to computers and his hand has drawn many of the images we see on screen. What Princess Mononoke did for environmental issues and the sacredness of the earth and it's creatures, Spirited Away does the same for youth and the human soul. This goes beyond film let alone Anime, this is a universal truth and like Shakespeare should have it's place among the great masterpieces of history."

","See this film. 10/10 But first some hints to remove any preconceptions, 1. This is not some kiddy cartoon, despite appearances, it is a film; 2. It is 2 hours long for a reason; 3. There are no zany characters, dance routines or merchandising to distract you; and 4. You will not look out-of-place in the theatre if you did not take children with you.<br/><br/>Fans of Miyazaki have anticipated this film since 1999.  (It is easy to anticipate Anime, given the long production period.)  The central character (Chihiro and Sen) is based upon the daughter of one of Miyazaki's collegues. Chihiro starts as a petulant 10-year-old, utterly self-absorbed, not looking forward to moving to a new house, school, friends.  Later, her transformation, first into Sen as she tries to rescue her parents, teaches her that manners, hard work, honesty and love can achieve far more than she ever imagined.  As she returns to being Chihiro we wonder if she remembers all of these lessons. You should consider taking children from 10 up as they might learn some manners by the end of the film.  :) I don't think it matters whether you see the English dubbed version or the original subtitled.  Both versions are slightly different.  The English dub subtly explains some Japanese concepts to assist those who aren't nippon-philes such as me.  While it doesn't explain every Japanese concept, if you are puzzled by something, take a breath and enjoy the rest of the film. As much as I implore you to see as many Studio Ghibli films as you can find, you should of course avoid pirate copies in favour of the original DVDs or find the films at film festivals.  Hopefully the success of Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi will encourage the release of more Studio Ghibli films outside Japan."

Why have I been subjecting myself to Disney drivel, when absolutely breathtaking animation films are coming from Japan? <br/><br/>Of course the English/American dubbing of ""Spirited Away"" was actually a Disney venture, using actors that have provided voices for Disney films before Daveigh Chase in ""Lilo and Stitch"" and Jason Marsden in ""A Goofy Movie""). <br/><br/>I was generally very impressed with the voice acting, however after a while Daveigh Chase's high pitched tones started to grate on my nerves, distracting me from the greater good. Jason Marsden was perfect as the mysterious boy Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette was brilliant as Yubaba & Zeniba.<br/><br/>However the wonder of this film is all thanks to Hayao Miyazaki. He is truly an amazing Director and Writer! The story was multi-faceted. Every time you thought you had come to the end of a mystery, more layers were pulled back to reveal more mysteries. Characters are not what they appear, and what they are is too enigmatic to explain. <br/><br/>There is a lot of humour in the film, and a deep well of emotion. I really found myself caring for Chihiro's well being, and hoped she would get back to her parents. I was completely sucked into the film. Even though, thinking back, all the things which happen in the film are confusing and complex, I never found myself bewildered or bored, as has sometimes been the case.<br/><br/>
The animation was beautiful, the colours were used so well to accentuate every minute detail. The landscapes and buildings were incredibly realistic.<br/><br/>

"TorpidOne","8","0","1","5 December 2002"," Great for younger audience; good but occasionally uneven for adults
","Miyazaki films are always a treat to watch.  I was hoping this film would surpass Princess Mononoke in quality, and it both does and doesn't.  In terms of the life and joy breathed into the film, it is certainly Miyazaki's crowning achievement.  But in terms of character complexity, deeper meaning, and richness of plot, it is not at the same level.<br/><br/>However, make no mistake, this is an excellent alternative to most family films.  Anyone able to appreciate imaginative artwork, memories of childhood wonder, and curiosity will enjoy this film.  Examining it with a cold, logical eye we might suggest that it seems like nothing more than a miyazaki sketchbook of characters.  But the life that each character is imbued with would overpower this opinion once the heart is let in.  What is great about miyazaki's children's movies is that none of the characters are really evil; just perhaps crabby or different.<br/><br/>Watching the film, we really feel as though the main character is swept away into adventure and wonder.  As the audience we are able to stop and think, ""what's she doing that for?  what the heck is going on here?"" but the character does not have such luxury.  Tossed into a world of weird but charming creatures, she nonetheless has a very serious set of obstacles to overcome.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most rewarding part of the film is the way characters never turn out to be exactly what we expect, and how they are molded over the course of the film into characters we are fond of.  And then there's the little bits of what I can only term throw-away joy.<br/><br/>However, those looking for even, structured stories should probably take a look at less child-like films.  There are times when the movie just sort of veers off randomly in another direction, sometimes seeming to even conflict with itself.  This is not uncommon to children's fiction, and certainly almost a mainstay of japanese animation.  Still, people looking for well-crafted stories will find some parts a little disappointing.<br/><br/>For this reason I would rate this just below Princess Mononoke.  Perhaps PM was a little too ambitious, a little too conventional, but it did succeed in telling a very complex, intricate story.  This film seems a little more messy and convoluted.  Which could be seen as a good thing to some."

","""Spirited Away"" is one of the best fables filmed.  Audiences seem to know this, yet Disney has neither advertised it nor made a serious effort to distribute it in the United States.  This lack of effort merely encourages comparison of this work to other Disney offerings.  The last film that Disney did of this calibre is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937). Atlantis may have come close, but Spirited Away puts it and other Disney efforts of the last sixty years to shame.  <br/><br/>It has a good story line grounded in some very important ideas.

","One of the things movies CAN do, and great movies ALWAYS do, is evoke: Dimensions, ways of being, feelings, thoughts, emotions, etc. Dimensions that are somehow ""above and beyond"" our normal, everyday lives. ""Spirited Away"" really does a great job of that. Any description I can imagine fails in capturing the essence of the movie. It is animated, but it is no cartoon. In fact, its essence, its life, its ""legs"" are so much richer and closer to a truth of some kind than many conventional movies shot on film stock with more or less human actors. For example, ""Spirited Away,"" in my opinion, is much more real and much more watchable than any Julia Roberts performance ever put on film. ""Spirited Away"" is, in fact, a breath of fresh, vibrant air. OH MY GOD--- I sound like a film school graduate--- but it's true nonetheless.<br/><br/>One very sad thing, however, is the lack of promotion and evident lack of care exhibited by the U.S. distributor--- Disney Studios, is it? I was eagerly awaiting a chance to see this movie, but when it finally did arrive there was zero advertising in my community, so I almost missed it. Some friends called me and said it was playing nearby and they asked if I wanted to see it on a Wednesday night. I said sure--- although I was a bit shocked that it had come to my town completely unannounced. Good thing we went that Wednesday (it had come to the theater just four days before, on the Friday), because it was gone in only two more days. WHAT??? A masterpiece like this only played for 7 days! And even sadder, the four of us sat in an almost empty theater during a ""prime time"" screening. That is a crime against art. A crime against movies!!! I'm sure that if the movie had been advertised and promoted on TV, many, many people--- adults, families, kids--- of all kinds would have really enjoyed themselves at this flick. Buying the rights to it, and then ignoring it and even virtually burying it away like they've done is shabby treatment for a master-work, and very tacky. Does the entire corporate world treat innocent creativity and joyous movie making in this way?<br/><br/>If you have any chance at all to see this movie (even a 4 hour drive would be worth it), please do yourself a favor and hie thee thither.

","Let me start off by saying that I hate writing reviews. In fact I don't like sharing my comments with others period. From time to time, I cast my vote for a movie and then read other reviews. This is the kind of movie that I want to tell everyone about.<br/><br/>In fact, movies don't move me period. I saw ""The Ring"" (coincidentally starring Daveigh Chase also) two days ago and it was pretty scary. Sure, I've slept with the light on for two days now, but this just made my day. Maybe even month. Maybe even year. <br/><br/>Word to the wise: it's very helpful to understand something about Japanese culture before seeing this (since you will see it). The main idea is based on kami, which are spirits of the departed that come back to guide family members. As shown in the beginning of the film, shrines ranging from small to enormous are constructed to serve as remembrance for the kami. The idea of the building in the movie is to serve as a first class hotel/bath house for the kami. With this as the background for adventure, the princpial character Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) undergoes one of the most emotional character changes I believe I have ever witnessed. She learns the true value of hard work, friendship and love. Accounting for the second major motif is the idea of the power of love between her and Haku (Jason Marsden). Their relationship in the film is brilliantly developed; sometimes I actually forgot it was animated. <br/><br/>Another aspect is the incredible animation. When Chihiro is on the train, the landscapes she passes awed me. Never before have I seen so much detail and artistic expression captured by animation or live action alike. The graphics alone are enough to justify seeing this movie, but adding in everything I have just seen, this movie should be seen by all.<br/><br/>
As compared to the 2001 animé ""Metropolis"", a love story with a powerful conclusion also develops. However, the romance between Tima and Kenichi seems false largely in part to the fact that Tima was a robot. ""Spirited Away"" has characters that you can relate to. Chihiro is a scared girl that finds herself in a more-than-troubling scenario. Even if the movie is extremely Japanese, American audiences with an open mind should have no problem feeling at home. This is what movies are all about. It's a shame that a 10 is as high as I can rate it."

","The arms on Chihiro's parents were drawn too short for their bodies, avian flight was animated way less naturalistically than bipedal movement, and with a wider release on DVD, teenagers across America will giggle during the scene where Chihiro rides a phallic dragon. But other than that, I can't think of a movie better than Spirited Away.<br/><br/>On moving to their new home, Chihiro and her parents are sidetracked to an abandoned amusement park. As a bathhouse of the spirit world materializes around them, Chihiro's parents mistakenly eat the indigenous food, finding themselves turned into pigs, and putting Chihiro in the position to sign away her name to the witch that runs the bathhouse, to stall for time to rescue them.<br/><br/>The basic theme consistent throughout the movie is the relationship between gratification, identity, and the soul. Chihiro's parents helped themselves to the forbidden food of the spirit world, unable to see beyond the hubris of their consumerism. A polluted river spirit was so in need of a bath, it was unrecognizable to those who reserve their courtesy for the most wealthy bathhouse guests. No Face, who bears the distress of also having no home, is unable to control his appetites and begins eating the bathhouse staff. Chihiro quickly learns to defer gratification to avoid becoming sidetracked. Leaving the bathhouse herself to beg the forgiveness of the witch's sister, Chiro invites the destructive No Face to go with her -- without explicitly referring to ""addiction"" (a testament to the genius of the film) -- saying instead she believed the pleasures of the bathhouse drove him crazy.<br/><br/>I think it's disgraceful how little attention this film is getting. Some bore at the San Francisco Chronicle had the nerve to say the movie was unoriginal because the transformation of Chahiro's parents into swine was like the donkey transformation scene in Pinochio, then inconsistently complain the movie was difficult to comprehend. Why didn't I hear anyone (besides me) compare Jurassic Park to Dawn of the Dead with dinosaurs, a comparison more richly earned?"

","In ""Spirited Away"" Hayao Miyazaki has crafted a gentle, whimsical fable for our times that deals with important and universal themes in a wildly imaginative manner.<br/><br/>The basic plot is less ""Alice in Wonderland"" than based in Japanese folktales of travelling to ""other worlds"" and in the country's rich and polytheistic mythology, where the protagonist is eventually reminded about the truth of this world. Here, the protagonist Chihiro is whisked off to another world where her parents literally hog up the place and where spirits and gods of all manners take refuge in bath houses.<br/><br/>The animation is simply wonderful, if enough hasn't been said of it, details adorn every frame, and the colors are rich and warm. Hayao Miyazaki adds his fertile imagination to his country's already rich folk myth and creates sights that range from bizarrely Tim Burtonesque to whimsically cute. The score, drawing heavily on Japanese folk music, is soaring and intense, and one just feels that amazing energy charging through one's body as one beholds the film and hears its wondrous music.<br/><br/>But what truly makes the movie shine is its witty and wise script, that while apparently a fairy tale has important things to say about issues like greed, environmental pollution, the consequences of single, overdoting and absent parents and what it means to grow up in a world riddled with temptation. <br/><br/>And stay for the credits and the gentle, beautiful closing song.

She's the alternately vicious and helpful witch of Russian lore, lives in a house on chicken feet and can be your best friend or worst nightmare depending on what day you catch her.  Of course, Yubaba is also reminiscent of The Duchess AND the Red Queen from ""Alice"". She's the Wicked Witch from Oz.  Queen Mab of British legend. And while I am not terribly conversant with Japanese fairy tales, I'm fairly sure there is a wicked witch/evil fairy ruling over Japan's fairy land as well.<br/><br/>
2) Guys, you never, but never eat food you find sitting around in a strange place.  It will either turn you into a piggie or it will prevent you from leaving the strange place.<br/><br/>3) The three green heads (which all looked a lot like Disney's blue Genie to me) are indeed part of traditional japanese lore.  They are headless ghosts and eaters of human flesh.<br/><br/>4) Ditto, no face, The Hungry ghost who can't get his fill.<br/><br/>5) The ""prince"" (instead of princess) in peril.<br/><br/>6) How about that stink spirit: Androcles and the Lion, anyone?<br/><br/>7) ""Don't look back!""

Frogs are often turned into princes and vicer versa, but in much of traditional fairy lore, frogs are NOT good guys...they aren't even guys...they just aren't anyone you want to meet.<br/><br/>11)SPOILER: The fact that Chichiro and folks have been in fairy land a LONG time (maybe not the requisite seven years, but certainly seven weeks or months, judging by the grass that has grown, the fall of leaves and the dust in the car).<br/><br/>All they needed was Tamlyn, a feisty dog and some ruby slippers.  Instead, they had a school card, sneakers and a hungry ghost.<br/><br/>I loved this movie.  I know a lot of people had plaints about the plot.  Yes, there were some breakdowns in logic, but then have you ever read the great English classic ""Alice in Wonderland""?  That thing has plot holes big enough to drive a mack truck through.  Friendships form instantaneously in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Evil characters (like the flying monkeys in Oz and the Duchess in Wonderland) become good.  This was a ""fantasy.""  More to the point, it was a DREAM fantasy.  (Okay, yeah, it's ""real"" in that we are to assume it is happening, but the flavor is dreamlike--it's fairy land for crying out loud.).<br/><br/>No, you can't take very small children or a weak bladder to this film. You need a strong stomach, too.  (When the Hungry Ghost lost ITS lunch, I nearly lost mine.)  But it wasn't any worse than--and was, frankly, miles ahead of ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ""Hercules"" for story and sophistication.<br/><br/>

No pretty boys, kawaii girls, or even immodest appearance like the major anime series who exploits anime fan (mainly male) common taste and the director/writer's own libido. Hayao Miyazaki certainly has a class of his own. Expect to find more details as you watch the movie more than once."

","This film is a thoroughly impressive tale, with astounding animation and a great amount of humor, emotion, excitement, and absolutely incredible imagination.  From the moment young Chihiro's parents turn into pigs, Spirited Away lies somewhere in between ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China.""  A somewhat regular Jane is thrust into a world of spirits, toads, monsters, and one BIG BEB-BEH (as Fat Bastard would call him.)<br/><br/>
I will just say that I have only watched one other Japanese animated movie, and that was the post-apocalyptic classic AKIRA a while back, which was definitely not suited for kids.  In contrast, SPIRITED AWAY was fine for both kids and adults, as really a lesson in how kindness, bravery, and as someone else said, lack of greed or violence can make one into a hero.<br/><br/>
(SPOILER)  The No-Face character got almost too much attention, but the core story of what he is, becomes, and how he is ""defeated"" is wonderful. So are the characters of the river spirit, Yubaba, Kamagi, the toad, Haku, and all the others who populate this mysterious universe.  (I don't know why, but the little moment between the Radish Spirit and Chihiro in the elevator had me doubling over.)  This film is an eye-popping treat, that while maybe 15 minutes too long, will definitely give you a smile on your way home."

","I am not saying I didn't like it. In fact it was probably the best anime ever in every aspect. If anything went wrong it was just myself, because I failed to associate many different scenes and little details which would have been clearer to a person that knows the asian culture (and writing) and its traditions better than me. My girlfriend is of asian origin and she just enjoyed the film so much more than me... I felt so envious. For example, she was explaining me what was written in japanese words in every scene and how they related to the scene, the meaning of each little detail was so deep and so rooted in the asian culture that I sort of felt awkward to tell her that I loved the movie(I didn't understand half of it). Go see it though, you will also love it. I guess the reality-based anime is still the one at the top of my list (hey, that I can understand and digest better): Grave of the fireflies, Whisper of the heart, Barefoot Gen... all of them such beautiful and wonderful movies, I wish they were making more anime like that.<br/><br/>Axel"

","The good news!  Sen is visually stunning movie.  The art is fantastic, the CG was put together very well, and flowed evenly with the regular animation. (something which is rare these days)  The character designs were original and well drawn, Miyazaki  has lived up to his artistic expectations.<br/><br/>The bad news...Sen has it's problems.  The story, while very good, seemed somewhat choppy.  It was like it was pulled directly out of someone's head and not put into exact order at times.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all out of place, but certain things could have been explained more or moved to earlier parts of the story. Another problem, that I think will be an issue once this movie hits the states, is that this film is very japanese ..and I think the casual movie-goer will miss out on a lot of stuff because of that.  And it is because of this I also fear the changes to the script upon it's arrival in the US. This is also not a subtitle movie.  Yes, I watched it subtitled, but because of how heavly this movie relies on visuals, I feel liked I missed out on some stuff from watching it subtitled.  So unless you absolutely must see this in subs, I suggest waiting for it in theaters or on DVD.<br/><br/>All in all, while this movie is definetly a Miyazaki masterpiece,  I don't think it's his best.  For those people who are new to Miyazaki, check out some of his other works like Kiki's Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro..I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

","OK, not the best one around, but still one of the better! If you like the genre, I deffenitly recommend it! It doesn't only look fantastic - the animation is really great and everything is drawn with the greatest care - but the story is great too, and the whole movie has this great magical feel about it.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Marvelous, this is considered as one of the best movies that I have watched for the year 2001 together with the J.R.R.Tokkien ""Lord's of the Ring"" From my analysis of this movie, the movie plots seem to draw parallel with the Story ""Wizard of Oz"".<br/><br/>1) Same as Wizard of Oz, there are 2 witches, the evil one and the good one.<br/><br/>2) Little girl about the age 10 - 12 age is the main character of the story<br/><br/>3) Magic<br/><br/>4) Out of the World Creatures<br/><br/>Don't just the review of this movie, go and do yourself a great favor, Go and watch this 'Once in the Lifetime' Movie.<br/><br/>There are many Movies that I have watched, And this rank as one of the most outstanding movie along with the great movies ""The Godfather"", ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Ran"""
