"Oeuvre_Klika","8","57","64","8 May 2019"," An underrated part of MCU history
","As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk."

","This movie bucks me in the most irritating way. I love Hulk, but this movie really is irrelevant if you think about the bigger picture. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many other movies that actually have some kind of impact on the rest of the universe, but in the end, this movie is really just a filler in the middle of a greater universe and unfortunately, it really tells when you watch the movie. It's not that good, unfortunately."
"Nytwolf","9","385","541","11 June 2008"," Attention - Origin Mixture!!!
","For those that know only of the original comic book Hulk, the TV series Hulk, or the regrettable Ang Lee Hulk, you should know that this new version is a mixture of origins.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it, one of the larger ingredients in this new Hulk comes from a Marvel series that is an alternate universe. There are many differences in the Ultimates Universe. In this version, Banner did not get his gamma radiation from exposure during an experimental bomb explosion. I won't spoil it, but you can go to www.marvel.com and look under ""Ultimates"" if you wish to get the gist of it. <br/><br/>I can truly say that this version captures a little of everything, so that no matter what your knowledge is of the Hulk character, there's tie-ins to everything.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt this reboot was well thought out. It allows for any future connectivity by not limiting it to one version of the Hulk. This will allow future Marvel movie-makers the ability to pick and choose aspects from the multitude of alternate universes, re-tellings, and time spans to combine whatever they please.<br/><br/>This was well cast. When the overall product can make me forget the fact that I don't like a specific actor, and truly appreciate the total entertainment experience, it's something to smile about. I won't mention which one I don't care for, since all that will do is spark useless debate.<br/><br/>Story - intricate and intelligent, fast-paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. I surely was.<br/><br/>CGI was great. Don't know why some have to nit-pick, but you can't please everyone, I guess. Action was wonderful with plenty of it! If you've ever read one of my reviews, you'll know that I'm a true fan of overall entertainment. While I have favorites, I don't base reviews on just one actor, writer, director, production company, genre, or whatever. So, if you don't like my opinion, so be it."
"MovieAddict2016","7","138","198","15 June 2008"," A fun summer blockbuster
","In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success  breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.<br/><br/>Then, of course, the negative word of mouth caught up with it  and by the following weekend it had dropped a colossal 60%. It was quickly left floundering in theaters and only turned a profit thanks to worldwide intake.<br/><br/>Marvel wasn't quite sure what to do  the film's huge opening indicated an inherent interest in the material, but fans obviously didn't enjoy what they were seeing.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's film was, to be fair, admirable in its scope and ambitions  it wasn't your typical comic book action film. But, at the end of the day, most audiences don't want two-and-a-half hour psychological explorations when they go to see a Hulk movie  they want big battle scenes and lots of bruising action, both of which the 2003 Hulk  for the most part  failed to deliver.<br/><br/>I count myself among the masses that disliked the 2003 film  not because I was a fan of the comics and not because I was disappointed in its treatment of the material; not even because I thought it was boring, necessarily. I simply thought in spite of its aim to be an intelligent movie, it was quite silly and pretentious  the end fight sequence was appalling, for example. It was a film containing moments of genius cornered by lots of unnecessary scenes and scenery chewing by Nick Nolte.<br/><br/>So, with this in mind, the ultimate question is: does the 2008 Hulk deliver on its promise to be bigger, bolder and better? Well, in short, yes  it's still not a great film by any means, and it has its fair share of flaws (most notably the last twenty minutes which, despite a cool battle sequence, go overboard in their destruction), but at the end of the day, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster with a cast that's probably a little better than it deserves.<br/><br/>Edward Norton would have been my last choice as Bruce Banner  not because I think he's bad for the role, but rather because he is such an unexpected choice. Renowned for his anti-mainstream approach to film-making and his artistic credibility, his placement in a comic book franchise sequel/reboot is puzzling to say the least  it would be like Christian Bale taking on a role in a Batman or Terminator movie (oh, wait).<br/><br/>The thing is: Norton delivers a solid performance. I'm not sure if it's better than what Eric Bana tried to achieve (I'd say Bana's performance is a bit more complex overall), but I think that's partly due to the film's length and also because it's so action-packed. For what it's worth, Norton tries his best to inject some humanity into the character; the whole Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde aspect is more prevalent here than in the 2003 film. In that movie, Bana's Banner admitted to enjoying the transformation into the Hulk; in 2008, Norton is struggling to conceal and control it.<br/><br/>William Hurt replaces Sam Elliot as General Ross, the man responsible for Bruce's predicament. The movie is essentially a cat-and-mouse game, with Banner hiding away in Brazil for over a year, until Ross finally discovers his location  prompting Bruce to flee back to North America in a last-ditch effort to find a cure for his ""disease."" He reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), and finds himself at odds with an overzealous combatant named Blonsky (played by Tim Roth), who eventually transforms into Abomination.<br/><br/>My problems with the film are most present in the latter half. The first 45 minutes is a lot of fun and is rather cleverly made  the fight scenes are engaging and Roth establishes his anti-hero villain. But suddenly halfway through the movie, Blonsky turns into an unmotivated cliché of a bad guy, and by the end of the film you lose all care and understanding for the character. Once he transforms into the Abomination and goes on a citywide rampage in search of an equal foe (in this case, the Hulk), his reasons are puzzling.<br/><br/>This is where the film truly falls apart, because suddenly General Ross is responsible for millions of dollars' worth of damage and civilian casualties (without spoiling any surprises, he is responsible for Blonsky's transformation), and he's flying around in an Army helicopter following the city's destruction, but nobody really seems to care. He never loses his job, even after he tears up a college campus in search of the Hulk earlier in the film. It may be pointless to criticize a comic book film for lapses in logic, but since the film strives for a sense of realism in its early scenes, the switch to excess halfway through is a bit disheartening. The 2003 Hulk had the same problems, incidentally  I'm wondering if it's a flaw of the comic book or just the character itself; perhaps it's too hard to retain realism when you've got a 12-foot giant green dude destroying everything in sight.<br/><br/>If I'm being too critical, it's only because I enjoyed the film and regretted these aspects. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining summer blockbuster -- and that's really all it needed to be."
"Rxblinkboy","8","321","502","8 June 2008"," A whole lot better than you think
","Honestly, as soon as I heard they were making another Hulk movie I was surprised. When I heard they had cast Ed Norton, I was shocked. So going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. Coming out, I feel like an idiot because it was really masterfully done. Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. If you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Far better than Ang Lee's attempt at the green man and as far as this year, it's definitely Marvel's year. No better way to make up for Spiderman 3 than releasing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk just a month apart. Thank you Marvel for cleaning the mess Spiderman 3 left and clearing your name. This film just makes me thing of one word...AVENGERS"

","I went into this completely blind. I wanted a pure 'experience' I saw ONE trailer prior to this screening and closed my eyes while humming. I had no idea if this was a second in the series or a re-make.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at the (obvious)complete makeover of our big green friend, and this was a (P.R.)change for him no doubt... this delightful romp will bring him right into the ""good guy fold"" so to speak, within the umbrella of the, ""Avengers"" Franchise that is now an inevitability.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, Lots of time on character development, and the intricacies that make you really care for a plot and its characters. I thought the acting was very well done although I found Liv Tyler to be the 'Weak Link'. Not sure she 'sold' her part that well or maybe it was just typecasting for that ""Armageddon"" girl. <br/><br/>The CGI was top shelf. There were no seriously 'over done' moments of ,""awww Come on"" uttered in the theater. In this packed theater there were many ovations for the cameo's and the ,""Bad guy gets it"" scenes, and even for the thrilling last minute of the movie. So where was Samuel L. Jackson?<br/><br/>Please enjoy this more Comic like and more faithful version of THE HULK!<br/><br/>*** PARENTS*** Go see it! Please do not bring kids under 5 yrs old! it is very realistic and violent. Be a good parent."
"rama-28","10","117","191","7 June 2008"," My review: THE INCREDIBLE HULK
","Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.<br/><br/>Let's just start with the acting, what a perfect cast ensemble. Edward Norton is a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana because Edward looks more convincing as a skinny nerd scientist. He embodies the pain and the struggle that his character has to go through. Always running, always hiding, always trying to come up with ways to get rid of the monster in him. William Hurt and Tim Roth have no problem being the bad guys, having played so many other bad guys in many other movies in the past. Tim Blake Nelson giving us hints that he'll become the next arch nemesis The Leader is pretty cool. Liv Tyler is so damn cute. That girl can melt your heart.<br/><br/>Now to the best part. The category that makes this movie a winner is its awesome CGI visual effects. Bravo to the brains behind this brilliant technological accomplishment. When Hulk breaks a cop car into half and uses each part as boxing globes, that's just plain badass! The images are so much better and more believable,.. the timing could not have been more right to revamp this character. The storyline helps us understand the characters and their development as they progress but it wastes no time at all on any boring moment.<br/><br/>Magnificent stuntwork as well, especially the chase scene in the small town in Brazil. The whole jumping from one roof to another at high speed with bodies bumping into walls or falling down from a considerable height. I have much respect for the stunt people who broke their bones daily for this movie.<br/><br/>The story has three main long action packed sequences and the last fight scene is just phenomenal. They weren't kidding when they said that it would last for 26 minutes. Hulk punches Abomination, Abomination, kicks Hulk, Hulk strangles Abomination, Abomination slams Hulk onto a couple of buildings.. Your inner kid will be happy.<br/><br/>All the elements of this movie have but one purpose only to entertain your senses to the fullest extent. Your sight and hearing will be treated with the utmost incredible experience of your lifetime. You will find yourself cheering at how great this movie is.<br/><br/>The cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, who plays Hulk in the old TV series are memorable. The plot also has some punch lines here and there that are silly funny but effective. I'm glad Lou Ferrigno got to voice the Hulk because I can't think of anyone else more perfect for the job. The movie even includes the main theme song from the old TV series starring the late Bill Bixby. What a heartfelt nostalgic tribute.<br/><br/>The teaser at the end when Tony Stark meets Gen. Thunderbolt Ross, that part is a show stopper. Director Louise Leterrier and his crew deserves a standing ovation for successfully making an excellent superhero movie which some people thought was going to be as bad as the first Hulk movie. Well, Louise has proved them wrong. Summer 2008 may quite possibly be the best summer movie season ever."
"YoSafBridge","7","94","152","16 June 2008"," Don't make me hungry...
","Three cheers for Marvel for finally realizing that no one knows their material better then themselves. May they never sell another beloved superhero to a lesser being again.<br/><br/>For the second time this summer Marvel has given us a superhero movie that just plain rocks. With the exact right amount of humour, character development and great action sequences, the Incredible Hulk is up there with Iron Man as one of my favourite films to be released so far in the summer movie season. While I didn't like it quite as much as Iron Man (Robert Downey WAS Tony Stark. Whereas something still doesn't sit right about Edward Norton as Bruce...) it was nevertheless a great, faithful adaptation of the comic books. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Possibly my favourite Stan Lee cameo yet.<br/><br/>There isn't really much else to say besides, go see it for yourselves. If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one.<br/><br/>8/10"
"cherold","5","22","31","12 September 2012"," At least it's not as bad as the Ang Lee version
","With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie.<br/><br/>Ed Norton doesn't really do much with the role. Yes, I know Ed Norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances, but he just doesn't do that here; Mark Rufallo's laconic Bruce Banner in the Avengers is far more interesting than Norton's here.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was just bored. Not so bored that I stopped watching, but consistently restless and never drawn in."
"DICK STEEL","9","140","235","12 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Incredible Hulk
","The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.<br/><br/>While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.<br/><br/>And it's not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as ""don't- make-me-angry-you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry"" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I'll leave that to you to find out.<br/><br/>But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang's version, we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did."
"femaleanimefan","9","294","514","8 June 2008"," Spit out the 2003 version of Hulk like a bad taste in your mouth! This is an exciting movie
","I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.<br/><br/>I also must say the cast is a lot better this time around. Edward Norton is far more convincing as Bruce Banner than Eric Bana was. Liv Tyler does a good job as Betty, Bruce's girlfriend, though I do like Jennifer Connelly a bit more. The supporting cast is also great, and they all deserve to at least be nominated for some awards. My favorite performance is tied between Norton and Tim Roth.<br/><br/>Now, to the special effects. Predictably, they are magnificent. With recent superhero movies, the effects are always brilliant, and they certainly adapted the Hulk character more closely to the original comics from what I've heard. The action scenes are cool and fun to watch, and fans of the comic books will be on the edge of their seat in excitement.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great movie that comic fans should enjoy, and even if you don't really read them, you'll still like the movie, as I did. While it's not my favorite superhero movie, it is a whole lot better than Ang Lee's version, and a fun time at the theater."
"springsunnywinter","10","212","366","9 June 2008"," Monstrously Entertaining
","By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's origin<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like ""Wow this movie looks cool"" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.<br/><br/>The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.<br/><br/>This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee's Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I'm glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright. Overall this movie is Incredible not an Abomination."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","40","62","20 February 2016"," Grading on a Bell Curve
","About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.<br/><br/>Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.<br/><br/>And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.<br/><br/>It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.<br/><br/>(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).<br/><br/>All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest."
"brando647","8","27","41","16 November 2008"," An Incredible Reboot
","I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.<br/><br/>One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.<br/><br/>In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).<br/><br/>It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was ""That's IT?!"". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours."
"schristian-6","Null","134","242","10 June 2008"," Almost Incredible
","I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else."

","History.
In the sixties, the company made tremendous progress, as it was during these times that such characters as Iron Man, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, X-Men and many other heroes were created who are still considered to be the main stars of the vast Universe Marvel.<br/><br/>Finished work on the first series of comics about the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee began to look for something completely new and different. Then Lee remembered that one day he really liked the movie ""Frankenstein"" (1931), then in the makeweight remembered another masterpiece - ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (also in 1931 the year of release).<br/><br/>Crossing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Frankenstein Stan Lee got the monster he needed: a terrible outside, good inside (which, moreover, could turn from a man into a monster and vice versa). Originally, Lee made the Hulk gray (he explains that the Hulk is a monster, he must frighten, and gray is a suitable color). But when the first edition was printed, it turned out that the shade changes from drawing to drawing. Therefore, it was decided to find a different color. Thinking about what color a superhero did not yet exist at that time, the thought came that no one had thought of making a character green, and Stan decided to ""Be to him Green!"". So the Hulk became as We know it today.<br/><br/>So, May 1962 was marked by the release of a new character from Lee Incredible Hulk and his ""second self"" - Doctor Bruce Banner ...
Actors and Heroes.
Edward Norton (Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Incredible Hulk) - I think that Norton has already come across such a split (meaning ""Fight Club"", whose main character suffers from a split personality and tries to get rid of his ""companion"" in the course of the film).<br/><br/>At first glance it may seem that the Hulk is a very primitive character, just an evil monster and nothing more. But everything turns out to be not so simple because there are remnants of human memories in his head (that's why he did not touch Batty and defended her). Part of the Hulk hates Bruce Banner, because for him he is only a miserable nonentity, while the Hulk is an invincible force and power. He constantly feels a split.<br/><br/>Probably this is the case when superpower is not a gift, but a curse. The tragic side is manifested when the Hulk again becomes Bruce, and sees the destruction that he did (in the film - this is the destruction of the laboratory at the time of the first transformation of Banner). Then his conscience and guilt tell him that this monster can not be released, and the Doctor consciously goes into exile. Edward Norton is a wonderful dramatic actor, his game conveys the feelings of a lost person: alienation, anguish and grief - the real Dr. Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler (Betty Ross) - like Norton, Liv had a similar role - Arwen (The Elf from the movie ""The Lord of the Rings""): the same deep feelings and the same ""forbidden love"", in general, everything is very sad. In Hulk, she plays a strong, and at the same time sincerely loving woman who is ready to fight for her happiness; she is the embodiment of true love. And the way Tyler transmits emotions is really beautiful. In the film, Liv Tyler treats the Hulk as Naomi Watts with King Kong; and the Hulk itself is very similar to Kong: calms down at the sight of his caring beloved, protects her from all the dangerous (and not thinking about his own self-preservation). What more can be said? God grant more such loving women.
Tim Roth (Emil Blonsky aka Abomination) - he plays Russian, who grew up in England and became a soldier (who, moreover, does not drink vodka and does not wear a hat with a fur hat!). He leads a group of professionals gathered to catch Bruce Banner. However, after the friend saw what the Hulk is, he immediately became fired with the desire ""I want the same!"".<br/><br/>During the film, Blonsky is injected with the serum of the super-soldier, after which he becomes very fast, strong and enduring. It seemed that he got what he wanted, but after the Green Giant had made a cutlet from him with one blow of his foot - Emil realized that he did not have enough, and he wants more (and eventually achieves it). And what is most surprising is not to take over the world and rule it (like most super villains); but in order to fight properly. If we talk about the actor - then Roth like his hero is very charismatic. The game is good, not fake. Tim in a beautiful form: in his 47 so quickly run and participate in battle scenes - is respected. In general, Tim Roth disproved the opinion of the Coen brothers and Cormac McCarthy; ""Old people"" here is the place!<br/><br/>Special Effects.
Special effects in the movie a lot. I will not talk about the visualization quality of the Hulk: now, with the modern development of computer graphics, there is simply no need to talk about it, especially with a company like Universal Pictures (which, in my opinion, always wins in quality, both computer graphics and special effects in whole).<br/><br/>If you care, you know: everything is fine, muscles are throbbing, hair is developing in the wind, drool from the mouth flying at crying, clothes are bursting; The Hulk runs, jumps and fights, as befits - really. The explosions themselves, the launch of cars and tractors into each other is done at 5+. All the laws of physics were observed: there will not be a Hulk like in the movie Enga Lee fly like a dandelion: he weighs decently for a mountain of muscles and generally a three-meter bald, so that he will fall swiftly and powerfully.<br/><br/>The battle of the two giants can not be called otherwise simply as a fierce fight, all the tools at hand are used: stones, bricks, cars (the Abomination still used people) - in general, everything is beautiful, beautiful, incredible!
The result.
""Incredible Hulk"" - the second film Marvel Studios. A wonderful cast, good special effects, great sound, not only could one enliven one of the best comics, but also create an incredible film! Adventures, love, hate, good, evil - everything comes into this movie! Sitting in the cinema, I noticed that the Hulk was looking into my eyes, then with a shout of ""Hulk Beat"" he ran up to me and hit ... on the spot"

","What a summer Marvel is having! Iron Man hitting big was great but Incredible Hulk may even top it. I caught a pre-screening and I can assure everyone that the Hulk delivers more action and maybe more fun. If you are concerned that this film is another Ang Lee type misfire, don't be. It's about 100 times better then the version of five years ago. Unlike the Ang Lee effort, it's presented in a way that can be savored. The pacing is perfect and the action is relentlessly awesome. What's amazing is that they managed to play both sides perfectly. It's far deeper then I would've thought given the subject matter. Each frame is packed with action, emotion, drama or intensity. I was expecting to see a crazy green giant destroying the landscape and fighting another crazy green monster for two hours. I was shocked at the complexity of this movie. Given Edward Norton's involvement, I don't know why I'm so surprised. The action is certainly there but the tone is perfect, a mix of the TV flavor with all the action from the comic books. Hulk does indeed ""smash"" but it's more then just dumb action with no plot. It truly is an all around exceptional film. Also, I'm amazed at how far the CGI came since the first teaser trailer. This remarkable CGI works very well and it offers the chance to savor a complete movie going experience without being pulled out of the film. This trimmed downed Hulk looks perfect and his opponent is truly frightening. The final battle between the two will go down in movie history as one of the greatest fights of all-time. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year, with the possible exception of Iron Man. Again, who would've thought that Marvel would be a perfect two for two this summer? <br/><br/>Speaking of Iron Man (*Beware SPOILER*) <br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) does indeed show up at the end of the film(they cut from Banner and that green eyed smile we've all seen in the TV ads right to the Stark scene and the hairs on your neck will stand up)"

The thinking man's King Kong on a self-help quest? They just can't help but fall back on the same clichés and feeble structure with good ol' time-warps to fast-track to the climatic fight scene -and prep it up for the sequel before rolling the credits.

","After a five year absence from the big screen, Hulk is back with more punches and kicks to throw around than a thinking brain which would hurt more movie goers than cramming for a high school exam.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I love Ang Lee's version of the ticked off monster in which it took its time getting to know the characters before getting to the action sequences along with seeing how experiments could have consequences. Plus the cut scenes which resembled a comic book had it's high marks though it can only please those who truly love the atmosphere of comic books. This time around French director Louis Leterrier brings more anger while managing to bring depth to the lost soul of Bruce Banner (Edward Norton).<br/><br/>""The Incredible Hulk"" is a reboot of the first movie (note: a third Hulk is in the works) in which it pays homage to the classic 1970's series with Edward Norton (taking over Eric Bana) playing the title character after a failed experiment left him to turn into the Hulk while hurting the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler taking over the Jennifer Connelly role) and becoming a fugitive as he hides in Brazil working in a soda factory. It's not long when Betty's father, the indestructible General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt taking over for Sam Elliot), finds a report that an elderly man has drinking a piece of gamma radiation and immediately finds the location of Bruce where the general gets a British/Russian import soldier by the name of Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help track down Bruce.<br/><br/>The action doesn't take much long before Bruce is bullied by a few thugs which leads him to turn into the Hulk smashing and throwing his enemies before going after the secret military. Bruce is now on the run as he wants to head back into the states to find the love of his life along with seeking a cure for his disease while Blonsky convinces his boss to give him the same radiation that made Bruce into the monster he is and having a one on one action.<br/><br/>With the film under two hours, The Incredible Hulk is great entertainment and a way of apologizing to those who hated the first Hulk movie in which those who seek mile-a-minute thrill rides will be pleased. The film's got everything from a wild battles, wit humor and while the performances are not Oscar-memorable, I really cared for Norton as the title character where he wanted to rid his curse while remembering from 2003's Hulk that Eric Bana's version actually liked being angry. Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt are good as well along with Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Sterns.<br/><br/>A note to all comic book historians or lovers, make sure to check out for Avenger references along with the last scene in the film when a certain character makes a cameo appearance."

"Critomaton","1","50","98","13 July 2008"," Hulk Bore! Again!
","Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br/><br/>Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br/><br/>But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.<br/><br/>Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.<br/><br/>OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.<br/><br/>Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's ""failure"". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br/><br/>This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).<br/><br/>It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. <br/><br/>It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film."

I lucked out that I just so happened to take her to a movie that featured Portuguese (EN sub-titles on & off for about 10 minutes or so) but as it turns out she claimed to like it more than Iron Man (which I admit, I might have been a bit more partial to).<br/><br/>Basic plot, good acting (on Norton's part), great special effects, and while I may have been more partial to Iron Man, the battles featured here cannot be compared.<br/><br/>Keep 'em coming Marvel - great job!!"

The difference between this movie and better ones is that it does not have a forced joke every minute and a half like later ones. The reason that it has lower average rating is also because back then no Marvel fanboys existed. It is reviewed by pure movie and comic book fans.

","Some people say, that the first try of a new Hulk Version from 2003 was too much intellectual driven, which gave the film a too complex story and emotional background to believe in and not enough room for action.<br/><br/>In fact this new Version of the Hulk theme could not even keep up with the first one in any possible discipline. It lacks nearly anything, except a slightly better CGI. The cast was really promising, but the whole story is totally empty and lacks of any surprises at all. The whole intention of a movie with a believable plot supported by actors and good directing is simply not used in this one.<br/><br/>You can easily skip the middle 70 minutes of the film, because everything is so obvious to happen. Compared to the storyline of the first one this new version lacks of any depth and drama. It's like being told a story with a 10 point plan what is going to happen now and then and finally the good spirit wins.<br/><br/>So, what is good in this new version? Nothing at all. There is even no real humor noticeable, no emotional ups and lows, and we will never know why Tim Roth did all this silly stuff. I did not like the first one too much at the time i saw it, but in comparison to this new one it's a quite good movie after all.<br/><br/>I don't know where the good screenwriters are gone in Hollywood.

","The Incredible Hulk is a tough character to adapt and I really think any filmmaker would have trouble making a good film version of the green guy. When a comic book film is adapted to the big screen the movie goer wants a story to balance the action and in this movie we have no story. The entire film is a special effects extravaganza wrapped in between pieces of bad dialouge and characterization. Creating an effective Bruce Banner is key to making any Hulk adaptation work and it hasn't been done yet. The original Incredible Hulk series that is beloved by so many plays like a melodramatic continuation of Adam West's Batman series, and Ang Lee's Hulk, which I feel is still the best adaptation of the story, tried to add too much dramatic substance.<br/><br/>Norton structures the story as a fugitive film where the Hulk is constantly on the run from Ross and his endless search. Ross enlists the help of Emil Blonsky, a skilled agent from the British Marines to help him find the Hulk. Blonsky eventually becomes a super villain which leads to one of the most painfully fake looking CGI battles ever seen.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is it's script but the acting isn't good enough to salvage it. Edward Norton doesn't really give me a reason to pity him or feel bad about his condition. Sure he says he is haunted by the prospect of the Hulk hurting people but I didn't get any sense of those emotions in Norton's performance. I don't know what went on because Norton is a very talented actor. I sense he tried to underplay this role. On the other hand William Hurt looks like he wanted to overplay the role and he gives the worst performance of his career as General Thunderbolt Ross. I honestly thought he looked silly in the Ross wardrobe and make-up. Hurt overplays this role and his performance is silly. Liv Tyler is a beauty but her methods of soothing the CGI beast look forced and unreal.<br/><br/>Tim Roth is the exception, he is terrific as the villainous Blonsky. He gets too little screen time in my opinion because the way the super soldier injections drive him mad could have made him a more effective villain if he were given more screen time. Roth is underrated actor and he uses the most of his screen time. His dialogue is bad too but he has terrific presence with it. When he bulks up himself the build-up is disappointingly taken away by bad effects and terrible video game dialogue but the performance is still very good.<br/><br/>The action scenes are somewhat interesting and they are well imagined but I just felt that they could have done more with the human aspects of the character or at least have him battle more than just the military.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk ends the same way it began, Bruce Banner is on the run and I am still waiting Hollywood to produce a decent adaptation of this character"

","This film simply breaks all the rules of storytelling. The characters are empty, the plot-line is empty and the makers must have been on holiday and allowed a primary school to manage the project. Maybe the whole thing is a Louis Leterrier joke on the stupidity of humanity - for dignifying this by forcing us to comment on this piece of garbage.<br/><br/>The shots of the Favela in Brazil are the high point. If you have a Blu-Ray player that shows this shot in its glory, then you can have enjoyed that, take your copy with your tail between your legs to a store where they will give you 'pre-owned' money for it. This is the most favourable outcome for the victims of the 'Incredible Hulk'.<br/><br/>As someone who knows a bit about CGI, I can say that creating these characters without any reference to the immutable laws of physics that govern our universe is lamentable stupidity. I cannot go on. I am utterly disgusted. Please let this be the worst ever. Do not test us with new precedents film makers."

","This one definitely belongs on Failblog.<br/><br/>I seem to have the diametrically opposite opinion as some other commenters in here, in that where Ang Lee succeeded in actually creating characters for us to like, no such attempt is made in this movie, and thus we couldn't care less about the white, black, green and yellow characters on screen.<br/><br/>Apparently, the team here decided to totally ignore the previous installment of Hulk, both by changing the title from Hulk 2 to The Incredible Hulk, and by ignoring the story that precedes this installment. So, basically, we're starting from scratch. Let's see.<br/><br/>""We must explain how the characters know each other, why they're supposedly in love, why they hate, etc., let's get that over with during the opening credits."" Fail.<br/><br/>""If we cut the fundings for CGI effects, we'll have more money for marketing!"" Fail.<br/><br/>""'Wroooarrara roowowoaraaa Wrrraaaahh' makes for good dialogue."" Fail.<br/><br/>""The Hulk smashes things, so the point of the story must be to smash things."" Fail.<br/><br/>And this last point is exactly why Ang Lee got it right. I can understand if some people who left their trailers and Oprah on the television would find it hard to have to endure in excess of an hour being fed plot and character construction before the Hulk finally gets around to throwing around tanks and soldiers, but that's exactly what's needed to makes an over-sized angry Apache-smashing green guy become recognizable and worthy of empathy, and not just become a joke worthy of laughs. Which is what happens in this second Hulk movie.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's Hulk worked because of this, Spider-Man works because of this, Iron Man to some degree also, but this? This? This is just awful. You hate the characters on screen, each and every one of them, because they didn't earn your caring. I find myself commenting on Tyler's ""Nooo!""s with, ""Why don't you just shut up?!"", and The Hulk's ""Hulk smash!"" with, ""We knooow, why not try something else instead?"" I'm sorry, but bad CGI and smashing stuff, including the army firing miniguns from choppers at residential buildings in downtown Manhattan (what's that about?) just doesn't make a good movie.

Emil Blonsky, the arrogant soldier working for General Ross, is trying to get his hands on the power of the Hulk, while Bruce is trying to get rid of it. It is great story for anyone. See this movie. It completed me."
"ghostofmrpalmer","1","41","86","14 June 2008"," I'm trying to be fair... but it's hard
","OK, let me start off with a confession, I do not like Edward Norton. I do not like him as an actor, and I do not like him as a person. I believe he is the product of all the worst aspects of the misused and misunderstood practice of method acting, and I think he's an egomaniac and a terrible ""Film maker"", see ""American History X"" for what I mean. So lets get to ""The Hulk"". This film was of course going to be compared to Ang Lee's commercial and critical failure ""Hulk"". I myself did not like ""Hulk"", but I have to admit that it had more to do with the writing and the story than with the actors and film makers. ""Hulk"" actually had some original ideas in how to present the mythology of a comic book on film. The cast i felt in that movie was actually good, they just had a crap story to work with. ""Hulk"" was really an overwrought soap opera between the title character and his father, which to be fair in 80's the comic did explore Banner's relationship with his father and it explained his anger issues.<br/><br/>Now we come to the new film ""The Incredible Hulk"", he we have a story less melodramatic, but somehow even more hollow and lacking in any intelligent subtlety. Edward Norton can not write. let me put it this way, as a writer Norton is a great actor, and as an actor, Norton is a great paralegal (please someone get that joke). Much was made about Norton writing a draft for the film to give the character more depth, but its not there. Also, Norton has made a huge deal out of not promoting the film as he feels its poorly made, the editing in particular. On that we can agree, but I have no doubt in my mind he could only make it worse. With ""American History X"" the director found it unbearable to work with Norton and left. Norton than re-edited the film, and gave himself more screen time and took the focus of the story from the white power movement and it's complexity and frightening aspects, to his acting abilities. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is edited perfectly naturally and well, so all Norton could do is add more footage of himself, and less of the actual Hulk. There are no opportunities to do and dialectic Eisenstien editing in Hulk, or and Bressonian elliptical editing, its just not that kind of movie.<br/><br/>I understand not every film needs to be ""Au hasard balthazar"" or ""The 400 Blows"", but even the summer blockbusters can be smart and entertaining, but ""The Incredible Hulk"" is neither. Unfortunately I believe most people don't care how crappy a movie is, just that is has lots of CGI and explosions, and they'll be happy. I on the other hand will be making better use of my time watching Willam Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" on DVD, or ""Mon Oncle Antoine"" when it comes out on CC."

","Action without story is boring.<br/><br/>A film with a bad script is boring, it can even be painful and anger-inducing...;-) A film with mostly good actors in it (good in other films..!!) that of course cannot save the film, as the script is so baaaaaaaaad!!! I like Ed Norton and I liked him in this, little as there was...<br/><br/>I rejoiced at seeing Bill Bixby, Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, nice touch for fans, of course not important for the film.<br/><br/>Chase scene through favela - watch City of God. Though at that point I was still interested, nice cinematography, okay plot.<br/><br/>Then they shoot the dog - bad move in my book, I'm annoyed.<br/><br/>Then they chase Bruce in the factory....and chase....and chase...oops, I thought - you're losing me!! THEN they don't really show the Hulk - what, like we don't know that Bruce turns into him? Like, trying to make it more exciting, he's like Alien on the spaceship? At that point I started to be bored.<br/><br/>Sadly, nothing much interesting happened after that. In fact, totally dim-witted things happened after that. Tim Roth: Military man with long hair. William Hurt (whom I adore!): Almost more stupid than that military guy in Avatar. Liv Tyler: Unconvincing, looking over-concerned and distressed or soppy.<br/><br/>The most intelligent pieces of dialogue were the computer chats...;-))) Why don't they talk about the last five years AT ALL? Oh, he's there, oh, I'm shocked and happy, oh, you come with me. But we only chitchat.<br/><br/>Too much military for me. Mostly quickly coming out of bushes exactly when needed, sadly totally useless...oh my...<br/><br/>No, this was not for me. I had thought this really might be about how Bruce learns to harness his powers, but that is only hinted at. The scene in the lab is just stupid.<br/><br/>3 points because I really like Ed.

","This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.<br/><br/>The story has Bruce in Brazil working at some strange soda plant or something. Looks like Mt. Dew, but has some funky name. Well, a slight accident leads to some of his blood getting into a bottle and this is how the military and General Ross track him down. Bruce is in chats with a man dubbed Mr. Blue in the hopes of finding a cure; however, he must find more data for Mr. Blue to create a cure. A crack team of soldiers try to track down Banner and he avoids them for a while, but soon turns into the Hulk, leading one of the soldiers, Emil Blonsky, wanted another crack at the beast. He is soon infused with super soldier serum and does quite admiral in dodging the Hulk, but it is still not enough. He craves the power the Hulk haves and soon this desire will create an abomination! <br/><br/>The film is pretty good, but could have been better. The scenes with the Hulk are by far the highlights and better than any of the Hulk scenes in the 2003 film with the incredible expanding Hulk. That being said, I did not like the fact they tied Banner turning into Hulk with his heart rate as it is solely tied to his anger. The film also did not portray the Hulk becoming stronger the angrier he got and the fight with Abomination should have showcased this. In the comics, Hulk is stronger than Abomination because of the increase as he gets angry. Abomination though is a better fighter as he is more agile and that is why he gives the Hulk a good fight, not because he is stronger. The reason the Hulk wins is because he keeps getting stronger, not because he is a better tactical fighter.<br/><br/>So, in the end, this film was more enjoyable than the Ang Lee film. That film was just strange in many ways as it played out in comic panels which suggests a fun film, but was so serious with virtually not humor that it was just a strange concoction. This one had some good action, but was not a perfect film. Hurt is the only actor from this film to be seen in a later Marvel universe film as he appeared in Captain America: Civil War. Most things from this film were pretty much scrapped though as the Leader looked to be coming, Abomination was still alive and various other things. Abomination was supposedly going to be in the second Avengers film and that would have been great as I felt Ultron was not enough, but they decided against it which sucked as something other than the exact same robot would have been cool. In the end, this film is kind of part of the Marvel universe and kind of not."
"griffolyon12","10","14","25","15 June 2008"," The Most Incredible Movie of the Summer so Far!!!
","I am not going to lie, I really was not that excited for this film when it was first announced, simply because the last time the Hulk made it to the big screen it was such a disappointment. Ang Lee's Hulk film from 2003 was a poor adaptation of one of my favorite comic book heroes. I have always loved the comics, but felt that the film didn't do the character justice, where as this new Hulk film, which is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, finally took advantage of the Hulk franchise and delivers an adaptation that is both truthful to the comics and entertaining at the same time.<br/><br/>Within the Incredible Hulk, we get a story that is more in keeping with that of the original comics from the '60s, and it also has a lot in kin with the T.V. Show from the '70s as well. The story begins in Brazil where we meet Dr. Bruce Banner, who has already been infected by the Gamma Rays which make him become the Hulk when he becomes angry. Here in Brazil, Banner is trying to discover a formula to cure him of his big green menace, as well he is undergoing treatment sessions to try and understand a way to control his anger. Banner is currently marked as a fugitive from the United States, and is constantly hunted by the military. All of this is familiar territory to anyone who liked the old television series, or the original comics. Of course the story really doesn't punch into high gear until Banner must return to the U.S. in order to meet a scientist who claims he can help Bruce to possibly find a cure for his problem. Once Bruce returns to his home country, he reunites with his love interest Betty Ross, and together the two try to thwart the ever persistent government and get to New York to meet the scientist who wishes to help Banner.<br/><br/>I will be very truthful here, this is my favorite film of the summer so far, and in retrospect it might just very well be my favorite film of the year thus far. As a fan of the comic I am a little bit biased, as I always am with comic book movies, but this one really is a great film. Now this film is by no means going to be an Oscar contender next year, except maybe for Special Effects, but it is by far the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time. What this film delivers is a Hulk film with tons of action and explosions, that has a terrific story to go along with it, but it also is able to finally deliver audiences a Hulk story that allows the Hulk to be a hero, and not just a guy who destroys stuff when he gets angry.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, the story is terrific, with a terrific script that obviously benefited with Edward Norton's help, especially when it comes to the tight dialogue. As well the directing by Louis Leterrier was really great for this particular type of popcorn movie, successfully delivering both the great action of the story and the more intimate dramatic sequences to the audience. Then the acting was really superb as well, in particular Edward Norton as Banner and Liv Tyler as Betty, both of whom clearly have real chemistry and work really well together on screen. After that it is just a role call of well executed production values, nothing was really that weak; but the one other production value that truly stands out is the Special Effects. The CGI is some of the best that I have seen in a long time, it would definitely be a shame if this film doesn't receive an Oscar nod for it Effects.<br/><br/>Overall the Incredible Hulk is an amazing film that definitely lives up to its Incredible title. The action is amazing, each action sequence among some of the best I have seen in a while; in particular the final fight scene between the Hulk and the Abomination, which has gone down in my books as one of the finest superhero vs. super villain fights in movie history, and the fight literally, I am not exaggerating, goes on for close to 10-15 minutes. After seeing it I can see why many critics don't like it for it focusing more on action and spectacle than its 2003 predecessor, but what it does deliver is a crowd pleasing Hulk film that is sure to please both audiences and die hard comic book fans alike. I can not wait for a sequel, I am definitely hoping it makes enough money at the box office to allow it.<br/><br/>I give the Incredible Hulk an Incredible 10 out of 10!"
"drqshadow-reviews","2","17","32","11 September 2011"," Questionable Re-Reboot is a Hulk-Sized Leap Backwards
","There ought to be a law for relaunches of a franchise less than five years after the last attempt: every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being even worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a functional story. Knocking out the Hulk's fabled origin story during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce Banner never comes off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk, and actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brains. That effectively kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that should be fueling the story. Both characters are mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors - this blew up in Marvel's face."
"Rahwaj","3","11","19","28 July 2008"," Incredibly Mediocre
","Let's just cut to the chase.<br/><br/>Starting with the good: Paying tribute and giving the nod to Lou Ferrigno (playing the security guard and the voice of the Hulk), and to Bill Bixby. They even threw in the ""Lonely Man"" theme from the T.V. show. Seeing them go that far, why not the Incredible Hulk theme when he makes his first appearance. Maybe it would have been a little corny, but why not throw it in for the fans? Also, I think that the design of the Hulk was also good, although I did like that design of the Hulk from the 2003 version as well. More on that later.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: Liv Tyler being one. I hardly found her performance believable. They threw some thick rimmed glasses on her and now she's instantly a scientist? Half the movie, her mouth is hanging open, and I'm thinking to my self, ""Close your damn mouth!"" Jennifer Connelly was much better in the role of Betty Ross.<br/><br/>William Hurt does a decent job as ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, but the character was turned from a guy who loves his daughter and the military into a guy only interested in acquiring a new weapon for the military. At least in the 2003 version, we knew that he cared about his daughter. In this version, he has a superficial interest in his daughter while barely giving her a pass for defying him.<br/><br/>And what's with the pulse monitor? I found this to be a silly concept. Banner can't tell when he's getting angry or frustrated? I don't think you need a heart rate monitor to detect your moods. I also found it to be completely stupid that Banner couldn't be intimate with Betty. So on top of fear, anger, pain and frustration, we can add having sex to the list of things that will make Banner turn into the Hulk? Since when did getting some become a reason for Banner to Hulk out? I could understand if it were frustration from E.D., but the idea of Banner Hulking out just from being sexually excited is something that should have been forgotten.<br/><br/>I wouldn't normally make this complaint, but because so many people were critical of the CGI in the first one but not this one, I had to say something. While the design of the Hulk was impressive, they fell way short in bringing the Hulk to life. The color never seemed to match that of the real characters. It was always just off. The CGI seemed to be more appropriate for one of the new generation video game systems. If the first incarnation of the Hulk was ""Shrek like"", then I would have to say that this version was Gumby like. The skin had no realistic texture. It looked like plastic, whereas the 2003 Hulk had realistic blemishes and pores. Even the movements were more mechanical this time around. It looked like bad animation. The muscles didn't seem to move quite right. They even got rain wrong in this one. How do you mess up CGI rain? The cave scene was painfully bad, as neither the Hulk or the water (rain) looked realistic at all. I don't know why ILM wasn't on this one, but it seems that the decision was made to completely divorce this attempt from anything that anything to do with Ang Lee's Hulk. A big mistake as Rhythm & Hues is a few steps behind ILM.<br/><br/>As a fan of the comic book, I'm disappointed with the display of the Hulks strength in this one. Compare the ""Hulk Smash"" scene to the one in the 2003 version. In The Incredible Hulk, he puts a crack in the roof of a building, while in the Hulk (2003), he destroyed half a city block. In this version, the Hulk comes off more like a bully around the ""lesser"" opponents. He was so tough when he was dealing solely the army. When Abomination makes his way to the screen, the Hulk becomes less then enthused after taking a few shots. Of course the Abomination is stronger than the Hulk is INITIALLY, but as the fight continued the Hulk got his butt whipped all over the screen. The more shots he took, the more he looked like he wanted no part of the Abomination. Any fan of the comic should be able to tell you that the physical aggravation of the Hulk will only make him angrier and stronger, not turn him into a whimpering puppy dog. This is something that the 2003 version was able to convey. The more he was bothered, the angrier he became. He had to be allowed to calm down before anything could be done to control the situation. And how does the ""epic"" battle come to an end? The Hulk is barely able to muster enough strength to choke out the Abominationwith a chain. Yes folks, a chain. These two characters rip through cars, tanks, and buildings, but the Abomination gets choked out with a chain. That's like a fully able bodied man being strangled with a string of tissue paper. Truly, a disappointing and anti-climactic ending to a mediocre 2nd attempt to bring the not so jolly green giant to the big screen. I would have to say that The Incredible Hulk is this comparable to last year's Transformers. More action with little substance."

","After the 2003 angst ridden Hulk things took a change for a better with this more thrill laden movie. Ed (in the only time he played the role sadly) Norton plays Bruce Banner on the run from William Hurt's General Ross who is seeking to extract the blood that will give him super soldiers. Bruce turns to his old girlfriend (and Ross's daughter) Betty played by Liv Tyler. The General then brings in Emil (Tim Roth) Blonsky a British special forces operative who after his first confrontation with Banner's alter ego starts his own path to a transformation into a monster. The Incredible Hulk is full with amazing action scenes such as a chase through Rio and the final fight between Banner and Blonsky in their alter egos. This one fun ride of a movie."
"Bruce722","9","5","7","26 May 2013"," Very well done!
","Though I'm not a big fan of Edward Norton he does a great job in this movie. It's darker and more emotional and dramatic than most superhero movies and I think that fits in well with the Bruce Banner tragic story. Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend ""Stanley"" being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic. That fight is being hyped up the entire film and I just didn't think it was that great. Nonetheless, this was an outstanding movie and most people would enjoy it."
"xlars","9","8","13","2 November 2008"," Good picture - with interesting philosophical worm-cans
","Compared to Ang Lee's version of the 'Hulk'  this version is far, far better. The story is superlatively better  and of course, no matter how good Eric Bana is as an actor, Edward Norton  is better to the extreme.<br/><br/>The plot is better too, though I will not say much about it.<br/><br/>About Tim Roth's unnamed monster  it must be said that it had a certain potential to be improved. Something uncertain was missing  to say the least.<br/><br/>One thing that makes everything worth seeing the film  is the interesting philosophical discussion opened when General Thaddeus Ross first  at an early stage of the movie  says: «As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the U.S. army» and somewhat later, after Bruce Banner has been treated by Dr. Samuel Sterns: «If you've taken it from me, I'm going to put you in a home for the rest of your life.» The can of worms opened here, is the general understanding that man is not his own master (not delving into any religious conceptions here), but the notion that the ""state"" as such can own a human being.<br/><br/>That is of course not in any case true. A man is and remains his own master, with his own free will, and can not be sold  in the same way that a man cannot sell his soul to the devil  because it is not a saleable commodity.<br/><br/>This even remains a vital part of the American Declaration of Independence, quoted in the following: «We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED,  That WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS, PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM, IT IS THEIR RIGHT, IT IS THEIR DUTY, TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT, and to provide new Guards for their future security».<br/><br/>Since the views presented by General Ross absolutely belongs under the characterization of ""despotism"", I'd just as well wish, this would have been stated clearly  in the movie, as an explicit answer to the theories of General Thaddeus Ross"

The Incredible Hulk was just as good as Ironman, but in very different ways. I liked Ironman because of the clever mix of humor, action, and peril, however there wasn't much deep emotion or character development. The Incredible Hulk substitutes the humor for emotion, thus resulting in a great movie. <br/><br/>Great movie, lots of action, and a great performance by norton.<br/><br/>One more thing, I'm tired of the bitching about the CGI.

"Robert_duder","9","13","24","23 June 2008"," Completely obliterates Ang Lee's mistake and makes it right in a big way!!
","I am going to re-watch Ang Lee's Hulk generally considered disastrous by fans so I can review it properly but I seem to remember it being pretty awful and in no way an homage to the monstrous hero that fans love. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan by any means but I love the hero movie and they needed to redeem Hulk and The Incredible Hulk redeemed him and then some. This was the true Hulk film that fans would have wanted and now we can firmly pretend HULK never existed. Relatively new director Louis Leterrier takes the helm and makes Ang Lee look like an amateur and clearly Leterrier must be a Hulk fan or at least turned to enormous Hulk fans because this had everything. The film paid huge homage to the original 70's/80's series which I think is just incredible. It used the music from the original series on one or two occasions, Edward Norton seemed to really channel and pay respect to Bill Bixby's Banner character and his transformation definitely leaned towards that. Terrific cameos from Stan Lee (as always), the original Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno in a terrific and funny cameo that felt like a hand over of the Hulk reigns (although it was only coffee), Robert Downey Jr., and mentions of Stark Industries (Iron Man), the Super Soldier program (Captain America) and other terrific Easter Eggs.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is an amazing actor although he's slipped from high profile in the last few years. He really channels the fugitive scientist looking for a cure part really well and does an amazing job. He's such a non-assuming almost mousy character which is far more like Bill Bixby's Banner than Eric Bana's character in the original Hulk film. Norton is ideal in the role although he may not return in future installments. Liv Tyler is Betsy Ross, Banner's love interest. This is her second summer flick and decisively better performance than The Strangers (although it was a great scare flick.) She gives a better all around performance and has great chemistry with Norton although she is still whiny at times. Tim Roth is a terrific villain, completely on part with other Hero villains that were great. Although his true villainous performance is CGI he still does a great job setting up the character. William Hurt who is a seasoned and often talented character actor does an okay job as General Ross. There is just something missing from the performance. He doesn't seem to have his heart in it and yet he could do very well and is a decent nemesis to Norton's Banner.<br/><br/>Many ask what is better Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. I mean Iron Man really told a great story and established the character whereas The Incredible Hulk took the liberty of summarizing the establishment of the character in the opening credits but mostly assumed we all know how it all began and puts you right into the action. The story in The Incredible Hulk is simplistic and it's all about two hours of The Hulk smashing stuff and that is wicked cool. I just about giggled and clapped when the Hulk actually exclaims ""HULK SMASH"" in one of his rage filled riots. The Incredible Hulk is the perfect summer blockbuster and is already racing to the top of the charts which is good because it is a worthy super hero action flick that anyone should see. Forget the disaster of HULK and go see this because his redemption is super sweet!! 9/10"

","I have to admit I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this pathetic B-movie disaster just pales in comparison to Lee's film. To begin with, the plot (if it can be called that) is so shallow and full of holes that it's embarrassing to see respectable actors like Edward Norton and Tim Roth involved with this mess. An American military airplane heading towards Rio? Brazil is not Iraq. It would have been put down by the Brazilian Air Force in a minute. A vehicle with half a dozen armed guys in a Brazilian favela? The local drug bosses would have gladly used them as target practice. And the cream of the crop, a ""for export"" bottled juice factory INSIDE a favela? This will become the joke of the year in Brazil. As to the reviewer from Singapore who wrote ""(...)the crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro(...)"" - for mercy's sake, get a clue and your geography right before writing this kind of nonsense. The scenes take place in a FAVELA, which are poor, isolated parts of the city, not the city itself.<br/><br/>There are far FEWER action sequences than on Lee's film, and what there is is so pointless, badly executed and less exciting that the average popcorn eater above 6 years of age will be bored to death. Any self respecting fan of the Hulk comic books will rate this abomination of a movie as low as possible.

"richard-wilkinson-2","10","12","22","18 June 2008"," Amazing, fantastic, wonderful film!
","There just aren't enough superlatives to describe the 2008 Incredible Hulk film. So I will try to break it down piece by piece : <br/><br/>The casting of Edward Norton as Hulk/Bruce Banner was a curious one that stunned fans around the world, but trust me - he is perfect for the role. Norton plays Banner to a tee, giving the perfect representation of the awkward scientist - quiet, self-sacrificing, nervous and full of heart. From the first glimpse of Norton's eyes turning green the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end - the Hulk looks more like the comic book version than the Ang Lee one did. He appears smaller height-wise, but still massively proportioned. The musical score for the film reminded me of a cross between Batman and Spiderman. Epic scores for the action set pieces and dramatic scenes, and toning it down into dulcet, breathtaking pieces for the emotional parts giving the film the perfect balance between action and emotion. Liv Tyler is strong as Elizabeth Ross and gives the impression that she is ready to do anything for the man she loves regardless of his nature and appearance. William Hurt as Thunderbolt Ross was also a very good selection - he plays the part with a mean streak, leaving the viewer unsure of what to think of him. A special word must go out to Tim Roth as Blonsky/Abomination who gives a sterling performance of a man gone power mad. The Abomination itself is a fantastic creature - everything the Hulk is without possibly that small amount of self control. Finally, I need to give kudos to the last few scenes, the one with Tony Stark - who utters the words that make those hairs stand up again ""we'r putting together a group"" (Avengers :)) and the final scene with Norton staring at the camera meditating - then his eyes turn green and he smirks. This gives the impression that he can now control his power and could possibly lead Hulk to be the central antagonist in the Avengers film in 2011. All in all, 10 out of 10 for this tremendous comic book representation, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again and again."

","My Take: Flawed but modestly entertaining, and compared to the previous HULK opus, a little better.<br/><br/>Among the others, I was disappointed by Ang Lee's HULK. I have no problem with a more character-driven superhero/comic book movie, but in the expense of deepening the character's persona, it lacks the good ol' comic book action fans have grown to love. Louis Leterrier's reboot/semi-sequel THE INCREDIBLE HULK makes up for that. It's still a flawed experience, with some scenes that still pad out the better bits, but in terms of pure big-screen comic book experience, it's an improvement, albeit not a vast one.<br/><br/>In case you actually liked the Ang Lee version, Leterrier and writers Zak Penn (and Edward Norton, who made an uncredited re-write on his character) doesn't really forget the events of the first movie, but still makes sure everyone else keeps up with a new and different story. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is now in hiding, still in search for a cure for his ""sickness"" with the help of an unseen contributor. Meanwhile, Gen. Ross (William Hurt) is still in search of our monster-transforming fugitive, this time with the help of a bloodthirsty assassin (Tim Roth) who is proves his more than a match for our hero (and we learn later, more than a match for the Hulk as well).<br/><br/>Unlike Lee's artsy version, Leterrier isn't afraid to push through with the action for most of the time, even if his direction of the dramatic scenes are just as slow-moving as Lee's. The still-developing romance between Buce and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) just doesn't spark. Norton, a fine actor who does a good job in deepening the character, just lacks the charisma of even a doomed comic book character, while Tyler just doesn't add anything to the role. Hurt and Roth actually add some actual depth to the proceedings. While it won't compare to the Iron Men and Dark Knights of the same year, Leterrier does deliver the ""Hulk Smash"" fans expect, if very little else.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

","'The Incredible Hulk' sort of takes of where Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ends. It's not an exact sequel as a few events are changed but arguably it serves well enough as a continuation. This one succeeds in parts where Ang Lee's film failed. Leterrier's direction works for an action film as it's got all the required ingredients. It's a lot slicker and full of action. The pacing is comparatively well set. The special effects are an improvement (but the CGI is still very prominent). The camera-work is solid and the score is wild. The story isn't as effective as say this year's 'Iron Man' because the characters aren't well fleshed out and the dialogues are a bit clichéd. Edward Norton fits the role of Bruce Banner quite well but we don't see much of him because of the CGI hulk. Eric Bana wasn't a bad choice for Ang Lee's Hulk either so I wouldn't compare the two actors. Actually, the Bruce Banner in Ang Lee's version was better fleshed out and gave Bana more scope to perform. Liv Tyler, however, is a little too weepy and she shouts a lot. Clearly Connelly was the better choice. Tim Roth and William Hurt are adequate. Overall, this is an enjoyable action flick even though it's no 'Iron Man'."
"SonicStuart","10","11","20","17 September 2008"," This Totally Makes Up For That Terrible 2003 Movie
","The Incredible Hulk<br/><br/>Starring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson and Tim Roth including a special appearance by Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller<br/><br/>Rated PG-13<br/><br/>I hated the 2003 Hulk movie, but I'm glad that this movie turned out better and made up for it and not to mention Edward Norton gets to play the title role and you can't go wrong with Edward Norton. Plus this movie got a chance to start the series over again from the right foot considering this movie is a reboot but yet a loose sequel. So basically, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding out in Brazil trying to control his anger and finding a cure to get rid of his inner beast while General Ross (William Hurt) is still trying to capture him and trying to stop Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) as he goes out of control and becomes Abomination. I liked it how this movie decided to take only a few minutes of the movie to show us how Bruce Banner became The Incredible Hulk unlike that 03 movie that took an hour to explain how Bruce became The Incredible Hulk. I also liked how they put in a lot of chase scenes in this movie like the chase scene in Brazil made it look like ""The Bourne Identity"". Plus the fight scenes were good too and they made a good choice to choose a villain that's more of The Hulk's size and strength. Edward Norton also did a good job writing this movie too, he never fails to do a good movie, I hope he does another Incredible Hulk movie or at least make an appearance in ""The Avengers"" movie. Not to also mention that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets to make a special appearance. Overall this movie was totally better and made up for the damage that Ang Lee did."

","What on earth do we have to put up with these days, a huge budget feature where the script was written with as much finesse as the hulk himself would, if you gave him a piece of a4 paper and a kids crayon! The set up from the previous film was played in the opening credits and then we had to endure laborious romantic interludes with some science thrown in, in between some predictable action scenes. This film could have been cut down to 28mins and would have still seemed floppy. Even the CGI was poor, Ray Harryhousen did better with some old left over plasticine!! As a point in fact look at the scene in the cave, they don't even line up the Hulk and his love interests hands properly, when they go into yet another romantic interlude.<br/><br/>Overall this was a terrible film even on the scale of Spiderman 3 terrible.

","Horrible, horrible, horrible I can't believe how miscast this movie is. What was Ed Norton thinking when he signed up for this? Okay, it's a remake. If you saw the first hulk, you don't need to see this one. Feel free to avoid this one. And feel happy that you did.<br/><br/>Couldn't they have found a shorter Special Forces guy to fight poor Ed? LOL. As an SF veteran myself, I can tell you that we all weren't 8 feet tall, but I was short at 5'10''. Tim Roth looks like a hobbit standing next to William Hurt. And why does Tim Roth, the super soldier, have a freaking beard and long hair? With all of us coming back from the Middle East, couldn't they have found any veterans to square this douche bag away? I mean come on, give one of the PTSD guys a few hundred bucks for god's sake William Hurt should NOT, I repeat, NOT play Army officers. He looks asleep as he is delivering his lines. His hair is too long and his mustache is past the edge of his mouth  the gas masks can't seal of you have hair past you lips.<br/><br/>There are some who would defend this junk. To them I say, ""Taxi scene, researcher scene, lines delivered by the super soldier, Tim Roth"" The only shining moment in this piece of crap is the cameo by Lou Ferrigno. Great to see you Lou.

","Hulk is a very interesting character. One with a Prometheus fate that could destroy a whole city in a few minutes in a brutal and fierce rage. The one you will see in this movie ? Well... he loves to run in dark places (you know, places where we can't see him very well), yell a lot, stay quietly in love with an ex-girlfriend, yell a lot, break some glasses and, Ô surprise, yell a lot and take the time to kick the ass of the bad guy, surprisingly more bigger and ugly than Hulk. The other surprise of this movie is that the bad guy won't even try to kick Hulk's ex-girlfriend ...huh ... wait ... wrong, he obviously tried it of course, with Hulk aaaaaaaaall the way yelling at him ! (remember, Hulk yells a lot). Thanks to Edward Norton, there is some things to save from this film, as well as most of the (few) FX present in this movie. Nevertheless, there is still a possibility that you enjoy the movie. I think."
"Mihnea_aka_Pitbull","5","26","58","9 June 2008"," Decent enough
","***** This comment might contain spoilers! *****<br/><br/>One thing is certain: the thriller parts - mainly the beginning, and all the scenes where Hulk doesn't appear - are well enough done. The Brazilian slums are shot with true visual feeling, and the chase through their maze is definitely the best scene in the movie. Leterrier does have narrative skills and cinematographic style - I really hope he will move away off the comic strips blockbusters and start making true content movies.<br/><br/>Also, the characters are well built and developed. Surprisingly, Norton makes a good job out of Bruce Banner, helping us to forget the shapeless blunder from ""The Illusionist"". Very good is also Tim Roth in Blonsky - expressive and compelling. But my favorite was Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns - he has humor and depth, outlining with true talent the future evolution of The Leader.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the worst side of the movie is Hulk himself - together with the Abomination (a REAL abomination, not just in name!) and with most of the special effects. Hulk is totally false and unconvincing, his movements are stiff and unnatural, and the proportions and texture, preposterous - can you believe that, although a C.G.I., he looks as if made of rubber and papier-mâché? Many of the most interesting features of the C.S. character were lost on the way (for instance, his habit of always talking in the third person, and his despise towards Dr. Banner, his normal alter-ego). The final battle is childishly anticlimactic, with useless quotes of King Kong and devoid of any resourcefulness. Do not expect any bright trick used by Hulk to win the day - there is none. They simply beat each other stupid, until the Abomination falls down - for no reason at all, even more so as it was supposed to be much stronger than Hulk! Personally, I would delete ALL the C.G.I. scenes and re-organize the movie as a paranoid thriller, around the plot of Bruce Banner being chased by the special forces. THAT is the real point here."

","I had a great chance to see The Incredible Hulk yesterday and I wasn't expecting much, after the total flop that was The Hulk in 2003, I wasn't too sure that this was a good idea. Now, granted, Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of all time, he is just terrific and has such a wide range of characters. Seeing him for the first time in a super hero movie was going to be interesting. But from the trailer, this looked once again like it was going to be over the top and not really entertaining. However The Incredible Hulk was actually... incredible! It was highly entertaining, the CGI was a thousand times more believable than the 2003 movie, the actors were great, and it pays great homages to the TV show and comic book for the fans. The Incredible Hulk does have small flaws, but the story keeps you interested and Edward Nortn couldn't have been a more perfect choice as The Hulk.<br/><br/>Bruce did a new experiment that made him into the hulk, causing every angry reaction he has turning him into a green nine foot monster that is virtually indestructible. But he has run off to South America until he can find a cure for this ""desease"" and be with the love of his life, Betty. But when the FBI surrounds him, he heads back to America with the promise of a cure from his friend, Dr. Blue. But as soon as he heads back, an army experiment gone evil with Blonsky turns him into an evil hulk and Bruce must face him off.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a great summer movie and I highly recommend it. The story can be a little slow at times, but I thought the effects and acting was just fantastic. I really loved watching The Indcredible Hulk, this is a summer block buster that I have been waiting for, I know a lot of people are rooting for Iron Man, but I feel like The Incredilbe Hulk is in a class of it's own. Edward Norton and Tim Roth were great on screen and had a real presence. Tim was so frightening, he was awesome and his villain couldn't have been more on key. I highly recommend The Incredible Hulk, this was a great movie that I'm sure any one could just have a blast with.<br/><br/>9/10"
"krycek19","1","17","36","30 June 2008"," Almost as bad as Ang Lees version
","Again it is beyond me, how poor taste in movies the users of IMDb, truly has. <br/><br/>I did'nt like this movie very much. Maybe because I think The Hulk is probably the dumbest superhero ever made. A man that turns into a 10 feet tall green monster with an iq smaller than Homer Simpsons, whenever he gets angry. Its completely ridiculous. I hated the 2003 version and the only reason I wanted to see this was because of Edward Norton. I've always considered him one of the greatest actors of his generation. Unfortunately that does'nt show in this movie. Because Norton has so little to work with. He does'nt have many lines as Bruce Banner. Whenever he is not replaced by the cgi-Hulk, he is on the run. It's a very physical role and its disappointing, because it makes it hard to care about him. <br/><br/>Tim Roths character is annoying and stupid and his motivation for hating Banner/Hulk is never explained. He just seems like a psychopath hellbent on killing Banner/Hulk. The general is frigging annoying too and his lack of compassion for Banner gives him almost no credibility at all. <br/><br/>There are only two good things about this movie: the effects and the gorgeous Liv Tyler. And speaking of her, they even managed to ruin what could have been a love making scene with nudity from Tyler, because Banner can't even get sexily aroused without turning into The brain-dead Hulk. <br/><br/>Some Marvel comics are just too dumb to be made into movies. The fantastic four is one of them, Hulk is another one."

","I'm not sure what it is about Marvel comics that turns their movies into unsuccessful films. There's some profound consistency in the approach. It clearly originates in a specific concept of what the essence of comic books are about so what matters in translating to the screen.<br/><br/>My theory is that Marvel had a fan base in the 60s and 70s (when the form we see was established). The fans and artists reinforced a style which was more spefically rooted in the comic books of the 30s before comics became essentially cinematic.<br/><br/>I'm talking about superhero books here. DC was the first to become exclusively cinematic and the first to market that to TeeVee and Movies, which in this context are equivalent.<br/><br/>It's precisely the uncinematic nature of Marvel that made them successful as books. The design of the panels is profoundly static. The postures and even the builds (which are the main defining characteristics here) are not derived from any stage. The physical humanness is deliberately removed so that the characters and stories can be more abstractly pure.<br/><br/>It's the same crowd that is producing these movies. Unlike, say the Batman series where artists are given great freedom, this production shop controls the approach tightly. That's probably good for the brand, but it makes for pretty tepid movies. Oh, these can be as loud and colorful as the next guy's. But they will never have the power over the soul that  yes  the comics have.<br/><br/>And gosh, if Liv Tyler's job is to just look appealing, why would they photograph her so poorly?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I can't help but say that I liked this version better than ""Hulk""! It stuck really close to the comic book. I liked ""Hulk"" but it strayed a bit and they didn't stick to the personalities and physiques of the characters. In ""Hulk"" Eric Bana portrayed Bruce, and although his acting was impeccable, he was wrong for the part. Bruce and the Hulk are supposed to be complete opposites. But Eric Bana doesn't look the part of a potential ""science-nerd"". He almost looks like Hulk. Now, in The Incredible Hulk"", Edward Norton played the part very well. He has the ability to look like a geek which would be hulks opposite. The graphics in the movie are brilliant. And of course the ending opens the door to the next chapter.

","THE INCREDIBLE HULK on the other hand takes a hamfisted James Bond route. It somehow creates a sprawling adventure mess that takes us through a tired string of horribly cliché scenes from a Brazilian favela all the way to Broadway. As a result the only way this revamped HULK can sustain our interest is by staging bigger, louder and more CGI laden action scenes - by the time the Broadway showdown was in full swing I simply couldn't care less. As if the stock characters and stock dialogue weren't enough (we even get the stock zany NYC cab driver, a NYC establishing shot all by himself - where have I seen that before?!!), we have to further suffer through Liv Tyler's idea of acting - her mere presence on screen instantly makes a scene bland. In fact I wager that you could intercut a shot of Liv Tyler within every classic scene in the history of cinema and those scenes would be ruined beyond all recognition. Any attempts at humour or romance fall flat on their face, she has NO chemistry whatsoever with Ed Norton who in turn is in full paycheck mode. HULK is everything the superhero movies I saw as a kid were - exercises in shattered glass, broken walls and loud explosions. Beyond that the void.

"roddickrocker21","9","6","10","22 July 2008"," Take out Zak Penn and you'd have a brilliant film
","This has been a summer of superhero flicks. Ironman, Hancock, Incredible Hulk, The Dark Knight and Hellboy II have all topped the box office and all in all, none of them were really bad (I have yet to see Hellboy, though). The Incredible Hulk is no exception.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk starts off with about a five minute background story during opening credits, just to quickly tell the origin of the character. If you don't already know, Bruce Banner was experimenting with radiation, he gets exposed, and now whenever he gets angry (or excited) he turns into this big green monster known as the Hulk.<br/><br/>If you compare this reboot to its 2003 predecessor, you'll be able to clearly see the good things this film did. Ed Norton, playing Bruce Banner, is a great actor, and he puts on a great performance. The film is also extremely well paced; you should never get bored, because the action scenes (about 3 big ones) are so well balanced and spread out. Liv Tyler, playing Banner's love interest Betty Ross, does an alright job but it doesn't really take away from the movie. I'll just say that the whole beginning of the movie, where Bruce Banner is on the run from U.S. forces and trying to find a cure for his problem, is probably the best part, but the movie stays pretty decent throughout.<br/><br/>The worst aspect of the film is likely the dialouge. The was (mostly) written by Zak Penn, known for the last two X-Men movies and Behind Enemy Lines. I'm not going to say he's a terrible writer, but he's got a lot to learn about dialouge. Particularity during fight scenes; characters constantly exchanging silly taunts that take away from the action. The Hulk talks, and it sounds god awful.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is very much worth watching. Great visual effects, including the coolest helicopter crash I've seen in awhile on film, good acting and great story progression. If you're looking for a very good action and superhero film, this is it."
"dee.reid","9","6","10","1 July 2008"," Green means ""go"" - This ""Hulk"" was indeed, ""Incredible""
","""The Incredible Hulk.""<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I'm one of the few who liked (""liked"" is italicized) Ang Lee's 2003 film version ""Hulk,"" which saw the first major screen adaptation of the famed Marvel Comics character co-created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1962. Lee co-created a number of characters for Marvel Comics that defied traditional superheroes before them who were perfect and idealized, and instead were flawed and imperfect, and had much more dramatic potential than any other comic book superheroes at that time.<br/><br/>Of course the Incredible Hulk has severe anger-management issues, which has set him apart from his Marvel Comics superhero brethren; Bruce Banner (played here superbly by Edward Norton, although I do miss Eric Bana) is a genius, but sensitive and emotionally withdrawn physicist who is exposed to a lethal dose of gamma radiation and that while showing no outward physical damage to his body, forces him to transform into the monstrous green brute the Hulk when enraged - ""don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry/Hulk Smash!"" - giving rise to a Marvel Comics version of a Jekyll/Hyde relationship.<br/><br/>This character first saw light in Ang Lee's film five years ago, but that film was much-maligned by many fans of the comics and critics. I'm proud to say that I wasn't on the ""hate 'Hulk'"" bandwagon in '03. But now, Lee is gone. Replacing him is an entirely new cast and crew that draws much of its inspiration in ""The Incredible Hulk"" directly from the Marvel Comics Stan Lee/Jack Kirby source material. Like ""Iron Man,"" this film marks the second time Marvel is calling all the shots on a movie production.<br/><br/>In the director's seat this time, is the French Louis Leterrier, who directed martial arts sensation Jet Li in the utterly spectacular ""Unleashed"" in 2005. To their credit, Norton and Leterrier have sold their film well to this eager movie-going public. While I'll admit that Lee's 2003 film had many faults, it was not entirely unwatchable, and was brilliantly acted and directed and really explored the many troubled layers of its troubled protagonist Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Like many superhero films of late, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a sequel/reboot of Lee's earlier film - replacing the entire cast and crew of the first movie - and takes place five years afterward: Banner is on the run in South America, and is now a day-laborer at a bottling plant in Brazil. On the run from the U.S. military and General Ross (William Hurt) and having to leave behind his beloved Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) - General Ross's daughter - Banner spends his days trying to rid himself of his curse, meditating, and desperately e-mailing an anonymous American scientist back home information about his condition.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, General Ross is stepping up his efforts to capture Banner at all costs and use his blood to create an army of super-soldiers. To this end, he's hired a Russian-born mercenary named Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help him. When a confrontation between Banner and Blonsky's men forces Banner to reveal his Big Green alter-ego, that's when Blonsky takes it upon himself to be ready for round-two. Ross has Blonsky injected with an experimental super-soldier serum to be able to fight the Hulk on his terms next time the two meet face to face. But Blonsky craves more power, and eventually is able to get hold of Banner's gamma radiation-contaminated blood to transform himself into Abomination, and then get ready for a mutant-powered, Japanese monster movie-style CGI showdown in Harlem.<br/><br/>""The Incredible Hulk"" does the incredible and is a massively superior second installment to a franchise that up until its release this year seemed to be at a stalemate. Maybe the reason I was not so disappointed with ""Hulk"" in 2003 is because I'm not a reader of The Incredible Hulk comics (those who have read my reviews of superhero movies know that Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero). But Leterrier and his crew have sealed the deal here. Leterrier has made ""The Incredible Hulk"" the cinematic equivalent of a well-oiled machine: a masterful, well-paced, and action-packed superhero film that doesn't play dumb to its characters or audience. This is not your typical comic book superhero film: it's dark, it's thematic, and it's much more intense in its action and special effects. Speaking of special effects, this CGI Hulk (voiced by '70s television Hulk Lou Ferrigno, who also shares a cameo credit as a security guard), is much more streamlined and fluid and three-dimensional, a true force to be reckoned with this time out. Norton is the film's emotional centerpiece. He proves to be an unlikely but certainly trustworthy Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>What I liked especially about this film was its emotional content. It's clear that Bruce Banner and his CGI alter-ego Hulk have anger management issues. He's cursed. He has some of the worst luck of any superhero in the entire Marvel Comics Universe. Don't make him angry, because, you wouldn't like him when he's angry. Because of that, he's his own worst enemy. Of all superheroes out there saving the world, he's always trying to get rid of his ""gift"" (or curse), and failing miserably every time. (Who said that superheroes had to be perfect, all the time?) There are a number of well-acted moments between Norton and Tyler, as they both try to rekindle a doomed love affair that makes up the film's emotional core. I haven't been drawn into one such love affair since ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), my favorite superhero film of all time and my #2 favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>This movie isn't perfect, of course. It has many attributes that make it much stronger than ""Hulk."" The cast could from that film could have been reused here, but it's Hollywood; they always win. Still, ""The Incredible Hulk"" does the ""incredible"" and then some.<br/><br/>9/10"

","HULK SMASH! Yes, the Incredible Hulk does utter those lines in this newer, updated version of the comic-book superhero movie. He does the Thunder Clap, uses two halves of a squad car as boxing gloves and does not fly for miles. The studio has spent a lot of money, hired an A-list star cast, got a famous director and even distanced itself from Ang Lee's critically-panned outing five years ago. Edward Norton re-wrote the script and Marvel has made sure the movie is littered with direct references from the Hulk comics and the Marvel universe that fan-boys will geek over. Yet, this movie misses the target quite spectacularly. It suffers from the same problem that X3 did  the movie just does not come together due to extremely poor execution and hence seems mediocre at best.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) hiding away in a Brazilian town doing small jobs while researching for a cure. In the next tedious 100 minutes, we see Banner/Hulk returning to USA, fighting the US army, reuniting with Betty Ross, and facing & triumphing over arch-nemesis (a grayish, spiny, talkative Abomination).<br/><br/>Now you hardly expect Ed Norton to go wrong, especially when he's writing as well, but this has to be the vainest attempt by the actor yet. Bruce Banner's portrayal fails because his green monster brings never brings any sense of threat to his scientist. We see him suffer without clothes, money and shelter but we never really see him suffer under the weight of guilt or responsibility for the force of destruction within him. This not only makes the Hulk that less effective, but his oft-repeated roar and mayhem seems superficial. A bimbo Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and reluctant semi-pacifist Gen. T Ross (William Hurt) don't help matters much. Tim Roth (pre-mutation) comes as a huge saving grace though. His Russian-born, British-schooled operative Emil Blonsky may just be the one of the best supervillain characters yet. Without much of a backstory, and with absolutely no insight into his psyche, he still makes the vile and single-minded Blonsky a formidable opponent  one that I cheered for! Yet, the bad CGI and campy dialogues bring any momentary expectations crashing down. (It has one of *the* worst dialogues this year: ""You're making me hungry you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry""!!) It comes as no surprise though that the deathmatch finale is all mind-pollution. The numerous plot-holes and the unforgivable sin of using Hulk for comic relief just plunges the standards of this movie lower.<br/><br/>One thing though  with Ironman and now with Incredible Hulk, Marvel studios has hit the perfect formula to close these movies. Even if the movie is bitter or bland, you finish with a touch of excitement.<br/><br/>My rating --> 2 of 5 p.s.: The movie can't help but make references to Ang Lee's movie through out its running  the starting notes of the theme music, the opening scene, the dialogues (""he has managed to stay unseen for five years"", HULK released in 2003). IMHO, I think it is about time the world revisited HULK, and give it its due."

Plus he is a good actor, which adds to the role of such a movie, where you are not supposed to take it seriously.<br/><br/>As with Iron Man, the protagonist is a remarkable actor, although in Iron Man the action was lame, the story repetitive, the usual boring happy ending and overall the only thing worth mentioning about it is the performance.<br/><br/>What we have here is a movie with good pace, interesting characters and exciting action (FINALLY). Liv Tyler was OK. Norton great. CGI awesome.<br/><br/>WHAT STANDS OUT IS THE ACTION. You can feel every blow!<br/><br/>Hopefully, the DVD release will contain the uncut version of 136 minutes which means 22 minutes plus, adding more depth to the characters and do justice!..<br/><br/>GIVE US MORE MAYHEM!!! We need movies like that..<br/><br/>8/10"

","At first, I wondered why they were releasing this ""adaptation"" so quickly after the Ang Lee version. I hadn't recovered from that disappointment and didn't have much confidence the new movie would get it right, either. It was specially daunting, coming right behind ""Ironman"", but there some intriguing variables, most importantly, the fact that Edward Norton was playing our doomed scientist. Finally, I must admit that the new ""Hulk"" is everything a film of this genre should be: exciting, interesting, very nice to look, showing a range of emotions, and most importantly, it leaves you hoping there is a sequel really soon! The excitement never lets up in this one. From the introduction of the ""hulk"" when the original experiment goes awry. Later on, other pieces come together, and we understand how each of the participants contributed to the tragic transformation of our hero. It is the trademark of a good screenwriter than he is able to create multidimensional characters, without relying too much on narration or extended dialog pieces. Most of the information is delivered visually, through montages, and a couple of lines placed at the right moment in key scenes to recall past events. Some of the film is even told in a foreign language, and it doesn't seem to matter because it completes that particular chapter and adds truth to the scene.<br/><br/>In addition to being exciting, the film is a pleasure to watch, as we follow our hero through his odyssey from Brazil to Guatemala and back to the states. Great camera work adds plenty of mood to each scene. The director and cinematographer have seamless added special effects to a beautifully shot movie. Gone were my reservations about the look of the ""monster"" in the first film. This time, the new hulk is able to project his emotions without calling much attention to the FX. The Hulk is actually capable of showing a range of emotions ranging from desperation to anger, and it touches us.<br/><br/>It is also refreshing to see a love story in the middle of this action fantasy film. It gives every character a much need dimension that is usually missing from this type of adventures. The lovely Liv Tyler has amazing chemistry with Norton and fully supports the main character as he moves through his adventures.<br/><br/>And let's not forget that final scene... if i was craving a sequel from its opening scene, I couldn't restrain myself from gasping when I saw the guest star who shows up at the last minute to exchange a few words with the William Hurt character. I'm dying to see what happens next."

","I hated the first Hulk effort with a passion. The franchise had bags of potential and it was never realised, even though the style was visually impressive the film had no substance. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were well cast but their characters were a bit two dimensional. All the other characters were poor.<br/><br/>Thank heavens for take two. The focus was taken from the origins of the Hulk and more on the aftermath, which then takes the focus from the Hulk and onto Bruce Banner, which was the smartest move the director made, and there is no better actor for portraying the humanity of a character than Edward Norton. When I first saw that he was in the role I was excited at the prospect of the new dimension he would bring to Banner, and he is successful in so many ways. His portrayal, William Hurt's portrayal of The General and Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of Samuel Sterns had so much depth that it was a joy to watch them all on screen. Liv Tyler did an admirable and surprising job of surpassing Jennifer Connelly, who was one of the better performers in the first attempt. Tim Roth was somewhat below par as the main baddie, but he did the job expected of him with gusto.<br/><br/>In terms of visual effects, its pretty much whats expected of a superhero film. The major difference from the first attempt at Hulk is the departure from the comic-book visual style. The effects are much darker, and the Hulk looks much more menacing than he did before. The tributes to the old incarnations of Hulk are well done, with the ""You won't like me when I'm angry"" speech nicely referenced, and there is a neat cameo from Lou Ferignio, who provides this Hulk's voice.<br/><br/>I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It realised all the potential that the franchise has and does almost everything right. This and Iron Man have set the bar for superhero movies and bringing them together in the Avengers film will surely be a winner."

","Back in 2003, filmmaker Ang Lee released ""Hulk,"" the hugely budgeted adaptation of the Marvel comic book series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Starring Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connelly as his true love Betty Ross, the film was considered a box- office disappointment and mainstream audiences complained that the picture was too slow, ponderous and heady for their liking. Having just watched 'The Incredible Hulk' and then re- watched ""Hulk"", the 2003 film now comes off as an astoundingly misunderstood achievement a complex, multilayered, visually extravagant, and ultimately quite moving operatic tragedy that transcends the norm of the genre. If all viewers really wanted was just a big, dumb, by- the-numbers action flick, then their wishes have been granted with ""The Incredible Hulk,"" a creatively dull reinvisioning that pretends ""Hulk"" never existed.<br/><br/>Following an opening credit sequence explaining the backstory of how cellular biologist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) was involved in a genetic accident that left him with the unstoppable ability to transform into a nine-foot-tall, green-skinned superhuman whenever his heart rate and rage level were raised, the plot proper picks up five years later, with Bruce in hiding in Brazil. As the hulk, he was responsible for multiple deaths and mass destruction, and General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt)father of Bruce's now-estranged girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler)has made it his life's mission to find and destroy him. When Bruce's whereabouts are finally located, he once again must go on the run, secretly returning to the U.S. in the hopes that the data he has collected will be enough to reverse his infection. With a reunited Betty once again by his side, they head for New York City to visit a scientist who may be able to help them. Hot on their trail is not only General Ross, but also cutthroat British soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), himself now injected with a strain of the same dangerous serum.<br/><br/>Because ""Hulk"" is only five years old, it is virtually impossible not to compare it to ""The Incredible Hulk,"" particularly since the unwise decision was made to start the series over from scratch. ""Hulk,"" as directed by Ang Lee, was rich in character work, narrative depth and a provocative subtlety that spoke louder than any words or explosions could have. At the same time, it was also gorgeous to look at, complete with comic book-inspired aesthetics and an overall sense of wonder and poeticism. ""The Incredible Hulk,"" helmed by Louis Leterrier (2005's ""Unleashed""), hasn't any of those characteristics. The film is grittier, to be sure, but it is also emotionally wooden and visually forgettable, a CGI-heavy grab for the attention of teenage boys that has no concern for finding an identity of its own.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Zak Penn (2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"") is unimaginative and the story that is woven feels unnecessary, with little forward momentum taking place and none of the characters really growing any through the course of the running time. The special effects used to bring the Hulk to life are pretty good, and detail in body musculature and facial expressions are strong, but he really doesn't have much to do once the transformation occurs. The film lacks scope; the underwhelming action set-pieces have all been given away by the trailers and television ads, and they are all suffocating in their onslaught of CGI and dreary camera-work. The climactic battle on the streets of New York City between the Hulk and a now-monstrous Blonsky reminds of a poor-man's ""Cloverfield,"" especially ironic since ""Cloverfield"" was made for a fraction of the budget that ""The Incredible Hulk"" had at its disposal. Watching two giant creatures face off, both whom are one step away from being invincible, just isn't very interesting, and director Louis Leterrier is additionally unsuccessful in bringing a grandeur to the proceedings or a rooting interest in how things turn out. Like 2007's ""Transformers,"" it's just a lot of mindless chaos and freneticism lacking a heart or soul. <br/><br/>Edward Norton (2006's ""The Illusionist"") is a committed and passionate actor well-equipped to tackle the role of Bruce Banner, but the finished product does him no favours. It has been extensively documented in the press that Norton was battling the studio for final cut of the moviehe apparently had edited a 135-minute version that he much preferred to the 113- minute cut being releasedand all evidence points to him being valid in his opinions. As it is now, the film is dumbed-down and deficient in personality. As love interest Betty Ross, Liv Tyler (2008's ""The Strangers"") shows a fiery flair in her reading of a character whose relationship with her father is strained and whose love for Bruce is the only thing to tame his out-of-control alter-ego. That Betty drops her current boyfriend (Ty Burrell) the second Bruce shows up without so much as a good-bye, however, seems awfully insensitive.<br/><br/>""The Incredible Hulk"" has a few effective scenes, such as a touching one between Bruce and Betty in a cave and a very funny one that makes a succinct comment on New York City cab drivers. What is so disappointing about the film, though, is how much of a lesser experience it is than ""Hulk."" From its uninspired writing to its plodding character interplay to its stock action to its horribly cheesy ""Hulk Smash"" moment, the picture is mundane, predictable and empty. The title oversells the output. ""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't incredible at all. In fact, he's discouragingly ordinary.<br/><br/>The only high point came right at the end where a cameo appearance from Tony Stark (Iron man) propositions general Ross in regards of putting a 'team' together. So I guess in the coming summers we'll be sure to have a ""Captain America"" and maybe a 'Thor' film building to an ""Avengers"" movie. It put a smile on my face until I realised just how disappointing ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" have been."

","It's a bad sign when you hear members of the audience groan! But its not hard to figure out why! This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but if the filmmakers were honest they would have marketed The Incredible Hulk strictly as a child/young teen flick, instead.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One thing is for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!<br/><br/>I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!<br/><br/>Memo to Hollywood: I know your going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make you next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, the last Superman film or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much? There are adults who like a good story just as much as you (Hollywood) like to make a ton of money!"

","Realism gets thrown out the window completely. I wasted $7.50 and 2 hours of my life. I can only hope this cancer known as a bad movie does not infect other movies, unfortunately Iron Man could be in trouble. I am still trying to figure out why Bruce was so afraid of a few drops of blood getting out, when he openly did heavy spit-swapping with the scientist chick. I think her name was Betty. I don't care. I feel infected with the Incredible Hulk. The Hulk was bad 5 years ago, and some things haven't changed in 5 years. And why does the Hulk always scream like he's Mufasa in the Lion King. The Hulk is a green beast, not a roaring lion. Save yourself while you can. This movie made me angry. And you wouldn't like me when I'm angry."

","The movie starts to basically fall apart after the initial 15-35 minutes and never quite recovers. The concept, and the initial storyline were rather promising, but they are never quite built upon, and the focus is, instead, on mind-numbingly dull, repetitive special effects that are neither aesthetically pleasing nor that revolutionary in terms of technical wizardry. The whole movie is basically about the hulk- running away from a military that acts as if it owns the planet, roaring loudly, and smashing things. Its yet another generic mindless action movie targeted at 12-15 yr olds; and indeed, if I was a twelve year-old I'd be in love with this movie..trouble is I ain't twelve years-old, and neither were my fellow cine-goers, who were laughing throughout the overdone action sequences and positively jeering by the end. the only redeeming quality about this movie is Edward Norton's performance, William Hurt is moderately tolerable, and everyone else, especially Liv Tyler, are wasted. besides, its 30 minutes too long. Conclusion: watchable, but barely so."

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Before i go into my review, i must comment on the hulk film that came before.<br/><br/>Ang lee made a beautiful film, all the players involved were great. The desert battle was the highlight of that piece and the cinematography was beautiful. Ubfortuneatly An Lee made a movie with the hulk in it, not a hulk film The orgin was too complex and over drawn and the whole scientific approach to explain the hulk didn't really make sense. Plus the hulk looked more like a giant green man (although in some scenes he was pure hulk).Over all it wasn't the hulk i wanted to see.<br/><br/>Now , The incredible hulk on the other hand IS a hulk film and a very good one at that . Right off the bat we are introduced to everyone to all the characters in the story ( with a nice nod to the TV series) . Gone is the 45 minute explanation of how Bruce is the hulk and we are thrown right into his life as he is desperately trying to rid himself of his ill tempered alter ego. We are also introduced to the hulk right at the beginning of the film ( which was one of my fav scenes i n the film) After the first hulk out, Bruce banner ( ed Norton) heads off to find Betty Ross ( played wonderfully by live Tyler) to try and find a cure his anger issues.<br/><br/>The story moves at a great pace with little bits of humor thrown in the mix ( the purple pants bit was classic). The special effects are as promised a lot darker and this time out the hulk looks more like a real monster. Wilam hurt's general Ross and Tim Roth's Emil blonskey make great villains ( the later being the best of them). The inclusion of Samuel sterns provides a great setup for the inevitable sequel. Marvel got Right this for sure ....so what doesn't work? The final battle between Hulk and the abomination could have been a little longer. There were some scenes that moved a little too slow but these are just minor issues. Of course the part that made me smile the most was the delivery of the most famous words the hulk has ever spoken HILK SMASH! which comes in at good time .<br/><br/>With iron man under their belt and the hulk being a great compliment, marvel is really getting their act together... all leading up to the moment we fans have been waiting for ( spoilers alert) AVENGERS ASSMEBLE! i almost forgot the last sense marvels man of iron steps in to delight us with the surprises to come en spoilers i gave this film an8 out of 10 , good job by everyone evolved HULK SMASH!"

","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the run from the authorities after conducting an experiment to himself to become a rampaging green yet gentle brute called Hulk (Voiced by Lou Ferrigno) and has hidden away in Brazil to be alone where he won't cause accidents and searches for a cure. However, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is as he sends out his soldiers to take him alive so they can conduct experiments to make super soldiers. As Banner returns to the U.S., he is reunited with his love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) but unleashes his rage on some soldiers but Betty is the only one that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with some of the same gamma that made the Hulk to transform himself into a hideous beast called The Abomination whom starts a rampage in New York City, only Banner with his inner-monster must stop it.<br/><br/>Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee effort which wasn't too bad but could have been better as this one was an improvement. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton made a film that is more true to the comics and the 1977 classic TV show, the special effects are a vast improvement with the Hulk looking more realistic and less cartoonish this time. The action is non-stop and there's also some emotion as well as it makes the viewer relate to the characters, look for appearances by Stan Lee with Lou Ferragino and Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark.<br/><br/>Nice to see Marvel is getting back on track with their movies and this with ""Iron Man"" are a prime example, this is a must see experience."
"svetlastoyanova","10","5","8","18 June 2008"," Incredibly MARVELlous
","This movie is incredible. I was a fan to the comics and the animated series first, but that thing transferred onto the big screen is absolutely amazing.Far better than the first time around,anyway. I have never thought that Edward Norton would be perfect for that role, but he is.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner is just a young idealistic scientist in love with the general's daughter. He is so shy and polite and really unnoticeable, if you don't look for him you wouldn't even know he is there. Those big blue eyes and charming smile are absolutely irresistible until... he gets angry. Then there is mayhem- he is enormous, he is green, he is loud, the angrier he is the stronger he gets, he is incredible, meet Bruce's alter ego-Hulk.<br/><br/>They couldn't be more opposite, which makes the whole transformation more unreal, yet believable. They have one thing in common though- Dr Elisabeth Ross. The gorgeous Lyv Tyler is absolutely outstanding. I don't think she needs to try very hard for that performance, her eyes just say it all, it comes so natural for her. The relationship between her and Bruce is depicted in such a high school manner; it is so adorable, so innocent. She is his university sweetheart. When his big green secret comes out she is the only one Hulk recognises and listens to. Her wellbeing is his primal instinct. In the final fight you could see Bruce creeping his way into Hulk's head, the fight has turned pointless for him, until Beth's life was in danger again.<br/><br/>Tim Roth is spot on the shrewd military mercenary Emil Blonsky. His greed for power and a little biological help from General Ross turns him into a ruthless monster Abomination that only Hulk can manage. The fight between them two is literally epic, the CGI effects are spectacular and the destruction is ultimate.<br/><br/>The director Louis Leterrier has done quite a good job giving us all the details on the story of Hulk's creation, yet leaving the unimportant bits out, which keeps the plot neat and easy to follow. There is a fair share of emotional torments and colossal battle sequences, not a minute of boredom. And by the end of it, there is definitely going to be a sequel, I bet Stark Enterprises will sponsor that one too. This movie is a must see this summer. You will enjoy every bit of it."

","The Incredible Hulk is positively jam packed full of action and excitement. It contains impressive CGI visuals, a malevolent & power hungry adversary and scenes which will have you on the edge of your seat. But unfortunately this is not enough.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a film which isn't terribly diverse. It seems to only switch between the fugitive lifestyle of the protagonist & some sort of conflict; where he is being either being pursued, or engaged in a fight whilst in Hulk form. It didn't seem to branch out enough from a linear form, nor did the pace of the film crescendo.<br/><br/>The acting however is well done. Edward Norton plays the worn out but nonetheless strong and enduring Bruce Banner in a convincing manner. As dos William Hurt in playing the emotionally detached military General.<br/><br/>Whilst The Incredible Hulk (2008) is in no way a continuation or sequel to the movie Hulk (2003)... It's hard not to compare the two in order to decipher which one has the most potential.<br/><br/>'Hulk' has a much more cartoony style in it, which i found much more engaging. In contrast, 'The Incredible Hulk' decided to follow a more darker and gritty style. The comparison is similar to comparing Batman Begins with the older Batman movies. You can't help but ask 'Is a guy who turns into a green, muscular beast when he gets angry really something that's meant to be taken seriously?' <br/><br/>Overall the movie is good for some thrills, decent acting & impressive eye candy... But not much more."
"voicemaster71","10","5","8","17 June 2008"," Second To the Classic TV Series, This Is THE Hulk Movie To Go See!!
","When it comes to the Incredible Hulk, I am and will always love the classic TV series the best. But now, I've seen the second best Hulk interpretation ever made!! Oddly enough, I wound up seeing it three times this weekend. I just couldn't get enough of it.<br/><br/>The 2003 Ang Lee film was a total abomination (pardon the pun)and it would be similar to, ""What if somebody attempted to do a lower budget Superman movie a few years before Christopher Reeve, Richard Donner, and the Salkinds got involved?"" That movie was a joke that was not funny at all. <br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk was a brilliant collaboration and this time, both the director and the star are both Hulk fans of both the comics and the TV series. Louis Leterrier was an ideal choice for a director. Edward Norton made an excellent Bruce Banner. He looked a little like Bill Bixby, but only a little bit whereas he mostly represents the comic book Banner far better than the poorly miscast Eric Bana of the 2003 film. The retold origin was far better than the plot of the previous film and was only restricted to one part early on in the film so that it's not rehashed. Liv Tyler made a decent Betty Ross and she was much more loving and understanding than Jennifer Connelly was, but in terms of beauty, I am more partial to Connelly myself. Add the grey hair and the mustache, and William Hurt executed his performance as General Thunderbolt Ross. The only thing I liked in the 2003 film was the casting of Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot as Betty and her father, the General, so I could go either way with the Ross's.<br/><br/>This Hulk movie has many things the previous attempt did not. For one thing, it has some humor in it while the other film was too dark, brooding, and serious. And this film had good length while the other one was too long. That is one agreement that I'm glad Marvel won. Sorry Ed. And most of all, we had a real villain along with a colossal fight for the Hulk. Tim Roth was great as Emil Blonsky and his Abomination was a true menace and a frightening one as well. <br/><br/>Best of all, this Incredible Hulk movie has many nods to the classic TV series. Lou Ferrigno has a better cameo role and he was the voice of the Hulk. There is a brief cameo of the late Bill Bixby seen on a TV set while Bruce Banner is channel surfing. And what I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet, there is also a nod to the late Jack Colvin's character in that there is a character named Jack McGee found somewhere in this movie. You need to see the movie for yourself to see these nods. The Hulk himself is CGI of course, and to some, that is probably a big letdown, but this time, the Hulk looks far better and he doesn't grow when he gets angrier, plus he looks more like his comic book counterpart. <br/><br/>One more thing, the musical score was outstanding!! Craig Armstrong's score sounded like real Hulk music as opposed to Danny Elfman's 2003 score, which sounded a little too Asian and martial arts type of music. But the intro theme of this new movie is really captivating. <br/><br/>For my final evaluation. If you want to see a Hulk movie that is truly good in every way and will capture the interest of both TV series and comics fans, the Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton is THE movie to see and completely discard the Ang Lee film of 2003. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!!"

Well if you are the later then spend the eight or nine bucks on the ticket to go see it, it will be well worth it.<br/><br/>I had heard many reasons of why some people did not want to go see this film and many of them reverted back to the 2003 film The Hulk, I unlike what seems to be many other people have this film and enjoyed seeing it many times. I do understand though that many people were not impressed with fight scene time or with the C.G. of the time but overall I still think it is a decent way to spend a rainy night.<br/><br/>If you had some concerns about The Incredible Hulk based on some let down after viewing the 2003 film, DON""T! The fight scenes are longer, the Hulk looks more realistic, and he is still a bad ass.

"tavm","9","5","8","16 June 2008"," The Incredible Hulk was a way entertaining adaptation of the beloved Marvel character
","Having managed to miss Ang Lee's Hulk from 5 years ago, I watched this version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's green-skinned, gamma-radiated monster with an open mind. In a word: AWESOME! Nice recap of the origin during the opening credits before we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil having basically stayed calm for at least a year. That won't last long. There's also General Ross (William Hurt), Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who later becomes The Abomination, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who tries to cure Banner, and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)-the general's daughter who stands by Bruce through all his trials and tribulations. Great mixture of drama, suspense, and action as provided by director Louis Leterrier. Eagle-eyed viewers who've lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of Banner/Hulk: Bill Bixby in a television scene from his earlier series ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"", and Lou Ferrigno as a security guard who lets Norton in (He also says something as the Hulk in a later scene). And of course, Stan Lee puts in his Hitchcockian cameo! One more person I'd like to mention is Ty Burrell-late of the cancelled show ""Back to You""-playing a shrink who also gets involved with Betty. In short, The Incredible Hulk is another very worthy movie made from a Marvel Comics character. P.S. My first real encounter with the Hulk was from a comic book I got for my 9th birthday that had a 45 r.p.m. record attached from Power Records that provided the voices of the characters and narration in that book. The Abomination was the villain in that one."
"doctorkananga","10","5","8","16 June 2008"," Best Marvel movie yet!
","This film is amazing! You can actually tell that the director, Edward Norton, and Tim Roth are fans of The Incredible Hulk unlike most Marvel films. The Incredible Hulk is such an underrated comic series, I would probably say Bruce Banner is the one of the most emotionally intriguing characters in Marvel. So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most ""fun"" film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of ""The Lonely Man"" and ""Hulk Smash"". The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry. I believed Tim Roth was an aging mercenary that was power-hungry and wanted to find the fountain of youth, and that William Hurt was a corrupt General...but to him Hulk is the bad guy. William Hurt totally gets into character here as always, he doesn't look or sound like himself, crazy."
"the_headless_cross","Null","5","8","15 June 2008"," Incredible indeed!
","OK, I didn't think the 2003 Ang Lee version was THAT bad, but you ever figure out the faults of a movie when seeing the sequel/reboot to it? Now I do with Ang's version and after seeing the new improved Hulk I must say this is 100 times better! We see more of Bruce ""Hulking"" out and less of the drama the first showed to us. No more of Bruce blaming his father for what happened to him.<br/><br/>Also this presents to us something else the first lacked: humor. OK, don't want the movie to be a total laugh fest, but nothing wrong with a little moments of laughter, such as some nods to the comic and TV show (the purple pants, and of course Lou's cameo, dang he's huge!). A little humor made Bruce seem like a real human rather than Eric Bana's deadpan performance.<br/><br/>Speaking of, the cast, like the story, is redone and redone well. As I mentioned, Norton makes Bruce Banner more human. Nothing against Sam Elliot, but Hurt gives off a better presence as Thunderbolt Ross. Liv Tyler is easy on the eyes (she does have daddy's lips, but still hot), and easy on the performance as well. Tim Roth just owns as the villain here.<br/><br/>The villain of course is the Abomination and what a sweet villain he is (better than the CG dogs and the Absorb Man). And believe me, the fight scene between him and our green friend will bring out the inner nerd in you. Oh, and hearing ""HULK SMASH!"" will too!<br/><br/>Overall, more action than the 2003 ""drama"" and more humor leads to what we WANT a Hulk movie to be like. Oh, and don't forget to watch for a surprise cameo (hint: not Stan Lee or Lou) which hints at a possible cool movie event in the future!"

","Edward Norton is right & wrong. This movie could have used more of him in it (when the DVD comes out I hope they include ""his cut"" if it exist), but he is wrong for not promoting this movie.<br/><br/>This re-boot is a blast to watch. I actually liked much of Ang Lee's version but only in fits & starts. This Hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags. The FX are spectacular & sometimes inspired --every part of the production is great. The battle scenes are ferocious. I never tired of watching Mean Green do his thing, but I guess thats the point. The movie makers knew when to cut the action.<br/><br/>However --like Iron Man-- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism, but, come to think of it, all 3 Spideys & X-Men + Batman Begins (& Returns) also featured really fine & often great acting. AND this Hulk could've used more of it. Norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working. There are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief. William Hurt makes a fine foe. And, so help me movie gods, Liv Tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name ""Bruce"".<br/><br/>Overall this movie ROCKS.<br/><br/>And I thought all movies released b4 July 18th were just time-killers until the Dark Knight arrives. Thank you Tony Stark, Indy & Bruce Banner for proving me wrong."

","Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Most of them have silly names and often sillier costumes. But there's something so fundamental and human about the ones that have survived half a century. Spider-Man isn't just some dude swinging around New York. He's a young kid trying to balance so many competing parts of his life and spreading himself too thin. We all know what that's like. With the X-Men it's not just people with cool powers kicking the crap out of each other. It's about being part of a minority and others discriminating against you. Who hasn't had a taste of that? And with the Hulk, it's ultimately anger management. Literally having a monster inside of you and how difficult it is to control it. It's about being at war with yourself. So yes... his name is ridiculous. The idea of a giant green monster is a little out there. But when these movies have enough small character moments peppered in with the action there's a chance to really connect with them and allow yourself to forgive how unrealistic they dare to be because you're so immersed in their universe. The Incredible Hulk is not the best comic book movie ever made. It's not even in the top three. But it's a solid film and it could have been so much worse.<br/><br/>I have fond memories of the old TV show. Back then it was a waiting game until the Hulk showed up. Now it's the hardest part of the show to swallow and I find myself really intrigued by David Banner's plight. I didn't hate the Ang Lee movie but I have no desire to ever revisit it. This new incarnation has elements of both but for the most part does a satisfactory job of establishing itself as something new. The first act was the best part of the film for me. Everything until the battle on the college campus. The introductory scenes of Bruce were really effective and the first Hulk-out was almost legitimately frightening. The later action scenes are bigger in scope but they're never as creative.<br/><br/>Norton's been making headlines for all the wrong reasons lately but there's no denying he's got the goods. I have a feeling there were a lot of character moments left on the cutting room floor but what's left is still an admirable performance. And even though it's an underwritten role, Liv Tyler is a complete sweetheart as Betty. There's such a charming girl-next-door quality to her and even though I don't completely buy her as a scientist I totally believed in the connection she and Bruce shared. I felt like William Hurt and Tim Roth both received pretty thankless roles. They weren't bad by and means but the script (or this cut anyways) never allows them the chance to do much other than beg to fight the Hulk again or scream for more firepower.<br/><br/>The CGI isn't fantastic. That's just a fact. But it only pulled me out of the film a couple of times. And the Hulk looks about a million times better than he did in the last movie. As expected it does take over once the third act hits and for me that stuff just isn't as enthralling. The film never lost me, it just never reached the heights of the opening thirty minutes. Not for me at least. If I were thirteen I probably would have drooled over the last fight scene.<br/><br/>In the pantheon of comic book movies Hulk stands above Fantastic Four and Daredevil but never quite makes it to the top tier of films like Spider-Man 2, X2, Batman Begins, or even Iron Man. It's comfortably in the middle. I don't feel like I wasted my time or money. But I'm not anxiously awaiting a sequel either.<br/><br/>You really could do worse."

","Just saw the movie last night and I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with the movie. The first Hulk movie was kind of a let down. The Hulk was so over the top and unbelievable. He was made to be something that he wasn't. This one was was quite the opposite.<br/><br/>From the start it I felt as though riding a roller coaster. A slow start a nice build up, then the trough, then once again a bigger build up then a long level ride. then the final heart thumping thrill ride that leaves you cheering and, like any adrenaline junkie, wanting so much more.<br/><br/>I wish that they would have developed Betty Ross' character a little more but over all they did a great job."
"tombstone81","9","5","8","15 June 2008"," Getcha popcorn ready...HULK SMASH!
","I suppose any review about a comic book movie must be preceded by a few disclaimers as to the reviewers objectivity. I've been a Hulk fan for more than 30 years, since I started wearing my first Hulk T-shirt at around age 5. I love the big green guy and all the angst and brooding and power and potential carnage he represents...especially knowing that somewhere deep within that poisoned, rippling, veiny interior is a sensitive soul struggling to stay attached to its compassion and humanity. I really liked Ang Lee's 2003 version but I absolutely LOVED this version! The other disclaimer would be that while I am just as fond of ""thinking"" movies like Schindler's List or Flags of our Fathers, I also freely embrace the ""summer blockbuster"" and am more than happy to check my brain at the door and munch away on m lapful of over-priced goodies while things blow up real good in front of me.<br/><br/>So with that, you already know my opinion of this newest rendition of The Incredible Hulk. The other reviews who have given this movie an 8-10 have pretty much said it all...so I am not going to elaborate on the awesome destruction scenes, the CGI (which I thought was incredibly well done and realistic), the dialogue or what have you. Quite simply I thought it was perhaps the greatest summer smash movie of all time (in a very elite group amongst T2, Jurassic Park, True Lies and Transformers). <br/><br/>Stepping away from my Hulk manlove for a moment, and trying to find some objectivity...I can let readers know that the movie is not without some technical flaws which, if you know in advance and can forgive the filmmakers for, it will likely enhance your enjoyment of the overall product. Some attempts to create humour or ""classic memorable lines"" in summer blockbusters do not always work, and the Hulk has its share of cheese that made me wince. For example, in trying to pay homage to the classic Bill Bixby TV series, Edward Norton's Bruce Banner (who is very weak in his Portuguese) says to a colleague in Brazil...""Don't make me...hungry...you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry!"". Yes, I admit I laughed, but was secretly miffed at the openly cheap attempt to create humour from a classic line...because the part of my brain that I didn't check at the door realized that ""faminto"" and ""zangado"" don't sound enough alike that a person uttering a sentence in a newfound language simply wouldn't make that mistake. There were other examples as well of things that appeared to be created for the cheese-factor that simply would not happen in real life (or likely the comic book for that matter). Things like Bronsky saying to the Hulk ""Is that all you got!?"" when he wasn't yet quite sure that his body could withstand a massive beating and when any other mortal man would be crapping his pants...or as the Abomination speaking fluent English. Why could a man who only recently became the Abomination talk freely in his native tongue, while Banner has been the Hulk for years and finally took everything he had just to grunt ""HULK SMASH!""? <br/><br/>And finally, the scene in the cave with the Hulk and Betty Ross. As a movie maker and a seller of comic books...you've just asked me to suspend all disbelief and accept that a giant green monster can withstand a barrage of 50-caliber shells bouncing off his chest like Nerf balls...but then you want me to believe that when he accidentally bumps his head in a cave it's going to hurt so much that he yells out in pain? Again, I understand the motives behind all this stuff...and it is funny, so the humour can be appreciated...it's just that it becomes ""frying pan in the face"" obvious to anybody watching this movie that it tries just a wee bit too hard to be all things to all people. But for 2 hours, it really does succeed in doing that. 9/ 10."
"Grant_Price","7","5","8","15 June 2008"," It's a good year for superhero movies
","Out of the five original Avengers, I always thought that the Incredible Hulk was the least interesting and therefore least likely character to be adapted to film (except Ant-Man, although he'll be arriving in 2010...look forward to that.) However, here we sit in 2008 with not just one, but TWO different portrayals of the less-than-jolly green giant. The main problem that the new film faces is that some people will believe it to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 effort, which upon release was blindfolded, made to stand against a wall and executed by public firing squad. The fact is that it is not a sequel at all. Instead, director Louis Leterrier has pulled a 'Batman Begins' and rebooted the franchise, and not just in name only. Everything about the 'Hulk is excellent. From the special effects to the characters to the reticent nods to other superheroes within the Marvel universe, the 'Hulk succeeds on every level.<br/><br/>The film sidesteps the curse of the tedious 'origin story' by showing it to the audience in the opening credits. That should really be a law within superhero movies. It works so well: Bruce Banner works on a radioactive serum with love interest/scientist Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler's lips), he injects himself to see if it works, it transforms him into the Hulk. There, that didn't need to take one hundred minutes of screen time did it? This means that director Leterrier has free reign to explore how Bruce Banner lives as the Hulk and the attempts by the United States army to track him down and neutralise him, which leads to several action set pieces involving vehicles being thrown into walls and soldiers firing a nimiety of bullets at the Hulk, even when they can clearly see them bouncing off his body. Really, what is the best they are hoping for in a situation like that? ""Keep firing, he might develop a vague sense of moral ill-being and stop!"" Ultimately, the film boils down to a brawl in New York City between the Hulk and his evil counterpart, a special-ops soldier (Tim Roth being exemplary as usual) willingly injected with the Hulk genes, much like the climax to 'Iron Man.' The difference here is that the build up to this fight doesn't seem rushed like in 'Iron Man' because Leterrier has been able to utilise the whole of the film's running time to arrive at this natural conclusion, instead of being preoccupied with the origin story and tagging on an antagonist at the end.<br/><br/>Whoever cast Edward Norton as Dr Bruce Banner is almost as much of a genius as the person who asked Robert Downey Jr. To play Tony Stark in 'Iron Man' (who makes an appearance in the film inducing fan-boy erections everywhere.) Norton plays his role with understated finesse, never resorting to overly pained facial expressions, intense eye contact or shouting to display the anguish which is consuming him for the majority of the film. He simply shows that the Hulk sized burden on his back is destroying him, crushing his will to live. He looks haunted and tired, but possesses a steely resolve not to succumb to the beast within, although it would temporarily end his struggle if he did so. He's so good that Christian Bale will have to turn water into wine in The Dark Knight to retain his title as King of the Superheroes (Tobey Maguire? Hahaha, you're kidding...wait, you aren't?) There are many minor elements in 'The Incredible Hulk' that elevates it above most movies in this genre. For example, for nearly half of the film the audience are only provided with fleeting glimpses of the Hulk, much like Batman in 'Begins. His presence is not overused, though it easily could be with the bravura CGI shown at the end. Indeed, the first chase scene does not involve Banner turning into the Hulk at all, it is just an exciting pursuit across rooftops in Rio De Janeiro. Also, the orchestral score lends an air of intelligence to the film and enhances the scenes much more than an overdriven guitar track (hello, Iron Man) would have done.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is one of those minority superhero films; it's good. In fact, with regard to any competition it faces, you (if you were looking to conclude a film review with a dialogue related pun) might be inclined to say ""Hulk smash!"""
"DarkVulcan29","10","5","8","15 June 2008"," Quite enjoyable and INCREDIBLE
","I always have been an Incredible Hulk fan as long as I could remember. I love the T.V. show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, which ran for 5 and a half years. But I was disappointed with Ang Lee's The Hulk(2003), that failed to do the character any justice, and not mention Eric Bana, don't get me wrong is a good actor, But his performance as Bruce Banner was over the top and unwatchable, and it made me miss Bill Bixby in the role. The Special effects where the only thing good about it. Now it's 5 years later, a new hulk film is here, and Edward Nortan has taken over the role as Bruce Banner. Still on the run from General Ross(William Hurt), Bruce keeps trying to find a cure for his violent transformation , While Ross's military unit is on his trail, He finds refuge with his long lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler). And that is all I'm gonna tell you. But this film was Incredible, the action where great, not to mention the effects where awesome. And everybody gave great performances, Including Edward Norton who was more memorable then Eric Bana was, He played it very real, like Bill Bixby did in the T.V. Show. The Incredible Hulk makes up for The Hulk(2003)."
"ahab_minhas-1","4","8","15","5 December 2009"," Inferior to Ang Lee's 2003 version
","This reboot is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but very underrated 2003 ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br/><br/>Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.<br/><br/>Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). To this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tell how strong the ""force"" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.<br/><br/>Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.<br/><br/>In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.<br/><br/>In his quest to turn it into a ""fugitive"" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. To him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director picking up on Ed Norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt, Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary.<br/><br/>The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However, even as I am a fan of the comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.<br/><br/>Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart."

","Honestly, that's what kills this movie, and the previous one before that. Yeah it wasn't as artsy as the first one, but I actually liked the first one better for it's believability factor as opposed to this one which was just plain silly.<br/><br/>And that's really what deep sixed this film for my was the CGI. I could have dealt with Norton's Banner...<br/><br/>Okay that's just not true, he wasn't good for this part at all. And Liv Tyler played basically the same airy whispery voice role that she plays in all her films minus LOTR...<br/><br/>But when oh when, and yes this is a pipe dream, will Hollywood stop using CGI on everything known to man? Honestly, that's why Hulk movies will always fail is because once the puny human banner goes bye bye, angry cartoon Hulk smashes...<br/><br/>No emotion whatsoever in the character. His rage makes me want to laugh because it's so fake and engineered.<br/><br/>At least when Ferrigno did it in the 80's he looked more believable then this stuff.<br/><br/>Yeah it was campy, yeah it was basic, but it had so much more feeling in it then what we get today.<br/><br/>All the hulk is anymore is a multimillion dollar Shrek meet's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.<br/><br/>Honestly the only way to save the hulk is this: Put down the computers, put down the animation. Find a good makeup/costume designer and some super huge steroid head body builder, and go to town.<br/><br/>It works with the Thing in FF. It works in Hellboy. It can work here very good here.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie left me bored, and not caring less what happened in the ""surprise"" left open for a sequel finale'."

Ang is talented and sensitive and tries to show us something beautiful and different. Ang/Barton thinks that movies shouldn't be dumb with uninteresting characters, or be full of mindless action or be cliché ridden and full of terrible dialogue. So Ang really puts effort into working in an unfamiliar setting attempting to transform and transcend the usual genre clichés.<br/><br/>Hollywood and cinema goers are not pleased.

"ivo-cobra8","9","3","4","27 December 2015"," An Incredible reboot overall improvement over the original!
","The Incredible Hulk (2008) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action superhero Film! This film is miles way better than The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2003 film Hulk! I take this movie over both Avengers films and 2003 Hulk! This movie right now is still to this day, the most underrated Marvel movie of all-time. The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film. Watching this, I was highly enjoyed, the movie was entertained, not bad at all, it was pretty good. Not boring, not to over long, I have enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is awesome Action superhero comic book flick that does the job right! I am not a big comic book reader fan, I have not read Hulk comic books, but I did have watch the original TV show The Incredible Hulk (1977 - 1982) as a child. Been the biggest fan of that show, I know that in the TV show that, there was a reporter Jack McGee who was chasing Hulk trough the state, in this film Jack McGee is mentioned but as a journalist reporter student. <br/><br/>Edward Norton did a solid job as Bruce Banner, he was even more convincing than Eric Bana. A massive improvement from the last movie. Edward Norton gets the character right all the way through. Eric Bana was the worst choice for playing the most iconic character Bruce Banner. The original bored me to hell, I will never watch it again. But this one I will it is my favorite flick alongside Iron Man 1 & 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor: The Dark World and Thor. Liv Tyler did amazing job as Betty Ross, but I still love Jennifer Connelly to death, I have enjoyed watching her in the Original flick Hulk. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination is great and fantastic in this flick, he was the most awesome villain in this film, unlike original who had none villain in the movie except David Banner (Nick Nolte). This movie has a heart and Edward Norton is the best, but Billy Bixby will be the only David Banner around here not Nick Nolte or Paul Kersey!:P. Lou Ferrigno was respectfully in this movie who has play the ""Hulk"" in the 70's TV Show, I have mentioned before he was also in Hulk (2003) original he played the same Security Guard that he have played here. I remember the scene where Bruce comes dressed as a pizza deliver boy on the campus and brings security guard a pizza, that security guard on university campus is Lou Ferrigno! I have recognized him immediately. Lou Ferrigno even voices Hulk, his first words where after the original film ""Betty"" where changed too: ""leave me alone"" and ""Hulk smash!"" really great lines. <br/><br/>Right after Iron Man (2008) was finished and released out, Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) made a cameo scene on the end of credits towards Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: (William Hurt). Director Louis Leterrier did a great solid job directing this fast paced action flick. He expressed interest in directing Iron Man but he couldn't because Jon Favreau was already MARVEL's first choice to direct the flick, but instead he was brought on board with writer Zak Penn who started to work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. And they both proved and did made a great solid job working together. <br/><br/>Things I love about this film that work so great: The chemistry between Bruce (Edward Norton) and Betty (Liv Tylor) were great and amazing. The suspense, a c t i o n, drama, romance, comedy, special effects all perfectly blended to create this spectacular superhero flick. The hulk himself is portrayed as he should be. A rampaging monster with heart and a creature who is misunderstood. The fight scenes between Hulk and Abomination where really great, just like was in Iron Man movie, Hulk defeated Abomination but did not killed him, when Betty told him not too and she stopped him. <br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is the second feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series (the first being 2003's Hulk). Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner, who goes into hiding as he tries to find a way to reverse the mutation that causes him to become the green beast. This film was directed by Louis Leterrier and is part of ""Phase One"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. The rating I am giving to this movie is 9, it is great superhero flick! I rather watch this than MARVEL Avengers, I will never watch them again! <br/><br/>9/10 Score: A Studio: Marvel Studios, Universal Pictures Starring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell Director: Louis Letterrier Producers: Avi Arad, Gale Anne Hurd, Kevin Feige Screenplay by Zak Penn Based on Hulk by Stan Lee Jack Kirby Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 52 Mins.

","The Incredible Hulk (2008): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell: Not a sequel to the 2003 film but a different take on the huge green monster scientist Bruce Banner transforms into once anger sets in. He is tracked down by military who wishes to subdue his power. Director Louis Leterrier does well with a decent screenplay that bares similarities to the Ang Lee version yet details additionally elements that work every bit as well. Edward Norton plays Banner who struggles to control his rage. He is sought after by the Army until a freak accident has him on the run. Years later he is discovered at a bottling plant after his blood accidentally enters a bottle. He must learn to control his rage and master this condition. Liv Tyler is no Jennifer Connelly and her demeanor throughout becomes increasingly annoying especially in her constant crying out of his name. Ty Burrell as her boyfriend is a pointless addition to the cast as well. Tim Roth plays a soldier who injects himself with the same substance used on Banner. He will mutate and engage in a thunderous battle against the Hulk. William Hurt as Ross's military father jeopardizes his relationship with his daughter while on pursuit of what he perceives as the villain. His drinking scene in the conclusion gives way to a great cameo. As good as the 2003 version sustaining its hulking effects. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

","I would never have considered Edward Norton to portray a comic book character like The Hulk, but then again, I couldn't see Ben Affleck as Daredevil or Michael Keaton as Batman, so in that arena I'd be batting triple zeroes. Actually, Norton is Hulk's alter-ego Bruce Banner, but I think you get my point.<br/><br/>I used to watch The Incredible Hulk TV show of the late Seventies with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so it was cool to see the muscular body builder portray a security guard, just like he did in the Ang Lee Hulk of 2003. The same with iconic Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee, opening the fridge and dropping that bottle of Pingo Doce soda. That would have been the tainted bottle from the Brazilian assembly line, but otherwise that whole business with Banner's blood was a maguffin, and probably could have been played for more noteworthy effect.<br/><br/>In the action department, 'HULK SMASH' acquired powerful resonance in this one. The big green guy had a field day on the campus of Culver University, and that battle with The Abomination (Tim Roth) was an all out blast. The CGI for those sequences was stand-out and creative as well, like when Hulk tore a military vehicle in half and used them as boxing gloves. But the scene that really grabbed me was when Dr. Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) tried the 'cure' on Banner and you had the midway transformation between man and beast. Very well done.<br/><br/>So all in all, a pretty cool action flick with a neat set up for the Avengers movie when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with General Ross (William Hurt) in the final scene. The Marvel folks have a unique way of tying their characters together to leave you clamoring for more."

","As a major superhero movie fan, I've got to say this movie was just, OK. Out of all of the back up movies to The Avengers (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor) this one was the one that did the lest for me. It may just be because I'm not a huge Hulk fan, but it really didn't do much for me. This movie starts out with Bruce Banner in Brazil trying to learn how to control his heart rate so that he doesn't turn into the Hulk again. But of course this fails so he goes back home in hopes to find data to give to a mysterious ""Mr. Blue"" who is trying to help him find a cure. Along the way he meets up with his ex-girlfriend who still loves him and runs off to help him. There are a lot of battle scenes with The Hulk, and the U.S. army who are trying to bring him in so that they can create an army of Hulks. The only scene that is really memorable, however, is the one at the end battle between The Hulk, and The Abomination. Everything before that is just OK. This movie IS worth seeing. It is NOT a horrible movie. I just wouldn't ever buy it for any reason, but to complete the collection of the whole before Avengers series."
"kylehodgdon","9","3","4","12 February 2010"," Awesome Superhero Film. Wipes Out All Bad Memories Of 2003's ""Hulk""
","For everything that was wrong with 2003's ""Hulk"", 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" does right. <br/><br/>It's kind of too bad that this movie came out right after the blockbuster ""Iron Man"" because it kind of became a bit overlooked. I did like ""Iron Man"" just a tad more than this, but only by a small amount. This was every bit as much an awesome superhero movie that ""Iron Man"" was. <br/><br/>Most people are somewhat familiar with Hulk, so they did not start this story with the birth of the Hulk character. Instead they could really start the story off quickly. I think that was a good idea. We saw that in ""Hulk"" and it was not necessary to show it again. <br/><br/>I thought Edward Norton played a great Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler also played a very good Betty Ross. <br/><br/>Unlike the 2003 Hulk, this one really looked much, much better. Not only did his look improve, but his actions had more power than the 2003 version. The Hulk character is a tough one to make a story around since his power only works when he is angry, so I was impressed that this story really made sense and was very good.<br/><br/>The Abomination character was also done very well. To me, it might take a certain kind of enemy for the Hulk character to have and they nailed it with him.<br/><br/>The final scene of the film definitely made me very anxious to see more Marvel films, especially the one that will cap them all off: The Avengers."
"zurnderrick","9","3","4","24 August 2009"," An Action Packed, High Flying Comic Book Film
","The Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the Hulk films, because many people though that the first film was confusing and boring. Luckily, I am one of those people that thinks that this film is much better and better written than Ang Lee's film. It is action packed, more thought out, and is closer to the 1970s Hulk TV series than the first.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, who turns into the Hulk when he is angry. We are also introduced to the Abomination, a classic Hulk villain played by Tim Roth. The fight scenes between the two are awesome and really display great computer generated effects and graphics.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk is an entertaining super hero film and I am looking forward to watching it again in the near future."

","I thought that the first movie definitely could've been as good as 'The Incredible Hulk'.But it wasn't.Although it was entertaining,there should've been a more interesting plot along with a better cast.The sequel actually got it right.Edward Norton did a better job as the Hulk,and Liv Tyler did a better job as Betty Ross.There is also more action.And no action movie would be perfect without special effects,which in this movie are incredible.So if you enjoyed the first movie,then I definitely recommend this highly superior sequel.If you hated the first movie,then I still recommend this movie.If there is any word that sums up this movie,here it is: INCREDIBLE"
"mjarvis0","9","3","4","2 March 2009"," A very good movie among its genre
","To comment on this movie I will do a comparison between the Eric Bana (EB) version and this the Edward Norton (EN) version. The first thing to say is that what the EN version has demonstrated is that with some screenplays/directors you can tell a story in 2 minutes what some screenplays/directors take half an hour to do. The EN version told us the audience in two minutes how Bruce Banner came to be the Hulk while the EB version took half an hour of valuable film time. Secondly the EN version stuck more or less to the TV series of the Hulk that featured the late Bill Bixby while the EB version went off on some weird tangent bringing in Bruce Banner's father into the equation. I was also particularly touched by the tribute to Bill Bixby that was in the EN version while also giving the great Lou Feringo (He is the TV version of The Incredible Hulk if you didn't know) a speaking part with him exchanging dialogue with his alter ego (David Banner) so to speak. To be fair the Hulk action scenes in the two versions were comparable but the idea of the super soldier in the EN version was easier for me to accept than the Father Son conflict as given to us in the EB version. I also liked the way the EN version once again paid tribute to the Bill Bixby TV series. This was done when Bruce Banner met Betty again. For those of you too young to have see the television series of the Incredible Hulk, the regular feature in that series was Bruce Banner thumbing a lift. So I have given this version of The Incredible Hulk 9 out of Ten and hope to see more!"
"kieran-wright","8","3","4","9 February 2009"," Much better than the media reviews made out
","OK, so it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I settled down to watch this, although admittedly I did enjoy the first Hulk film with Eric Bana. Just for a change, I'm not going to go on about how fantastic this film was, but I'm actually going to say that, had it not been for the ending of the showdown between The Hulk and Tim Roth's monster, which I found to be highly improbable and actually downright perplexing, I would have probably given this a 10. This is one of those rare films where, apart from about 1 minute or less, is actually flawless, and whereas my disappointment of this ending is in no way comparable to that which I experienced in 'No Country For Old Men', I was still left feeling disappointed - actually more disappointed for the director and the actors that this turned out to be a flawed masterpiece."
"ad_upclose","6","3","4","21 June 2008"," A fun summer flick!
","I always had concerns about how good this movie was gonna be. One thing for sure, it's more entertaining than the first. But it is not a great superhero movie (Iron Man was more rounded). But it's not really fair to compare it with Batman or Iron Man. Hulk is a far less complex character, so it was always going be hard to make a great movie on him. There are some cheesy & unexplained scenes, but not enough to hurt the film too much.<br/><br/>However, there is enough in this movie to make it a good 'popcorn' flick. I liked how they did not rveal the Hulk fully till later; showing him through shadows was cool I felt. Norton was convincing as always, & there is some subtle humor here & there. The CGI is really good for the most part of the film, and the final fight was awesome (beats Iron Man's hands down). Abomination was a really cool adversary, & I hope to see more of him (yup a spoiler!).<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining summer flick."
"asaar","6","3","4","15 June 2008"," Almost A Monstrous Letdown...
","So this movie wasn't THAT bad I guess. It was definitely entertaining, a bit better than Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk. There were many things that really bugged me about this one though. First off it is full of advertisements. They threw in a Norton Anti-Virus ad (maybe provoked by Edward Norton's lead role.) Also, Liv Tyler's character decided to buy a rather expensive looking camera after she sold her diamond studded pendant which did not add to the plot at all. Liv Tyler and Edward Norton also do a pitiful job of acting. The two of them had no chemistry. It was like the director threw them on the set without any previous interaction and said ""Act!"" Despite these harmful casting issues and the unfortunate amount of advertising going on, this was a fun summer movie."
"CowherPowerForever","9","4","6","14 April 2015"," Why Are You Always Hitting People?
","The Incredible Hulk is the second of the six Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase One films. Though many consider this film to be one of the worst Phase One films, I personally hold the opinion it is the best, and that includes taking into account The Avengers. This film was coming off of the 2003 Hulk from which was directed by Ang Lee. That might have played a factor in people hating this film, and not giving it a fair change, but I was always willing to give this film a fair shake. Thankfully, I did, and so should everyone out there. The following is my review of The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk was written by Zak Penn. Before this film Penn already had writing credits for comic book movies. For example, X-Men 2 and X-Men: The Last Stand, and has since also wrote The Avengers. The story in this film sort of rushes past the back story that many probably wouldn't have enjoyed after the previous Hulk outing. Instead we get some flashbacks earlier in the film, and the characters build up the knowledge over the course of the film as well. Bruce Banner is in Brazil to start this film. He is hiding out from the US government, as they are actively hunting him down. He is still in contact with a professor from the states who wants to help Banner with his gamma radiation problems. Banner attempts to solve it with rare flower he comes across but no luck. After an accident at his job in Brazil, the US Government finally finds him, which in turn forces him back to the states. This is just a light rundown of the overall plot, and on this review I won't be spoiling anything. Even though the character development for some of the major characters isn't all that impressive, the overall story is great and a joy to see progress. Zak Penn does an excellent job on this film, and I see why he was asked back to write a bigger MCU film.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Louis Leterrier. Leterrier prior to this film had worked on films such as The Transporter 1 and 2. Since this film was released he worked on Clash of the Titans and Now You See Me. While I do generally enjoy the work Leterrier does on his films, this film still impresses me the most. There are so many action scenes in this film. Far more than the previous MCU film had(Iron Man). I would say of the last twenty five minutes or so of the movie, a good fifteen to twenty minutes of that was pure action. That can take a toll on a production, especially since CG has to be used when creating an action scene with a character like the Hulk. At times the CG can be awful, though most of the time it is generally at least good.<br/><br/>On the acting side of things, the film is lead by Edward Norton(Bruce Banner), and also stars William Hurt(General Ross), Tim Roth(Emil Blonsky), and Liv Tyler(Betty Ross). The film also features other amazing actors like Tim Blake Nelson in smaller roles. This film is very well acted across the board. Even though Edward Norton never returned to this character, he seemed to get along amazing with everyone on set and he clearly works well with the other actors. Also, in my opinion Edward Norton is the best Bruce Banner/Hulk that has been done on the big screen. That might be an unpopular opinion, but I stand by it. Overall. Leterrier does an excellent job, with only some minor issues in the CG department of the film. This is one director I do hope is invited back to do another MCU film.<br/><br/>The film was composed by Craig Armstrong. This was the first and only time Armstrong worked in the MCU. He has worked on other films such as World Trade Center, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and The Great Gatsby. After re-watching The Incredible Hulk once again, I find great shame that Armstrong was never asked back to compose another MCU film. In my opinion this is easily one of the best MCU scores, and I will go a step further and say one of the best comic book scores that I have ever heard. The depth it adds in the action scenes, and even the slower scenes in untouchable by many of the other MCU films. Hopefully as the years go on Armstrong will get more respect for this film. He greatly deserves it.<br/><br/>In closing, The Incredible Hulk is truly an amazing film to watch in this comic book sub-genre of films. The action hits early in the film and often throughout the film. The film also features impressive acting, and a truly wonderful score. While it seems the general opinion is that this is one of the worst of the MCU Phase One films, I personally have it as the best of the lot. No matter where you stand, I think the general audience will get some enjoyment out of watching it at least once.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>I will be back to Review the next MCU film in the series, Iron Man 2."

","At last, Marvel have stepped in and taken the reins of the production of their films. With Spider-Man 3 lacking the class of the previous film and X-Men 3 the same we are treated to the same roller-coaster ride we seen in Iron Man. Ed Norton is fantastic as the beleaguered Bruce Banner and in my opinion resembles the troubled David Banner from the TV series, superbly played by the late Bill Bixby. Liv Tyler is class as Betty Ross and is always capable of delivering some emotion and feeling into her parts. Bruce's experiments toward a cure and the military's involvement because of the planned super soldier programme is all in line with the upcoming Captain America story. Abomination was in the movie long enough so not to take from Bruce's plight. A clue of what's to come is hinted at when Bruce smiles at the end and his eyes light up green! The Tony Stark cameo at the end capped it all and gave us a clue of what's coming, and a brief reminder that there's some tie ins on the way!! In all, well done Marvel and keep them coming!"

"Medacakathareal","7","4","6","2 November 2008"," Winning mix of old and new Hulk
","After the atrocious 2003 attempt at the Hulk I was worried when I heard that a reboot was in the making. I had begun to believe that the old Bill Bixby series was about as good a Hulk as we were ever going to get, and quite frankly was pretty content. But, with the DVD release of the Incredible Hulk I'd figure I'd give it a shot, and I was surprised at how good the movie turned out.<br/><br/>The Hulk looks a lot better, the CGI has improved quite a bit since 2003, and he seems a darker, more realistic green tone. The film is pretty simple plot wise, the military hunts the Hulk to use him as a weapon while poor Banner is just trying to survive and learn how to control and eventually get rid of, his alter ego. <br/><br/>There are a few throw backs to the old series, including the ""sad walking away theme"" and the zooming in on Banner's eyes when he has a ""spike"". There are some pretty awesome battle scenes, including one where a helicopter crashes, the special effects aren't ground breaking but they are still top notch. The only real flaws I found were the New York setting, this is the Marvel Universe, so where is Spider-Man while all this is happening? And I really didn't like the way SHIELD seemed to be okay with the whole super-soldier program, I'm worried that the Avengers will end up taking orders from the deceptive government, that would be a sad day indeed.<br/><br/>A few extra points that made the film great:<br/><br/>Inclusion of the line ""HULK SMASH"" A cameo by Stan Lee (as he is prone to do) Tony Stark's little cameo Someone almost gets killed with a forklift (MST3K anyone?)<br/><br/>And just a whole lot of awesome moments that make the comic book geek in me satisfied... Set aside any skepticism you might still be retaining and see The Incredible Hulk..."
"redeyedtreefrog","9","4","6","26 October 2008"," Green is in!
","No one can be Bill Bixby, no one should try. I saw Eric Bana in Hulk and was supremely disappointed. Let's see, where to start? I can understand that with the technology we now have all those larger than life comic characters can really come to life. The show did not have the use of such and so relied on a really big green guy and a great actor. IH tried for both, CGI with a touch of human. I think Hulk tried to make him too big, too sensational and too GCI looking. I like that IH didn't use a pretty boy (not to take anything from Eric) but rather an average Joe. I think they worked really hard to create an atmosphere closer to that of Bixby and his team. Hurt stepped way out of his comfort zone to put on a superb show. Liv and Roth did their part to make a movie worth watching over and over but the dark horse was Dr Stern. Tim was only on screen for a few minutes but his manic not as good as I look performance should turn heads for future projects."
"kyle-cruse","8","4","6","22 August 2008"," A huge improvement over the 2003 version
","As opposed to ""Hulk,"" the adaptation made in 2003, ""The Incredible Hulk"" actually looks like some work was put into it. The first film had no emotion and was mostly filled with long scenes of dialogue or useless scenes with the Hulk fighting other creatures. That film also made up stuff about Bruce Banner's dad being involved in turning Bruce into the Hulk, which was never a part of the old TV shows. This film is very emotional and puts a greater focus on Bruce, not what he turns into. Unlike the first film, the cast is actually made up of known people, including Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and William Hurt. There are also little bits of humor that make this a more fun film to watch, such as Bruce's girlfriend giving him a pair of purple shorts to wear. The action scenes are good, but not great. This is a pretty gruesome film that can be a bit disturbing to some audiences like myself, though it is still far less than ""The Dark Knight."" It can be painful to watch when the two Hulks are fighting and when Bruce is injected with the chemicals. This is not an unwatchable film, but be aware that it can be tough to watch at times. Parents take caution; it is fairly violent (not bloody) and somewhat gruesome for young audiences. Know your kids and whether or not they should see this.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

"MrPink08","10","4","6","1 July 2008"," The Incredible Ed
","Edward Norton has always been my favorite actor, and here is one of the reason why: he can take crap and make it look good. Case in point: The Incredible Hulk. After the 2003 Ang Lee disaster, Norton stars and writes this superhero epic, which is just as good as its companion Iron Man, which I also loved. Norton makes us care about the Bruce Banner character. We actually want him to find a cure for his ""illness"" and not just break out into a Hulk fit at any random time.<br/><br/>Instead of boring us with a dull backstory like Eric Bana's Hulk did, director Louis Lerterier (The Transporter) opts to show us the backstory in an opening montage during the credits. That way, we get right to the action. Bruce Banner (Norton) is living in Brazil, seeking a cure for his ""incident"". However, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who want to use Banner's substances to create ""supersoldiers"". Eventually, Blonsky takes some of the supersoldier serum and becomes like Banner, only evil. Banner teams up with girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) to find a cure for his rage.<br/><br/>In addition to Norton, it was nice to see Tim Roth finally get a starring role in a film not directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tyler portrays Betty well, and she and Norton have good chemistry on screen. Hurt's Ross was a huge improvement over Sam Elliot's, and Nelson is a fun character who comes off likable.<br/><br/>Fans will love the cameos in this film as well. Tony Stark, aka The Invincible Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) shows up at the end, and Lou Ferrigno makes a cameo. But the real star is Norton and his big bad green self. A Perfect 10, and I cannot wait for The Avengers Movie."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","11","23","23 October 2008"," Despite The Same Old Military Bias, It's Very Entertaining And Fun To Watch
","I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays. When the ""Hulk"" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed ""The Sandman"" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this XXX-L version of the Hulk, too.<br/><br/>In the finale, you can get to watch two monsters going at each other which has the typical overdone action but still fun to watch action. As for the story, once again, it's the same old/same old bash-the-U.S. Armed Forces. Who are the two villains in this movie: two military officers! The military, especially since the early '60s beginning with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" has always been the left-leading Hollywood's prime target.<br/><br/>I did a little homework on the Hulk comic book origins and, yes, the police and army were trying subdue the green monster, but only because of the destruction he was causing. In this movie, however, they aren't too subtle. The main ""soldier,"" played by William Hurt, ""Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderebolt' Ross,"" is shown to be a heartless killer with the usual let's-make-a-super-weapon attitude and not-care-about-anything else. His nickname ought to tell you something. Making the military look like evil dummies is nothing new, either, with screenwriters the past half century. In this particular Hulk film, one of Banner's allies, "" Dr. Samuel Sterns,"" (Tim Blake Nelson) even admits ""I hate the government."" Of course he does. Anyone in authority is always the villain in today's movies. This film is a good example of that kind of thinking. The other weirdo (Tim Roth) has the rank of ""Major.""<br/><br/>Other than that, and the always-annoying Liv Tyler, who plays ""Bety,"" the female love interest of Banner's, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining film. Norton is a credible and likable ""Bruce Banner"" and Roth is one of the best in the business at playing whacked-out villains. He plays the Major and winds up as the second ""monster"" and he's a real hoot! Hurt is a fine actor, too, as movie fans know.<br/><br/>One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, ""Superman Returns,"" we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s ""Adventures of Superman"" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.<br/><br/>The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again."

","I'm sorry to write a negative comment on a film which cost 130 million to make... I went into the cinema with an open mind as I'm definitely no Hulk fan, my son of 15 wanted to see this movie. When the film finished I had the feeling of being let down, the CGI of the Hulk is like looking at a CGI character, I never had the feeling that the Hulk was real in a movie sense, the Abomination was far better as a visual image, the Hulk doesn't even have the slightest resemblance to Edward Nortons facual characteristics. The special effects and camera work was sometimes extraordinary, but this was not maintained. I was very disappointed with the look of the Hulk, Edward Norton was fine as Banner, as he is in most films... I wonder what motivated him to take this role? obviously the money, but what about his reputation as a serious actor who takes roles that demand great talent. This film didn't ring my bells at all... Iron Man is a great film and with Robert Downey jn in the title role brought depth and emotion to the character which I didn't feel with Norton. Sorry to be so negative..."

While seeking the cure with his beloved Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) and other scientists, he learns how to control his emotions and heart beat and to keep his human form for a long period. When General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) finds a clue of his location in Brazil, he sends a command leaded by the tough Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to abduct Dr. Banner. However, he transforms in Hulk and escapes to Guatemala. Later he contacts Betty and his colleagues and when he is close to find his cure, Blonsky captures him and transforms himself in powerful beast The Abomination. Dr. Banner has to decide whether he should remain human or transform in The Incredible Hulk again to stop The Abomination.<br/><br/>After the ""Shrek-Hulk"" of Ang ""Brokeback Mountain"" Lee, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a wonderful surprise. The story and characters recall the comic books of my childhood, plenty of action and adventure. For Brazilians and more specifically for ""cariocas"" (people born in Rio de Janeiro) like me, it is funny to see Dr. Bruce Banner living in Rocinha, probably the most dangerous location in my city, where the police is afraid to go, chased by the American soldiers. In real life, they certainly would be murdered by the army of drug dealers. Further, I really appreciated the effort of Edward Norton speaking a couple of words and sentences in Portuguese. But the most important, the story is a great and entertaining adventure and the special effects are really good.

Scene: daughter tells the general that he is her father no more. A few minutes later, after experiencing the consequences of the generals deeds, Edwards tells ""please"" to the general, and the daughter calls him a father.<br/><br/>I won't even try to discuss the military logic 'cause it's not even a mess, it's a usual black hole.<br/><br/>And after all this, a character from good film appears in a bad film! Tony Stark, an unusual character from 16+ movie which had a plot and no repellent and redundant sentiments - Tony Stark appears in the second Hulk movie! And doesn't he turn into a bad guy a way too fast? But, hey! there's no character relations in Incredible Hulk, so what am I asking for?<br/><br/>Now I can feel the whole power of Hollywood script writers crisis...

","Hero origins in the Marvel universe are often hard enough to believe on their own. (Radioactive spiders are more likely to give you radioactive blood poisoning than super powers.) <br/><br/>The Hulk, being basically Mr. Hyde on super-steroids, is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Lou Ferrigno, despite not being as brawny as the comic book character (and who is?), nevertheless did it well. The CGI character in this movie, not so much.<br/><br/>In fact, the CGI is the main killer for this movie. On its own, it's not convincing at all. There are almost no scenes in which you're not aware that you're looking at a video game character interacting with normal humans. The result is that the movie ends up looking like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" crossed with an X Box game.<br/><br/>Whoever designed the Hulk obviously never heard that less is more. A hulk larger than any living bodybuilder would have been fine, but this is one gigantic, over-detailed brute. If motion-tracking technology was used, it didn't show up in the final product. This Hulk moves awkwardly, at times much too fast considering his bulk. His skin is ridiculously over-detailed, as if the producers were afraid anything less would result in a plastic-y look. The result is that the Hulk looks like he's got the world's worst skin rash or something. Muscle striations are visible everywhere except the Hulk's eyeballs, and his overall size is just WAY overdone, like some homoerotic bodybuilder fantasy.<br/><br/>Poor CGI also afflicts things like helicopters and other vehicles, which is puzzling considering people have been doing these things for years now.<br/><br/>That leaves us with story, and unfortunately, the old ""the army wants to turn me into a weapon"" trope is getting really, really, really tired now. Some ingenuity might infuse fresh blood into this idea, but you won't find it here. The baddies are about as subtle as a fart in an elevator. One ends up wishing that the Cigarette Smoking Man from ""The X Files"" would show up to concoct some devious, shrewd plan to capture Bruce Banner. But no, we go full-out tanks-and-troops. And the less said about Blonsky, the better. It's all might and no brains. There are no surprises in this movie, only the assurance that you can see the next turn of the plot in this movie coming a mile away.<br/><br/>Norton does a serviceable job as Banner, but you can tell that even he knows that this is a paint-by-numbers plot. Overall it's just old, tired and overblown. Adam West's Batman reached the same level of camp, except that the producers of that show did it intentionally and with gusto."
"jahremusic","1","6","11","29 November 2011"," A pointless movie that can't figure out its own plot.
","This was an excruciating ""reboot"" of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which was a far superior movie in my opinion. Had I known that the writer of ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Last Action Hero"" was responsible for this, I wouldn't have watched. This story really doesn't bother with the comic book Hulk, and mostly just takes from the TV show. The one nod to the comic book is the return of the Betty and General Ross characters (which could just as easily been lifted from the last movie, without referring to the comics at all). However, this Betty is pretty ineffectual as a character and the General is nothing more than a dimwitted antagonist. The General's brainless plan involves capturing the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, and returning him to the military for study. His reason is that Banner's blood is the result of the army's experiments to create a ""super soldier"". However, we find out in the first act that the army already has the serum for this super soldier and injects it into the Generals lackey, in order to better conquer the Hulk. So why are they trying to capture Banner then, instead of just shooting him in the head? Later, the General finds another doctor that's been helping Banner, and has a storehouse of his blood. So they have everything that they need and decide to just leave it in a lab with no more than one army official and a Royal British special ops grunt. This has got to be the stupidest general in the U.S. Army. I would love to see the report that he sends to his superiors in Washington after all of the unnecessary carnage that has occurred under his watch. These are just some of the major flaws with the poor writing and execution in this movie. A big laugh happens when the British Marine has a few scenes wearing U.S. Army officer attire, complete with U.S. badges and medals on his lapel. If you want to watch a really ambitious super hero film, complete with character study and depth, watch Ang Lee's version. If you want to watch a CGI demo reel that's not really better than Ang Lee's version, have fun with this one."

","When I walked out of Spider-Man 3 last summer, I kept asking myself, ""I liked it, didn't I?"" Of course I did. This was Spider-Man 3 after all, and after the phenomenal showing in Spider-Man 2, Spider 3 had to blow the second one out of the water. I was so thoroughly convinced I liked it that I went again the following night. It wasn't until a whole week later that I had to admit it. ""Spider-Man 3 sucked big time."" I had similar feelings as I walked out of ""The Incredible Hulk"" only I was smarter this time around.<br/><br/>After hiding out in South America for five years, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is still plagued by the gamma radiation which turns him into the Hulk, or as Ferris al-Ghazi from ""The Kingdom"" said it, ""The Green Beast!"" Banner is still being hunted down by General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt). I always wondered who would name their kid thunderbolt, even if it was only a comic book. I recently found out that it's a nick name for Thaddeus; makes sense. By some strange twist of fate General Ross discovers Banner's location and brings in Emile Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help hunt Banner down. Blonsky is an aging soldier who is more or less on his way out because he looks like crap. He says he'll do the job as long as he can although his body looks less like a whip cord and more like a pillow. Bruce comes back and takes the aid of the general's daughter Bettie (Liv Tyler). This was Bruce's love interest from the first film. Yes, the first film which we're supposed to pretend didn't happen.<br/><br/>It's pretty much at this point where the film's narrative element just stops moving. Did last year's writers strike have something to do with it? The makers could've at least tried to give us more meat in the story but they chose to give us the senseless action. The rest of the film is pretty much Hulk versus Blonsky in three (or was it four?) different rounds. Every time he gets his ass kicked though, Blonsky comes thundering back with the help of, as Thaddeus puts it, a super soldier serum that was developed during World War II; an obvious reference to Captain America.<br/><br/>Now as far as the action goes I'm coming right out and saying it. The first time we see the Hulk, he looks fake. I mean fake with a capital ""F"". The CGI was done by Rhythm and Hues, a special effects studio based in Hyderabad, India. Normally they do great work and they even won an Academy Award for last year's ""The Golden Compass."" But the first scenes of the Hulk were painfully bad. It was like a cartoon sitting in the middle of a live action film a la Roger Rabbit. The later scenes are done much better but they don't make up for the fatal mistake of giving us a crappy first look of the film's main attraction.<br/><br/>This film is Marvel's second home production after Iron Man. What made Iron Man great was a good story, talented cast that had loads of chemistry, a balance of action and narrative, and characters that felt real and not ""reel."" It was like they all had a history and they worked together. In this film (like so many other summer action films) the story gets kicked to the curb the last 30 minutes to give us the special effects bonanza, none of which was that entertaining.<br/><br/>I'm sure this'll make loads of money on opening weekend but that much is expected. Why couldn't they leave this one alone? Didn't the studios lose enough money on the first Hulk disaster? Apart from poor writing, bad CGI, under developed characters, and overly cartoon-ish action, The Incredible Hulk isn't a bad movie. Oh, and there's a surprise at the end. Problem is, I knew about this surprise six months ago."

He ended up getting revenge on all of us for Brokeback Mountain but I'm straying from the real topic here...<br/><br/>Fans of movie-making and films rejoice? Well ... this 'reboot' is a better version than the original but not by much. There are elements of conflict, terror, action, and tension, all crammed into a melodramatic musical score with somewhat way too obvious (hence, boring) direction and screenplay. What keeps The Incredible Hulk from a total belly-up is Edward Norton, William Hurt and Tim Roth can still pull a heck of a performance in spite of everything. The Incredible Hulk's updated look deserves a note too, but five years later, it is to be expected. I'm just happy the Hulk's back I guess. The climactic bout between the Abomination and Hulk failed to deliver. Like the movie itself, the fight was a laughable mess at most, ending in the silliest of fashion.

"PlayerSS","8","6","11","14 June 2008"," The best Marvel movie yet
","Although my personal bias as a Hulk fan will probably sway my opinion on that.<br/><br/>5 years ago I watched Ang Lee's Hulk. I really liked it and couldn't understand why everyone was hating on it. Specifically comic book fans. The more I watched it though the more I started seeing pacing problems with the movie. Three years after I watched the movie I went and got every single Hulk comic I could find. I was in for a shock. The movie wasn't faithful to the comics at all. Reading the comics turned me against the movie entirely.<br/><br/>Needless to say I was a bit cautious whenever this one was announced. I got more optimistic whenever it was revealed that Ed Norton was being cast as Bruce. They couldn't have gotten anyone better. Eric Bana was a terrible choice. Then more casting reveals came along. For the biggest part I was happy about most of them. Except for William Hurt as General Ross. I felt one of the only things that the 03 movie got right was Sam Elliot as General Ross.<br/><br/>Then the trailers came. I wasn't impressed with anything I seen in the trailers. I was still willing to give it a chance, but I was more pessimistic now than ever.<br/><br/>After watching the movie though I can safely say the trailers didn't do it justice. It made me do a 180. This movie is the best piece of Hulk work outside of the comics. One of my worries was that since the 03 Hulk was a bit heavy with the story. This movie was going to go the opposite route and be all action and nothing else.<br/><br/>While this may be somewhat the case, the action is incredible. Abomination and Hulk's blows were thunderous. There was a big chunk of character development on Bruce Banner, but certain things could have been expanded upon. Like General Ross, Dr. Samson, and Betty. Other little things could have been expanded upon as well, but Marvel was worried that this one would be too story heavy and not enough action like the 03 version. In the end the action being so great made up for the slight sacrifice in character and story development.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler I thought did a good job as Betty. She played the innocent love role well. I know some critics are bashing her for whatever reason. I thought she was good.<br/><br/>Now to touch on the negatives. Just two big ones that stuck out to me. As I mentioned earlier I loved Elliot as Ross in the 03 Hulk movie. Hurt was no Ross. I never could completely buy him as Ross through out the movie. I kept thinking on how great Elliot would have been if he were back in the role.<br/><br/>The second was the Abomination's design. Being a comic book geek now Abomination's design irked me more than anything whenever I very first seen the trailer. I see lots of people say that the comic book design makes no sense, but this ""is"" a movie based off of a ""comic book"". Gamma affects people in different ways in the comic. The comic design differed him from Hulk's look. Which I felt was the exact thing was wrong with him here with his design. He looked too much like a bald Hulk clone. I'm not as down on it as I was, but I still prefer the comic book version any day.<br/><br/>I thought they went a bit overboard with the TV show homages. I don't like the show. I don't mind the cameo by Lou here and there. The TV show did help Hulk reach get more mainstream, but by that same logic why isn't all the current Batman movies homaging and using elements from the Adam West Batman show? Like I said I'll give credit where credit is due and to the movies credit it does strike a nice balance trying to please both sides, but Batman Begins has shown that you can make a superhero movie with 100 percent of it's inspiration derived from the comics and still be successful and good.<br/><br/>The CGI was great. Way better than the 03 version. The Hulk looked great and they went through a lot of trouble creating the battles the Hulk is in. This is getting too long. Probably my longest review yet. Finally they got the Hulk right. I'm hoping there will be a sequel."
"ungy357","3","15","35","13 June 2008"," A pale shadow of Ange Lee's infinitely superior version.
","Ang Lee's version had the nuances of a classic Greek tragedy. And, in the end, that's what superheroes are: they're the modern day equivalent of the Greek and Norse Gods of ancient times. We don't love Superman just because he can fly and lift heavy things. We love him because he is a symbol of the best in humankind, and yet also suffers from the same doubts, fears and unrequited love that plague us mere mortals. Superheroes are supposed to be fun, yes. But it does not have to be ""turn off your brain"" fun. But, then . . . ""turn off your brain"" fun has its place. While being painfully aware of its cheesy weaknesses, I had a great deal of fun with ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", and even confess a great fondness for Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"". But that's just it: The Incredible Hulk, as directed by Louis Letterier, was not that much fun.<br/><br/>The new film is not a ""Batman Begins""-style reboot as was long rumored. No, it's actually more akin in many ways to ""Batman Forever"" (though Letterier does use the opening credits to set up a slightly different version of the origin story than we saw in the previous film). We open with Bruce Banner (now played by Edward Norton) on the run from the government, who wants to use his alter ego, the Hulk, as a weapon. The government forces are lead by hard as nails, blood and guts, shoot first and later, cigar-eating General William ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, played by . . . William Hurt? Seriously? WILLIAM FREAKING HURT. The ultimate stuffed shirt. The man who put the ""ass"" in ""pomp-ass"" (we know it's not spelled or pronounced that way, but in Hurt's case, it should be). As a piece of casting, this is akin to watching Kelsey Grammar portray a rodeo cowboy. It just doesn't work. In Hurt's defense, he does provide the film with its greatest moments of tension: we wait with baited breath to see if his mustache is going to fall off. But the smug self-satisfaction he seems to be taking in his own overracting makes his performance unbearable. And it doesn't help that most of his scenes are with Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, a soldier with Captain Ahab-like obsession with defeating the Hulk, but an annoying tendency to slouch and shuffle like a 1920's Jazz musician with his shoes on the wrong feet when he walks. Roth, after his Academy Award nominated turn in the underrated Rob Roy, underwent some sort of bizarre religious conversion and gave up his talent for lent. Hurt and Roth are engaged in a titanic struggle to see who can chew the scenery more egregiously. No one wins, but the audience certainly loses.<br/><br/>Banner, desperately seeking a cure for his condition, is lead back to his lost love, General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Norton and Tyler have an easy, breezy charisma that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly may have lacked in those roles, but do not approach the same level of depth. And, besides, far too little of the film focuses on them. This is one of those comic book films that seems more interested in the villains than the heroes, but we're not talking Jack Nicholson as the Joker here. We're not even talking Scott Paulin as the Red Skull. We're talking WILLIAM *^@$# HURT AS . . . sorry. That was just a piece of casting that really didn't work for me.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is, after two-time Academy Award Winner Lee's cerebral human drama failed to connect with mass audiences, the goal here was not to delve deeply into the characters, but instead to provide a series of exciting action set pieces. The was supposed to be the ""hulk Smash"" version, and I went in embracing that and prepared to enjoy it on its own merits. After all, I've been arguing since 2003 that Universal Pictures and Marvel Studios were foolish to jump to the conclusion that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made Ang Lee an action director. That film featured eye-popping fight scenes, but in its heart and soul wasn't that far removed from Lee's previous Oscar-nominee Sense and Sensibility.<br/><br/>But Letterier's direction makes one yearn for the steady hand of Brett Ratner or Mark Steven Johnson. It was as if Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay chose to band together and combine weaknesses. And darn it if Ang Lee didn't give us much better action sequences. Truth be told, while there may be more action senes in this film, in terms of quality, they don't even come close.<br/><br/>This is not a film that is likely to make anyone desperate to have two hours of their lives back. It's not terrible. It's just . . . really not very good."
"simonparker1990","10","7","14","12 June 2008"," Hulk smashes to success
","Ang Lee's movie Hulk received an extremely mixed reception upon its release in 2003. While it did deliver as a drama, and the performances were pretty good, as a Hulk movie it kind of left out the Hulk, we barely saw the big green giant, and for a comic book that took pride in Hulk smashing it really didn't feature an awful lot of it. I suppose it's no surprise that Ang Lee's version has almost been ignored, it wasn't a commercial movie, and while I appreciated moments of it the movie just really wasn't a Hulk movie. So The Incredible Hulk is rebooting the entire series, while its not a complete start over like Batman Begins it just seems like a fresh new break. And what a fresh break it is, The Incredible Hulk basically smooths over every flaw the original movie had yet maintains the quality drama from the first movie. But most importantly of all, Hulk finally smashes! The final fight sequence is pretty much one of the highlights of this year so far, it is truly incredible. The performances are also an improvement, Edward Norton being a much more accurate interpretation of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler being superb as Betty Ross and Tim Roth, well just being downright brilliant on lead villain duties. Sure the movie essentially is a big dumb popcorn flick, but its also an extremely well made one. In fact I actually preferred it to Iron Man, although both are still some of the best superhero movies to date and both show a great improvement in terms of Marvel adaptations.<br/><br/>So let me go more in-depth with the performances. Edward Norton really hit the core of Bruce Banner. I had nothing wrong with Eric Bana's portrayal in the original movie, but he just didn't suit the character as well as Norton does. Norton seems more the geeky scientist desperate for a cure, a man desperate to stop his inner self. The scenes at the beginning where he tries to control himself show a great performance from Norton, and the scenes he shares with Liv Tyler are touching. That leads me onto Tyler's performance, and I'd go as far to say she delivers the best performance in the movie. The scene where she finally sees Bruce again is brilliantly done, its done in a subtle way, but Tyler's performance just makes it all the better. A later scene in a helicopter with the pair is the highlight of their chemistry and one of the highlights of the movie. William Hurt is a great general in the movie, both villain and victim to an extent, Hurt really characterises a possibly two-dimensional character. And then there is Tim Roth, the caged animal of an actor who does villains like no other. He is brilliant, snarling constantly and wanting to more than he could ever be. The scenes before he literally turns into an ""Abomination"" show a brilliant performance from him, and makes it all the more apparent how the original movie lacked a suitable villain for the Hulk.<br/><br/>But the main thing people want to know is how good is the actual Hulk in the movie. The CGI I thought was great, sure its not the best CGI in the world, but I began to believe he was there and the transformation sequences were extremely well done. But what Hulk does best in this movie is smash his way around. The three key fight sequences all being noteworthy, but the final just being stunning. The best scene in the movie, two words, ""Hulk Smash!"" I literally had a chill up my spine when I saw the scene and finally made me realise how happy I was to see the big green hero in all his glory in the big screen, and done well. The drama side of the movie is also done extremely well, in some ways it was done even better than Ang Lee's movie. The relationship between Bruce and Betty being vital to the movie, there scenes together are so well written and believable it really hits the heart. The movie also has a sense of humour, the best being Banner trying to keep calm in a New York cab. I suppose the biggest surprise of the movie is the fact the Hulk doesn't have to be on-screen to keep our attention, and that makes this the brilliant film that it is. Like Iron Man, Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 there are superb moments where we don't see the hero or the villain, there are moments that are small, subtle, yet brilliant. This makes this one of the best comic book adaptations to date, and one of the bigger surprises of the Summer.<br/><br/>Overall The Incredible Hulk is a truly incredible reboot for a series I wasn't convinced could survive after Lee's movie. However this movie is stunning in almost every way. Its one of the best movies of the summer I have seen so far and definitely one of the largest surprises I have seen so far. I urge you to watch it, and prepare to see a proper Hulk movie."

","Well, after nearly five years, most thought there was to be no sequel to the 2003 ""Hulk"". But, shortly after the spectacular ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"" arrived. I was surprised to find out Louis Leterrier was behind this thrilling film, but I guess he was truly the right man for the job. Where do I begin? Well, to start I'll say the story by Zak Penn was dope. The pacing is better I must admit and most viewers will find it much easier to embrace and connect with the characters. Edward Norton is perfect as the ""mild-mannered"" Bruce Banner. Although some say he didn't portray the conflicted-side of Bruce enough, I think so. Liv Tyler and William Hurt also star, making this cast spectacular to say the least. The Hulk himself looks much more fearsome and the muscles are much more defined. In short he looks much more ""beasty"". But it comes at a cost of diminished realism really. The first Hulk actually looked like a human stillquite a bit, so maybe in the end he was a litte overdone.<br/><br/>Speaking of beasty, Tim Roth is excellent as Emil Blonsky/Abomination. One major problem with the first film was its villain, and this film definitely doesn't disappoint there. Abomination's rampage scene alone is exhilarating, and the end fight delivers. It's brutal, bloody and last forever, YES!!! The score by Craig Armstrong is magnificent, letting the film play as a scary monster movie of sorts and I utterly love it!! Only one word can describe this film....Incredible!"

","I really enjoyed this movie until I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD. Then, I realized that including some of those scenes would've made this film a pure masterpiece. I hope they give us a director's cut or that ""Norton"" cut we have all heard about. As is, even in an era when an explosion of comic-book superheroes are hitting the big screen, Hulk stands alone. This has nothing to do with being a blind superhero fan. It has everything to do with the classic Jekell and Hyde story with a great twist and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe. The concluding battle is one for the ages. What's special is that it is held together by some great acting and a sci-fi but believable story (so very rare for a summer ""blockbuster"") Banner is likable and the Hulk isn't some victim, he's the hero this time around. I really like this movie but would love it if they put a few of those deleted scenes back in to the film. (ALL the Bruce/Betty relationship stuff, the Ross cigar filled room speech, the pre-helicopter stuff, etc.)"
"jerekra","7","5","9","10 March 2009"," Not Incredible, but pretty Good.
","Before I start this review I just want to say that I actually liked the hulk film that was made a few years ago in 2003. I liked this one too and it is better in some aspects than the other hulk film and worse than the other hulk film in some ways also.<br/><br/>The story is basically involving Bruce Banner and how he must be on the run constantly. THis is because there are some in the military who want to use his mutation into the hulk to aid the military. One soldier in particular is infected by the same type of mutation and becomes a hulk monster whom Banner must battle to save humanity.<br/><br/>First I should say that this film tends to try to ignore the other hulk film completely. It is a remake of sorts not a follow up. I guess this is because they felt that the other hulk film was a disappointment.<br/><br/>I thought the beginning of the film really lacked in story. THere are some brief scenes during the opening credits that show how Banner became the hulk but for the most part during the whole film Banner is the hulk already and they do not explain how he became the hulk at all. I guess this makes sense but it got me confused. If they wanted to redo the hulk film completely wouldn't they want to show how he became the hulk in the first place? But this does lead to there being more action and I guess the people assumed that most people who are watching this film do not care too much about how Banner became the hulk and just want to see action.<br/><br/>THere is a lot of good action in this film. I really like the bad guy in this film and how the main bad guy is another hulk like evil looking creature. The battle between Banner and the other hulk is a pretty good battle.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Not outstanding. I liked Edward Norton a lot in ""American History X"" and ""Rounders"" and I thought he was a good choice to play Banner in this film. He really does an effective job portraying a man who must live with the problem he possesses and must deal with other people who want to find him due to the problem he has.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler never has wowed me in any film I have seen her in and it was more of the same in this film. Nothing outstanding and sometimes lacking. COuld have chosen a better leading lady actor.<br/><br/>Quickly I would just like to say I thought it was interesting how Robert Downey Jr. appears briefly as Tony Stark. That cameo I thought was awesome as it may lead to more great Marvel Films in the future.<br/><br/>So this is a good film. Does not really do a good job explaining how Banner became the hulk but I think they did that on purpose. But the acting by Norton was good and there is a lot of good action. I recommend it."
"Dillypogo","9","5","9","27 October 2008"," The Incredible Hulk: Truly Incredible
","You certainly won't like Edward Norton when he's angry...or maybe you will and he'll entertain you for a couple of hours. He stars as scientist Bruce Banner, who takes part in an experiment that ends up turning him into a giant monster whenever he suffers stress. As he desperately searches for a cure, he is hunted by General Ross (William Hurt) who wants to extract the condition from Banner and make an army of super-soldiers.<br/><br/>Due to Ang Lee's very disappointing 2003 version of Hulk, the green giant was given a reboot in the form of Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk. This is far superior to Lee's movie, which was overlong and took itself too seriously. Unlike Lee's one, The Incredible Hulk doesn't dwell on the origin story for too long, which leaves more time for some kick-ass action scenes. The reboot was a great idea and I'd like to thank whoever came up with it for giving me back my faith in the Hulk.<br/><br/>The special effects in The Incredible Hulk are amazingly constructed and really stunned me. Although maybe not 100% perfect, they're good enough to flabbergast the average viewer. Their use in the astonishing battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is quite simply fantastic.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk contains some references to past versions of it. For example, Bill Bixby, who played Dr. David Bruce Banner in the 1980's TV series, makes a posthumous appearance on a TV screen. Also, the famous purple trousers are used for a joke. And, of course, the legend that is the creator of The Hulk, Stan Lee, has a small cameo.<br/><br/>Edward Norton does a far better job than Eric Bana did in the 2003 Hulk. Norton embodies the role perfectly and is very memorable, whereas Bana didn't really fit in with the character. Also on fine form are William Hurt as General Ross and Liv Tyler as Banner's love interest, Betty Ross. Tim Roth is brilliant in the part of villain Emil Blonsky, who soon becomes the monstrous Abomination.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk has many visually stunning, adrenaline-pumping battle scenes which really make the movie great. Obviously, the best is the action-packed finale between the two monsters of the film. However, the action scenes don't distract from the relationship between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, which works a lot better than that of the 2003 version.<br/><br/>With fantastic special effects and great action scenes, The Incredible Hulk truly is incredible.

","That emerald hued comic book character is back. Edward Norton as the Hulk? Run with it. Dr. Bruce Banner(Norton)now a fugitive lives in the shadows trying to find a cure for his condition of gamma poisoning, that when stressed transforms him into a huge muscle bound monster. The military and especially a rouge General Ross(William Hurt)want Banner found in order to exploit his powers. An antidote seems to be a reality; and back in civilization Banner finds himself against a formidable counterpart much like himself, but bigger. It is aggression versus aggression in a battle of powers as the Hulk contends with the Abomination. An enormously high octane duel makes for an exhilarating mind-blowing finale.<br/><br/>Special effects are demanding and control your attention. Liv Tyler is terrific as love interest Dr. 'Betty' Ross. Also in the cast: Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Cabot and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno.

"Happy_Evil_Dude","8","5","9","6 August 2008"," Better than the first movie (which actually wasn't that bad, you know?)
","Let me start off by saying that Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk is NOT a bad movie. In fact, as of writing it has 5.1 rating on IMDb and an critical approval of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes (this one is currently at 65%). Ang Lee did a lot of cool stuff in his film and had a talented cast, Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. Overall however, the Ang Lee film suffered from being too ambitious and overly complicated, and simply not being what the audience expected. The audience went in expecting to see ""Hulk smash"", and got a more cerebral film than they expected, even though there was still plenty of action (Hulk did swing tanks around after all!). It is true however that action scenes in Hulk weren't the coolest, which also contributed to the negative reputation it enjoys.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk writer Zak Penn (also responsible for X-Men 2 & 3, Elektra and Behind Enemy Lines), director Louis Letterier (of the Luc Besson productions Transporter 1 & 2 and Danny The Dog/Unleashed) and actor Edward Norton (who contributed greatly to the screenplay, though he is uncredited) took the complaints over Ang Lee's film into account and aren't overly concerned with continuity in this sequel. It is mentioned that 5 years have passed and the film starts in Brasil while Lee's film ends there, but the origin of Hulk is changed in the opening credits to resemble more the famous 70s TV series (references to said series abound).<br/><br/>The film is more fast-paced than Lee's effort, and while there actually isn't that much more action here (both films have 3 main action scenes), it is certainly better-made and definitely cooler. The story is certainly less cerebral but it's not a throwaway either. There are characters here, and they do go through something. As for people criticizing the CGI, well that just baffles me...just hows realistic do you expect a green muscled giant stomping around to be? The effects of the 2003 movie were already very good and they're even better here. They could have done a few things slightly better interaction-wise, true, but they're still very good.<br/><br/>In addition, I love how Marvel movies are starting to reference each other (we have here references to Nick Fury/S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark/Stark Industries, the Avengers and Captain America). This is way cool and I wish they could it for characters whose rights are owned by other companies, such as Fox, Columbia or New Line. Stan Lee's cameo is probably his best one yet and the Lou Ferrigno appearance is way cool. The guy who voiced the Hulk in one of the animated series also appears, as does Bill Bixby, indirectly.<br/><br/>Almost as good as Iron Man, this 2008 Hulk enters the hall of the best Marvel movies along with Blade 1, the first two X-Men, Iron Man, Spider-Man 1 and The Punisher ""2004 version"" (yes, I love The Punisher), and succeeds in bettering Ang Lee's underrated movie. With great action and the cool factor in spades, The Incredible Hulk should satisfy all your action blockbuster needs and leave you wanting to see Hulk smash some more. The only minor gripes I have with it are the unnecessary retconning of Lee's movie and the fact that I sincerely doubt that they asked any cast member of the first film if they wanted to return (I definitely would have preferred Jennifer Connelly reprising her role to Liv Tyler stepping in...what is it with movie sequels replacing pretty girls with unpretty ones? Maggie Gyllenhall in The Dark Knight and Liv Tyler in Hulk, sheesh!).<br/><br/>Well that's it. Good movie. Good action movie, that is, not good ""potentially an Oscar-nominee"" movie, but you should already suspect that if you know anything about this film. So yes, this is a good action blockbuster, a great one actually, one of they very best of the quite strong 2008 summer movie season.<br/><br/>Now vote that my review was helpful or you'll make me angry...and you wouldn't like me when I'm angry..."

","When the huge, jade-skinned, sometimes anti-heroic behemoth, conceived by visionaries at Marvel Comics, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, got the movie treatment in 2003, fans a many were stoked to see the Incredible Hulk in full, CGI action. However, the film by celebrated filmsmith Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") was a wooden penny. Hulk dogs? The Hulk's dad becomes The Absorbing Man? The madder the Hulk gets, the bigger he gets? I'm just glad I save my money.<br/><br/>I didn't, however, when viewing the recent comic book hero cine-relaunch (Batman being the first) which is a fun, rock'em, sock'em balance of human drama and high-edge action-adventure, the comic book and the classic TV series starring Bill Bixby as the tormented, gamma radiation-infested nuclear scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the not-so-Jolly Green Giant alter-ego. Compromising coolness is here for a superhero that can't take off the costume and call it a day, and that's what makes ""The Incredible Hulk"" interesting.<br/><br/>Oscar nominee Edward Norton (""Fight Club"", ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"") fills the late Mr. Bixby's shoes, perfectly and hauntingly, being on the lam from the protocol-minded General Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a no-nonsense William Hurt). All Banner wants is a cure, but Ross and field soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Youth Without Youth"") makes things difficult, especially when Blonsky takes a ""super solder"" formula (a major hint to fanboys) to match monster brawn with the Green-skinned Goliath, and their fracas elevates to a monster mash in NYC's Harlem district. Good thing old Doc has the general's daughter, Betty (a mousy but lively Liv Tyler of the Lord of the Rings saga), as moral support and her heart as well.<br/><br/>It's rare that movie producers can admit a ""mea culpa"" (money and rep, I guess), and ""The Incredible Hulk"", a combo of the Jason Bourne films and ""King Kong"", works. Director and fan Louis Lettierer (""Transporter 2"", ""Unleashed"" and an aide on the indie crime drama ""Gravesend"") does the script (a lost, first draft of the TV show's pilot episode, due to budget constraints and unavailable technology? ) by fellow fans Norton (uncredited) and Zak Penn (the second and third X-Men films) justice. Exceptional are the cast, especially Ty Burrell (the short-lived sitcom, ""Back To You"") and Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou"") whose roles hint at a sequel (Like, duh). More eye winks towards fanboys are the cameos of Stan Lee, Ferrigno, Bixby (from an episode of ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"") and Robert Downey Jr. as his Tony Stark role from the super-hit ""Iron Man"", clueing into the Marvel Comics Universe. (Take heed, DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures). ""The Incredible Hulk"" does more than entertain; IT SMASH!!!"

","I liked the first Hulk movie because it was the Hulk, a Marvel character that I was so familiar with as a child reading comic books, watching cheesy animations and watching the TV series. THIS Hulk movie is more like tha actually Incredible Hulk I know and closer to the series.<br/><br/>The Hulk in this movie was like the actually comic book character where he actually speaks and comprehends. The first Hulk movie showed him as a mindless brute. Also the first movie put too much emphassis on a relationship between Bruce Banner and his father David. And the new (original?) Hulk has more emotion.<br/><br/>Choosing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was perfect. Besides Norton's acting, his small frame helped create the contrast between Bruce and the Hulk alter ego.<br/><br/>There are a couple of cameos and some winks to the fans. Can't tell you what those are, that would be a spoiler. :) This movie had great live action/CG mix with camera pans that were flawless increasing the effectiveness of the illusion.<br/><br/>The true Incredible Hulk or Marvel fan will love this movie."

","The Hulk does indeed smash. And once he's finished smashing something, or someone, he goes ahead and smashes something else. Thats just the sort of guy he is. He's a smasher.<br/><br/>Anyway this movie is awesome. It really really is. The cgi is absolutely brilliant, second only to Iron Man, which is also awesome. Forget about the old hulk movie, I believe they just pretended it never happened and brushed it under the carpet. But they also didn't take an hour explaining the origins of the hulk. Nope, instead they did a simple montage at the beginning that gave you all the info you needed, and filled in the gaps and it went along. much better.<br/><br/>The story unfolds gradually throughout, but the action just keeps smacking you in the face...smash smash smash. You really have to be a kid at heart to like this movie, and I am, so I did.<br/><br/>Also it does indeed confirm the future of the Marvel franchise, which sounds really exciting. I ain't gonna tell you what it is, but if you stayed until the end of Iron Man, after the credits, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Go and watch it, you'll love it."

","Before watching this Hulk movie, I should have taken the time to watch the one released a few years back that was directed by Ang Lee. Instead, I was given the chance to watch this and I had to take it. Seeming that this was going to be one of the year's better films, I thought why not. And it lived up to a lot of its billing.<br/><br/>The origins of the Hulk are given, although not as explained as I would have liked. His fleeing to Brazil in the beginnings of the film do make for some good scenery, including the introduction of Débora Nascimento to the film stage. Though I doubt she will be given a lot of time on the screen for now, she certainly is a beautiful woman and made Liv Tyler pale in comparison.<br/><br/>The action was good, but I thought it was flawed. The military operations against the Hulk just seemed to come out of the blue at times and did not explain it as much as one would hope. Even the final fight seemed a little bit of a mess. Still it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good film. I am hoping I see more of Débora Nascimento in the future. ""B+"""
"djruffin614","5","5","9","24 June 2008"," A sequel that's not a sequel, but acts like one
","""The Incredible Hulk"" accomplished a few things. It gives a lot of nods to the old TV show, brings in some things from the comics, borrows elements from the ""Ultimate Destruction"" video game, and drops cameos and hints to the upcoming Avengers movie. On it's own? It doesn't do too much. Although, Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, and William Hurt offer decent performances, it's not their best.<br/><br/>The story itself is kind of sloppy and very predictable (partially because most of the plot is given away in the trailers). Also, even though it's supposed to be an entirely new film and not a sequel, it kind of plays like a sequel... of a movie that never existed. There's a brief explanation of how Bruce became the Hulk and his relationship with Betty Ross, but not enough to fully understand or to suck you into the story. It rushes through those parts like we're supposed to ""already know"" all that. It even begins where the first movie left off; yet, it's not a sequel!<br/><br/>When the actual Hulk action picks up, you can tell there's some cool stuff happening, but the camera is too erratic, and he Hulk himself is too detailed and animated; moving around way too fast. It loses the realism. That seems to be a problem with CGI these days. It's harder to enjoy the effects when your eyes are trying to keep up with what's going on. Plus, slowing things down a bit can add much more weight, strength, and solidity to characters like the Hulk... especially when mixing CGI with real life.<br/><br/>Overall, as hard as I tried, I couldn't find much to like about ""The Incredible Hulk"" other than the music score. Basically, this movie is made for people who hated the first one; but it actually made me appreciate Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" even more. I was disappointed with the first film because there was too much plot, heart and quiet moments for a movie about a guy who turns into a green monster whenever he gets mad. But, I disliked this movie because it lacked in those same areas. This film tries really hard to distance itself from the first Hulk film, but it might have been easier to make it a straight sequel."
"sherrimichel2004","6","5","9","18 June 2008"," The Increbile Hulk
","As you know, this is not a sequel to 2003's Hulk. It is a much more entertaining film. It is faster moving and more action based than the first one. The three main action sequences are: 1. A chase through a bottle factory 2. A attack at a university and 3. A grand battle between Hulk and the abomination. Other than those sequences, there is not much to recommend. Although the actors are fine, nothing exciting happens when Banner is just Banner. This is the opposite of Marvel's last film Iron Man where the down to earth guy was more entertaining than the hero. Hulk has a paper thin storyline and never really takes itself seriously. It just feels like setup for Marvel's Avengers Projects. P.S.: The Hulk speaks!"
"sloopydrew","6","5","9","17 June 2008"," For the fanboys
","Rebooting a franchise that was unsuccessfully rebooted only 5 years prior seems to be an incredible risk, but The Incredible Hulk proves that Marvel knows their material better than Ang Lee. While Lee's Hulk was a more ambitious, creatively daring picture, it just wasn't the Hulk fans know from the comics. The Incredible Hulk, on the other hand, is as comic-book as a comic-book movie can get. That's not to say it's the best comic-book movie ever made (far from), but by the time it's over you'll be tempted to wipe quad-colored ink from your fingertips.<br/><br/>This is a big, loud celebration of the green behemoth and all the toys that he loves to smash. The first action sequence featuring Hulk himself is one of the better staged action scenes of the summer -- if not the year. The hulking hero is introduced to us just right. He's an angry monster in the shadows. A glimpse of something moving in split second sprints caught only by your peripheral vision. His introduction had me thinking Hulk as a horror movie may be the best idea ever. But that would, once again, go against the Hulk fans know from the comics.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing if not fan service. Stan Lee shows up (in more ways than one). Lou Ferrigno has a memorable moment. They even manage to work in a cameo for deceased actor Bill Bixby. If you're a die-hard fan of the comics and don't like this movie, you accidentally stumbled into Sex and the City.<br/><br/>Marvel goes as far as to make the same mistakes as they do in the comics -- the climax is too hectic to be enthralling and the last 20 minutes are as busy setting up a sequel, a spin-off and a crossover as they are a decent finale to a once entertaining movie. Still, complaints aside, this is a fun movie for the fans and this review could have been just as easily summed up in 2 words: HULK SMASH!"
"pyrocitor","7","5","9","17 June 2008"," Straightforward Hulk finally smashes
","When acclaimed director Ang Lee's cerebral take on comic book antihero the Hulk hit screens in 2003, the reaction was hardly a positive one. Fans of the comic books fumed over the script straying from its source material, whereas critics and audiences alike mused over the effectiveness of the philosophical ruminations in lieu of crowd pleasing action sequences. All of the above criticisms appear to have been taken by Marvel Studios (now producing their own franchises) in stride, revamping and continuing the green behemoth's tale with a more enjoyable, action packed focus and a quality cast. And while The Incredible Hulk may not quite live up to the no holds barred action epic its premise promised, it proves a satisfyingly bombastic smackdown to appease both fans of the comics and audiences alike. <br/><br/>The inherent imbalance in the script lends credulity to rumours of creative disputes between Edward Norton's influence and that of the studio. While opening sequences detailing Banner's fugitive life in Brazil prove breathless, tense and tremendously gripping, taking more than a few notes from the Bourne series, upon returning to the United States, the promising start lags, as continual run ins with the military become increasingly repetitive and unoriginal, with the raucous fun of the periodic Hulk battles now saddled with a flimsy romantic subplot, entirely failing to compliment the intrigue. Here the script begins to falter, tripping over itself during certain crucial emotional moments with contrived lines and confusingly stilted character motivations, while the sidelining of certain characters initially presented as major players (most noticeably Ty Burell's Doc Sampson) reeks of hasty last minute cuts. By the film's obligatory big loud climax, it becomes clear that the creative reigns have shifted - all the prior gritty realism has vanished, replaced with a more conventional and less enjoyable action finish. As the occasional throwaway comic moments (some more effective than others) prevent the film from descending in the realm of melodramatic self importance, the film's primary redeeming factor emerges - despite the steady descent into excess stupidity, it is never afraid to have some fun, the quality Ang Lee's incarnation sorely lacked. <br/><br/>Of course, the primary draw for superhero blockbusters is seldom the screen writing, and Transporter director Louis Leterrier's unapologetic ""smash first talk later"" approach does generate some exhilarating action sequences, but the increasingly unimaginative fight choreography and relative sparsity of action setpieces for an action focused film detracts from the glorious destruction that could have been, the attempted juxtaposition of emotional intensity only slowing the gleeful mayhem. Thankfully, after the paltry CGI in Ang Lee's effort, special effects have been amped up to make this new, grittier Hulk about as close to feasibly photo real as one could hope for, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Norton himself, though certain fluctuating details (the Hulk appears smaller or less muscular at various points) give the impression of patchy continuity, and the movement of both Hulk and monstrous adversary The Abomination appears too mechanically humanoid to properly capture the otherworldly feel of gargantuan muscular mutations - nonetheless, an impressive and exhilarating effort overall. <br/><br/>Despite the laudable use of quality actors over conventional blockbuster stars, even the astutely talented performers prove they can only do so much with such a steadily flimsy script. Edward Norton of course proves the exception, his passion for the project and standard blistering intensity making tortured protagonist Bruce Banner a truly fleshed out and tragic character. Burning with nobility and pathos, his plight genuinely moving and his battle with the monster raging inside of him truly gripping, Norton truly convinces in the crucial role. In contrast, Liv Tyler is saddled with an embarrassing nothing of a role, exemplifying the worst aspects of comic book love interests, with nothing to do but scream the hero's name and stand around statuesquely looking worried - it is a shame to see such a normally talented actress descend to such banality. Tim Roth similarly suffers, infusing tragically two-dimensional antagonist Emil Blonsky with all the steely menace and petty arrogance and ambition he can muster, but his quality is still diminished by the overwhelming predictability of his role. William Hurt is appropriately grim as obsessive general ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, thankfully eschewing the scene chomping which could have resulted all too easily, and Tim Blake Nelson delivers a bout of much needed irreverent goofiness as overeager scientist Samuel Sterns, his brief but enjoyable role hinting at a larger character progression in any ensuing films. Finally, the film's slew of enjoyable cameos do not disappoint, from comical Stan Lee and Lou Ferringo appearances to the highly anticipated Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man lead Tony Stark, a fitting and classy way of bridging the gap between superhero franchises as well as planting further seeds for the upcoming Avengers film. <br/><br/>While the film may disappointingly fall short of its true potential, comic book fans can breathe a hearty sigh of relief that the green behemoth has been firmly returned to his less philosophical and more action filled roots. If nothing else, Leterrier's more singular vision is laudable, never losing track of its true intent: even during the fumbling between dramatic clout and exhilarating action, the film never fails to entertain. While the superb cast may flounder with underwritten characters, Norton's incendiary lead performance and the enthusiastic action sequences make The Incredible Hulk a solid edition into the realm of guilt-free summer entertainment - despite the criticisms, Hulk finally smashes. <br/><br/>-7/10"

If ever there was an actor who was good at portraying tortured souls, characters with inner demons, it's Norton. So why does his try at the ultimate tortured soul with the mother of all inner demons not work? I think that's the question that'll hang over this film.<br/><br/>The highlights are Tyler, the emotional heart of the film. She and Norton have a chemistry, but even this can't seem to light the film up any. Roth also shows his talent and brings an essentially two dimensional character to life, until he vanishes under a tonne of CG.<br/><br/>The effects are good and well used. The direction is okay. The action scenes (certainly the first two big chases are), but the finale is poor and doesn't live up to what's come before.<br/><br/>The film seems to try to make a fresh start, including a montage at the start covering the origin story as it now stands.

","If this version of the Incredible Hulk was done in the fashion of an animated cartoon perhaps I would have liked it better. Graphic artists really know how to draw monsters.<br/><br/>Here the monsters look like some kind of monster suit a kid might get for Halloween. They are so obviously artificial! The special effects of the monsters throwing cars about also seem ridiculously artificial. Am I being picky expecting a comic book character to appear realistic? Well, they did it in the original TV series. They used a simple technique. Instead of costumes (or whatever) the TV series used super-sized Lou Ferrigno as the hulk, just painting his skin green. But a Ferrigno sized hulk apparently was too small for the makers of this film.<br/><br/>In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit I am not a big fan of action films. There are some I liked, including about everything by Quentin Tarentino. I liked Superman and Batman films, but got bored by too many sequels. But the main reason I wanted to see the Incredible Hulk was to see how the they handled the transformation, expecting something outstanding what with all the technology advances made in the past decade."

","Dr David Banner is hiding out in Brazil having fled the military unit led by General Ross who wish to study his genetic mutation and utilise it to create a race of super soldiers. Banner continues his studies into a possible cure for his condition with the discrete help of the mysterious scientist Mr Blue. A slip up in the bottling plant that Banner works alerts Ross to his presence and in goes a small unit led by Major Blonsky to tranquilise him and take him into custody. However when Blonsky and his men trap Banner in the plant, Banner's pulse races and soon Blonsky learns firsthand why Banner is such an important asset to Ross.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk was sold as more of a blockbuster experience than the Ang Lee film was and from the very start this approach is laid out in the rapid back story in the credits. This continues across the whole film with some good sequences, comic book references for the fans and plenty of impressive special effects. What that does for you will depend on you but for my money it produced a solid summer blockbuster which is much like Iron Man in construction  ie it doesn't pretend to have ""substance"" or complexity in the way the Batman franchise reboot does. Instead it is all about the basic blocks that make up the film and delivering those in a way that is fun without being too demanding or too complex. Hulk delivers on this and has plenty of good action that are greatly helped by the effects being very good indeed, with the decisions made about the look and size of the Hulk working to stop it being silly. Without a doubt it is a ""money up there on the screen"" sort of affair.<br/><br/>Having said that though, essentially this does mean that the film comes down to big computer effects hitting one another with New York City taking its traditional summer-time pasting and it did make me wonder about Norton's involvement. I respect him a lot as an actor and his scenes do appear to suggest that he sees more in the material than comes across on the screen. As it is he must have spent more of his time doing motion capture than doing on-screen acting and while his presence suggests that he has ideas of depth, nothing worthy of him is forthcoming. The opposite is true of Tyler, who is perfect for this material-light film but is not still that impressive. Roth was a strange bit of casting but he works in his character and is convincing in his transformation. Hurt and Nelson are both good additions who I assume more will come from. The cameos are not too obtrusive (although why can't Stan Lee do more of background cameo) and it is really hard for me to fault a film that gives a bit of time for Williams  who even in ""normal"" clothes as he was here will always be Omar from The Wire.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is not a particularly dark or interesting film but, like Iron Man it is a fun and energetic comic-book film with good effects, good action and a general sense of good humour running through it. It won't blow you away outside of the realms of being a summer blockbuster but for what it does it is a perfectly enjoyable film."

","The Incredible Hulk was one of the best movies I have seen this year. It was definitely the best action movie this year. It was by far the best superhero movie and comic movie I have ever seen. The movie is not a big disappointment from all the hype. People might think it was way to over hyped but not me. I wasn't looking to forward to it but wanted to see it. So I decided to go to the midnight showing and it was so worth my money. I want to go see it again already. This is a movie you don't get sick of after seeing once. The action sequences were so loud and well written. They didn't have to much action about just as much as you would see in Iron Man or Spider Man. The story in this movie though was amazing. The story was very well explained. The movie started out write away with them explaining what went wrong and how Edward Norton became the hulk. This one was way better than the first Hulk they made. This movie probably had one of the best battles in any movie at the end when The good Hulk faced off against the bad. They made the Hulk look so good. I think that the visuals and special effects were so amazing. Especially each time they had action scenes. The action scenes went on for a long time and were very fun to watch. The acting was very good as well. Edward Norton did an amazing job playing the hulk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job then Edward Norton did. Liv Tyler did a good job also playing the hulks girlfriend. She didn't have a ton of screen time but when she did she made the best of it. Everyone else did a great job as well. I don't think their were any flaws at all really. The only one I could possibly think of is that it kind of drug on toward the end. They made it seem like it was going to end and then it went on. The movie was well acted, loud, fun, entertaining, and was great for all ages. I think that even older people can enjoy it and even late teens. The language was not very bad for kids. All and all this was such an amazing movie go see it. It is well worth your money and well worth the hype."

","The Incredible Hulk, is a reboot, not a sequel, to Ang Lee's misunderstood masterpiece, The Hulk. For this version Louis Leterrier, took the reigns. With screen writer, hackerr, I mean Zak Penn doing the ""screenplay."" I am not really a Hulk fan at all. Even during my misspent youth as a comic book junkie, I was just never into the Hulk. But even for me this film was a joke, a slap in the face really. Allow me to analyze why this is.<br/><br/>The screenplay sucks. It is really nothing but an homage to the campy 70's series. That I have seen in reruns. And it was terrible, so is there any wonder that this film is a poor crop at best? With bad lines, like ""It's like a bad acid-trip."" When describing what is like to be The Hulk, gone is the eloquent description from the good Hulk film. And how about, ""I can't control it, maybe I can aim it."" Right before Banner jumps out of a plane. Despite the fact that he may not turn into the Hulk, and may be committing suicide.Speaking of Banner, the cast sucks in, The Incredible Hulk. Which is odd, seeing as most the actors in the film are usually quite capable.<br/><br/>Take Edward Norton for example, he is normally a good actor, just watch, Fight Club, and you will see what I mean. Yet in this he is terrible. Largely due to a poor script, which interestingly enough, Norton, re-wrote. I shudder to think how bad it must have been before the revision. Liv Tyler, does little as Betty Ross, largely due to this film keeping her as a flat, one dimensional character. Unlike Jennifer Connolly's version of Betty in the superior Hulk film. Tim Roth, is a great actor, and very talented especially when playing the villain. But in this tripe, he comes off as clichéd and uninspired at best. And as far as I can tell, his version of, The Abomination is a far cry from the original character.<br/><br/>And why did they even have Samuel Sterns character in this? For those who don't know, and I think that is probably most people who liked this ""film,"" Sterns, eventually becomes the villain, known as The Leader. So he is only here to set up a sequel. Because we really need more bad sequels to bad films from Hollywood. Further, Bull is that the few nitwits that did not like, The Dark Knight, complain how that film sets up the sequel. Yet no one makes this complaint with this Hulk garbage. And a Hulk fan, friend of mine assures me, that the way they made him become, The Leader, is complete crap, and not like the comic series at all.<br/><br/>Ironically all the impatient unintelligent people who liked this crap-fest of a film. Always go on about how the better Hulk film was not good because there was not enough action. Yet there is very little in this one. There are only three, yes, three action scenes in this. And unlike The Hulk, they are poorly shot in this film, and bland and boring. Odd considering the director has experience with action films.<br/><br/>Worse are the ""story"" parts of the movie. Not only are they poorly shot, to the point where as a middle school student could do better, but they are poorly written, and stiffly acted out, By actors who must have needed the cash, because there performances lack and real emotion, or talent. On top of that, the situations are so damn lame, that I often found myself almost laughing. <br/><br/>I mean come on, they find Banner, because he bleeds on a soda bottle? Why would anyone think to check for the blood type? And if they did they would never link it to Banner without a sample of his blood. And then they would have to compare it directly to his. But why the bloody hell (No pun intended.-MM-) would they even consider doing this? When they have no reason to think or believe that it is Banner's? Zak Penn must know little to nothing about pathology. I would liken it to ""Grey's Anatomy"" but that would be an insult to fans of that show.<br/><br/>Let's face it, the superhero genre is so over saturated, that there is little reason to watch this film. There are so many better films in this sub-genre alone. Like: Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, The Hulk, and even the flawed, Watchmen. So why would any one waste their time with this celluloid trash? This incarnation of the Hulk, is barley as good as stinkers like: Daredevil, Ghost Rider, and Batman and Robin. Even if you are an action film junkie there are so many better choices. Go rent a John Woo film.(Hard-Boiled, or The Killer preferably.-MM-) Hell, watching the old Hulk show is better than this drivel.<br/><br/>As hard as they tried to make this like that show. They even failed to surpass even that level of campy. I saw, The Incredible Hulk, for free. Yet I still wish I could get my money back. Better yet, I wish this crap had never been made. That way at least poor old Hulk could have had at least one good film adaptation.<br/><br/>(1.0 out of 10. And that is being very generous, this crap deserves a 0.0. But IMDb, does not allow it.)"

It's made with absolutely no spirit at all, bland as a mouthful of flour. The story is extraordinary simple, the acting is wooden and characters act stupid more often than not (even the non-hulky ones), the music sounds as if stolen from any number of previous movies.<br/><br/>Sit this one out and wait for yet another sequel, one day they have to do it right."

Perhaps due to high expectations, the movie left me expecting much more.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good super hero flick, see The Dark Knight  a superior show in every respect. Although Iron Man was not as good as the Dark Knight, it was also substantially better than this movie.<br/><br/>While the movie did not get off to an overly poor start, it quickly lost its footing. It became slow during the sappy portions of the film. While I generally like Liv Tyler, I found her miscast in this movie. She just does not strike me as the academic type.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't all bad. Edward Norton was good as always.

And the first appearance of that second monster Blonsky is done like Cloverfield - makes you participate in this chaos. 10 out of ten for comics done right.

"MaxBorg89","7","4","7","24 June 2008"," Pardon the pun, but this is incredibly good!
","X-Men: big franchise. Spider-Man: ditto. In fact, even Fantastic Four was granted a sequel. But not good old Hulk: despite the best efforts on behalf of director Ang Lee and a cast that included Eric Bana and Nick Nolte, the green giant's big screen outing, though lauded by most critics and, to lesser extent, fans, wasn't big enough at the box office to convince Universal another installment was a good idea. Now, with the studio merely distributing (Marvel itself threw in the cash, which is also why there are no legal obstacles to having other characters from different comics in the film - more on that later) and a completely renewed cast and crew, The Incredible Hulk is a noble and for the most part successful attempt to reboot the series, a bit like Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Technically, this is not a sequel to Lee's film (the opening montage depicts a completely different explanation for the Hulk's origin), but it is indicated that five years have passed since Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) disappeared from the United States (and there is a five-year gap between the release of the two movies), and the story begins in South America, where the previous version ended. To be more specific, Banner is hiding in Brazil, trying to control his rage and having no contact with the outside world, except for occasional e-mails with a certain Mr. Blue (Banner calls himself Mr. Green, obviously), who might succeed in finding a cure for the protagonist's condition. But while he may avoid others, others are looking for him, and a radiation-related accident (which has to do with Stan Lee's mandatory appearance) enables General Ross (William Hurt) to locate him and send a team, led by the slightly insane Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), to get him. The rest of the plot is rather basic: Banner is on the run, he becomes the Hulk on a few occasions, returns to the US and has no ally besides Mr. Blue and old flame Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Oh, and did I mention Blonsky decides to become a monster himself in order to bring a little fairness to the game?<br/><br/>The script, which is largely influenced by the '70s TV show, with the addition of Bruce Jones' comic-book cycle (the Mr. Blue subplot is lifted from his arc), aims to solve the one problem many think caused Lee's take on the subject to alienate fans: there was too much psychology/emotion, not enough action (some people made the same remark about Superman Returns). For that reason, hiring The Transporter director Louis Leterrier seemed like a logical choice, although there was doubt regarding his ability to handle what little ""deeper material"" there has to be in a picture like this. That he succeeds is nearly all thanks to Norton: not only does he play Banner with a conviction few would have in a role like this (then again, he's already dealt with multiple personalities in Primal Fear and Fight Club), but he also co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn (the sole credited writer), his deep knowledge of the comic proving a great asset when it comes to finding the right mixture of action, drama and humor (the ""hungry/angry"" joke is one of the best). But this isn't just Norton's movie: Roth, the actor formerly known as Mr. Orange, is joyously manic, and Tim Blake Nelson's sequel-suggesting presence comes close to marvelous.<br/><br/>Any complaints? Actually, yes: Tyler, despite her fair share of blockbuster experience, brings very little of significance to her character, not counting a couple of scenes, and the inevitable climactic showdown between ""hero"" and villain could have been reduced by at least five minutes. But hey, at least we get a Hulk that looks a lot better than the ""poor man's Shrek"" seen in the 2003 version. Plus, he finally utters the famous line ""Hulk smash!"" (with Lou Ferrigno's voice, no less). That, in addition to a really great cameo by Robert Downey Jr. (which, unlike Sam Jackson's role in Iron Man, has not become a post-credits ""surprise""), indicates that if a second (or third, depending on how you interpret the connection between the films) movie gets made, it's gonna be pretty, well, incredible."
"jctundis","8","4","7","21 June 2008"," At last we can forget the Ang Lee debacle!
","Ahhh... at last I have a Hulk movie that I'll be happy (and able) to watch again.<br/><br/>The new Incredible Hulk is, first and foremost, an action movie. It's not Iron Man (which is a phrase that you'll probably see again and again as more Marvel movies are released). I gave Hulk an 8, while Iron Man got a 10.<br/><br/>Once again, Marvel has created a hybrid movie combining elements of the Ultimate Universe (most notably the origin), mainstream Marvel Universe and the classic TV show starring the late Bill Bixby (there are several nods to the show including the theme song and an appearance - and voice work - by Lou Ferrigno).<br/><br/>How does the CGI stand up? Much better than the Lee film. The daylight scenes are very impressive - and there is a scene in a rainstorm that is absolutely brilliant! No lame gamma-irradiated poodles in this one, folks.<br/><br/>What I'm really looking forward to now is the Blu-Ray release which will have all of the Edward Norton penned scenes (many of which constituted the original trailer) restored. The one thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher score was the feeling of ""pulling back"" from dramatic scenes. Norton is brilliant as Banner (as he is in most movies) and the dramatic punch that he will bring to the full length release fills me with anticipation. This is hinted at in a few poignant scenes before the viewer is thrust back into the action - and what action it is, especially when Tim Roth hits the screen.<br/><br/>I really hope Norton returns - a situation that is in doubt - and picks up with the villain that long time Hulk fans will recognize as being created during this film.<br/><br/>After being disgusted by the 3rd installments of Spider-Man and X-Men, I am fully on board with these new Marvel Studios productions. Bring on Thor, Captain America and The Avengers! HULK SMASH!"

"isabelle1955","Null","4","7","19 June 2008"," Good Stuff!!
","I have to admit that the only reason we went to see this movie was because we couldn't quite believe that Edward Norton had made it. Norton is an interesting and hugely talented actor, and as far as I'm concerned he's never made a bad film. I loved him in Keeping the Faith, in American History X (an intensely powerful film), in Fight Club, in The Painted Veil, in The Illusionist.. the list goes on. And he seems to have resisted over exposure in the media, which makes him all the more interesting. Cute too <br/><br/>And the main reason this adaptation of The Incredible Hulk works is because of Norton. He brings such intense vulnerability and credibility to the role of Bruce Banner that the audience is filled with sympathy for the guy right from the start, which keeps us interested even through the fairly predictable special effects scenes where Banner becomes the Green Eyed monster /hero of the title and smashes everything in sight. I haven't seen any of the other iterations of this comic book character beyond a half watched TV episode or two many years back, so I can't make valid comparisons to Ang Lee's version and must review it as an entity by itself. But I thought this film extremely well cast, well written (Zak Penn) and well put together. It was a very pleasant surprise, as I hadn't expected much of it. Comparing this incarnation of The Hulk to the 4th Indiana Jones movie which I saw a couple of weeks ago, is pretty easy. This is a vastly superior film in every way. <br/><br/>The opening sequences of the chase through the Brazilian favela are extremely well done; we get a real feel for the claustrophobic narrowness of the streets and the tough life of the inhabitants, as Banner runs for his life from the US Special Forces team who want to capture him for weapons research. I was gripped. I was interested. I was convinced. I wanted him to escape and I was totally drawn in. I thought this was one of the better chase scenes I've seen recently in a movie. Contrast that to the yawn inducing car chases in Indy 4, where I glanced at my watch thinking ""How much more can they possibly string this out?"" <br/><br/>Back in the USA Banner hooks up with ex girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler in the best role I've seen her in for a long time. The female love interest in an action movie isn't going to win anyone an Oscar nomination, but she made the most of it) and their scenes are played out with a surprising degree of tenderness and occasional humour (anger isn't the only thing to raise Bruce's pulse rate). Surprising? Well yes. These special effects driven films are not usually noted for their convincing emotional content. This was well done without  I hope  alienating the young male audience who seem to be the Holy Grail for Hollywood producers. <br/><br/>William Hurt's villainous General Ross was matched only by Tim Roth's wicked and egotistical Emil Blonsky who morphs into The Abomination, a guy who makes The Hulk look cuddly. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and it came in briskly at a little under 2 hours rather than the obligatory 3 hours which nowadays seems to turn every action movie into cinematic purgatory. Good stuff!"
"briguy128","7","4","7","18 June 2008"," Hulk Smash!
","And smash he does. Let me first off say that anyone expecting intelligence, a sophisticated plot, and well-developed characters should look elsewhere, because The Incredible Hulk has none of those things. However, those hoping to see some exciting action, a touch of romance, and a lot of the big green guy tearing sh** up will find this very enjoyable. This is a pure matinée popcorn flick, the kind that Ang Lee's 2003 movie should have been but wan't. And in that respect, it is great! In terms of a hero movie, The Incredible Hulk probably isn't as satisfying as, say, Iron Man or Batman Begins, but it's up there. I for one am relieved to have finally seen a faithful adaptation of the Hulk. Let's face it, he's not that complex of a hero. He gets mad, he throws a tantrum, he smashes things. Your inner little boy will be grinning. Enjoy."
"Astralan","7","4","7","17 June 2008"," Has it's points, but...
","I have to admit, I really don't know why I went to this. In a venue saturated with CGI and somewhat crappy scripts and story lines, this installment over what was released just 5 years ago seems somewhat nonsensical. On top of that, Louis Leterrier has only directed only 2 films in his carer: Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and The Transporter II. Granted, both films merit a smile and a nod for actually being quite good films, however to hand over $150+ (which is incredible seeing at least almost 1/2 the film is done in CGI) seems also a little nonsensical in this case. It just seems to me that these movies are quickly becoming ordinary and harder to watch unless there are some great innovations in them, or at least a solid story line and a good ending.<br/><br/>I like Ed Norton in this role though. At times you could see some striking resemblances to Bill Bixby at moments, and his mannerisms are more in tune with the original Bruce Banner character. I'll state right here that I am not going to do cross platform comparisons with all the various Hulk remakes and episodes, sorry. Liv Tyler seems a bit sappy in her role. I think she gets picked because she knows how to squirt those tears when needed, and on demand, and I didn't know what to make of William Hurt as her estranged father. Try as he might, I just can't see him in a ""tough guy"" situation.<br/><br/>The CGI is probably what takes this movie into a more plausible realm. In the beginning, you meet Bruce banner, and there is a counter for the important scene changes that tell you how long it's been since his last ""episode"". The director brings in Hulk fairly early, but they leave him in shadows for the most part, only delivering the objects of his rampaging to the audience. This movie really has no start or finish, it is more like we are dropped in as observers into a struggle that aspires to be normal but seems to be a futile objective, and when we finally get Hulk so steamed up to yell the famous ""HULK SMASH"", it comes across climactic, but lacks that which should be sending electricity through your body.<br/><br/>And that, for me about sums it up: It just didn't give me a charge. It was OK to watch, actually it was much better than the 2003 remake, but as far as being up there with this year Iron Man *cough* (could be the closest thing to a spoiler I can get to) *cough*, but probably by far not the worst movie we will see this year. The audience was quiet throughout the viewing, which also supports my lack of charge contention. Let us hope that they don't remake this one for at least another 20 years. Maybe by then we will go HOLO!"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","7","17 June 2008"," Incredible Movie
","Poised in a helicopter high above the city, prepared to risk perhaps certain death in saving it, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) tells the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), ""Betty, I've gotta try"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" is the compelling hero story reinvented with a yearning love story in the foreground. The action is visually enthralling, and the Hulk himself is amazingly ferocious with ripped muscles and veins. Unlike the previous incarnation, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a sense of humanity and pathos. Director Louis Leterrier (of the ""Transporter"" movies) and Writer Zak Penn (of the ""X-Men"" movies) have reinvented ""The Incredible Hulk"" as an exploration into the darkness of human nature all in the context of a brilliantly orchestrated action movie. Understandably, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is based on a comic book which had the pretense of retelling the story of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". However, there is something noble in Bruce Banner's (Norton) journey to control the great anger and power within himselfThe Hulk. In that regard-- Edward Norton is powerful. His compelling performance humanizes and breathes compassion for a man coming to terms with his own darkness. Thankfully, those who saw Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" can finally forgive the sins of the predecessor.<br/><br/>Leterrier and Penn's story begins with Banner in self-imposed seclusion in Rio de Janeiro. Recall that scientist Bruce Banner exposed himself to gamma rays as part of experiments for the military. However, something went horribly wrong during a transient gamma ray exposure. Under great duress or anger Bruce transforms into the green skinned beastThe Hulk. The Hulk is a seemingly mindless enigma of rage and destruction. Bruce must find a cure for his affliction. In Brazil, Bruce may have made peace with the raging beast within. He meditates. He trains with his Brazilian Jujitsu Sensei (martial arts great Rickson Gracie) to find his path. Sensei tells Bruce, ""To control your anger, you must control your body."" Bruce works odd jobs at a bottling factory, while researching his own cure. His only regret in self imposed exile was forsaking his true love, Betty Ross (Tyler).<br/><br/>While Bruce may have found some peace the world, the rest of the world will not let him be. In particular, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), who regards Bruce as missing government property, is determined to hunt Bruce and The Hulk down. Even Bruce realizes that he inadvertently participated in a covert ""weapon"" conspiracy. General Ross enlists the talents of expert soldier Emil Blonsky (cold blooded Tim Roth). The singular focused and ambitious Emil is not entirely what he seems. Realizing he is overmatched in capturing The Hulk, Emil willingly volunteers for an experimental ""super soldier"" program, so he can engage The Hulk. This of course leads to the unexpected outcome: The Abominationa creature perhaps stronger than The Hulk.<br/><br/>The battle scenes with General Ross's army and The Hulk are visually stunning-- thunderous mayhem. Leterrier gets his job done. The battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is dramatic spectacle. My bud Ron, pointed out that their battle is reminiscent in scale of Godzilla, but sans the camp. Through all this Liv Tyler as Betty grounds the story with an emotional resonance. There is a quietly touching moment when Betty distinguishes Bruce in a bar and a great scene when she embraces Bruce in the down pouring rain. Edward Norton's quiet power is the soul of ""The Incredible Hulk"". Liv Tyler is its heart. She brilliantly captures Betty's resounding regret, knowing she can never be with the man she loves. Edward Norton embodies the hero's courage and nobility. He is awesome. Also amazing is William Hurt as General Ross, who will sacrifice his very humanity and family to obtain his objective. Hurt brings a keen focus and unmatched duplicity.<br/><br/>Amidst the epic scale action, ""The Incredible Hulk"" tells the compelling story of a man's search for peace within himselfthe noblest of pursuits. Leterrier and Penn reinvent a classic hero tale. Edward Norton is powerful and amazing. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a great movie."

I'm pretty sure the FX guys created muscles to add onto the Hulk's already massive build.<br/><br/>The beginning is actually the most solid part of the film, as the filmmakers do a very nice job of showing the lengths Dr. Banner has went to in order to steady his excitement factor. Though moving to Brazil  a country fraught with smoking hot babes  and working in a factory  with all sorts of dangerous equipment  might not be the best choice.<br/><br/>Of course the sh!t hits the fan and Banner is forced to leave South America and head home. Once he arrives home, he meets up with the sexy Liv Tyler and plans to meet a fellow scientist who may be able to cure his affliction. But General Ross and Emil Blonsky have different ideas, and make it very difficult for Banner to do anything...without getting very, very irritated.<br/><br/>The Abomination is revealed at the film's climax and the action that fills the film is monstrous to say the least. Big explosions, big punches, and big roars fill this movie! So why is it a little disappointing? The writing is not very good, the FX wane, dumb choices are made, and it seemed rushed at times.<br/><br/>Why is it good? Very mean looking Hulk. He is truly a monster. And because of the Abomination, and Tim Roth. Roth will always play a great bad guy.<br/><br/>So you see, this film is pretty damn good. But I thought the first was also pretty damn good (better as a comic book stylized film), so..see it for your self.<br/><br/>ALSO: It has the best cameo of the year by ease. No not Stan Lee.

They've left me heading out of the theaters totally blown away.<br/><br/>I haven't really been a follower of the hulk comics, and after seeing Ang Lee's take on the Hulk I wasn't so sure if this would be a good movie. Iron Man was a great movie, but I was felt that the Hulk just wasn't an interesting superhero.<br/><br/>I was with some friends today just killing time, and we were at the theaters. They suggested we see the hulk, but I wasn't so sure about it. I argued and told them it was probably going to be a bad movie. After some debating I finally reluctantly went to see the green man.<br/><br/>I groaned watching the first few minutes, because they reminded me a little of the 2003 film. However, as the film continued I was mesmerized by the fast paced and interesting story. No scene felt boring, and all of the scenes felt useful in connecting the story.<br/><br/>Instead of going deep into the Hulk's origins, like the 2003 film did, this version explored Bruce Banner trying to find a cure and get rid of the hulk. This film's story worked great, and Edward Norton did excellent portraying all the emotions that Bruce Banner went through being the hulk. The anger, the frustration, the disappointment, and the hope were all acted out skillfully by Norton.<br/><br/>Norton was helped out by the awesome job done by the supporting cast. William Hurt did awesome as the ruthless general, Liv Tyler was exceptional and really showed Betty Ross's love for Bruce Banner. Tim Roth did alright, I thought he could've been more aggressive though.<br/><br/>The first film, I believe, lacked in action, this film doesn't at all lack in action. Norton's great acting made me feel for Banner, and then when the action happened I was on the edge of my seat. The chase scene in this film is one of the greatest chase scenes I've ever seen. Thanks to the wonderful cinematography this film's action truly stand out from the first film.<br/><br/>The CGI was alright, but I personally felt they could've made it look better. I wasn't disappointed by the Hulk, but I didn't exactly feel fear when looking at the green man. However, the CGI in the movie was by no means bad. I was amazed by a few scenes in this movie, and I really had fun watching this.<br/><br/>The little cameo at the end was really interesting, because it left a lot of options opened for film makers to work with in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Finally, when I got off my seat 117 minutes later, I can safely say I was wrong and I was completely blown away by this movie. This film delivered, and it delivered beautifully. After releasing a terrible film like Spiderman 3, Marvel has been revived in my eyes.<br/><br/>This is definitely Marvel's summer, and with films like Hancock and the dark knight coming up this looks like an awesome year for superhero movies!"
"TheMechanic11","8","4","7","16 June 2008"," A slight improvement
","First thing's first: I don't care what anyone says, I liked the Ang Lee movie from 5 years ago. I liked that it was more of a story about human tragedy, and less of what you'd expect from your average comic-book flick. Jump forward to now, and you have this version of Hulk, which is everything the first version maybe should have been. But there's a trade-off: the strength of the Lee version was that it was character-driven, whereas this version is entirely action-oriented. Edward Norton (another genius casting decision by Marvel) is more effective and believable as Dr. Bruce Banner, than the rugged and pretty-boyish Eric Bana from the Lee version. William Hurt's ""Thunderbolt"" Ross is a draw with Sam Eilliot's, but for Betty Ross, Liv Tyler was the only mistake. She was your typical damsel in distress, whereas Jennifer Connelly's was such a stronger-willed character. With the exception of Tyler, I liked this Hulk better than the Lee version, but only a by hair. Though it lacks character development, the action is incredibly fun and should please those that were looking for it in the Lee version."

I think that is all right to enjoy both, though they are different interpretations, they both were quite satisfying to me....now if I could only find me a Betty Ross, and I wouldn't have to watch my temper, worry about my ragged clothes, or the dark lair I live in."
"casinoclouds","9","4","7","16 June 2008"," Way better than Ang Lee's version, a great adaption of the Incredible Hulk
","OK, so I want to start out saying that everyone needs to remove Ang Lee's The Hulk back in 2003 from their memories forever, because Louis Leterrier is the man by pretty much telling Humpback Mountain director to shove it elsewhere with his adaption to the Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>As soon as the movie started, I loved it more already. Edward Norton was by far the best choice for Bruce Banner over Eric Bana (whom I don't have a problem with, he just doesn't fit the Bruce Banner profile). And Liv Tyler was a great Betty Ross. I've been a fan of both William Hurt and Tim Roth for a very long time, so I was pretty stoked to see them in this as well.<br/><br/>Also, Hulk looked way more realistic than Lee's. It's still CGI, of course, but it didn't look like a cartoon in a live action film. I was quite impressed with Louis Leterrier since I wasn't a fan of the Transporter movies, but I decided to give him a chance because he has more experience in the action genre compared to Ang Lee.<br/><br/>I also like how they actually stuck to the storyline of the comic. The last one was way screwed up, making Banner's father Absorbing Man, which is completely false. The Abomination looked intense!!! Tim Roth did an amazing job, and I love seeing him as a villain.<br/><br/>It wasn't a better comic book film than Iron Man, but it's right below it as far as being one of the best Marvel Comic's ever made.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. Everyone involved did an outstanding job. So with that, I give it 9 out of 10."
"Norway1","7","4","7","16 June 2008"," MUCH better than I even hoped!
","After watching the first couple of trailers for this I was very unimpressed and even began to doubt (big time) that this would be any good. Thank goodness I was SO wrong!<br/><br/>Let me start by admitting I actually liked HULK (2003) aside from Nick Nolte and the last 10 minutes or so. Sure, it was a little short on action and heavy on drama, but I thought the effects were awesome and the acting very good.<br/><br/>This Hulk blows that one completely away! It is so much better I couldn't even believe it! Maybe the reason I liked it so much was because of my very low expectations but this movie delivered in every way a comic-book movie should!<br/><br/>Before watching I read the first 15 or so comments here on IMDb to see how people were reacting. Most of them positive, there were still a handful of negative reviews that had me questioning. However after seeing the film I must wonder what those people expected. I just can't imagine it being any better! Seriously. It freaking rocked!<br/><br/>Marvel, I can't wait for more!<br/><br/>If you want to compare your tastes with mine, here's my opinion of some other comic book films (rating out of 10)... Spider-man: 8 ::: Spidey 2: 9 ::: Spidey 3: 5 ::: X-Men: 7 ::: X2: 8 ::: X3: 7 ::: Superman Returns: 4 ::: Batman Begins: 9 ::: Iron Man: 9 ::: Hulk (2003): 6 ::: The Incredible Hulk: 8"
"TiiR27","8","4","7","15 June 2008"," It's all the Hulk should be.
","Not the best movie ever made, but it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The performances are all quite good, Tim Roth's in particular. Though his character isn't overly deep, his acting certainly makes him interesting. Norton's portrayal is pretty monotonous and boring, but considering the character he's playing is a scientist that's trying to keep himself from getting excited, it works.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are well done, and really the best part of the movie. Why else were you going to see a Hulk movie anyway? A slo-mo running scene (which you see in the commercials) seems a bit cheesy, but it's not overdone so I can look past it.<br/><br/>The CGI... could have been better. But this is a movie where the main character is CG, he has a lot of screen time, therefore you have a lot of time to examine him, and any CG will be clearly fake after that much examination. He's a big green monster, I don't expect him to look real anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty good. The story of the Hulk isn't a great one in my opinion, and they've done about the best they could with it. It would work for someone coming in fresh, but has plenty of geeky tidbits for the nerds like me."
"lossieit","9","4","7","15 June 2008"," Great Movie
","Great film 100% better than the first one thank you Louis Leterrier and Zak Penn. I won't give anything away but the acting was great Edward Norton plays Bruce banner very well and Liv Tyler is hot. In parts it was a little over the top but you have to expect this with this type of film. I would recommend anyone to go and see it even if you was not keen on the first Hulk film as you will be surprised. I always thought the incredible hulk was David Banner until I googled it and found David was the guy from TV series and Bruce is the one from out of the comics. I wonder why the TV series did not just call him Bruce. Go and see it you won't be disappointed"
"dbborroughs","8","4","7","15 June 2008"," If Marvel hit a home run with Iron Man, this is a solid triple.
","Essentially a sequel to both the last film (Banner was in the jungle at the end of Ang Lee's film) and the TV series (Lou Ferigno and Bill Bixby have cameos and we hear the theme music) the film is also a restart of it all.<br/><br/>As the film opens Banner is is Brazil working to try and find a cure for his problem. When the military shows up to capture him he flees and eventually heads home so that he can make contact with a scientist who is helping him via the internet. Much damage ensues.<br/><br/>The action scenes are spectacular and much better than I thought they would be. Its great that even though we are watching what are often CGI characters running around we still have a sense of danger. Betty or any other puny human could very easily get hurt. The battles are not neat affairs and there is considerable collateral damage which plays out in little pieces on TV screens and else where once the battles are over. The battles are also epic in ways that only movies and comic books can be. Hulk is larger than life and what happens when he is engaged in battle is too.<br/><br/>The real joy here are the characters which are invest with real weight. I've been reading the comic for decades and this is the first time that General Ross wasn't one dimensional.Kudos to William Hurt for giving us a real character. Tim Roth is a blast as Blonsky/The abomination. The real story here is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and Edward Norton as Banner/The Hulk. We feel the weight of their relationship. We feel the love they have and that they are joined forever together. Its amazing. The feelings they have is the reason that much of the film has a real emotional weight. Its nice to have the Hulk smash things but at the same time we care about the characters. We feel the pain in the Hulks eyes when he realizes Betty is in danger. we feel the anger when someone hurts her. Its adds greatly to the film.<br/><br/>When the film is ""on"", which is most of the time, its one of the best comic films ever made.Its not just action and heroes its people and characters with real emotion. Much of the film is right on target.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that at times action sacrifices character and a clear plot. We're dropped into the action in such away as to make us feel that we're missing something. Yes 45 years of the comic, the TV incarnations and the Ang Lee film sort of fill things in, but at the same time its coming in on chapter two of a serial. There is also the publicized battle between Marvel and Edward Norton.Norton wanted a longer more thoughtful film and Marvel wanted this action packed cut. Give me Norton's cut. I could be wrong but there are several times as we jumped through time and space or from action scene to action scene, I got the sense that something was missing. More than once I thought a little something was lost- details mostly- that could have strengthened or deepened what we saw. For all I know this maybe the best cut of the film, but at the same time since the action works because of the characters and plot I think that the 15 or 20 minutes that Marvel chopped out could only make things better.<br/><br/>Yes I liked it. Yes I frequently said-out loud- ""thats it thats it they got it right"". Yes it moved me.<br/><br/>Go see it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 (maybe a little less but not enough so you'd notice)"
"raimorio","8","4","7","15 June 2008"," a superb action flick
","I had the pleasant opportunity to see this movie last night in the theater. If you need a quick answer this is it: It is a movie of quality. It contains superb acting, top notch CGI, good plot (although differing a little from the original comic book version) and it is nicely directed.<br/><br/>I know most of you will like/like the Ironman more. I personally liked this more because in the ironman there wasn't enough ""superhero"" action. There was action etc but it just didn't go much on the superhero side of action in ironman. In Hulk there's an appropriate amount of action and it is cooler than in Ironman. In Ironman he didn't use his superpowers much. If you compare for example the final battle's of these movies you will know the difference.<br/><br/>There is something in this movie that makes it a quality movie. I could say that it has ""that"" something. Much like Ironman did. I tried to figure out what it was. I've heard that the first Hulk movie starring Eric Bana had the same budget as this movie, but the first one ended up being totally mediocre. I can't point any single thing that makes these movies great, they just simply appear to be made of quality. Guess in the end you have to give creds to the director and the actors. Give any script to a good director and he will turn it into something much greater, give a good script to a bad director and it ends up being cr*p.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this movie is made of quality in every aspect. It absorbs you in from the moment it starts. It's fast paced. You feel for the main character. There's a sip of humor in it that works. The actors do a great job, especially Edward Norton and Liv Tyler(I would marry her anyday, she is so cute when she speaks or is sad, she looks like she really cares). Edward Norton is basically the best actor on this planet for this role. He is skinny, nerdy, intelligent, but not ugly, his voice is cool. He is the perfect Bruce Banner. In fact everything about the main character is cool and is presented as cool, from the mind control stuff to the fighting and from the fighting to him being the intelligent professor.<br/><br/>There are some arguments that Tim Roth is miscast as ""Emil Blonsky"" in this movie. I disagree. I think its great that this veteran army dude who is the toughest soldier on the planet is not some athletic guy but looks more ordinary than my dad. Because in this movie his toughness doesn't come from him being the new he-man only with bigger abs but it comes from his experience on the field and the fact that he considers himself as a ""fighter"" despite his age etc. I think its way cooler seeing some ordinary guy in swat gear doing things in a calm way, moving like they do etc. Thats why I liked the Bourne trilogy as well. Cuz Bourne doesn't necessarily do anything flashy, he just walks calmly but knows exactly what he is doing. Although when it comes to big muscles and crazy fight scenes this movie delivers more than well. The other thing is that I really admire Tim Roths characters will to fight. He does it because he likes it and because Tim Roth isn't the athletic dude from the gym it makes it much cooler and more admirable, being just an ordinary guy but still wanting to fight because of the sheer fun of fighting.<br/><br/>This movie does its job more than well. It is an action flick of quality. If you are hesitating whether you should see it or not, don't. Go see it, now."
"wayfarer001","10","4","7","15 June 2008"," Marvel's now 2 for 2!
","This one's pretty easy...if you've been wanting a Hulk movie, this is it! It's a fast-paced, character-driven, action-filled roller coaster that really delivers. This film is faster & less angst-ridden than the Ang Lee production a while back, but doesn't throw unthinking or purposeless mayhem at you either. Like Lee's, Leterrier's offering arrives owing more to the TV series than the actual comic origins (so no Rick Jones or gamma bombs), but does hew a bit closer to the Marvel Universe. Insiders will see lots of set-up for future outings in details like SHIELD, Drs. Samson & Sterns, and the long-abandoned Super Soldier Project. <br/><br/>Like Downey last month, Norton pretty much carries the movie with a very engaging and nuanced performance. He plays the guilt-ridden conflicted hero well, and is supported ably by fine turns by Tyler, Hurt, and Roth. My main complaint: a sudden, inexplicably truncated ending that left too much up in the air, with only the slightest of epilogues. Actually, TWO epilogues. They give nice teases for what lies ahead, but did little in service to the story just seen. As said by many, it's not Iron Man level, but Incredible Hulk makes a dang fine 2nd Marvel-only movie and makes one quite optimistic about their future slate."

When i first walked into the theaters i didn't know what to expect.(i just saw it today too =]') But boy when i walked out i was just shocked. The movie does take time to get into the big story which i like in movies, and i like how you see Mr. Tony Stark. I also thought that battle at the end was just downright brutal. It was SO much better than the Eric Bana's version. For Hulk fans, you have a great movie right in front of you.<br/><br/>They also set up for an Avengers movie, and i cant even say anymore.

"shiftyeyeddog","7","4","7","13 June 2008"," Marvel is on a roll
","The new Hulk is not quite as drastically different from the previous one as they'd have you believe in terms of being action-packed. The Hulk still shows up rather sparingly for the first 3/4 of the movie, then finally takes center stage for the extended climactic finale. Not that I think it should be any different - I just don't think this one piles on the action much more than the last, as has been said. That being said, this film is a huge improvement over the mess that was the last Hulk film. From the acting to the writing to the effects, this blows away Ang Lee's version. The CG is not bad, and I'm sure it's probably the best possible at this time, but still looks very artificial, especially faces and when interacting with real characters. But such is the nature of movies - suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>The movie is pretty enjoyable, though, and chalks up another success for Marvel. If only the film rights to other characters like X-Men and Spider-Man would revert back to them so they can do them properly. <br/><br/>Regarding the cameos: I have no problem with other Marvel characters showing up in cameos in these films - why shouldn't they all exist in the same universe? But I'm getting a little tired of the rest of these wink-wink cameos - this time we get Stan Lee AGAIN (seriously, in one movie it was funny, after that it's just annoying) and TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Stunt casting like that really takes you out of the story, and you have to listen to everyone in the theater turn to their friend or kid and say ""hey! that's _______!"""
"hannah8700-1","8","4","7","13 June 2008"," Truly ""Incredible!""
","Well, somebody finally got it right this time! This new version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" is exactly what the first one failed to accomplish. Everything about the movie made it great- the acting, the plot, the story line, and its evil, yet very worthy opponent. It's exciting, entertaining, action-packed and suspenseful and keeps you right on the edge of your seat the entire time. Edward Norton did a fantastic job as ""Mr. Green"" and met everyone's expectations. The fact that he helped write the screenplay for the film says a lot about his talents and abilities as an actor as well. Liv Tyler delivered a good performance too and together they both added a great deal more to the film. Her character is compassionate and kind which I found to make Norton's character more human. And the little bit of romance they had on the side too wasn't a bad idea either. Every great comic book hero has to have his girl, that damsel in distress that requires rescuing from time to time. And I was surprised to find that some lines Norton delivered in the movie were actually quite humorous and that's always a plus. The last battle sequence between the Hulk and the ""Abomination"" was awesome. The ending leaves the story line wide open for a sequel with a special appearance from Tony Starks, the Iron Man. It was really neat to see how they tied the two Marvel characters together in what promises to be another great movie in the making. I am anxiously awaiting the next film. So even though you may be wary of this remake give the new ""Incredible Hulk"" a chance. It won't disappoint you!"
"dyl_gon","4","7","15","13 June 2008"," Is the hulk incredible? Maybe. Is his movie any good? Not really.
","The Incredible Hulk is poised to be a reboot of the popular comic book character, after the previous attempt at a Hulk movie a few years back bombed at the box office, as well as amongst fans. Marvel has done everything possible to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself: Louis Leterrier, a director known for his kinetic, hyper-violent Transporter flicks, helms this version as opposed to Ang Lee, the director of the original Hulk, known for making ""artsy"" films. Academy award nominated actor Edward Norton stars in this one, as opposed to Eric Bana in the 2003 version, who was a relative unknown at the time. Despite Marvel's best efforts, The Incredible Hulk is still a disaster this time around. It shows promise in the beginning, but quickly delves into nothing more than a $100 million B-movie.<br/><br/>Quickly skimming through Bruce Banner's transformation into the Hulk by gamma radiation overdose during the opening credits, the movie jumps right into the meat of things, with Bruce living in Brazilian slums, hiding out from the U.S military, particularly General Ross. General Ross has made it his mission to get Bruce's blood, which is radiated with gamma rays and causes Bruce to turn into the big, green monster whenever he gets excited. His plan is to use it as a weapon, creating numerous other ""hulks"", and he'll stop at nothing to get it. Most of the movie is an on-the-lam take on the superhero genre, with Banner evading Ross and the U.S army, while KGB agent Emil Blonsky begins taking gamma radiation doses so he too, can turn into a monster, and take down Banner for Ross.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk starts out with promise, showing Bruce dealing with the effects of his ""condition"", trying to learn how to control himself and maintain a low profile at the same time. It's interesting to see how Bruce tries to deal with the infliction, and it's filled with the right mix of drama and humor (one particular lost-in-translation moment had the audience cracking up). Not before long, the military shows up and a chase overtop the roofs of the slums ensues. It's easy to see why Marvel chose Leterrier during the chase; he knows how to handle an action sequence, without delving into shaky-cam or redundancy, despite the long length of the sequence. However, by the end of the scene, Bruce ""hulks"" out, and that's when the problems begin.<br/><br/>The first apparent problem is that the Hulk looks like he's came straight out of the video game tie-in. There's been a lot of detail put into certain aspects of him, including scars and muscle tone, but nothing has been done to give him any sense of realism. He looks like a cartoon and his movements and actions are similar to those of a CG-animated character. Yes, the ""hulk"" is created almost entirely using digital effects, but after movies like Transformers and Iron Man, where the effects were almost seamless, the hulk seems more in line with Sci-Fi channel level effects (for those who aren't familiar with the channel, it specializes in schlocky, cheap science fiction such as Python Vs. Boa).<br/><br/>The bad CGI appearance of the Hulk marks the movies descent into cheese. From that point on, the film no longer provides anything of interest about the characters or their situation: it serves only to show stuff blowing up and the hulk smashing things. Despite Edward Norton being a gifted actor, he has nothing to work with here. There's no emotion, no depth to the character of Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler is given even less as Bruce's ex-girlfriend, Betty. She's pretty much relegated to following Bruce around for the entire film, not showing any personality or character whatsoever. When the movie isn't going for cheap thrills and action, it makes a few flaccid attempts at evoking emotion, such as having Bruce and Betty hug each other in the pouring rain as angelic music chimes out in the background. Or having Bruce, attempting to provide thoughtful insight on his condition, say it feels like ""having LSD poured into you"".<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with a film, especially a superhero movie, going straight for mindless thrills and action. However, The Incredible Hulk doesn't deliver on that either. The action sequences are too cheesy, too over-the-top and ungrounded in reality, to be remotely thrilling. Take for instance, the Hulk's second battle against the U.S military, as well as a gamma ray enhanced Emil Blonsky, General Ross's right hand man. The hulk stops smashing through things and tears some metal chunks off a vehicle, and wields them as blades, spinning them through the air. Blonsky begins doing back flips and moves out of the Matrix films to dodge each of the Hulk's attacks. It doesn't fit in with the style of the movie to have them partaking in a hyper-stylized fight more akin to a Jackie Chan film. It's completely out of character for the movie and just plain ridiculous.<br/><br/>Then there's the finale, in which Blonsky, fully transformed into The Abomination (a hulk-like creature, but with more strength) fights the Hulk on the streets of Manhattan. The fight looks as convincing as something out of Kung Fu Panda, with a jumble of badly animated monsters leaping around the street, using cars as boxing gloves and chains to strangle each other with. It's just silly. It could be thrilling if it was more grounded in reality, if we cared about the characters whatsoever, if there was any sort of depth to the situation beyond Bruce deciding to go beat the monster up. There isn't. It's the type of scene some B-movie director would shoot if he had the same amount of money.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk doesn't add any depth to the story of the hulk, yet also fails as a mindless action film. It shows potential, but ultimately fails. Marvel had their chance, two actually, and it's time to put this series to rest."

","This is the most politically correct action film of the last 5 years. There is no story. The American army is evil. All the villains are men who wear medals and ribbons. It is an anti American film to the extreme. They throw in a British army villain because they Hollywood liberals hate the fact that we are allies with London.<br/><br/>No adventures here in this film. Scene after scene of hospital stuff and close ups of bruises. If you like medical scenes than this is the film for you. The film goes down hill fast after a decent Brazil opening. It is obvious that the film is anti military and wastes our time. We thought the new film would not waste so much time on medical stuff like the one a few years ago. This one is worse.<br/><br/>We also get the soap opera father daughter problems. The female lead is a phony sickening sweet annoying person. I seldom criticize female leads but this one is terrible. Lines like ""its OK, I like it"" and her switch from sweetness to her profanity laced tirade against a cab driver are pathetic. She condescends constantly and has an air of knowing all things which is horrible. My least favorite lead in a decade. <br/><br/>The best part of the film was Ed Norton's acting and a decent fight scene at the end. Not enough. The television show was so good and had meaning. The villains are wimps and all soldiers are portrayed as evil or stupid. I am sure that people in other countries will believe that the American Army is truly evil. This is a shame when our real soldiers are nothing like this. This empty hate America film is depressing. Hulk is my least favorite film of last three years."

The real problem at the core of this movie is the Hulk character himself: this is really one of the most boring comic characters ever. He becomes green creates havoc and destroys stuff. Big deal!

","The Incredible Hulk is a film with a lot of ""non-stop"" action sequences and decent special effects, but is there really much more to it than that? My answer would be a simple ""no."" It is nothing more than a typical summer action movie. Iron man was amazing with an awesome storyline, brilliant acting, awesome special effects and bad ass action sequences. Seeing this film after Iron Man was destined to leave me disappointed. I had heard so many good things about it that I was let down.<br/><br/>I'm just gonna come out and say that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2003 version of The Hulk as I thought it had a really good storyline and a very good vision. I liked the whole artsy feel. Take out the art, add the film adaptations of The Fantastic 4, only with The Hulk and you have this movie. It's fun but there's nothing else to it. The only things that really keep me from rating it lower are the acting which was phenomenal and the ending which I thought was pretty good. Other than that, it's just mindless fun.<br/><br/>Don't go into this film expecting another Iron Man and you should be okay. It's a fun summer, popcorn movie, nothing else!"

","This was a great homage to all the preceding HULKs, while maintaining its own originality! I was moved by a lot of the sensitive moments and the non stop action from beginning to end! Although I am one of the few that thought Ang Lee's take was also well done, this version makes that one pale in comparison. With great acting by Ed Norton, who captures the bittersweet struggle that Bill Bixby bought to the character, and excellent acting by William Hurt as the cold calculating General Ross; this movie has few misses. Liv Tyler does a great Betty Ross, but Jennifer Connelly would have been even better because she would have brought more emotional depth to the character.<br/><br/>All in all, money well spent and not too violent for the kids, as long as you go with them.

"FilmWeekUK","5","31","97","9 June 2008"," You've seen it done better a million times before
","Unlike the other reviewers here I was REALLY disappointed with this film. Admittedly I felt similarly disappointed after seeing Ang Lee's take on the big green monster - but that was my fault for having ""traditional"" expectations going in. That earlier film improved with subsequent viewings, and at least had a sense of originality going for it.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Ed Norton's work, and so was looking forward to his take on things, particularly when it was announced he was writing the script and would be concentrating on the Banner character and his inner psyche.<br/><br/>Alas, the endless reports of a troubled shoot, culminating with Norton's name being removed from the writing credits of the film earlier this week by the WGA set off alarm bells that have proved all too true.<br/><br/>This is a lazy, formulaic, 'do it by numbers' mess of a superhero film. It's not a patch on ""Iron Man"" which was Marvel's first ""in house"" production, and it suffers terribly when compared to that offering. When the standout sequence is a rehash of the rooftop scene already done (and to much better effect) in Bourne Ultimatum you know you're in trouble.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is, unfortunately, totally miscast in this take on Bruce Banner. He's far too bland to command leading man status. The action scenes are tired and lifeless, with poor fire FX and some terrible ""eye line"" work on the CGI. Only the end scene fight between The Hulk and The Abomination look vaguely convincing. And it's the sort of fight scene that we've seen endless times before in other, better superhero movies.<br/><br/>Other missteps include having Mr Blue (Samuel) playing everything for laughs, and the complete lack of a proper ending. The fight scene ends and then the makers don't know what to do. In fact the ending is so bad they end up having to add the same coda they added to ""Iron Man"", but this time before the credits. Lame, lame, lame! Kids will enjoy this, and I guess it's truer to the comic book than Ang Lee's take was. But really it just comes across as a ""between series"" TV episode expanded out with a movie budget. There's nothing new here and Bill Bixby did it better on TV.<br/><br/>I'd be surprised if there's a sequel. And if there is I hope it's a whole lot better than this mess."
"Guardia","5","9","22","12 June 2008"," Incredible. As In ""Not Credible"".
","This rendition of the Hulk story sees Edward Norton as ""Bruce Banner"". He is a man in hiding in South America, living an anonymous life as a factory worker. Why? Well, the government (or rather a particular Army General) want to find him at any cost. Really, what we're looking at in this film, is the story of a victim. Banner was created by the government, and now, the government want him for their own ends. It's a little of the Frankenstein-complex yet again in American cinema, (see ""Robocop"", ""Universal Soldier"" for other takes on this premise.) It begins, and rather than sit through twenty-minutes plus of back-story, the decision was made to show all relevant explanatory scenes in an opening montage sequence. These scenes (although quite clumsy in their direction) were an inclusion I was grateful for. I thought this would help the film find some momentum. But, I was only half-right. We skip ahead to Bruce's anonymous existence in Brazil, and we are itching to see signs of the hulk within him. Only hints in some of his unusual behaviour would ever suggest that he has any more than an anti-social problem.<br/><br/>When a clash between the government forces finally erupts, it is fairly underwhelming; a competently shot chase-scene plays out (Edward Norton runs like a girl!) and a poor ""fight"" scene to conclude it. When the animal of the title is finally revealed, it is a shadowy, confusing environment, and we only see a glimpse. Here, the direction delays the unveiling of it's draw-card as long as it can. Also, like so many movies of late, I found myself enjoying the scenery more than the performances - Brazil has never looked like more colourful and fascinating in it's maze of slums and shanty-towns.<br/><br/>Banner's nemesis ""General Ross"", uses ""Blonksy"" as his right-hand man. This role (play by Tim Roth) starts well enough (the David vs. Goliath notion is a nice touch), then gets a little over-the-top, then hits the outright ludicrous. He seems to have a major grudge over a special operation in Brazil that doesn't go his way. Just WHY this is such a problem for this guy is never made clear - he takes ""failure"" (although he has several other attempts at the same mission) way too personally for a spec-ops soldier. This brooding resentment is amplified by General Ross' tampering, and we are promised a showdown between two Goliaths.<br/><br/>The problem this films has is that it tries to make an underdog out of a superior character. A victim, a persecuted monster, the hulk is meant to draw sympathy AND be the unbeatable character. Sure, he takes his hits, but you're never worried that he won't succeed. The only way this film can raise the stakes is from turning things up from ten to eleven on the dial. And I'm not convinced that going to eleven makes the viewing experience that much better - rather, it overshadows everything else you've just sat through and invested in.<br/><br/>The climax, although well done in isolation, is ridiculous in it's seriousness. The love interest is just an excuse to give Bruce someone to talk to - to explain his Jekyll and Hyde complex, (one scene in a cave is particularly stupid. Watch the continuously changing size of his body). The father/daughter relationship has a particularly bitter taste to it, and Roth's evolving psychosis happens much too suddenly - we see HIS transformation as a despicable ""abomination"", but is it really that different from Banner's? Why is one worthy of sympathy, when another is demon that should be exterminated? Because it's ""uglier""?<br/><br/>Comic book to film movies are never going to work for me in this format. Imposing the super-human character over today's society will always come across awkwardly for me. They seem to want it both ways: an unstoppable physical giant, worthy of the armed-forces complete attention, and an anonymous weak-bodied victim, who is cursed with the power others will kill for. This contrast, although interesting on paper, is increasingly hard to convey believably."

","It concerns me that my friend and I's favourite scene in this movie was the one with Stan Lee in it.<br/><br/>Where to start. Lets start with the casting.<br/><br/>Given that the film (roughly) follows on from what went before there would have been no problem in using the same cast to do this movie.<br/><br/>In the press it's been stated that Norton was looking for a more cerebral plot. I'd suggest that he should either read the press - where Marvel distinctly stated Ang Lee's film was too cerebral - or sack his agent.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler's Betty Ross was about as substantial as tracing paper and I could see no reason for her slipping the glasses on and off as they failed to provide any gravitas.<br/><br/>William Hurt delivered some of his lines a'la Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski and finally Tim Roth just appeared to be there for the pay check.<br/><br/>It surprised me when Leterrier agreed to direct as previous movies have used physical action and not CGI (which was woeful at best making the Hulk look malnourished). This showed as the first scene and the chase across the slums is marvellously directed lulling the viewer into expecting more. It doesn't come.<br/><br/>Plot is (well is there a plot) bad to say the least. Why are the army trying to get Banner in the middle of a university campus if this is a top secret operation? Why does every troop seem to know about the operation by the time they hit New York? Why can't the US Army continue a hunt during a storm? Why does Bruce run away from Betty only to give up pathetically on the bridge and why does this film constantly reference the TV series? I could go on but there really is little point. Some Hulk purists may feel in harks to the heyday of this type of Hulk but it should be noted that it was Peter Davids more cerebral Hulk character that saved the comic and actually made the character interesting.<br/><br/>Come back Ang Lee, cast and crew. I preferred you!"
"qsdad2000","5","6","13","13 June 2008"," Unimpressed
","Before I complain, let me explain the 5 rating. If this had been the first HULK movie, it would get a 10 from me. Wonderful movie but an absolutely lousy sequel.<br/><br/>I found the movie itself, more entertaining than the HULK character. Movie 1 featured a hulk with unlimited capabilities and he was one of a kind. I didn't like the limits placed on his growth. At one point in movie 1, the HULK appeared 10 -12 feet tall. Awesome! I'm thinking, his anger can cause his body and strength to match the demands being placed on him. It is also my opinion that the first HULK looked more hulkish. He was considerably thicker in appearance. At one point I noticed that Norton's HULK seemed flat chested.<br/><br/>And does anyone remember the tank beating scene from Bana's HULK? Or the lab scene where HULK crawled up through that hole in the floor? Huge, impressive. This movie didn't do that HULK any justice. Didn't even to be the same HULK.<br/><br/>Hulk 1, hands down but I'm a 40 year old man. My son's are still lying in bed talking about it. They loved it."
"Chadsymptom","6","8","19","11 June 2008"," Entertaining, but not up to Marvel's new standard
","It is undeniable that Marvel has been on a winning roll lately since it has become it's own independent studio. They have started from scratch to make their films more enjoyable to all audiences. With Ironman, the proof is in the pudding and most can agree that the movie was pure fun and a great film to boot.<br/><br/>With our boy Hulk, I think Marvel missed the mark a bit, but luckily when Marvel misses, its not such a bad thing. The movie was entertaining and had my eyes glued to the screen during the sneak peak. The effects were dazzling, only looking cartoonish for a couple scenes. The Hulk is more human than in the Ang Lee version and it adds a nice element to the movie. Unfortunately, I could not get past Liv Tyler's horrible exchanges with Ed Norton and William Hurt. It was like watching a 7 year old pitch to Babe Ruth. She just can't at, and as an integral part of the movie, it strained me (and viewers around me). The saving grace is that mot people aren't going to see this movie for the acting, but Ironman set a new standard for acting(though Spider-Man has good acting) in recent comic book movies and Batman has followed the trend too. The dialogue was border line ridiculous, and the one liners that worked so well in Ironman did not in Hulk.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and it was an excellent summer popcorn flick, but as I said earlier, These newer comic films all feature more serious tones and more serious acting from more serious actors. No more Alicia Silverstone and George Clooney as our heroes, so why should we settle for Liv Tyler. Liv has roles that make her shine, this was not one of them. Norton and Hurt shine in every way they can, but the script was weak.<br/><br/>See this movie, it will blow you away stylistically, but even the less nit-picky people will laugh at the bad lines."
"dastaten","10","3","5","6 September 2009"," A Marvel Masterpiece
","First let me quickly explain that I am a serious, major Hulk fan. When I was a kid, I watched the TV show, I had over 200 Hulk comics, a Hulk bicycle, a Hulk Stretch Armstrong, Hulk action figures, you name it, I had it. I actually believed the Hulk was real for a couple years after finding out there was no Santa. So a Hulk movie had better seriously deliver for me to accept it. And this one rocks.<br/><br/>You may or my not consider the following spoilers. I don't give away any of the plot, but I do mention some of the cameos and other neat stuff you will see in the movie...<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier is a genius and does a bang up job of catering to old school fans. Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk in the TV show, has a cameo and does the voice of the Hulk as well. Bill Bixby (Banner from the TV show) is seen on TV in an episode of ""The Courtship of Eddy's Father."" We seen Jim Wilson (Hulk's sidekick from the comics) and Jack McGee (Hulk's nemesis from the TV show) as young college students. They play the Lonely Man Theme (the end music on the TV show) during one scene. There is at least one shot that is straight out of one of the old Hulk graphic novels (fans will recognize this shot when the Hulk rages on the edge of a cliff at the lightening at thunder). There's the purple pants from the comics, the line ""don't make me angry"" from the TV show, the infamous Hulk hand slap, and many more. My favorite nod though is the Hulk's final line (he only has two or three) at the very end during the fight with the Abomination. I won't give it away here, but serious fans will cheer when he says it.<br/><br/>The directing is wonderful, the visuals are amazing, the acting is nothing phenomenal, but everyone does a great job; it's just an all around solid comic book action flick that entertains from beginning to end and flawlessly delivers for serious fans of the Hulk.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint it would be that they messed with the origins of both the Hulk and the Abomination. But the movie does not focus on the Hulk's origin, which borrows slightly from the TV show, and the Abomination's origin is interesting enough and acceptable. Even with this flaw, I still have to give the movie a perfect 10 because the flaw was handled gracefully and it is so obvious that Louis Leterrier went above and beyond with his efforts to satisfy hardcore fans in every other aspect.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the Hulk or Edward Norton or Tim Roth or just action movies, this one should satisfy nicely. If you are indeed a Hulk fan, watch for all those nods to the comics and TV show. They're around every corner."
"sanddragon939","8","3","5","2 May 2009"," A Giant Leap Towards Success
","In the 1960's, a genius named Stan Lee, created for a company named Marvel Comics, an entire stable of characters who were unique and exuded originality in many aspects, including their characterization, their abilities and the style of storytelling of their adventures. Each and every one of his creations was in some way the a brand new innovation. Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the X-men, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor and of course, the Hulk. Owing to the worldwide success of the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Marvel has since sought to recreate all of Stan Lee's characters for the big screen and reinvent and reinterpret them for modern audiences. Their most recent and ambitious attempt at this has been with the creation of their own studios, Marvel Studios which will produce several films featuring various Marvel characters, set in a common continuity, so that the characters may interact in a future crossover film. The Incredible Hulk is the second film to be released as part of this ambitious project and following on the heels of the highly successful Iron Man, it has certainly done pretty well commercially and even critically, though probably not as much as its producers would have liked. Though the Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the short-lived Hulk movie franchise (which began and ended with the 2003 Hulk film), it does not retread the plot of the previous film by retelling the characters tragic origin story...rather it has the unique quality of reinventing the character and reintroducing him to the audiences while at the same time taking the character forward and presenting new material to viewers who have seen the previous film. The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who has been living with the curse of the gamma-charged monster called the Hulk for five years now. Banner, who is on the run from the US Military, led by General Ross, seeks a cure from his abnormal condition, with the help of his ex-girlfriend and his arch-Nemesis's daughter, Betty Ross. General Ross however is determined to capture the Green Goliath and to this end empowers a Special Forces veteran named Blonsky with the Super Soldier serum. However, Blonsky's lust for power results in his transformation into the all-powerful Abomination, whose rampage through the streets of New York City can only be stopped by the Hulk! It is this no holds barred fight scene which is truly the climatic moment of this film. Edward Norton does a brilliant job portraying Bruce Banner as the scientist and fugitive tormented by his brutal alter ego, while Liz Tyler plays the part of the faithful girlfriend and companion to perfection. Ultimately, this film has given the Hulk the momentum to make a giant leap towards future success...it remains to be seen if the producers enable him to actually make that leap..."
"restin_him","7","3","5","22 December 2008"," A much better start to the franchise
","The incredible Hulk tells us the story of a scientist on the run named Bruce Banner (Edward Norton). We get glimpse of an experiment gone wrong and catch up with Banner in Brazil. Banner is looking for a cure for something and since we all know what the film is about it isn't much of a mystery. Through an accident at the soda factory Banner works at a drop of his blood makes it to the US in a bottle revealing his location to General Ross (William Hurt) who is hunting Banner. An elite group of soldiers is sent to Brazil led by General Ross and a special forces legend, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). As Banner is pinned down he transforms beating several special forces agents and Blonsky. After his escape Banner seeks out his lost love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to help him find a man who may be able to help him. As General Ross, who is also Betty's dad, closes in on Banner he convinces Blonsky to take part in several super solder experiments to help him fight the Hulk leading to the creation of another monster.<br/><br/>All in all this film is far better then Ang Lees 2003 train wreck the Hulk. The FX were brilliant and the Hulk looked great. The Hulk was very real looking and felt like a character not a cool addition to the film. The action was smooth and we got a good villain instead of hulked out dogs.<br/><br/>I thought Edward Norton was perfect as Banner both in his stature and quit desperation for a cure. It was really cool to see a skinny and weakly looking Banner turn into the huge and powerful Hulk. Tyler, Hurt, and the other actors also do a fantastic job of contributing to the story. Roth is great as an aging soldier presented with the chance to become everything he used to be and more. He provides a great glimpse into how power corrupts.<br/><br/>The script flowed well getting rid of the cheese the seeped out of Ang Lee's Hulk. It was funny in a realist way and still communicated what was happening. The only real issue with the story was how crammed everything felt. At times I wished I had seen more of Banners time alone and how it got him to where he was. I guess I also wished Norton had had the opportunity to really let us see Banners pain in being alone.<br/><br/>I must say there were a lot of tips to Hulk fans as well. The scenes that mirrored the old TV show, the use of the TV show theme, Lou Ferrigno included in a cameo and as the Hulks voice, the purple pants, Hulk in the rain with Betty. All of those things pushed my geek buttons which was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The only problem this film really had was that it came out in the summer when we got Iron Man and The Dark Knight. I think that those two films helped to bury a very good story. Not that those films are evil it just may have not been the best idea to release this film in the same summer as those two."
"alanrayford","9","3","5","8 December 2008"," A truly excellent film...more please!
","The summer of 2008 was the season of the superhero at the box office. There was Iron Man, Hancock, Hellboy II, Wanted, and the Dark Knight. However, as impressive as each of these films are, one stands above them. That movie is the Incredible Hulk. However, marred by a highly questionable 2003 entry, it didn't do too well at the ticket booth. Now I hear talk of there not being a sequel to this truly superior film. How very sad.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is an action packed film that, literally, delivers the comic book to the big and small screen. When Banner hulks out in Brazil, the heavily armed and highly trained operatives chasing him were put in a very dangerous predicament. He's kicking around industrial mixing tanks and hi-lo's like they're nothing, and the gunmen were taken down to the last person without the Hulk putting any thought into anything besides getting out of that factory. Later, the Army finds Banner and a proper fight ensues. In this scene we have hummer's, tons of soldiers, APC's, a gunship, and two sonic bombardment cannons. Two words sum this scene upHulk smash. We see Banner's alter tear through all of this equipment like a bull in a China shop. It was just like a comic, but with one difference. In this scene we got to see the Hulk cut loose on a pre-Abomination Emil Blonsky. When that idiot was kicked through the air, only to have his body crushed and bloodied against the trunk of a tree, I knew the ante had been upped.<br/><br/>All of this action of course builds up to the final showdown between the Hulk and the Abomination. In the Dark Knight, Hancock, and Iron Man, the final showdowns were mildly anticlimactic. In the Incredible Hulk, this conflict was more than worthy of the time spent leading up to it. Maybe it was the Hulk turning a cop car into boxing gloves. It could have been him extinguishing a gasoline fire by clapping his hands together. There's always the chance it was the Hulk causing a localized earthquake by stomping his feet on the groundright after yelling out Hulk smash!! For whatever reason, this fight between these two inhuman behemoths is the fight. It's like the big budget, sci-fi equivalent of Martin Riggs vs. Mr. Joshua or, even better, the fight scene in the Bourne Ultimatum. It is brutal, unflinching, awesome, and not to be missed.<br/><br/>But, it's not all smashing. There is a tightly scripted story here as well. This movie eschews the tone of the inferior 2003 production and cuts right to the heart of the matter. Bruce Banner is a scientist, on the run from the government, who has a problem. Seeing how he set up an impromptu lab in Brazil was pretty cool. Later, landing in Mexico after an episode, it was compelling to see him pick up the pieces of his life and soldier on. In a Hulk film, you're supposed to want to see the Hulk. The script for this movie, however, made me not want to see the green guy so much. This is because every time he reared his head, it held catastrophic results for Banner. The writing is so good that it actually made me care more about Bruce Banner than the Hulk. But what is writing without acting to back it up.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and Tim Blake Nelson all delivered in their roles. Norton really sold Banner's horror over the fact that, if he goes over 200 BPM's, his world just stops and, the next day, he has to rebuild from scratch and live with the consequences of whatever he may have done. Liv Tyler made me believe Betty Ross' anguish over loving someone who was, for all practical purposes, cursed and inordinately dangerous to everyone and everything around him. Sam Elliot's General Ross was the one bright spot in the 2003 film. While William Hurt's take on the character doesn't look as badass, he really embodies the spirit of a man who is utterly obsessed with controlling a force of nature. Emil Blonksy, as portrayed by Tim Roth, is absolutely believable as an old soldier, teetering on obsolescence, who is willing to sell his soul for power. Tim Blake Nelson made the character of Samuel Stern fully his own, by imbuing him with a comical level of intellectual recklessness that flew in the face of all kinds of common sense. The real testament to the strength of this cast, though, was when Betty was helping a threadbare and twitchy Bruce around after an episode. There was no dialogue or anything to suggest what the movie was. However, if a person had been in a coma for the last ten years and didn't know this movie existed, they still would've known what they were looking at from that one image. The acting made what could've been a typical non-scene iconic.<br/><br/>The F/X was a step up from the previous effort. The Hulk, while still the size of a house, was more in proportion. This made it so that his status as a CGI creation was not glaring. The same is to be said of the Abomination, who genuinely looked more imposing here than he did in the comics.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is, in my opinion, the breakout action film of the 2008 summer season. It didn't make the most money. It didn't receive the most acclaim. It didn't have the biggest budget. But, like its namesake suggests, it defies all of this to beincredible. I truly hope Marvel Films realizes they have a viable franchise now that the 2003 version is dead and buried under this leaner, smarter, and vastly superior reboot. Just get the DVD, and see if you can keep your mouth closed and your pulse under 200."
"g-bodyl","9","3","5","15 November 2008"," Incredibly Great!
","The Incredible Hulk is a great movie, another success to the Marvel company and superhero films even though Hulk is not really a superhero. This movie is much better than Ang Lee's 2003 version. I did not not see that version, but the trailers for that Hulk are dumb and the reviews were not too good. Anyway, Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk because his experiment went wrong. Now, Banner is being pursued by the relentless general and his sidekick, Blonsky. While being pursued, Banner/Hulk is helped by the general's daughter, Elizabeth Ross and doctors like Dr. Sterns. The visual effects are very good. They are not cheap effects as there is supposedly in Lee's version. The acting is decent especially Edward Norton and William Hurt. Tim Roth and his character is a bit annoying and it's hard to understand his accent. I liked Blonsky's transformation. He is bigger and stronger than the Hulk himself. This is another success for Marvel. I rate this movie 9/10."
"jcallows","7","3","5","5 November 2008"," A Great Tribute to the 70s TV Show
","I loved the way this film paid tribute to the 70s classic. A movie about the Hulk should have some references to Bill Bixby's Hulk and this film had them. It was great to hear some of that music again, see Banner do the lonely walk and see him being given radiation in the way that was done to Bixby. We all loved the 70s version, so why stray too far away from it? The filmmakers had the good taste in deciding not to.<br/><br/>With the tone set to more like the 70s show and less like Ang Lee's version, this film was instantly engaging. And along with an interesting story, gripping action and great special effects, this film was thoroughly entertaining. I also liked that it explained how the Hulk has always been able to keep his pants on. I'm not sure if it was explained in the comic books or anywhere else, but this was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was an excellent choice to play Banner. No one could be more opposite to the Hulk. (I suppose the Jekyll/Hyde character he played in Primal Fear prepared him for this.) And Liv Tyler was fine. But as much as I like William Hurt, he didn't seem to have much energy. Perhaps it was the script, but he just seemed detached.<br/><br/>The CGI effects have come a long way since Ang Lee's Hulk. When I heard they were still going to use CGI for the Hulk in this version, I had my reservations. While it can render reptiles and all sorts of creatures fairly well, computers have always had trouble making humans or human-like creatures look real. But it seems they have come pretty close for this film.<br/><br/>One thing I would have like to have seen kept in this film from the 70s version was Banner's reason for getting the radiation-- so that he could become stronger to protect his loved ones. Here, this film went with the comic books' version-- to become a super soldier for the military. I liked the 70s version. It just seemed to add more empathy to Banner's character, and it was just plain more romantic.<br/><br/>Well, all in all a great film, and I'm looking forward to the next."

","Another comic book to live action adaptation and of the same character as a film previously made, in fact.<br/><br/>What can you say? Is it entertaining? Sure. Is it funny? Definitely. Is it worth a price of a movie ticket? Not really.<br/><br/>The problem is that the movie is all setup. It makes numerous references to upcoming Marvel projects that will entice the moviegoers to go for another round. Not that there is not some things in its favor, particularly Edward Norton as the title character. He is as always a joy to watch.<br/><br/>William Hurt scores too with his ""Everything for the cause"" character. Liv Tyler is essentially wasted. The exploration of her connection to Bruce Banner is underdeveloped (something that the 2003 film put more into focus) and some of her lines are downright ridiculous (""It's okay. Bruce, look at me!) Tim Roth does well, although the character is also a bit underdeveloped (maybe as another setup for future installments). For comic relief we have another Tim and you already know what his purpose in the plot is so why spoil it by repeating it.<br/><br/>So, worth a rental, skillfully made, but wish it could have been more than a preview of what's to come."

People might criticize her acting, but its hard to look good next to a Edward Norton, and personally I didn't mentioned any flaw at all in it; for me, she was totally believable.<br/><br/>Criticizing Edward Norton would probably be a sacrilege by now. The legitimate successor of Robert de Niro, the man who can play a tree (de Niro about de Niro), is of course again far beyond any criticism in his acting skills. I thorough enjoyed his interpretation of Hulk.<br/><br/>Tim Roth also does a good work as usual, even if his character was rather one dimensional. The story is not record breaking, but was definitely okay. All in all the movie was about as good or bad as Iron Man, but couldn't reach the level of the Spiderman Trilogy or the new Batman movies, due to lack of depth in the story. It definitely has a much, much, much better romance than the last of these movies, though.<br/><br/>What really enraged me was the fact that they cut so much of the showdown. Cant mention details to avoid spoilers, but the German version was nothing short of butchered in this respect; the German viewer really had no idea whatsoever how the villain was finally brought down."
"gbx06","8","3","5","15 July 2008"," Yes. This is Hulk
","If someone was waiting for a film that really shows a Hulk as it is, then I must say that this is the movie that always wanted to see about this character. ""The incredible Hulk"" has many qualities that make it off completely form the stylized and a little boring Ang Lee's version, who although isn't a bad movie, but it didn't meet the expectations of an adaptation more serious of this comic. What are the differences that make this film better than its earlier? <br/><br/>Lets start from the beginning. This version of Hulk resume, in its initial sequence of credits, everything that someone who does not know anything about comics should know to understand the story. This movie didn't deny the Ang Lee film, actually takes up the fact that Bruce Banner has fled to a place in South America and from there begins the story as a kind of sequel. Another success is that strips the movie completely of greater existential reflections and makes it what it is par excellence, a ribbon of pure entertainment, with big action sequences, chases and fights between giant monsters that make this version of Hulk more like the comic, but also has its romantic side and the human and painful part of Bruce Banner, but not focuses only one hour on that.<br/><br/>Visually the Hulk design compared to that of Ang Lee is much more stylized, less coarse than the last and most rugged, looks even stronger than the Lee's, while the FX are used much more stylized and harmonics, they are more precise, which results in sequences, like the battle of the university, that are really spectacular. Finally the choice of players compete much with the casting of the previous movie, but I think that is better the choice of Norton than Bana, and more beautiful Liv Tyler than Jennifer Connelly. Excellent choice of William Hurt and Tim Roth as ""the villains"" and much better even the preamble to ""The Avengers"" with Tony Stark.<br/><br/>For these reasons, this is for me the real Hulk."

Liv Tyler and William Hurt were perfect casting choices and should be brought back for the next installment. Tim Roth wont go down as one of the best villains ever but he was a cut above. Roth never gets enough credit as a truly good character actor. What really did it for me was the awesome ending, it shows that the Avengers are truly coming and that the Iron Man and this new revamped Hulk will be here for awhile.

I completely recommend this film to anyone who loves marvel or superhero films. WATCH IRONMAN BEFORE YOU SEE THIS FILM...<br/><br/>it plus it is a lot quicker to get in to unlike the old HULK film in 2003 which i still enjoyed and the special effects in this are fantastic especially Hulk and abombination, i thought that the hulk in 2003 looked great but this is so much better."

","This movie was awesome! After the monstrosity that Ang Lee created in 2005's 'Hulk' I was really not expecting much from this movie but I got exactly what I wanted and more. Firstly for those complaining that the Hulk looks fake from the commercials, don't worry, he looks a lot better on the the big screen and so does the Abomination which is the villain for this piece. This movie succeeds action wise with some really good stunts and lengthy battle sequences to the point where I was never bored in this movie. The only problems i had with this movie were very minor. Firstly, the dialogue was very weak. I like Louis Leterrier's directing style but Zak Penn's screenplay was really weak. I like how they tried to quote some of the famous lines from the TV series eg. 'hulk smash!' but when you are making a live action superhero movie it does not fit. Another thing was William Hurt who I was if no one else was hoping to love in this movie because i think he is a terrific actor. It was not that he was wrong for the role, he was perfect but his acting was almost lazy. It felt like he was acting on the basis of 'oh its a superhero movie, who cares I am probably going to get a big paycheck.' Aside from this everything worked really well. Ed Norton was perfect as Bruce Banner and even though i liked Eric Bana and thought he did a good job, Norton kicks his ass! Awaiting this movie I was prepared to really hat Liv Tyler but she turned out to be better than expected. I am not going to go as far as saying she was better than Jennifer Connelly but it felt like she was giving this movie everything she had which the audience realized and appreciated. Overall, a definite see!"

","I got so mad when I went to see this movie on opening weekend because a blackout came and ruin everything. I left the movie probably half way and I was irritated. There was no way that the movie will start immediately so everybody left and obviously with their refund. The theater was close for a few hours so I knew I had to come the next weekend. Then comes next weekend and I still had in mine that I was going to watch about 30 minutes into the movie again, but I didn't care, it was a great 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I was hoping this hulk movie to be more action-packed than Ang Lee's The Hulk. I wanted a true hulk movie and close enough towards its comic book. That's what the original didn't have and that's what The Incredible Hulk has.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk brings a new everything to the big screen; cast, director, story, etc. This time, Edward Norton (Bruce Banner) is in South America (Brazil) trying to find a cure for the gamma radiation that destroyed his cells and turns him into a totally different person when he is irritated and angry. Meanwhile, William Hurt (General Thunderbolt Ross) is on Banner's tail when he finds out that Banner is in Brazil. All hell breaks lose when Thunderbolt Ross brings a pack of U.S. soldiers to capture Banner. Things then get even uglier when a new powerful monster known as The Abomination causes chaos on anybody who steps on his way.<br/><br/>I really like the beginning of the movie because it was short and sweet to the point. It explains the events that happened in Bruce Banner's lab incident in seconds. Unlike Ang Lee's The Hulk when it probably took 30 or more minutes to explain the whole thing.<br/><br/>The new cast did an amazing job in the movie, especially Edward Norton. He did a great as Bruce Banner. Before, I was not sure if this was the right choice, but now I'm definitely sure it was. I also thought Liv Tyler gave a good performance as Betty Ross. She gave a solid performance as I expected. Tim Roth and William Hurt did their job too. Roth did great as Emil Blonsky.<br/><br/>Besides the story and acting, I thought the action and special effects were incredible. The action sequences between the hulk and military were amazing, but the final battle was so damn fun and great to watch. I totally think the Abomination and hulk fight should win an award for best fight.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk is one of the best superhero movies of all-time and I'm sure hulk fans will not be disappointed."

Reboot of the Marvel Comics cult hero is serviced well this time out with a fine mix of cool visual effects and a decent storyline/screenplay by Zak Penn depicting the account of mild-mannered scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Norton excelling with his nuanced agonizing performance) and the side-effects of being exposed to gamma rays resulting in the titular creature whenever he is angered. Adding to his fury is the US military's ploy to capture the fugitive for further testings led by macho jerk Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (Hurt) and interfering with Banner's romance with Ross' beguiling daughter Betty (Tyler) who is also trying to help Bruce return to 'normal'. Director Louis Leterrier goes gonzo with the action sequences, which prove satisfying with ""Hulk Smash!"" results including a spectacular throw down with nemesis gung-ho soldier Roth's ""The Abomination"".

","Greetings again from the darkness. Kind of a return to roots for the big green guy. The action scenes are grittier, louder and bigger than in Ang Lee's version ... all with a scaled back, more believable Hulk. This time Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner and Liv Tyler is Betty Ross, his scientific partner and love interest.<br/><br/>An unlikely casting decision puts Tim Roth as Hulk's nemesis, Blonsky, and finally as The Abomination. And a very creepy looking Willliam Hurt is the military guy attempting to cover up his mis-deeds. Somehow, Hurt's character has access to every military weapon known to man ... and the authority to use it on a college campus and in the middle of NYC. Hurt looks a bit too much like the new Burt Reynolds. I guess that adds to the list of mutants in the film.<br/><br/>Actually, I was impressed with the action scenes ... they were what I had hoped for. Plenty of fighting and chasing and ""smashing"". The dialogue in the non-action scenes was pretty lame, but that's not really what anyone comes to see.<br/><br/>A couple other points of interest: creator Stan Lee gets temporarily juiced off the Hulk's blood, Lou Ferrigno shows up twice - once as a pizza chomping security guard and also as the voice of Hulk, Ironman Tony Stark (Robert Downey, jr) shows up for a scene that sets the stage for ""The Avengers"" and the late, great Bill Bixby (TV's Hulk) has a creative cameo via TV and ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"". Speaking of setting the stage ... watch out for Tim Blake Nelson's character in the sequel."

","The first Hulk movie was a major disappointment. Ang Lee is a great director, but he fundamentally misunderstood the character. The Hulk is not about Bruce Banner's unresolved Freudian conflicts with his father. Nor is it about fighting giant, gamma-irradiated French poodles.<br/><br/>Now along comes Hulk 2.0. Director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn don't have Lee's talent or budget, but have created a more enjoyable, albeit cheesier, movie by sticking closer to the source material. Watch for cameos by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby, and Robert Downey Jr. in his Tony Stark role.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie works best: after an efficient opening sequence that gets the origin out of the way, we switch to Bruce Banner as a super powered fugitive, on the run from the US Army, and hiding out in São Paulo. (A nod to the first movie, which ended with Banner hiding in Latin America.) Ed Norton looks sufficiently haunted and emaciated to make this work. The Hulk is wisely kept in shadow and only shown in bits and pieces.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie starts showing some cracks. The Hulk doesn't look like Shrek this time, but he still doesn't look believable. Maybe it's impossible for CGI to render a nine foot tall, two ton green giant convincingly. Worse, the personal conflictsBanner with Betty Ross; Betty with her father, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; the General with Bannerfeel perfunctory, as if Leterrier and Penn are just filling time until the final throwdown with the Abomination. Here, they could have learned a thing or two from Lee, who excels at personal conflict."
"jp_philosophie","8","3","5","22 June 2008"," I read a critics review, my response
","Incredible Hulk 2008 review: a response Critics of Hulk 2008 <br/><br/>Does have spoilers <br/><br/>TIH is a very entertaining it just leaves itself open to nitpicking and vitriol assaults. Basically I put this down not to the creative team behind the project, but to the people who financed it and cut out no less than 70 minutes of the back story, just so as to rush to the action scenes. The problem with this is, many who went to watch this movie don't have a prior investment in the character, so where I could see between the poorly edited hodge podge of scenes the potential for a really sensitive, engrossing and moving portrayal of the tragedy of Banner's lonely tormented, existence, the film itself rushes to quickly through these points for some to really grasp Bruce Banners charm. Unfortunately in the shadow of the witty, quipping Tony Stark, Bruce's on screen persona isn't given quite enough time to develop.<br/><br/>Having said that Ed Norton is just brilliant as the tortured alter ego to the Hulk, he really taps into the pathos and simple dignity of this tragic hero. Certainly injecting far more humanity into Banner than Eric Bana's rather phlegmatic approach to the character. He really does give the Banner role the kind of elevated dignity that Bill Bixby added to the role. I wish we could have seen more of this performance. (There is one criticism of the portrayal of Banner which is more to do with the writing; it's like the writers just forgot he's one of the most brilliant scientists in the marvel universe. There could have been more reference and use of this in the script. It really is central to Banner's character.) Another notable, but again underdeveloped character is Tim Roths Emil Blonsky. I've got to be honest I loved the Hulk comic growing up, but the one thing I always thought Hulk was missing was a decent villain. A brilliant villain for me is premised on two things 1, there has to be a level to which you understand or relate to the villain's temptation by evil or malevolence and 2, none the less you have to understand why they must be stopped. Now characters like Lex Luther or The Joker are perfect examples of such villains; one immediately recognises Lex Luther's quest for ultimate knowledge as inherently human, or, one can relate to the mirthful twisted mind of the joker, who is just an extreme reaction to the equally insane and theatrical vigilantism of batman. But what about Abomination? How do you relate to a guy who wants to become a big mutant freak like Emil Blonsky? The truth is you can't, but Tim Roth puts in such a good performance that by the end you see him as both cool and by some weird perverted logic actually relate to his quest for Hulks power. I really think he is the outstanding performance in the whole ensemble.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler is under used but again in this role its not so much her acting that is outstanding, than the fact that Liv actually just inhabits important aspects of Betty Ross, a certain maternal care, a child like kindness which resonates with her response to the Hulk and the chemistry with Ed Norton is quite refreshing. It's not quite as ultra quippy and Hollywood as Ironman's main romance, which gave it a level of heart felt realism. Nonetheless her performance is jarring in places, and the scene where Betty and Banner are staring at the ceiling is funny, because it is made so obvious that even Ed Norton's eyes are better actors than Liv Tyler.<br/><br/>William Hurt's performance as Thunderbolt Ross has its awkward moments, but nonetheless, again he manages to pull off a rather dastardly General, and even gets a laugh or shudder at his maniacal persona every once in a while. Tim Blake Nelson does his best but his role really is awfully generic and I believe the let down of the whole piece. However luckily he's not in it that much.<br/><br/>Another surprise is Louis Letterier's directing. Its great because it feels like Ed Norton had a lot of control over the drama; but Letterier really knows his action scenes and they are surprisingly refreshing and while there are obvious homages to genres like horror etc he really makes the action scenes and some of the CG heavy scenes both aesthetically note worthy and some of the best action spectacles in the comic genre. Apart from Roth, the Hulk himself, directed by Louis is the stand out performance in this movie. The first Hulk fight is really testimony to this.<br/><br/>The only other criticism I have of the film is the Tony Stark cameo. It just seems like an add on, rather than a really well though out and integral part of the plot.<br/><br/>All in all this is still one of the best comic-adaptations out there; much better performances than in the spider man or X-men series, far better than Ghost rider and fantastic four, perhaps not quite as consistent as Iron Man however it even outshines in places that much lauded and perhaps overrated movie, definitely not in the league of the Matrix, Blade, Batman Begins or V for Vendetta. However it does have better action scenes than the latter two, and, if we had seen the full movie rather than the studio execs ""safe version"", well who knows? The critics say this movie is generic, the CG bad, there's no character development etc. Some of you sceptics who hated the first movie will listen to this and wait to rent or perhaps catch it on TV and when you do you will realise you've missed a movie that was truly meant to be seen on the big screen."

I'm even definitively stupid, so her opinion goes out the window right NOW.<br/><br/>The original hulk was a foul waste of time, and while it failed to please us, it cleared the path of Hulk's origins to give us the clash of the Hulk and Abomination. There are many little details just waiting in here, and if you catch them, it adds to the experience greatly. It has love, humor, action, suspense. Everything the Hulk can be counted on for, and then a bit more after that.<br/><br/>Even better, while in the original the Hulk was a very flat green, just very very big, this time he's got more veins than a steroids addict.

For me, these two are movies in which a super-hero is portrayed in a very efficient manner.<br/><br/>Though this movie has no connection with the first Hulk, but it does have a sort of connection in the way of portraying the problems the hero is facing with his ""problem"". I liked this movie as much as i did the first one. The director did do a very brilliant job. The desperateness of Bruce Banner to find an antidote, the craziness of Gen. Ross to capture Banner, Blonsky's desire to get more power, Betty Ross's willingness to help Banner all this has been shown in a very good manner. But the bet thing i liked was the amount of rage Hulk had been given, specially the time he screams.<br/><br/>While talking about the cgi use in the film honestly speaking i like Abomination more than Hulk. The nerves and veins of hulk looked a bit overshown, but the most impressive was the anger expression that was shown on Hulk's face.<br/><br/>Talking about action it was really really really awesome. Hulk's moves were totally wicked. His fight with Abomination looks like you are playing a King of fighters/Fatal Fury/Mortal Kombat on a more advanced version of playstation like PS8 or something. It was so totally cool. Not boring you guys more and not want to spoil the fun of those people who still haven't watch the movie, i will end this review now.<br/><br/>Just wanna say one more thing.

It was 100 times better than the previous version which is all that matters. I have also read that people are complaining again on how the Hulk looks which is a shame because i think he looked a hell of a lot better than the first movie. If anyone has ever used a 3D program they would know how incredibly difficult it is to model a character like that let alone apply the materials, have it interact with live action environment etc etc etc. As someone who uses 3d software quite a bit i think he looked pretty bad ass, especially in the daylight battle scene on the college campus. All im saying is enjoy it for what it is.

","Let me start off by saying I am not a big fan of action films. After 2003's lame rendition of the Hulk, I wasn't expecting much out of this one. Boy was I in for a surprise. This movie was intense. The fight scenes kept me on the edge of my seat, and I didn't dose off not once lol. I don't know what gave the bigger bang, the special effects or the sound effects. The acting was pretty good, too. Beyond Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, blah--so overrated! This revamped, supercharged version is a must see! Definitely worth the price of admission. I can safely say I prefer this one over Spider-man. It lives up to its title, The Incredible Hulk."
"mike1b24","8","3","5","18 June 2008"," Hulk fans will be happier now.
","In my opinion, the first Hulk movie in 2003 wasn't all that bad. However, I went to see it with very high hopes and expectations, and left feeling unfulfilled. I didn't like the new origin story and I hated how The Hulk kept getting bigger - he was like 25 feet tall! There were good action scenes when Hulk fought the army, but Bruce Banner's dad as the villain at the end was just strange and boring.<br/><br/>This time around, I think the formula is better...a little less drama and a lot more action. The Incredible Hulk also had a better villain in The Abomination. The action and fight scenes were terrific and a great cast complemented a well-written story. It seemed more like the Hulk in the comics which made for a much better movie. I also enjoyed the nods to the old Incredible Hulk TV series. The pace of this film is pretty fast and the feeling is more tense and exciting than the first movie, which was kind of slow and dramatic.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is definitely worth the price of admission. Hulk fans and general action movie fans will really enjoy it. I took my very uninterested girlfriend with me and she even said she liked it. As far as comic book movies go, I think only the Spider-Man movies (other than the 3rd), Iron Man and Batman Begins edge out The Incredible Hulk. Hopefully it does well so Marvel will make some sequels."

"ignus5uk","7","3","5","17 June 2008"," The Hulk version that won't leave you turning green
","When rumours of a new Hulk film began to surface after the Ang lee version, reservations set in the hearts of many of movie goers, however, when it emerged this was to be a reboot, curiosity began to grow and after setting foot out of the cinema having heard the words “Hulk smash”, any reservations about this film had indeed been smashed.<br/><br/>With the remnants of Ang Lee’s 2003 Hulk still prevalent in people’s minds, Louis Leterrier’s take of ‘The Incredible Hulk’ draws influence from the 80’s TV serious, with nostalgic music pieces and recreated scenes. Since the creation of the hulk from gamma ray exposure was commonly know, rather than invest heavily in to an origin story, write Zak Penn condenses it down to a neat little montage incorporated into the opening credit to allow for the story to take full steam from a spectacular opening shot of the slums of Brazil. In his new fugitive life, genius scientist Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton leads a solitary life seeking a cure and some control for seemingly incurable condition. All the while he is evading a US government search for him led by General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross and his new recruit Blonsky, a 39 year old unaccomplished soldier trying to make a name for himself wanting the power of Banner, which he inevitably gets to become Abomination.<br/><br/>Taking influence from the Bourne films, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ opens with an edge of the seat chase through Rio leading to a brief opening glimpse of the Hulk and is an excellent setup to what continues as a well thought out film. When Hulk finally makes his full appearance on screen we can see that a much more generous input has gone into the CGI work. The actions sequences that follow will leave you in awe and the brute force, sumo style culminating fight will ultimately satisfy the child in you. Norton is excellent as Banner and able to bring a sense of desperation and inner torment to this role, but the film doesn’t really attempt to develop this or take the same risks to any level similar to what Ang Lee set out to do and we only see really see one side of Norton character. Liv Tyler as Elizabeth ‘Betty’ Ross, playing Banners empathetic love interest left a sweet feeling and gave an overall decent enough performance. Even with the obvious ‘bad guy’ stereotyping of Blonsky being Russian and British, the talents of Tim Roth still managed to come out of a one dimensional character.<br/><br/>So, with Leterriers playing the right cards are there any faults? Well, asides some unnecessary cameos and limited character exploration, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to hit all the right buttons – it is a comic book adaptation done well with themes that not only make it work on screen but allows your average view to get involved with the central character, if only slightly. With comic to films adaptations having no end in sight and the as we enter the new dawn of marvel films with darker themes and crossover universes ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to keep the bar raised high and is the best possible pit stop to the climax of the summer blockbuster...The Dark Knight."
"Ozzy2000","9","3","5","17 June 2008"," Bulk Hulk
","Strangely enough Marvel has produced another film version of the Marvel Comic book hero, the Hulk. It is difficult to compare the two they are both really good but the first one had arguably better CGI but the second had a more likable hulk. Of course all hulks need anger management and heaps of Valium rather than natural meditative techniques as we learn from the second version. Liv Tyler plays the romantic interest of Hulk played by Edward Norton. Liv attempts to play a demure delicate woman but instead appears very large, Amazonian and broad shouldered that makes the human hulk look really weak and effeminate maybe this was deliberate. <br/><br/>The big showdown at the end of the film between the Hulk and the cheaper generic hulk imitation is very funny and enjoyable like world championship wrestling. <br/><br/>There is also a cameo appearance of Mr Stark of Iron man played by Robert Downey Jnr. which implies very directly that the Hulk may join forces with Iron Man to defeat some crazy evil force in a sequel. I did note that the Hulk inducing chemicals were not destroyed so that may be the key to why there will be a follow up. <br/><br/>I think the important thing in the next Hulk movie will be revolutionary stretch pants for the Hulk or maybe an ultra stretch leotard. I also think that an ultra stretch condom might also help a wee bit, the mind boggles.<br/><br/>Anyway burnt out Baby boomers who saw the sixties TV version and much younger males really love these action movies and are forgiving with all the technical errors. <br/><br/>Catch it while its on the big screen where the special effects are best seen."
"SlackerRus2000","8","3","5","16 June 2008"," As green the the boatload of cash its gonna make
","I don't know too much about the hulk mythos, but I can easily see why he is so well regarded. I anguish of not being able to control your actions when angered and the subsequent consequences of said actions, is easy to identify with emotion that most people suffer with. The 2003 film languished too much on this and forgot that it is ultimately an action film. This film seems to ride the thin line between action and emotion, between fist fights and questions of morality.<br/><br/>The emotion is anchored by a strong cast. William hurt, Liv Tyler, and Edward Norton all provide strong performances even mention goes to lesser roles like Betty's boyfriend and Mr. Blue. The script is the biggest factor in creating the emotional connection between audience and film. I was startled by some scenes of blood and broken bodies showing the true extent of hulks power and the mental anguish Bruce has to deal with knowing he is the cause of it all. Scenes of anger and compassion are pervasive in the film. While the hulk is a beast of volcanic and temperamental emotion, deep down inside he is old Brucie after all and the film is smart to show that ultimately the hulk is a good guy. There are several scenes were the hulk is roaring, flexing his muscles, and all I could think about was the torment that is raging inside him. An action film that can make you think about the character and not the next action sequence is something special in deed.<br/><br/>Oh, but the action sequences are not to be missed. I personally feel it is important for an action film to have a brisk pace and the hulk even though being a 2 hour movie never feels slow or plodding. The exposition is all interesting and the action sequences are top notch. The action isn't just top notch it incredible. The hulk looks magnificent, his animation and facial expression are dead on, and he loves to smash things. The amount CG damage done in this movie could bankrupt a large insurance agency. Oh, and this is one of the few movies I would recommend seeing in the theaters purely for the sound. Hearing the hulk roar in 5.1 Dolby digital in the theater was worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>The one aspect I didn't particularly like in this film was its lack of humor. Call me crazy but I want a good one-liner every once and a while and the few they had in there just didn't stick with this moviegoer (though one moment when Bruce is falling from a helicopter is pretty funny). Also, I do think Iron man is a slightly better film which it is inevitable to compare two marvel films in the same summer. Still, this is one of the best comic book movies to date, a summer movie that should not be missed, and the beginning of a great franchise/ franchises (avengers anyone?)"
"ODDBear","8","3","5","16 June 2008"," The Hulk re-imagined
","This re-imagining of the green Goliath works far better than Ang Lee's 2003 outing, that's for sure. Being an avid admirer of the Bixby/Ferrigno series in the late seventies and early eighties I found this film to be closer in spirit to the series and I definitely liked that.<br/><br/>The Hulk's origins are played out at the very beginning and once that's over and done with audiences are in for a fast paced and enjoyable ride. The film attempts to keep people who liked the series happy as well as the crowd who want it firmly rooted in Marvel tradition. The Hulk battles a foe called The Abomination in the final third, and by the way that fight is pretty awesome, and I gather that that's a person to be found in the original comics.<br/><br/>While some aspects from the film can be linked to the original series, the characters here are from the comics. Here are General Ross and his daughter, who were also present in Ang Lee's version. The Hulk not only battles The Abomination but also the U.S. Army and that wasn't the case with the series. Banner did get captured by the army at one point but that was never a recurring thing.<br/><br/>But a big thumbs up for the homages to the old series. Only a few minutes in we're greeted with a small tribute to the late Bill Bixby, as Norton switches channels in Brazil and watches for a few seconds an episode from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"". Lou Ferrigno gets a small speaking part that comes off very well, a journalist named Jack McGee is mentioned and that envelope with ""David B."" was a nice touch. I think all the fans of the original series appreciated these little touches.<br/><br/>While Eric Bana was one of the few things that was positive about Hulk (2003), Norton betters him here. He's such a natural performer and he can convey so much with mere expressions. He was the perfect choice to play Banner, in some ways he reminded me of Bixby. Tim Roth is one of those actors who's always good and he doesn't falter here. But William Hurt really surprised me. I've always thought he was good but I'd have to say this is his finest performance in many years. General Ross is a much better written character here than in the 2003 version and Hurt simply excels in the part.<br/><br/>As for the CGI, they work really well. The Hulk looks extremely cool and far better here. He doesn't continue to grow as he gets angrier and while that may annoy some I actually found it a plus. And those huge leaps are history as well, he jumps far enough but nothing compared to Ang Lee's version.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk does well what it intends to do which is entertain. It's full of action, very well acted and fairly well written overall."

","After seeing part of the original disasterpiece churned out by Marvel in 2003 I was quite pessimistic towards the new ""Incredible Hulk"" movie. Yet again cinema screens would be going green as the new CGI superhero flexes his biceps for an hour, like some kind of perverse exercise tape. My opinion was swiftly changed however when I noticed that the cast included Edward Norton...and much to my surprise he had been cast as the weedier alter ego of The Hulk, Dr Bruce Banner. In my opinion Edward Norton has yet to star in a bad movie and contrary to my initial thoughts toward the new comic book flick, he maintains his ability to turn a potentially disastrous screenplay, into solid gold. Unlike the first attempt Marvel made at trying to bring the no brained, green lump to the big screen, this second try has clearly been thought through. The storyline was sharp and kept me interested past the first half hour, a feat many recent films have failed to do. The casting was excellent and Norton in particular steals the show as the disturbed scientist battling with himself to contain his hideous secret. The action scenes throughout were quite inventive, but used bits of car whenever possible, which quickly got old. I mean there's a limit to the ways a big green man can break more stuff with already broken stuff. The special effects as per se with comic book to film adaptations were brilliant and really brought the Hulk to life. The most amazing part in my mind however was the film's ability to make me like a character I've always hated as a child. I was never a fan of Bruce Banner and his large handed alter ego, but after seeing this newest addition to the marvel library I must say I have a new level of respect for the big guy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it isn't all good. As I said before, the action scenes basically involve a big green bloke throwing all manner of vehicles at more vehicles to make big explosions. The action isn't particularly stylish but then again...when did the Hulk ever go for ballet composure? Other then that small rant..I actually can't think of anything else to strike this film down with. I mean of course there are better action films, and better comic book films (Iron Man for example). But hell, there are far worse things you could spend an hour and a half on. Like blending your face for example.<br/><br/>If your going to see this film purely for action purposes and pretty explosions then Im sure you will be satisfied. For the people like me however, who can't be seduced by flames and twisted metal, there is still light at the end of the tunnel. The acting is brilliant, the cast shine throughout and the storyline is well planned and interesting. The subtle use of humour in places also adds that crucial touch of variety that many action capers of late were crying out for.<br/><br/>Overall a decent action film that won't cause mass uproar with the Marvel fanboys, as it sticks closely to its comic book origins. If you are looking for a film to go see and can't quite decide, check this one out. I did and I wasn't disappointed (for a change!)."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","3","5","16 June 2008"," Much better than Ang Lee's ""Hulk""
","Damning with faint praise or not, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is far superior to Ang Lee's 2003 effort ""Hulk"", if only for its opening hour. The film opens with one of the best opening credit sequences I've seen in a while, a hook that immediately grabs the viewer. Many of the following scenes are also superb, with director Louis Leterrier handling the early scenes superbly well, and the first appearance of the Hulk in this movie is among its best scenes. In general, Bruce Banner in South America is far more interesting than Bruce Banner back home.<br/><br/>Back home Bruce Banner is chased, gets angry, turns into the Hulk, and destroys stuff. Oh, there's a poorly-handled and rushed love story as well. Liv Tyler is the most criticized aspect of this film in general but I found her performance effective. Then again, I'm one of the idiots who believes she should be in more major films. In general the acting here is superb all around with Norton being especially effective in the lead role, which he handles far better than Eric Bana did.<br/><br/>""The Incredible Hulk"" stops being very interesting around when the film turns from an absorbing and entertaining science fiction film into a bunch of excuses for the big ol' green fellow to destroy things. At least that's how this film feels in its latter half, and instead of being entertained I'm watching a solid script deteriorate rapidly.<br/><br/>Of course, ""The Incredible Hulk"" could turn out to be something of a comic book-to-film masterpiece when we get to see the original cut of the film that Leterrier and Norton wanted. From what we've seen thus far it is definitely clear that had this film gone the contemplative drama route it would have worked much better than Lee's ""Hulk"". Could the added minutes that we might get on DVD help this film reach its potential? I don't know. Until then, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a good summer flick worth watching but not much more. See it for the best-realized Hulk in any live action version thus far.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"TheLionsMane","9","3","5","16 June 2008"," Over all, as good as Iron Man.
","When I heard Edward Norton was going to be the Hulk, I was surprised. Can he pull it off, I thought. He did.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the 2003 version, and was wondering - hoping - that this reboot would top it. It did.<br/><br/>The story was changed and improved, CGI was fantastic, chemistry was perfect, and the amazing end fight had me very impressed.<br/><br/>When I saw Iron Man, I wondered, ""Will the Hulk equal, or perhaps better it?"" It did. <br/><br/>MILD SPOILERS BELOW!!!<br/><br/>Tony Stark's cameo was a pleasant surprise, and I hope to see Iron Man and the Hulk in a movie soon.<br/><br/>Overall, just as good as Iron Man. That is, 9/10."
"abecipriano","7","3","5","16 June 2008"," Simpler but more entertaining movie
","First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.<br/><br/>This Incredible Hulk version is a simpler story; however, with strong performances by Edward Norton, William Hurt and Liv Tyler, it entertains (yes the key word is that it ENTERTAINS) better than its predecessor.<br/><br/>While it retains a more serious tone generally than, say Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk is definitely not a pushover when it comes to getting fans to enjoy a good movie. The action sequences, though not that many, were pretty good. Whatever lacking in action you think it has in the beginning, the climax between the Hulk and Abomination (you've seen that in the trailer so no spoiler there) should more than make up for it. It doesn't have many light moments (I only count about 3, really, cause they were quite few so I remembered them), but it wasn't as totally dark as the Ang Lee version.<br/><br/>And to some extent, at least this Hulk is less CGI/cartoony-looking than the last one. While he does have those weird ridges/lines stretching across his body, making the muscles seem different than what you'd see on a big body builder, this Hulk is more realistic (but really, how realistic can you get with a CGI-made anti-hero?), so you at least have an improvement there.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is more believable as the ""tragic-story-of-my-life"" protagonist Bruce Banner (no offense to Eric Bana, but he was just too muscular and less flawed-looking that Norton). The one actor I miss here, though, is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. While Liv Tyler's portrayal was credible enough, I don't think anyone can beat Jennifer's take on Ms. Ross.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. Good enough to watch, entertaining and enjoyable without the complexities that the 2003 movie brought to the table, and a worthy addition to cinematic adaptation library that Marvel's adding every year. Hopefully, it will pick up steam after people realize that it's not the complicated, semi-psychological thriller (?) movie that the 2003 Hulk attempted to be. Rather an enjoyable cinematic achievement that's good enough to watch on the big screen."
"jimmy2","8","3","5","15 June 2008"," Not the best film of the summer, but pretty darn close!
","I must say that this film is exactly what a Hulk film should be. It should be a mix of 'The Fugitive' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. The last film wasn't like that at all. Matter of fact, the plot plodded in places, ruining the momentum. None of that here.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's still not the best film of the summer. Why? Well, there's not enough emotional investment into the relationship between Bruce and Betty. What's there on film is great, but a bit more back-history would be nice as well. I wonder if that's what Edward Norton was aiming for before Marvel decided to truncate the film. Regardless, I can't wait to see the additional footage in the Blu-ray and DVD version. If that relationship is fleshed out more, it would almost be the perfect Hulk film. As such for the theater release, it's very strong, but more could have been done.<br/><br/>There are some very jaw-dropping scenes in this film, but at the same time, this Hulk seems more human somehow, compared to the last film. This Hulk can actually be hurt, and there's real pain that shows on his face, especially when he fights Abomination. This adds a depth of character to this normally one-dimensional portrayal in the other film. I don't recall any particular moment where the Hulk in the other movie was in pain, or even if he bled. Good move by Marvel to make him a more human monster.<br/><br/>If anybody was concerned about whether or not this movie is better than the last Hulk film, rest assured that Marvel learned their lesson. The only complaint I have is what I said before; I believe Marvel wanted a film to so totally not be like the other one that they removed a good portion of the pathos from it in order to move things along. However, any complaint about that will have to wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release. I can't wait! Meanwhile, go watch the film and enjoy what's there."
"scorcher86","8","3","5","15 June 2008"," Great interpretation of the Hulk!
","The new Hulk film was well made for a number of reasons. Without giving any major plot details, their were some really good reasons to see this movie.<br/><br/>The movie was packed with action, had a believable romantic element to the film, although the plot was slightly rushed in the opening credits the remainder of the movie did a good job clearing up lingering questions, and of course spotting other famous comic book/ex-comic book stars is always fun.<br/><br/>Overall, Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth are believable in their respective roles and the energy throughout the film keeps you wanting to watch more. I definitely would recommend this movie along with Iron Man if you like to watch exciting action packed comic book movies!"
"RaspberryWaffles","7","3","5","15 June 2008"," Incredible Hulk= Incredibly Incredible
","Remember Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk? Well we can all forget that film now. This movie sure hit the spot for a Friday night. First of all, Norton pretty much dominates any role he is in, after all; he was a crazy Nazi turned goodie in American History X, a schizo in Fight Club, and a complete psycho in Primal Fear. He fills his role as Bruce Banner with complete control over the part. William Hurt has been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw A History Of Violence, and he keeps me entertained in this movie. Liv Tyler at times seems a lil bit too emotional, but believable just that same. I've heard some people on IMDb bash Tim Roth for his part in this film, but I don't see why. Some say he was supposed to be an insano nutcase in this movie. I loved his part and his subtle cruelty and demeanor. To me, he is not the perfect Emile Blonsky, but he sure is close to the best.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie aren't held back or exaggerated. Not like in Transformers when there was so much going on you couldn't see anything. This movie honed in on everything without crowding the shots. One of my favorite parts about this movie is that the Hulk is mean looking. I hated the Ang Lee Hulk because he was really smooth like and comic-book looking. This Hulk is mean green, with veins popping and ripped muscles showing, with some cool hair and an awesome ROAR!. The Abomination was well done too, but I don't want to give much away about him. Another little thing that I noticed that I really liked was, when the Hulk or the Abomination run, it looks as though its actually just somebody running, its so damn real.<br/><br/>No real spoilers in here, and I have nothing to bash about this film. Well actually I do, I don't like Mr.Blue. His cocky, ignorant, comical behavior is not suited for this movie, which in a way relates to Batman Begins with its more serious mood. Seven out of ten stars for a great job by the cast and crew, lets hope the sequel kicks ass. One last thing, don't stay after the credits, there is nothing there."
"Special-K88","Null","3","5","14 June 2008"," a definite upgrade over the initial installment
","Research scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has the weight of the world on his shoulders; a genetics experiment gone haywire could potentially turn him into a monster if he loses his temper, thus making him the target of a relentless U.S. government. Living in isolation in South America, Banner seeks out a cure for his unstable condition, but in order to complete his research he must return to the States and seek out his long lost love (Tyler) with her bloodhound Army general of a father (Hurt) in tow. Reimagining of Ang Lee's 2003 Marvel Comics adaptation succeeds by avoiding needlessly convoluted story tangents, instead relying on a more straightforward approach with plenty of destructive action scenes, superior special effects, and characters who make sense. It wouldn't be as effective without the work of an excellent cast, with Norton perfectly vulnerable as Banner, Tyler warm and empathetic as Betty, Roth chilling and tenacious as Bronsky, Hurt callous and cold-blooded as General Ross. Climax is a bit noisy, but it's still solid entertainment. ***"
"mr_popcorn","7","3","5","14 June 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""The Incredible Hulk""
","This reboot to 2003's Hulk starring Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt did precisely what it was made to do: to be an all out, guns-blazing, hell-hath-no-fury fighting, bone crunching summer blockbuster. The main problem with the first Hulk is that it took itself too seriously, it had more talk and less action and I'm no Einstein but the best place for a 10 foot tall, green beast is in a street duking it out with a 10 foot tall brownish abomination with spikes shooting out in his back. The reboot just did that. It may have not been a 30 minute fight scene as promised but still, we are treated with such a visual spectacle you will be on the edge of your seats until the Hulk does his trademark move, the ""HULK SMASH!"".<br/><br/>This version of Hulk is a lot better than Ang Lee's because first, the people behind the film embraced the idea of the Hulk being a less-talk-more-action kind of guy, second, the Hulk is actually just seven feet tall in the comics not 15 feet tall like what Ang Lee depicted in his version, this film stayed true to the roots of Hulk and they stuck with a shorter, brawnier, much greener version of him and it worked out pretty well in the end. Edward Norton, always the excellent actor, was stellar in this one. His portrayal of Bruce Banner is much more melancholic, emotional, desperate and you sympathize with his plight. Eric Bana's performance was okay but I find Edward Norton's much better and not only because he is my most favorite actor of all but if you look at it really carefully, you can see that he is truly the embodiment of Bruce Banner. He really connected with the character and I'm impressed.<br/><br/>Tim Roth on the other hand, who plays villain Emil Blonsky aka Abomination, gave a very spooky performance. He really dug in to the Emil character and it was pretty amazing. The scene where he in human form, approaches the Hulk shooting grenades at him and then goes all karate kid on him with the backflips and the hand gun, oh my god, that scene will really shake you to the bone. It shows how fearless he is and his drive to destroy Hulk will ultimately consume him in the end. Amazing performance from both the hero and the villain.<br/><br/>Other cast mates includes Liv Tyler as Bruce's ladylove Betty Ross and William Hurt as the guy who wants to harness the Hulk's power, General Ross. Their performances were quite good. Its a step away from the performances in the 2003 version. Lou Ferrigno who played Hulk sometime ago makes a cameo as a security guard and as usual, Stan Lee, the creator also makes a special appearance as the guy who drank that Brazilian soda punch. And of course the creme de la creme of all cameos is that of Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who makes a quick little chit chat with General Ross about this ""group""(read: The Avengers) they're making for which General Ross replies ""What group?"" and Stark with a funny look in his face. It only means one thing: come 2011, I'll be the first in line in the Avengers movie, I'm already there.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than 2003's Hulk and I can give you a 1,001 reasons why. A worthy addition to the Marvel movies collection.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I just returned from seeing this movie and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was never a fan of the Hulk in comics or in television, but this movie managed to entertain me and present at least two interesting characters.<br/><br/>I personally thought Norton nailed it as BB, as he was believable both as a super genius and a man frightened by himself. Props to him. Tim Roth also played his part very well, in what I honestly believe to be his best performance since RD.<br/><br/>While the movie was not quite up to par with Iron Man or either of the first two Spider-man movies, I still found it to be a fun action packed ride. I will definitely be seeing any sequels with Norton at the helm, including the Avengers movie due out in 2011. Take it for what it is worth...this film won't be winning any Oscars, but if you want to go to the theater and enjoy a good action flick, look no further than The Incredible Hulk."
"Cinema_Fan","2","7","17","13 June 2008"," No longer green behind the ears, but still some way to go.
","The green mean machine rises from the vaults of the Marvel collective once more. His true conception in 1962 has seen him more than often idolised in several aspects of the multimedia world, be it comics, cartoons, TV shows and just lately, as we see here, once more, a well-established movie star.<br/><br/>Playing the beast with the flight or fight syndrome that is Dr. Bruce Banner's alter ego we have Edward Norton, who, also having a major role in the films script (as Edward Harrison), and with this input, we have what feels very much, and quite deliberately, like a pastiche of the 1970's TV show of the same name. With a nod to the late Bill Bixby (1934 - 1993) and the shows instantly recognisable theme tune here too. This classic TV show ran from 1978 until 1982, had 81 airings and we also see, in this movie, an identical transformation that is taken from the TV show, both inspiration and respect for this cult show are well apparent.<br/><br/>We have the good Dr. on the run and trying his best to avoid capture, we see his love between Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) rekindled and the dastardly General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) trying his best to apprehend and detain the green giant. All done to perfection and predictability that will have young children loving the adventure and excitement that this formalistic narrative, bland but workable here, holds. While there is nothing wrong in formalistic story lines, it is well expected in this genre, and in its delivery is how it shall be judged.<br/><br/>We are shown and drawn into the world in which this green fugitive lives: lonely, desperate, dangerous, cold and deadly. With this in mind, the Hulk has an equal: the Abomination (Tim Roth); hell on earth is soon to erupt. While the human world pulls through with its action sequences, seek and destroy battles, love lost and found, chastising and baiting, we are then introduced to the CGI world of the Hulk and his nasty foe. This green over-sized gamma infested beast has anger management written all over him; big, muscular, rippling and lifelike, not a bad interpretation of the jolly green giant, personally, I would have preferred the human touch, Lou Ferrigno, you are well missed. The blending of both worlds has its moments, but these are fleeting, but overall, it's more a case of ups than down, giving this movie an atmosphere of excitement that won't frighten the kids in the isles and will hold its own in a fight with the grown-ups too.<br/><br/>The cast fairs well, but Ms. Tyler's soft and gentle character seems more fun when see is angry (the New York taxi scene for example), Tim Roth just seems slightly disjointed here, while William Hurt can be too easily forgotten when out of shot, but this is most definitely Mr. Norton's movie, without a doubt. Like most of Edward Norton roles they're not too over powering and not too undercooked, while this easy role has its moments, we can certainly understand that the real (hard) work has been done behind the camera.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk will continue to prosper for Marvel if it heads in the direction that we see here. The kids will love the action and adventure while the grown ups will reflect on the nostalgia of it all and too enjoy the benefit of CGI, all that we can hope for is that too much of a formalistic direction won't turn this green colossus into pea green soup: we wait with baited breath."

Ang Lee understood at least Hulk is about anger. About rage. About loosing your mind in rage. Only love could break that.<br/><br/>What the hell is ""the incredible Hulk"" about? He isn't even really angry. This Hulk is behaving like a big gorilla. Rather status than anger.<br/><br/>This incredible Hulk is just heading straight forward into the realm of the horrible TV series. I am absolutely not looking forward to a new incarnation of Bill Bixby's Hulk. Yuk! The venture is now heading into that direction. What a disappointment."
"TomCat502","6","4","8","21 November 2008"," Not as good as Ang Lee's Hulk
","There, I wrote it. The inevitable comparison, this Hulk film isn't as good as the 2003 version. Ang Lee's film was flawed, with a horrible climax and too much ham from Nick Nolte. Flat acting throughout, the previous film still exhibited heart and intelligence, obviously planted by Ang's thoughtful direction. Even the emerald green skin color was preferable to the swamp green of the new version.<br/><br/>I really looked forward to this reboot, but I was disappointed. Even with an action flick, great acting is necessary to bridge the gap. Sadly, heavy hitters like William Hurt, Edward Norton and Tim Roth just don't get it done. Most of their failure has to be due to the uninteresting screenplay.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler is one of the most beautiful women on film, but there's no way she's credible as a scientist. She comes across more like a lovesick schoolgirl. Her lispy, and Norton's tinny vocal deliveries, combined with inane dialogue, makes their scenes together no more than fluff.<br/><br/>The action is decent, and the back story and buildup in the Brazilian factory are pretty good. I am tired of the super soldier plot device. Maybe it's fresh to moviegoers, but it's been over-utilized for 40 years in the comic universe. To me, a reboot would take a fresh approach to the gamma radiation.<br/><br/>Tony Stark's (Robert Downey) cameo was nice, but unnecessary. This Hulk has no business in an Avengers movie. Until the Hulk gets his proper treatment, he should not be rendered on film again.<br/><br/>I realize I'll be in the minority with my preference, but I've watched both films a number of times, and I always end up with the same conclusion."

Edward Norton plays his role amazingly as Bruce Banner, where he is wanted as a fugitive and is being hunted down by the government, whose malicious intention is to manipulate his gene and use it as a weapon in the U.S. military. Edward Norton plays a die hard fugitive who is not willing to give into the government's plans, and his performance almost makes you forget about Dr. Richard David Kimble(Harrison Ford in The Fugitive). We see Bruce Banner transform into this gigantic beast in numerous scenes, and those scenes are highly intense and involve hi-tech machinery and amazing fight sequences. Alongside Bruce Banner, we see Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, a caring and lovable character.Tim Roth also played a villain perfectly. Overall, This film contains both great action and a storyline that's everything but superficial.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","With The Incredible Hulk Edward Norton can now take his place in the superhero genre besides such contemporaries as Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey, Jr., and Ben Affleck all of whom have played comic book superheroes. It's the in thing to do in Hollywood these days and I have to say the films for the most part make money.<br/><br/>When we meet Norton he's living in obscurity in Brazil trying to control his emotions because the experiment that turned him into the green guy have already gone horribly wrong. Norton is scientist Bruce Banner who made the mistake of experimenting on himself. Now if you get him mad it's not a pretty sight both to look at him and to see what he can do.<br/><br/>General William Hurt wants him back at any price. His scientist daughter Liv Tyler wants Norton back as well. She's carrying a Statue of Liberty size torch for Norton who when he's in Hulk mode would use that torch as a matchstick.<br/><br/>To track down the Hulk, William Hurt has imported a real bad dude from the British Royal Marines in Tim Roth. At some point Hurt decided he'd like a lot of what Norton has and of course the final confrontation is with them. I'm still not sure why we had to import him from the United Kingdom, but the match between them reminded me of Andre the Giant versus Big John Studd back in the glory days of the WWF.<br/><br/>Though the cast looked like they were having a good time, I'm not sure The Incredible Hulk gets beyond the comic book stage. TV's famous Doctor Banner, Bill Bixby made a cameo appearance via a clip from another old series of his, The Courtship of Eddie's Father. And when the late Mr. Bixby was in Hulk mode he was Lou Ferrigno who plays a small bit as a security guard who can be bribed with pizza.<br/><br/>If this film succeeds I'm sure there will be a sequel, in fact one was kind of set up during this film. Let's see if we get to explore that in the next Incredible Hulk film."

","In many ways this was an amazing cinematographic work of art, the action scenes were fantastic and the military force and co-ordination used to try and catch Banner/Hulk was superbly done. Yet this was the slightly disturbing aspect of the thing. Here was the US portrayed as gung-ho again, being able to ""invade"" other countries at will, endanger innocent lives and permit a rogue general powers that were way beyond reality. Okay so it was only a fantasy story in the Batman, The Incredibles genre, but I nevertheless found myself despising the US Government and its power which so easily could be turned to evil, perhaps it was a warning! Nevertheless with these feelings aside the story was far better executed than in the last Hulk offering (2003) though I have seen better acting from the main stars it has to be said. Liv Tyler (Betty) kept reminding me of Arwen in The Lord of the Rings though John Hurt's performance as the power-crazed army general was awesome. I did sit riveted throughout but came away feeling disturbed and the somewhat ""open"" ending (no spoilers) clearly left the path open for follow-up movies in the future, though I'll not be holding my breath."
"RodVar","8","4","8","17 June 2008"," Hulk Smash Bad Rep!
","I had a blast watching this film! Non stop fighting, roaring and smashing! The CGI HULK looks a lot cooler, more detailed and more believable than the one in the 2003 film. Abomination was truly CGI beauty! The story is a lot more agile, less cerebral and scientific, which is something you expect from a Comic Book movie. Plus, there is a really evil and threatening villain this time.<br/><br/>The performances are terrific, not to say that the one's in the previous film weren't, they were also amazing. But this story allows the characters to be a bit more human, you actually see the actors smile from time to time.<br/><br/>There's a lot of cool bonuses in the film, like Bill Bixby making an appearance on a channel showing ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"", Lou Ferrigno's Cameo and the fact that he is the Hulk's voice, the show's ""Lonely Man Theme"" being played when Bruce arrives in Mexico, Tony Stark's Cameo (Robert Downey Jr. is the Man!) hinting an Avengers or Civil War movie, and the ever present purple pants (you've gotta have the purple pants!) <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film, Louis Leterrier did an outstanding job!"
"thor8467","7","4","8","15 June 2008"," Great...as long as you like the Avengers plan
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun, loud, and reminded me why I enjoy going to see movies in a theater.<br/><br/>As many have said, there are plot holes. But they seem intentionally done. It is well known that the powers that be are intending to create several superhero movies with a culmination of an Avengers movie. It is dreadfully obvious within The Hulk that the focus was to have different story elements tie into that final project.<br/><br/>The acting was alright. I preferred Eric Bana's version of Bruce Banner over Norton's. But, as we have come to expect from good ole' Edward, he puts up a decent front as a cowardly scientist. Live Tyler gives the most generic performance of her life, complete with her trademark breathy voice and all. But, having her not be in the limelight so much actually worked for this movie.<br/><br/>The two stand-outs in this movie are William Hurt and Tim Roth. Hurt plays a great General. While he didn't do a whole lot with the role, he made it believable. Tim Roth is superb, finally finding a role for himself outside of the shadow of Mr. Orange. I loved him in every scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The CGI was never completely amazing, but it does its job. Best part, though, is the Hulk has a five-o'clock shadow. Seems like no big deal, I know, but it was just fun to see an ""edgier"" looking Hulk (as opposed to the far too clean Hulk in the last movie).<br/><br/>As for the director, he knows action sequences like no one else and flaunts it here. Each battle was uniquely and interestingly handled, with the final one being very satisfying. Granted, the ending may not have been to everyone's taste, it heavily ties into my statement in the first paragraph. The intimate scenes weren't perfect, but they do their job to help push the story.<br/><br/>I recommend going to see this movie...that is as long as you intend on seeing this Avengers plan follow through. Basically, it is like Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest: it's a good movie if you plan on seeing all of them. The Hulk proves to be an awesome superhero, but he's lucky that there are tie-ins to the Avengers project."

Jennifer Connelly in the 1st movie was practically perfect as Betty Ross. and don't even get me started on William Hurt. he had to have rec'd one giant paycheck for his wooden performance. heck, he was better in Lost in Space."
"TheHande","7","4","8","14 June 2008"," More of the same...
","The Incredible Hulk is a dumbed down version of the Hulk character and story and simply pales to the Ang Lee movie not only in casting, performances, seriousness and writing but generally by being just another run-of-the-mill action movie. Having said that, the movie is actually rather entertaining.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie is probably the best and even though it is a very distant nod to how the first movie ended I'm happy that Banner's escape to South America was referenced at least a little bit. The continuous references to the comics and ultimately the future Avengers Film, as well as moments of comic relief keep the movie fresh and going but it's hard to look at the film as anything more than a big budget blow out to get Hulk fighting another monster.<br/><br/>My problem with this film is the same as with Iron Man, the film deteriorates into a big over-blown CGI battle rather than trying to actually tell a good story. Unlike in Iron Man, this movie doesn't even have a secondary plot theme to keep it afloat which only manages to enhance it's rather meaningless existence.<br/><br/>Still, this is a fun action movie and I'm sure the sequel might actually be just as good. Here's hoping that the Hulk's next big screen appearance will have a little more weight to it."
"chuff21","6","4","8","14 June 2008"," Did not meet expectations, but still OK
","Maybe my expectations were too high, but after seeing Iron Man I had high hopes for this movie. First the not so great: The dialog for the most part is poor, and does nothing for the movie but fill time. I don't know if intended to have any comic relief moments, but I don't remember laughing once. Between fighting and chase scenes, it was kind of boring. There is really no suspense, and my heart rate didn't get going above normal once. There is also a couple cheesy 'King Kong' moments with the Hulk rescuing his love (Liv Tyler) and bringing her to a secluded location where they share some special alone time...while he's still in Hulk form. Lame, but short lived. While the dialog was poor, you weren't sitting there telling yourself how dumb it was either; it just didn't add anything to the movie. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie wasn't terrible either. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner. The visual effects are done very well, and while somewhat predictable, the fight scenes are fun and entertaining. There are also some subtle references to other Marvel material/movies. The movie did flow well, and while some of the scenes were boring, they did not last long enough to the point you actually felt bored with the movie. All in all it was a decent movie, and I'd give it 6.5/10 if this rating system could do half stars.<br/><br/>***Please keep in mind when you read the really good reviews on here that most of them posted prior to the actual release of the movie, and don't really match up with most of the reviews after the release date. Any negative comments are only made after the release date as well. Coincidence? If just kind of makes me wonder who's posting these early reviews and if they are accurate reviews, or just stuff to boost this movies overall review rating and to get people to go see the movie."

","The last hulk almost made me not go see this. Then I saw the star line up. Mainly the fact that Edward Norton was in it, as he does great films I decided to go. He does a great job as usual. I think I need to dust off primal fear his best film next to American history x. All in all it had a decent story line sure some parts were a little cheesy but had to be, to be PG-13 but hey who are we fooling todays PG-13 is 10 years ago rated r. It had a good beginning, middle and end. I loved how they tied in other marvel stuff and the cameos were cool. The action scenes and graphics were good not the greatest but good.

"fenixurban","10","4","8","13 June 2008"," My Review
","NOTE: most of what I'll be saying is in comparison to Iron Man.<br/><br/>Okay, yeah, um, TOTAL BADASSNESS!!!! The last Hulk was more like, ""Attack of the Play-Doh Man"". But this one... oh man. Not only does the Incredible Hulk delivery, but it exceeded all of my expectations. Lets face it, after Iron Man's success, this film was a coin toss. It was either going to be really good or really bad, and what were the chances that ANOTHER Marvel movie would be just as great? Well... it is.<br/><br/>Since I am comparing it to Iron Man, I'd say it's on par with it.<br/><br/>Pros: In terms of it's action, it's more intense and more ""edge of your seat"" than Iron Man. In terms of its emotional connection, Incredible Hulk is better as well. Yes, Eddy Norton is, as usual, the s**t. He plays a GREAT Bruce Banner and is more than convincing in his performance. It may not be his BEST acting job, (see ""Fight Club"") but it's high on that ladder. And Liv Tyler, holy crap. I was IMPRESSED. I mean, she may be too beautiful for the role of Betty Ross, but her acting is the best I've ever seen. Hell, I find it better than when she was Arwen in ""Lord of the Rings."" In short, I was just blown away by her performance this time around. William Hurt, awesome and convincing, as always. Tim Roth makes for an excellent bad guy, and not even an over-the-top kind. And of course, the special effects blew me away, which is pretty hard to do, nowadays. Yeah, that's pretty much it.<br/><br/>Cons: Even though its writing isn't AS GOOD as Iron Man, it's still respectable and better than most (that didn't sound like a con, did it?). Also, for a brief moment, it had one of those ""okay, that scene just had no reason to be in the movie"" moments. It's still funny, but it's just something I noticed (yeah, still doesn't sound like a con, does it?).<br/><br/>Yeah, similar to Iron Man, there aren't too many cons to say about it.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT!!! If you have seen it, GO SEE IT AGAIN!!! If you have no interest in seeing it, FIND INTEREST, GO SEE IT, AND THEN SEE IT AGAIN!!! If you've gone bankrupt from seeing it too many times, STEAL MONEY FROM SOMEONE AND SEE IT UNTIL YOU BANKRUPT THAT PERSON TOO!!! Just kidding. ^_^ Anyway, yeah, 10/10. GO EDWARD NORTON!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Craig_McPherson","3","6","14","15 June 2008"," Hulk merely pawn in game of life
","The Incredible Hulk marks the second transition to the big screen in the span of a month for two of Marvel Comics' stable of superheroes. Hot on the heels of the critically lauded and box office bonanza that was Iron Man, The Hulk tries to catch lightning in a bottle twice in a row, without success.<br/><br/>Sure it's racking up impressive numbers at Rotten Tomatoes, but that's largely due to the gargantuan action sequences that dot this otherwise brain dead movie.<br/><br/>In a clear example of a talented actor in it for nothing more than the paycheck (and let's not forgot those enticing royalty residuals) Edward Norton pretty much walks through his role as Bruce Banner, the scientist/victim of an experiment with gamma radiation gone awry who finds himself morphing into the giant green monster every time his blood pressure escalates or he feels pain.<br/><br/>The plain fact of the matter is that the movie suffers from an overabundance of lousy CGI. I want to cut French director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, Danny the Dog) some slack here, after all without resorting to CGI the only way to bring the Hulk to the screen would be to spray tan Lou Ferrigno green once again and slap him in a silly wig (Ferrigno makes a cameo as a pizza-loving security guard in one of the movie's better moments). However, whereas Iron Man's effects were impressive, The Hulk's look chintzy, almost cartoonish. You can never overlook the fact that what you're watching is computer generated.<br/><br/>And while I'm playing the comparison game, whereas Iron Man, through both a smart script and the deft utilization of Robert Downey Jr.'s acting talents, created characters and a story with depth, the Hulk never manages to create a similarly engrossing universe. Even Tim Roth, who does his best to chew up the scenery (both literally and figuratively) as Emil Blonsky, the SAS agent-turned-Abomination, ends up serving as little more than a placeholder for yet more crappy CGI.<br/><br/>Am I being too hard on the green giant? Maybe, but when it comes to muscle-bound cinematic simpletons, I can't help think of Mongo from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles when he uttered that hysterically philosophical line ""Mongo merely pawn in game of life."" Yes Mongo, you are, and so is The Hulk, whose creators only aim is to milk theater goers of their ticket cash and deliver second-rate CGI filled crap in return."

","I had hoped that since the last Hulk movie came out only five years ago that this one would be something really incredible, something so good that it couldn't have waited. And it wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be too dramatic. Several scenes go into slow motion and drag themselves out, trying for drama but just taking more time. It seemed as though they were ignoring the pattern of a story (beginning, rising action, etc...) and just went for climax after climax, which I didn't buy into because there was no rising action.<br/><br/>The visual effects were impressive, but personally I can't enjoy a film that is powered mainly on how it looks. That can only be cool for so long.<br/><br/>In the end, I didn't really care much about any of the characters. Emil Blonsky was the most forced of them all, who just seems to be the generic bad guy without being an awesome bad guy.<br/><br/>slight spoilers!!! Towards the end of the movie, the Hulk does a ""Hulk Smash"" by pounding on the ground, and he unfortunately says, ""Hulk Smash!"" right before he does it. It felt like hearing ""it's morphing time"" or something equally cheesy.<br/><br/>My personal recommendation is to play Hulk: Ultimate Destruction instead."
"vickie8669","7","5","11","13 June 2008"," Liv Tyler Disappointing
","The movie was good... the action was ""Incredible"", but I swear if I hadn't been there with friends I would have walked out. Liv Tyler is definitely the weak link in this film.<br/><br/>I loved her in the LOTR's trilogy, but she completely blew this part. Jennifer Connally has her beat by a lot shot.<br/><br/>Apparently they told Liv not to speak but to ""coo"" and ""whisper"" the lines and I've got to say that got old really fast! I think she screamed once or twice... the rest was the ""seductive coo"" which really had no place in this film. It works for some parts... but not for the Betty Ross part. Connally had it down without making you gag.<br/><br/>If they do another... I'm praying for a cast change for the Betty Ross part."
"l_cobern1989","10","5","11","12 June 2008"," Wow!!! the film the first wished it was!!! brilliant
","I have just got back from watching Incredible Hulk and just had to write about it. After finding out that Louis Leterrier was directing the film I new that this film would be a lot better than the first. He produces some amazing action sequences such as Transporter and Unleashed. He also has a brilliant eye for where the camera should and gets some brilliant shots in the film.<br/><br/>I was also very impressed with the acting. Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Liv Tyler give brilliant performances as the leading cast members. I had doubts over Edward Norton but he really does give a brilliant performance and proves that he was the right man to play the Hulk. I thought the way Tim Roth played his character was very good.<br/><br/>People were saying the Hulk CGI was rubbish but when they watch this on the big screen thy will see how good it really looks. The Hulk in the first one was good but this one was a lot better. It just looked more realistic, showing stretch marks of the skins and all the veins popping out of him. Abomination was also very well made from CGI. It looked brilliant with all the bones sticking out his back. Made him look more menacing.<br/><br/>The action sequences of the film were amazing. Although there was only three, they lasted a long time and produced brilliant action. The part where they trap Hulk at the university was really good. Just how Hulk should be smashing things all over the place and causing havoc. But the end action sequence was amazing. At first i thought people were over exaggerating that it was 20 minutes long but they really weren't. It did last that long. It's how the last film should of ended with cars being thrown all the over the place and building get destroyed. Abomination and Hulk really do cause havoc.<br/><br/>Overall this is far better than the first one and should not put you off this one. It is loads better. You will love the action sequences and the action from the main cast members. This is defiantly one of the best comic book film made and the most enjoyable. You will love this film even if aren't to keen the the comics. Go see it. you won't be disappointed."
"nightstrife","10","5","11","12 June 2008"," Freakin' Awesome!
","Just got out of an afternoon screening and I must say I was blown away. The whole movie just rocks. I'm an Edward Norton fan, I must admit, which helped to appreciate his performance, which was akin to the TV series and he plays a fugitive on the run with deftness.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was that it never once gets boring. The Hulk makes an appearance pretty soon after the opening credits (which gives us a backstory) and it's all action from then on. Don't get me wrong, there is story, but this is the ultimate in fan service, because it is a comic-book movie first and foremost and the action completely rocks.<br/><br/>There is a very long fight scene at the end which warrants mention because of its sheer awesomeness (it never gets dull). Much better than Transformers in my opinion because Michael Bay isn't directing it and putting his brand of overthetopness on it.<br/><br/>Tim Roth does an excellent job as Emil Blonsky/Abomination and the other actors (William Hurt and Liv Tyler) are adequate.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie for yourself. Along with Iron Man, this movie makes it Marvel's year. I won't say ""Forget about the Dark Knight"", because I'm sure that'll do Batman justice, but make sure you don't go past this re-imagining of The Incredible Hulk. It is simply awesome."
"Navaros","1","21","68","12 June 2008"," The *only* Incredible thing about this movie: Incredible how pathetically bad the CGI is.
","The Incredible Hulk has Incredibly bad CGI. That is the one and only incredible thing about the whole movie.<br/><br/>The CGI looks like the paid an amateur video game modder 5 dollars, total, to make the best CGI Hulk he could.<br/><br/>In reality, they may have spent a bit more than 5 dollars and hired more than one amateur video game modder. But the end result *looks* like they *didn't*, and that is the only thing that counts.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is rivalled only by I Am Legend, and the Ang Lee movie version of The Incredible Hulk from 2003, for having the very worst CGI of all-time.<br/><br/>Even the television Hulk from the 1970's looks *vastly* more believable and realistic than the CGI green turd Hulk in the Norton movie version does.<br/><br/>Some criticize the TV Hulk for being corny. Sure, he could be a bit corny, but *even so*, he is *still* INCREDIBLY more immersive and believable than this movie's 5-dollar-looking CGI fake green blob of crap is, which you *won't ever* believe is real for even one single second.<br/><br/>Besides, it is possible to use a human actor to play the Hulk *and* make the Hulk have a gritty, dark edge. Just because the TV Hulk was lighthearted and family-friendly, it doesn't mean that that is so *because* they used a human actor to play him. This is a huge fallacy in logic that defenders of the CGI green turd Hulk frequently make. But it's time to put that fallacy of logic to rest, permanently. The Hulk as played by a human actor could easily be every bit as gritty and dark as Batman or anyone else if the writers, director, and producers made him be so.<br/><br/>Movies like Iron Man and Transformers have shown that it's entirely possible to make a great movie using *good* CGI that does not in any way detract from the believability and quality of the movie. The Incredible Hulk with Norton is the exact opposite of that. The CGI green fake turd 5-dollar-looking blob of crap Hulk completely destroys the movie in every conceivable way.<br/><br/>The Hulk in this movie looks so awful, that by even putting it on the screen and expecting people to pay to see it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewing audience.<br/><br/>Bottomline: there is no excuse whatsoever for how pathetically bad the CGI Hulk in the Norton movie looks."

Having watched both films right after one another, it is clear this version is superior.<br/><br/>First off Edward Norton's performance as Bruce Banner is more convincing than Eric Bana as he shows much more emotion and range as Banner, and is easier to root for. Same with Liv Tyler, as she is quite easily an upgrade over Jennifer Connelly's Betty Ross.<br/><br/>More action and this film doesn't feel as forced as the 2003 version. Also more humor and some unintentional funny moments for comic relief.<br/><br/>This film also doesn't drag its plot along and doesn't have the same abusive father storyline with flashbacks.

"Lori_ruelo","7","2","3","16 October 2018"," The Hulk goes into the second round!
","The Hulk goes into the second round! This time, the broken scientist is played by Edward Norton. The successor of Eric Bana and Lou Ferrigno gives Bruce Banner a certain vulnerability and acts more human than its predecessors. It's just not a parade for Norton. Norton is coming for me completely under-challenged. With this reorientation of the comics Hulk, all the main characters were exchanged. Betty Ross is now played by Liv Tyler. Tyler doesn't really fit into the role. Her charisma comes more naively over and the prehistory with Bruce Banner, one does not look at her. Also General Ross was now taken over by William Hurt. Like his predecessor Sam Elliott, Hurt also has a good screen presence and costs it completely. The main opponent is Emil Blonsky this time and is played by Tim Roth. Although Roth is motivated by his role, and he also sees that he is buckling, he also seems a bit stunted. One could have afforded more freedom for Roth.
The director's post took over this time Louis Letterier. Letterier relies more on action and effects than on figure drawings. His predecessor Ang Lee had rather told it as a romantic comic book fairy tale. Although Lee was rather lengthy in his history, Letterier is rather superficial. My favorite scene is when Hulk hits Blunsky for the second time. Blunsky says dry: Is that all? And you can see that in this version a bit: Is that all? Was that all? Conclusion: Better a few effects less to work out the screenplay better!"
"tomgillespie2002","6","2","3","25 July 2018"," Unfairly dubbed the black sheep of Marvel's Cinematic Universe
","In a few decades, cinema-goers will look back and dub these times the golden age of superhero movies. Of course, they are still going strong, but 2008 was the year it all really kicked off, with three key movies in the genre, two of which helped kick off Marvel's Cinematic Universe. The year saw one of the very best superhero films, The Dark Knight, although for a comic book adaptation it keeps its feet very much grounded. Nolan's movie will always be loved, and so it should, but elsewhere Marvel were planning on doing something never before achieved by a major studio: to truly bring a comic-book universe to life. Iron Man came first, and was a bigger hit than anybody expected, propelling Robert Downey Jr. from a risk with heavy personal baggage to one of the highest paid actors in the business. This was followed up by The Incredible Hulk, a film now with a reputation as Marvel's runt of the litter. Yet, despite the fact that Edward Norton was eventually replaced by Mark Ruffalo as mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner, the black sheep label is incredibly unfair.<br/><br/>The origin of Banner and his alter-ego the Incredible Hulk was attempted back in 2003 by acclaimed director Ang Lee, and while his desire to literally bring the panels of a comic-book to life was admirable, Hulk was an absolute bore, failing to add any dimension to its central character and struggling to bring the Jade Giant convincingly to life with special effects that simply weren't advanced enough at the time. Director Louis Leterrier's 2008 semi-reboot sort-of accepts Lee's introduction, and starts its life with Banner already living with the unexpected effects of his exposure to gamma radiation. Hiding out in Brazil away from the clutches of General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt), Banner is searching for a cure, spending his downtime working in a bottle factory and keeping his heart-rate below 200 beats per minute to keep the angry brute inside of him at bay. Ross views Banner and his powers as property of the U.S. government, and wants him captured in order to harness his abilities to create an army of unstoppable soldiers.<br/><br/>It's a simple premise, but one that compliments the character. Ang Lee tried to find deeper themes in Banner's story, but it just didn't work, and when Hulk finally smashed, it either came far too late or was shot in darkness. It doesn't take long for the transformation to take place in Leterrier's movie, and when notorious Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) shows up with his army pals, the special effects don't disappoint (although they are dated by today's standards), allowing Hulk to smash and batter with coherency. It isn't all brainless action however. When Bruce inevitably leaves his hideaway to return home, he reconnects with his former flame Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), who also happens to be the General's daughter and dating nice guy Leonard (Ty Burrell). It's here Banner hopes to connect with his contact 'Mr. Blue' and cure his affliction, while side-stepping various attacks by General Ross and an increasingly powered-up Blonsky. While I prefer Ruffalo, Norton is an excellent Bruce Banner, and it's fun to wonder what could have been had he stayed in the role, although it's difficult to imagine him trading quips with Chris Hemsworth on an alien planet. The Marvel universe seemed to go on ignoring its existence before Hurt's Ross turned up again 8 years later in Captain America: Civil War, but its importance in the creation of this now-massive world shouldn't be underestimated. I still remember the goose-pimples as Tony Stark swaggered into that mid-credit sequence"

"andrewnmiller","10","2","3","22 February 2015"," Makes Ang Lee's Hulk look like Batman and Robin.
","When Ang Lee's version of the big green monster came out in the summer of '03, it smashed box office records and outdid all expectations and was soon on its way to becoming one of the grandest comic book films ever made, then came the bad word of mouth and by the next weekend the film had plummeted a massive 60% and was left thrashing in theaters and was only able to make a profit thanks to a worldwide opening. Marvel was left not knowing what to do as the movie's massive opening had shown a natural appeal to the film, yet Hulk fans obviously didn't enjoy what they were watching on screen. While Lee's film was splendid in its scale and motivations, it clearly wasn't a typical comic book action film and at the end of the day, most movie goers don't care for a two-and-a-half hour mental investigation when watching a Hulk movie, they want to see epic battle scenes and lots of smashing things, both of which the 2003 version of the Hulk failed to give audiences.<br/><br/>Now, I never saw this film when it came out in the summer of '08, so much like Iron Man, I didn't know what I was going to see when I watched this movie; well fear not, this movie is miles better than then the '03 film in every way from the diction to the acting to the action.<br/><br/>The film opens with General William ""Thunderbolt"" Ross meeting with Bruce Banner about testing that will supposedly make people resistant to gamma radiation, but the test doesn't work and causes Banner to turn into the Hulk and go on the run from the military and Ross who now wants the Hulk weaponized. It then cuts to five years later with Banner working at a soda factory in Rio de Janeiro until Ross dispatches a SWART team to arrest Banner, but Bruce transforms into the Hulk, fights off the army and escapes. Once he reaches the US, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and now must contend with her father, the whole US army while battling the monster within.<br/><br/>The story here is great, with a superb script thanks in no small part to Edward Norton, particularly when it comes to the dialog. Despite being somber, the movie does have humor sprinkled throughout, making plentiful references to the TV show and characters in the Marvel universe. The directing by Louis Leterrier is also great for this kind of summer action film, effectively providing both action and more personal scenes to the viewer and making the movie a cinematic answer to a well-oiled car: a expertly, fast-paced, action-filled film that doesn't talk down to its audience. The true heart is the movie is the emotional moments. It's apparent that Bruce has an anger issue. He's plagued and has some of the poorest luck of superhero in any comic book film and because of that, he has become his own worst enemy, leading him to try and find a cue for his gift and always failing at it. The romantic stuff works well too. In Ang Lee's film, we never see a lot of romance between Bruce and Betty mainly because the story never requires it, but here, Bruce and Betty have more time to share on screen and it is used to great effect because while Banner may be invulnerable, but underneath beats the heart of a man who can not be with the woman he loves due to the gift that has been bestowed upon him.<br/><br/>One of the things that sets this film apart from the 03' film is its wonderful visual effects with this Hulk looking more updated, elegant and realistic as opposed to the 03' Hulk that looked more like Shrek. While there are those who might complain about Bruce's transformation into the Hulk being mostly done in the dark, it does prove to be effective in building expectations and amplifying tension as ton when Hulk finally shows up in full grandeur. The action set pieces are also fantastic and while there only three in the movie, they last quite a while and gives the viewer heart-stopping action with the battle between the army and the Hulk bringing spectacularly deafening mayhem and the final show down in New York City between The Hulk and the Abomination making your inner kid giggle with joy along with hearing the words ""Hulk Smash!"" which is sure to spend a chill running down your back.<br/><br/>As for the actors, they are just fantastic: Edward Norton plays a far superior Bruce Banner/Hulk than Eric Bana due to Edward being much more convincing as a scrawny, geeky scientist while also exemplifying the agony and fight his character must endure by always being on the run, hiding and trying to find cue for the monster within him. Liv Tyler does a great job playing Bruce's love interest, Betty Ross, capturing the unquestionable shame of a woman who can never be with the man she loves surprisingly well, not to mention she and Norton have great chemistry. William Hurt plays General Ross as a no-nonsense villain, representing a man preoccupied with controlling something even he doesn't understand. Tim Roth is unquestionably credible as Emil Blonksy, tottering on uselessness and is willing to sacrifice his soul for power. Tim Blake Nelson makes the character of Samuel Stern his own by filling him with an amusing amount of intelligent irresponsibility that flutters in the face of logic and common sense. Robert Downey Jr. even shows up at the end of the film to set up the future of the MCU. Lou Ferrigno also shows up as a cameo and provides the voice for the Hulk.<br/><br/>All and all, I will say that The Incredible Hulk is fantastic and if Ang Lee's film disappointed you then be sure to give this one a watch, it's way better and a must see superhero movie."

","I really believe this movie deserves a lot more credit than it is given. That being said I felt odd about Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Norton fills the role of an emotionally distance awkward skinny man perfectly, but Bruce Banner is one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe, and that was not shown on screen. However, the scripting and directing was well done. The progression from not seeing the Hulk transformation at all in Brazil, slightly showing it in the University, and finally the full on transformation in Sterns lab. The visuals were able to capture the torment of his transformation with spine chilling accuracy(shoulders dislocating and relocating). And finally the underlying idea that Hulk wasn't completely invulnerable. He wasn't that overconfident invulnerability we see in Superman(where he can calmly fight crime). The Hulk had signs of weakness which keeps the character grounded through the movie. Finally, the movie was able to capture the potential for good and the idea that will power can overcome other struggles in your body was depicted very well. Finally the use of the iconic line ""Hulk SMASH!"" was perfect. This is a movie worth re-watching."

The Hulk from 2008 movie looks more real than the previous Hulk. The Abomination is a fantastic villain. On this movie, there's more action and the screenplay is identical to the 70's TV series. Ang Lee's movie screenplay is not bad, but the problem is that it is too much long and it isn't a screenplay that fans expect for this type of movie. Industrial Light & Magic didn't make it a bad Hulk effect, but it would be easier to use a body building and paint it. Rhythm and Hues made a Hulk that stands up to his appearance in comics. And it looks too much monstrous. In my opinion, Louis Leterrier's movie is the original version of The Incredible Hulk. Now I understand why Ang Lee's Hulk doesn't have THE INCREDIBLE at the title."

","One of my favorite Marvel movies. My 12 year old stepbrother loves it. I heard it's a great movie to watch on blue ray. So I bought it on blue ray, and i'm not at all disappointed. I love the story line and graphics are fantastic on blue ray. I thought the old Incredible Hulk movie was just OK. But this one is a little more realistic looking then comic book looking then the old one. A good version for adults and kids alike. And I love the villain. Good thing I didn't rent this from netflix they'd never git it back. lol I do not have a bad thing to say about this one. I hope you give it a chance and enjoy it as much as I did."
"Green_Saturn","9","2","3","10 November 2010"," Lovely 'til the very end (literally)
","I decided to watch this movie with only loose knowledge of the Hulk. All I knew going in was the very basics- Bruce Banner is a scientist who's experiment goes awry and he turns into a monster every time he gets angry. I didn't know what this version was going to be like, and I had NO idea whether a sequel was in the making (which would ruin the fear you get out of wondering whether the main character will or won't die). This movie is AWESOME that way!!!!!<br/><br/>I loved the fact that Bruce Banner is a misunderstood villain. He tries to control his... I'll call it his disease, he works on controlling his temper. He even tells people, ""I'm not good when I'm angry."" He's used to playing cat and mouse with the government, is pretty smart (Well, duh, he's a SCIENTIST), very mysterious and (excuse my language) undoubtedly cute! In other words, there's no better choice for this role than Edward Norton. Even though he's technically a villain since he has no control over his disease, I still found myself loving every bit of him on screen. I'm not saying this is bad, but Edward Norton, at least in this, has a habit of making simple lines pull at you and make you love the Hulk. (Oddly, I found myself smiling when he said, ""The circumstances called for improvisation."" Who would've thought that barfing could be adorable?!) I was routing for him the entire time and Edward Norton never failed to deliver a line perfectly.<br/><br/>Setting Bruce Banner and Edward Norton aside, the rest of this movie doesn't fail to go past expectations! Usually in action movies I just assume that all the main characters will live because that's just how action movies work. In this, my jaw dropped more than once and I did say, ""Aww, what? They're dead?"" at one point before breathing a sigh of relief. The excellent CGI really helped keep the action pumping; I think my mind forgot that the Hulk is just an image made by a computer for about 10 minutes!<br/><br/>""Now, why didn't you give this a 10?"" you may be asking yourself. I gave this a 9 because the ending, though completely fitting, was a little disappointing. It was a bit like watching the end of Inception, you find yourself wondering whether Bruce has overcome his disease or whether the disease has overcome him. I'd like to think Bruce won.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. He had a completely random cameo at the very very end that apparently leads to the vague idea of a sequel of some sort (And this is coming from a die-hard Downey fan). I thought Iron Man was arrogant and, at the end of the first Iron Man film (which also came out in 2008), he believed he could fair by himself. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson told him other wise at the very very end of Iron Man, but why on Earth would Tony Stark listen to him and not all the other people who've tried to give him advice? This Avenger's movie better be EPIC or I'll feel like I just got slapped in the face!<br/><br/>All in all, though, this is a great movie. Since you've read my review (hopefully), I'm assuming you've read how much information I came into this movie with. That's all you need to truly enjoy this film. And one last thing. I tried to resist, but I can't help myself: ""HULK SMAAAAAAASH!"" :D"

","As I had stated in the title of this review this is truly a comic-to-screen masterpiece. I am a religious Incredible Hulk comic reader and fan and it takes a lot for me to be impressed by anything adapted from the Marvel universe. And I am happy to say that this film is nearly perfect on all accounts staying quite faithful to the comics and the classic Bill Bixby live action TV show.<br/><br/>The story is pure brilliance and in my opinion was written in such a way that could only work for an Incredible Hulk film to be acceptable and enjoyable to the masses. You may hate me for this but I really don't want to go into great detail about the story because I really don't want to spoil anything pertaining the story because I really want you to be as thrilled and surprised by the story as I was when I first experienced this masterpiece. I promise YOU WILL buy into the story and be absorbed with the characters and will feel a passionate connection with the main love story involving Betty and Bruce. I mean how can you not?LOL.Tee-Hee. Okay joking aside with the whole giggle thing, YOU WILL LOVE THE STORY! PERIOD.<br/><br/>In a nutshell this is just a great comic book film for the masses consisting of everything you would want in a general film not just comic book films. Everything works in the film. The special effects, acting, writing, music, and directing. I really love this film and have not met a person who doesn't. Forgive me for not going into a great detailed review but I really don't want to spoil anything or really say anything because this is a great movie going experience that shouldn't be spoiled in the least bit. If you haven't guessed by now I strongly suggest you should see the film."

Unnecessary gore that makes the film a bad idea for younger children & very obvious & not very well done computer graphics made me nearly give up on it. However, once the Big Green Guy meets up with ""Mr Blue"" everything comes together nicely, including a much improved special effects scene. <br/><br/>Typical for Marvel movies, like the comics, there's plenty of pathos though it at times borders on the pathetic. This is no Spider Man (my fav) but there's enough meat & mayhem to entertain Marvel Maniacs like myself. <br/><br/>So green means go ahead & watch this movie.

"Angelus2","10","2","3","16 July 2009"," Second greatest comic book movie ever made.
","I'm a comic-book nerd...(Just in case you wanna label me).<br/><br/>And this is probably the second greatest Comic book movie ever made; first being 'Batman Begins'. And the third if your wondering is Iron-Man. <br/><br/>The reason why this movie is so high up on my list, is because it concentrates on the origin story but at the same time keeps going....(If you understand what I'm babbling on about).<br/><br/>The story is simple. Bruce Banner is a scientist, whom when angered turns into the 'Incredible Hulk'; a creature of pure rage, and so the American Government look to harness this creature for their own benefit. Banner realising the sheer magnitude of this situation, goes on the run.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's version was disappointing with the 'Steroid-like-induced dogs'...But it wasn't that bad...(But it was bad).<br/><br/>This movie has a almost spine-tingling music that runs through it, from the television series. With 'real' actors, not models who look like comic book characters...I have new found respect for Edward Norton. He just fits the role of Banner brilliantly, Liv Tyler is sweet as Betty; while Tim Roth and William Hurt are great villains.<br/><br/>But the greatest asset of this comic book movie is the Hulk. He is visually stunning and much more menacing than Lee's attempt. The build up to Banner's change is handled magnificently as we, the audience feel Banners anger and rage as they 'beat him up', 'hurt his lover'...And then Hulk arrives....<br/><br/>And the build up to the arrival of Abomination is beautifully executed, its definitely well-worth the wait...Bringing two of Marvel's most monstrous creations to duel it out...His look is also terrifying to say the least when you catch the first glimpse of him on the big screen...<br/><br/>But the greatest aspect of this Comic Book Movie is the end fight...The greatest comic book fight, also considering that its all CGI...I love how Hulk break out of the ground and gets ready breaking a cop car and creating 'Boxing gloves', LOL.... And he say's the line that we've been waiting for 'HULK SMASH!!'. <br/><br/>Simply one word to describe this monster of a movie...Incredible."

"tburke85","8","2","3","30 May 2009"," The Incredilbe Hulk Does Justice To The Character
","The Incredible Hulk does justice to the popular comic book character giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Ang Lee's version of the Hulk wasn't that bad with some cool action sequences but it was long and a bit of a disappointment. This reboot gets it right and this is the one they should have done first. With a whole new cast and director The Hulk is back. It may not be as good as the Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's still an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. Director Louis Leterrier does an excellent job at keeping the story moving at a steady pace with just the right amount of Hulk action throw in that fans of these type of films crave. This time around Edward Norton plays brilliant scientist Bruce Banner. Eric Bana played him in the film by Ang Lee who did a decent job with that role. But Norton inhabits the role of Banner and becomes that character. Norton's Banner is a cursed man desperately looking for a cure of the rage that lies within him waiting to be unleashed. With films like Primal Fear, Fight Club, and Pride and Glory, Edward Norton continues to establish as an extremely gifted actor. Liv Tyler steps into the role of Bruce's love Betty Ross taking over for Jennifer Connelly who did a good job with that role. Tyler's Betty is a beautiful smart scientist who loves Bruce and hates what her father has done to him. She proves to be another effective actress in the talented cast. Well done. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a soldier with a thirst for power who will go through a similar experiment like Bruce that transforms him into a nightmarish beast known as the Abomination. Roth makes for an effective villain but his role in the movie unfortunately is cut short because for the last twenty minutes or so he lets his CGI counterpart take over. Other then that Roth is great at playing a villain with a lust for power. William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliot (who was good in the other one) as General Thunderbolt Ross who just happens to be Betty's father and Bruce's rival. Hurt doesn't really have much to do in the movie but he does an admirable job with the role. Hurt's Ross is a man obsessed to create a super soldier who's willing to bend the rules in order to protect his country and get what he wants. Tim Blake Nelson has a small role as Samuel Sterns. He brings some comic relief to the film and does a great job with his brief appearance in the movie. The special effects are much better than the first one, the Hulk and the Abomination looked realistic, even though you know it's CGI. All the action is intense and well choreographed I especially enjoyed the first chase sequence because it felt very real and not something made up in a computer. The battle royale at the end was cool but it did feel a bit anti-climatic and didn't last very long either like the one in Iron Man. There's always a surprise cameo at the end by another popular comic book character who had his own movie that came out the same year this one did for those of you who haven't seen it. I won't tell you who it is but for those of you who have seen it you know which cameo I'm talking about. Despite its few flaws the Incredible Hulk is much better than expected and is an improvement over the first attempt to bring this popular character to the big screen. With plenty of action, chases, explosions, drama, and thrills, if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy than go see the Incredible Hulk. It's sure to please anyone looking for an above average comic book to watch."

","Odd casting makes THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in my mind, an interesting feature film, a second attempt to right the wrongs of Ang Lee's HULK. Ultimately, as others in the past have mentioned, by the end, it turns into a video game duel between two monster titans with New York City(..a setting which seems to work quite well as a place where destruction occurs to such a devastating degree)the battleground as civilians, buildings, and transport vehicles are leveled in the process.<br/><br/>A scrawny Ed Norton is cast as Bruce Banner, an innocent University student who thought he was testing a serum in regards to ""radiation resistance"", but his girlfriend Betty's(Live Tyler) military father, General Ross(William Hurt, wearing a hair piece and facial war scars) had actually tricked him..it's in fact a genetic experiment Bruce was injecting, therefore he suffers the horrifying side-effects. If Bruce's heart rate reaches a certain high point, upon excitement, he mutates into a gargantuan, muscular monster rampaging through those who dare to combat it. Tim Roth, in an unusual role, is a Russian(..raised in Britain)soldier Emil Blonsky, called in by Ross to find Bruce, soon injecting him with formulas which enhance his recuperative powers and combative skills. Blonsky embraces a difficult opponent, enjoys a challenge, and yearns for the same ability(..to become an unstoppable force like the green hulk)Bruce has. Tim Blake Nelson(..who I think steals the entire film from everyone who shares the screen with him)is a, energetic, unflappable NYC scientist, Samuel Sterns, who Bruce has contacted over the internet regarding his specific condition, looking for a cure that can kill the beast within(..he looks at it as a disease).<br/><br/>Actually, my favorite part of the film was the thrilling chase through Rio de Janeiro, as Bruce attempts to escape his pursuers, military men led by Blonsky and Ross, leaping across roof tops and into crowded streets..it's quite exciting like a Bourne actioner. The action sequence within a juice bottle factory as unfriendly Brazilian co-workers bring the dormant hulk out from hiding, as Blonsky's men close in, is a stunner. Norton and Tyler really have good chemistry and their characters' romance isn't overwrought. Hurt isn't as intense or angered as Sam Elliot's version in Lang's film..he's more methodical and cold-blooded. Roth is pure machismo and menace. You can see that he lives for combat against an enemy. The Abomination character is quite hideous with it's deformities(..obviously thanks to those ill-advised injections which basically fed more fuel to an adrenaline junkie who covets competition). Great cameos featuring Lou Ferrigno(..still has bulging muscles)and Stan Lee(..the unfortunate who drinks a ""tainted"" juice containing Bruce's blood!)..nice tribute to Bill Bixby as well. Quite a lengthly battle sequence within a college campus between Hulk and Ross' soldiers, using all the weaponry and tanks at their disposal. As expected, the film is effects-heavy at times with Bruce staying active on the run, a fugitive who gains an ally in Betty(..who sternly disagrees with her father's operation)along the way. Norton is among an interesting crop of fine multi-talented A-listers assuming the role of hero in Summer Blockbusters."

","The Incredible Hulk gets the franchise a step closer to what it should be. It gave us a good story and plenty of highs and lows. The pluses to this film were the addition of Edward Norton and his discerning taste in the roles he chooses, the switching of the Betty Ross character from Jennifer Connolly to Liv Tyler (her and Norton have great on-screen chemistry) and a well-rounded story. In contrast to the positive aspects, the biggest disappointment was the poorly developed character development of Emil Blonsky a.k.a. The Abomination. A potentially formidable opponent, the talent of actor Tim Roth was downplayed and the character was reduced to a military thug comparable to a schoolyard bully. He spends most of the movie talking about fighting. A less important disappointment was the ""cure"" which is built up for 3/4s of the movie and then works when Banner wants it to and stops when he doesn't. In general, a good movie with a few loose screws that needed to be tightened."

","With ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", Marvel has finally arrived at a top form of the superhero movie. Granted, as Roger Ebert noted, that its themes are not as multi-layered as the Ang Lee version, nor its characters as complex and ambivalent (Bruce Banner: ""When it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control  I like it.""), I still prefer this Hulk incarnation precisely because it does not take itself too seriously, and simply delivers a popcorn movie with a tight plot, wit and humor, and, dare I say, ample CGI whizz-bang.<br/><br/>Critics who complain about the lack of investment in meaning and psychology have obviously not read comic books. Not that such works are deficient in meaning, rather, they generate it differently, than say the realism of 19th century novels. Comic books do not aspire to realism, but rather to formula and stereotyping (cartoon), much like soap operas. They are most effective when their audience recognize the class of forms they are citing: ""this is the part where the bad guy gets his just desserts"", and exactly how he gets ithow the premise was set up and the story cleverly toldis what makes or brakes the deal.<br/><br/>This is precisely my frustration with the first two X-men moviesthey were too solemn, too much trying to make a point, too busy filling their cup with meaning extraneous to propelling the narrative. They felt too held-back, saddled, as if reluctant in being superhero movies. ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", on the other hand, joyfully embraced the genre, dropped all pretensions of meaning, and delivered the comic book goods.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared in stickslip.wordpress.com as ""'The Incredible Hulk': Marvelous Marvel"")"

","This comic book film I was pleasantly surprised with. I missed it at the cinema and when it came out I bought it on BluRay and put it into my PS3. Now I'm not a major fan of the Hulk, I know of the comics, but I've never read them. Also as a kid I used to catch the show on a weekend, which I thought was fun. Then in 2003 I watched the HULK on DVD one night and I was a little disappointed, as a film I found it quite boring, and not on the same level as Spider-Man, Blade and X-Men that had been released prior to that. So here came the new rebooted HULK, which I'd only saw one trailer for and I thought it looked decent. I put the film on, and I enjoyed it from the get go, the scenes in Brazil are very gritty and Edward Norton does a good job letting us feel what he's feeling as he's trying to hold the HULK inside of him. The film picks up soon after when the army track him down and the adventure begins. The films action set pieces are very well done, much improved on ANG LEE's version, and the dramatic scenes play out very well as well. The special effects are good, not perfect but very good. The cast all do a very good job on the film. It wasn't obviously as great as THE DARK KNIGHT or IRON MAN but its a very entertaining film and I hope that they get to take the story further in another adventure for the HULK. 8/10"

","As many know, Ang Lee and Eric Bana tried to do a Hulk movie in 2003. It didn't work. Brooding and arty with limited action. So this time around they went for a ""reboot"" - new director and cast and approach. For other movies, the word 'reboot' means an update from what we've seen before. For 'The Incredible Hulk', reboot simply means getting back to the basics - more action and a brisk and easy to follow story. In other words, this aims to be be meat and potatoes and that is what it is.<br/><br/>This movie offers up much that is good and solid but not spectacular. The plot is simply designed to enable what we want to see. Nearly all the cast do fine. I wouldn't mind seeing them reprise their parts in any future movies. However, I'm not 100 percent sold on Edward Norton as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. He's a fine actor and there's nothing wrong with his acting here. It's just his approach to the character. Bruce here is quite solemn and repressed. He seems to be thinking deeply about his predicament, but not really in a battle to control his rage. Therefore, it never really feels like a smooth transition whenever he transforms into the Hulk. His chemistry with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross is pretty good though.<br/><br/>On the action front, the film is very good. It gives us what we want to see. A whole lotta Hulk Smash! The finale is definitely kickass and The Hulk versus The Abomination delivers. The film ends fairly abruptly after that. Now that we've had two movies in close succession basically introducing The Hulk and the major characters, now is the time to move on and start pushing this series into high gear."

I loved this movie from the acting to the story to the action etc. It was pretty epic. Finally they have made the hulk the way it was supposed to be made. It just got right to the point unlike the previous hulk film by Ang Lee. It was just so boring but this one gets right to it. It starts out with Bruce Banner, he has been in hiding somewhere in Brazil for a good 6 months still trying to find a cure to get rid of the monster within him. It seems to be going pretty well until the military somehow found out where he has been hiding and hunted him down and it pretty much goes from there i guess. He makes his way back to the states, meets his old girlfriend, and so on. The scenes where he becomes the hulk are really worth it especially the final fight between him and abomination. There was a few things they took from the old TV show as well. ""The lonely man"" song was even put in there and i wasn't expecting that lol and other things. I really hope they consider making a sequel"
"joemamaohio","9","2","3","19 October 2008"," My Review
","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the lamb in South America after what happened to him in the original film. He had to leave his old life behind - including girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler) - behind in the States. But the government, led by General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), hasn't forgotten him. He enlists the help of Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to track Banner down, and they find him in a small South American town.<br/><br/>Banner, who's been trying to research an antidote for his condition, has to turn into the Hulk again to escape and heads back home for a cure. Meanwhile, the government has been trying to replicate his DNA so they can create an army of supermen, and they use Blonsky as a test subject, and he becomes more and more evil, yearning for the power the Hulk has.<br/><br/>Years after the disastrous ""Hulk"" movie, they decided to try it again, and this time it was a success! Gone is the lame animations of the first Hulk, and now we're treated with even better - even darker - Hulk CGI. No longer can he leap across states in a single bound, but he's more human-sized, with tremendous power. Norton portrays Banner in a great way, and the overall animation of the Hulk and his nemesis is 100 times better than the original."
"Velociraptor256","7","2","3","12 October 2008"," Much better than the last film, and stands well on its own too.
","While this new Hulk film isn't the best superhero movie of 2008, it's a vast improvement on the 2003 version (which demonstrated that it is in fact possible to make a film about a big green monster fuelled by rage, that's actually boring).<br/><br/>This time round, there's no pointless character-development scenes that keep the film dragging on forever: the pacing's much better, with most (if not all) of the scenes remaining relevant and keeping you entertained. The film begins with some brief origin scenes before we find Bruce Banner hiding in Brazil  he's looking for an antidote to his condition, and ends up going home looking for help, but he's being pursued by the army who want to harness his power as a weapon. The overall plot is, again, more straightforward than the 2003 version, and flows nicely.<br/><br/>As in the last film, there's not quite as much Hulk as there could have been, but when the Hulk's around, he leaves more of an impression. He looks more detailed, and certainly angrier, and he spends more time doing what the Hulk does best: smashing. The action scene where he takes on the Army on a university campus is exciting and well filmed, but his climactic battle with the Abomination is one of the best superhero battles I've ever seen: watching these two monsters tear up the scenery and effortlessly throw each other around, striking with speed and hardly ever stopping for breath, is just fantastic.<br/><br/>There's not much to say on the actors playing the three main characters, Edward Norton, Liv Tyler and William Hurt  they all give performances which are nothing special, but satisfactory. Tim Roth's performance as Emil Blonsky is more noteworthy: while in human form, he gives us an entertaining antagonist that I wish I'd seen more of. His final transformation into the Abomination is a bit sudden after the gradual self-improvement that takes place through the rest of the film, but that's just a little gripe  the Abomination itself looks brilliant (the bones sticking out are a nice touch).<br/><br/>Overall, this film won't blow you away, but it's a good summer action movie that's definitely worth a look."

","I watched this last night and it is a decent enough film. You can tell that this was cut down a fair chunk to make it what it was: and in doing so I think they may have ruined what could of been a top notch movie ( there are some significant time leaps between shots). Still not a bad film, they could have done a bit more with Blonsky's character and included a bit more of the hulk hopping between buildings like an ungraceful Spiderman. That was great to see. One downfall is that there is no hulk pummel. But there is a hulk smash: which is what made the movie for me personally. Also the babe at the bottling plant is a lot hotter than Liv Tyler!"

","After the disaster a few years ago (and I didn't even criticize the movie for it's lackluster CGI or the few action scenes it had, but you can read that in my ""Hulk"" comment somewhere else), Hulk finally arrived! This won't be the best movie you've ever seen, nor might it be the ultimate comic to film version, but it more than delivers on it's premise.<br/><br/>You don't have to have watched Ang Lees Hulk to get into this movie, to understand it. There's a short intro, that does look a bit like it sums up the things that happened in ""Part 1"", although officially that movie won't be mentioned I guess. Ed Norton does know in what kind of movie he's in and plays it fairly straight. The (love) relationships work so much better and in more levels than those from Ang Lees Hulk, which didn't work at all.<br/><br/>Of course the CGI has evolved and is up to another standard here. There is the odd cameo here and there (nicely done) and if you're an avid fan of the comics you will be more than pleased (as my friend who is a big fan unlike myself, told me)! But even if you're not into the comics, there's a great action movie to be seen here (with a slight addition of drama, just enough to not hurt the action part, but kind of elevate it)."

","I recall disliking the overblown, gimmicky and far too somber HULK (2003); even if the creature’s leaping skills were a staple of the original comic (an animated series of which from the 1960s I used to watch as a kid), I found them especially silly in the live-action version – thankfully, here, they’re relegated to the very end. Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).<br/><br/>As for the Hulk himself, I’m still reeling from the ultra-fake look of the CGI technique: I know having a body-builder painted green (like Lou Ferrigno was in the popular TV series from the 1970s I’m also familiar with) wouldn’t cut the mustard in this day and age of blockbuster movies filled with large-scale gratuitous mayhem…but when the alternative is so unsatisfactory?! Incidentally, it was nice of the film-makers to acknowledge both actors from that earlier incarnation: the late Bill Bixby (the original Bruce…er…David Banner) appears in a bit from one of his other TV series on Brazilian TV(!), while Ferrigno is the lab guard whom Norton bribes with a pizza(!)…not to mention the character’s creator, Stan Lee (he has become a staple of these modern renditions of his work), who’s the old man infected with Banner’s blood at one point.<br/><br/>Another definite strong point to the film is the performance by Tim Roth: his typically riveting intensity makes up for the deficiencies of the character as written – so that he’s believable nevertheless as both a man of action and one who’s curious about the possibilities of science (as always, both the experts in the field and the military callously want to use the techniques to their own selfish ends rather than in the service of humanity); even more importantly, he’s an ideal adversary for both Banner and Hulk (when he’s himself transformed into the so-called Abomination). On the other hand, William Hurt disappointingly (I should say, lazily) hams it up in his one-dimensional role of the cigar-chomping General – one can’t help smiling at his apparent ability to summon all the heavy artillery employed in the pursuit of The Hulk at the bat of an eyelid!; having come to his senses by the end, he is seen taking a drink at a bar when he receives a visit from one Tony Stark… <br/><br/>The action is the slam-bang, give-‘em-all-you-‘ve-got routine we’ve come to expect in this form of mass entertainment – which, after a while, begins to look all the same (especially in the way Hulk seems to be impervious to practically anything they can throw at him!); besides, Abomination seems to throw in the towel all-too-easily during their showdown (I guess being a monster in love gave The Hulk greater motivation). Since romance in the usual sense isn’t possible because Banner’s accelerated heartbeat would constitute another transformation into the green giant, we get a bit of King Kong tenderness between Tyler and The Hulk himself in a cave but which, thankfully, isn’t carried on too far.<br/><br/>I’d never heard of French director Leterrier: looking at his brief resume' on IMDb, it seems he was chosen for this on the strength of his work on the actioner TRANSPORTER 2 (2005)! – he does seem to have an annoying preponderance for sweeping “helicopter” (crane/overhead) shots. In any case, his next film, looks like it’ll be another remake – this time of the Ray Harryhausen mythological opus CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) which, for what it’s worth, had featured extensive shooting in Malta!!"
"dunmore_ego","7","2","3","5 July 2008"," Hulk movie - Smash!
","Don't make him hungry! You wouldn't like him when he's hungry <br/><br/>Bill Bixby's infamous caveat, once again comically bastardized; in Ang Lee's HULK (2003), Eric Bana delivered it in Spanish at movie's end; now in 2008, Edward Norton delivering pidgin Portuguese - badly.<br/><br/>Neither a sequel nor an origin tale, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an adrenalized shot to the sternum  if it doesn't knock you black and blue, it will at least slap you and call you Susan.<br/><br/>The intro sequence reveals the origin back-story, allowing movie to hit the ground running, with skinny Edward Norton as Bruce Banner hiding out in an old-world Brazilian village, text on screen, ""Days without incident: 158."" Our first impulse is ""Wha-?"" This is Edward Norton after all, of renowned Thespian fame; maybe a tad overqualified to deliver lines like, ""Hulk smash!""? Then  it hits: it's EDWARD NORTON, no stranger to Dual Personality  from his breakout schizoid role opposite Richard Gere in PRIMAL FEAR (1996), Norton delivers ""second personality"" like second nature.<br/><br/>In Brazil, Banner works in a bottling factory, performing body control exercises with a meditation guru who thrills in bitchslapping him incessantly; monitors his heart rate via a wrist readout and, unlike the rest of the<br/><br/>world, tries NOT to ""go green,"" awaiting an antidote to his Hulk genes from an online mystery man in America named Mr. Blue, before he dares return home. (Banner's code name... Mr. Green. We didn't see THAT coming.) And running gags about stretchy pants abound<br/><br/>But General Ross (William Hurt) wants Banner's genes to utilize as military weaponry, so single-minded that he would risk his own daughter's life to attain that power. Typical pathological military jug head  nothing we haven't seen in the real world. There's crazy. Then there's Army Crazy. Ross enlists the aid of hard army grunt, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), injected with a super-soldier serum (wink to Captain America fanboys) to take on the Hulk mano-a-mano and capture him for lab experiments which probably include examining the magical material in his pants.<br/><br/>The Hulk's first appearance is well-staged, in glimpses and silhouettes. When we see Hulk in full battle daylight, it is astounding! Not just due to the effects team (Gentle Giant Studios, among many) melding him with ""reality,"" but because of the innovative motion-capture technology of Giant Studios. When the Hulk and the soon-to-be-birthed Abomination move, they are smoothly human; walking upright casually, interacting with debris, machinery, people, water rivulets cascading off flexing muscles and though his name reflects the 1962 Marvel Comics creation, no more is Hulk a bulky blob, but a svelte man-machine with a sexy v-shape. I especially like the way these creatures run full tilt, with the desperate lean and violent arm-swing of slim sprinters.<br/><br/>There are innumerable canonical nods and winks: Stan Lee as an unwary office guy who drinks a soda tainted with Hulk blood; Bill Bixby in a TV snippet from COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER; the *Lonely Man* theme from THE HULK TV series, where Bixby walks the lonely highway in snazzy bell-bottoms that will be shredded by the next episode; a cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to synergize the Avenger Initiative; and  not least, Lou Ferrigno! <br/><br/>When Banner gets back to the U.S. he looks up his old girl, the daughter of General Ross, Betty (Liv Tyler), who, like every woman whose love-of-her-life is on the lam, is time-serving with another guy. Of course, the part-time boyfriend is a complete dork who looks like Casey Kasem in a vest. (It's never a David Lee Roth circa 1980 Van Halen.) When Betty accidentally encounters tragic Bruce, she's all over him like a thousand-dollar hooker. If only all women were so devotional as to curl around you so urgently and intimately after years of separation. That's why they call these things ""fantasy."" <br/><br/>Betty and Bruce seek out Mr. Blue (Tim Blake Nelson), who has been hoarding Hulk blood samples like geekboys hoarding back issues. Mr. Blue doesn't really help Bruce, but he helps the plot, when Emil Blonsky, insatiable for monstrous power, forces Blue to inject him with Hulk blood; apparently, mixing super-soldier serum and Hulk blood creates a big vomit-colored, bone-splintering monstrosity called The Abomination which precipitates the TRANSFORMER moment: that point in any film where you realize everything on screen is computer-generated and that this eye-candy battle between two big things might as well be a video game  and you're sitting here watching it even though you're over 30.<br/><br/>Still, the action surprisingly contains heart. Hulk becomes Hero. No matter the many incarnations that portray Hulk as brainless or fogged with gamma-amnesia, this Hulk retains a sizeable chunk of Banner-brain, and his fierce compassion bleeds right offa the emerald giant's computer blips. We sense that Hulk's most compelling battle is not with big things that go boom, but with himself. And as good as Hulk's battles are, I don't think many of us over 30 would complain had we been given more of the great Ed Norton doing introspective and sullen.<br/><br/>End frames set up the Avenger Initiative with Stark  it is no secret Marvel are cross-pollinating their cameos; hope springs eternal that IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK presage a spate of quality Marvel offerings, and that the slated 2011 release of FIRST AVENGER: CAPTAIN America won't be as super-mundane as the 1979 TV series, with Reb Brown gadding about in a foamy muscle suit and plastic bike. As a Cap fan, that debacle made me very angry.<br/><br/>Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."
"tomok97","7","2","3","2 July 2008"," Way better than Ang Lee's version
","Let's start with answering the most pressing questionNo, the Hulk doesn't fight roided out poodles in this one.<br/><br/>If you liked Ang Lee's take on the Hulk back in 2003 (ahhhhyou're the one) then you won't be happy with The Incredible Hulk. For the rest of us, you're in for a treat. A reboot of a franchise this new is unprecedented but it was worth the risk. Think of it as a $100 million first draft.<br/><br/>It's rough for Hulk, coming on the heels of Iron Man. Iron Man was the best comic book movie since Spiderman 2 and quite possibly since the first Superman movie. While this movie isn't the roller coaster ride that Iron Man was, it was a solid cringe-free adaptation.<br/><br/>After a breezy retelling of the origin story, the movie opens with Bruce Banner on the run in Brazil. He's being hunted by the government - as governments are wont to do. Banner is in hiding as a day worker at a soda factory.<br/><br/>Ed Norton brings a brooding intensity to Banner but it's far from the star turn that Tony Stark was for Robert Downey, Jr. However, that is more indicative of the character than it is of Norton. Tony Stark is a drunk (on alcohol and power), loopy mess that has fun with his abilities and status both as Stark and Iron Man. Conversely, for all of the Hulk's power, Banner has virtually none. He's hunted, broke and tired. Tony Stark looks for cool robot technology to build cool robot suits. Bruce Banner looks for stretchy pants. It can be hard to compete.<br/><br/>Downey as Tony Stark is like Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or Harrison Ford as Han Solo  a performance so instantly iconic that you can't imagine any other actor in the role. Norton does a good job but it never quite reaches that level. While some of that falls at the feet of the screenplay, he co-wrote it we so can blame him either way. (In his defense, he is unhappy with the final version of the movie and is refusing to do press in support of the film. There is allegedly a pending DVD release with a whopping 70 minutes of additional footage, so time will tell.) The movie is much more serious than recent comic book outings with the exception of The Batman franchise. Unlike most superheroes, Banner/Hulk is a threat to the public NOT it's savior. This has always been a hurdle for the comic book and it's the main reason the show ended up as a green-tinted version of The Fugitive.<br/><br/>This movie definitely has more of the tone of '70s show but with less cheese and better effects. We get the footage of Banner ripping through his clothes and his eyes turning green as his inner-beast finally wins out. The score, while different, has the same sense of melancholy. And we get the same lingering shots of a lonely Banner walking dejectedly into the distance down an empty road.<br/><br/>The movie is a little slow paced in the first half. I took my 8-year old son and he got a tad restless around the 45 minute mark and he is a very good movie watcher (not to brag or anything). But the second half brings the noise, as it were, and we all get to see what we paid for: The Hulk smashing stuff. The final fight sequence clocks in at close to half-an-hour as The Hulk battles Tim Roth as Abomination for, um, wellI don't really remember what for. Does it matter? It was Hulk vs. Bigger Hulk and there was much smashing and crunching and car throwing and it was good.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk was definitely worth the price of admission. Marvel Studios was smart to reboot the franchise. Judging by the hints they've been dropping and cameos that have been popping up in this movie and Iron Man, they appear to be laying the groundwork for the biggest comic book movie in the history of comic book movies: The Avengersand I for one, can't wait.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Superman and 1 being Condorman, The Incredible Hulk gets a 7."
"TheAmericanBeggar","8","2","3","1 July 2008"," Bruce banner gets his bearings
","I had watched Ang Lee's Hulk in the theaters in 2003, in high hopes. I was let down, as was most of you. I had said if they ever come out with a sequel, I would not watch it. Now I know this isn't a sequel, but a re-imagining. What's funny is that it seems this movie is an imagining of the television series and Ang Lee's version is an imagining of the comic books. For me, it is safe to say that I like the television series better. From the start, you can tell that the film is different, almost the entire first act takes place in a different language, a bold move for a tentpole film, but something well done. Everyone is on their A Game, Edward Norton booms as Bruce Banner, something that Eric Bana did not so well, I mean, Bruce Banner is suppose to be geeky, Eric Bana played freaking' Chopper. Geekiness does not shine well for Bana. Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, and Tim Blake Nelson round of the cast in a glorious visioning of a comic book. Yeah, Iron Man may be better, but that doesn't mean that this film isn't awesome as well. So go out, and see it, Now!!!"
"ed_two_o_nine","8","2","3","1 July 2008"," Hulk is a smash
","OK fight fans here we go. First let me get started by declaring I am the only person I know who actually liked the Ang Lee Hulk movie. So for me this is not an essential remake. I thought that movie had a magnificent sense of pathos. But here we go the great things with modern super hero movies is just like the comics we can re-imagine them as and when the film makers see fit, and in this case it has been done well. Marvel is on a bit or a role here as they have now surpassed my expectation with both this movie and 'Iron Man' This movie seems to cleverly run on from Lee's version whilst giving you an altered history in the opening credits. We have Bruce Banner now holed up in Brazil a fugitive trying to understand his so called disease. Whilst General Ross is desperately searching for him to cultivate his research into a weapon. Where this film differs from the first is that it is action pretty much all the way and very well done it is too. Hulk seems a little smaller and therefore more accessible but the CG is good and the rainy sequence trick is used once again to help the blending in of scenes. Also where this film will work for the fan boys is in the appearance of a proper comic book villain in Abomination. Abomination's back story is handled well and Tim Roth gives a good hammy performance to match the stellar efforts from the rest of the cast. (I have heard Edward Norton is unhappy with the cinema cut and would like to see the cut he preferred, and would really hope he makes himself available for any potential sequels). There was some good homage's to the past with a TC clip of Bill Bixby, a cameo by Ferringo and the inevitable Stan Lee cameo and a real plus for me they even worked in a little bit of the old TV theme tune. A real unexpected treat."
"jdkraus","8","2","3","28 June 2008"," Surprisingly pretty good...
","People told me not to see the 2003 release of ""The Hulk"" and so I didn't see it. I expected the same news for this release, but I was told to see it. Having not seen the '03 version, I anticipated this would be a sequel and I wouldn't like it since I missed the first one. To my surprise though, ""The Incredible Hulk"" was no sequel, rather its own take on the character Bruce Banner and the Hulk.<br/><br/>Unlike some other superhero movies that I have seen, this had a plot that I found interesting. Rather than just being about a giant, angry green man who unleashes massive destruction, it's about the real man underneath who wants to change. Such a unique idea shows that the lead actor Edward Norton, who helped wrote the script, is more than just an ordinary thespian.<br/><br/>Norton was a great choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk. He's believable, engaging, and at times funny. Liv Tyler (still beautiful as ever), is another a good addition to the film as Banner's romance. Together, Norton and Tyler made the film even more intriguing. It was also nice to see Tim Roth, who later becomes the Hulk's archenemy in the movie. I've only seen him in a couple of other films, but he always played a decent villain as he does in this.<br/><br/>Like with all other superhero movies, there's a lot of CGI. I won't say I was impressed by it like I was with ""King Kong"" or even ""Transformers"", since it's almost in every action flick, but the fight sequence between Hulk and Abomination at the end was quite a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>But there were several things that left me hanging at the end of the film. I'm not going to say what they are, but I found them rather bothersome. Then again, this leaves room for a sequel. I will say though that the last scene in the film has an appearance of Tony Stark from Iron Man. This leaves clear evidence that ""The Avengers"" is underway for the big screen. 8/10"
"jkellylincoln","8","2","3","27 June 2008"," Marvel Makes a Beautiful Remake
","When Ang Lee made the Hulk people were not disappointed but not satisfied. So it came as no surprise that the film makers decided not to make the two other Hulk movies planned. So when The Incredible Hulk was in development I had major doubts.<br/><br/>But all these doubts became deafened by the good trailer and me seeing the actual movie.<br/><br/>The movie made the right choice for casting Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and all the other actors particularly Tim Routh as Emil Blonsky worked pretty good to me.<br/><br/>The movie is far more action oriented, great with a more understandable origin and a more vulnerable Hulk. Hence why they would make the Abomination a superior match to the Hulk. The acting and the hyper-realistic tone are all done very well and it is a great movie. I like how they were able to put in the Leader as a nice little hidden bonus for fans and Tony Stark revealing the plans about the Avengers.<br/><br/>My two regrets are that this new General Ross is not as menacing as Sam Elliot and that it did not have some of the science explained enough."
"come2whereimfrom","7","2","3","26 June 2008"," Hulk smash-hit!
","From that brilliant poster of Ed Norton dressed all in denim walking away from the huge frame of his alter ego the Hulk to the superb end fight that shows the makers of Spiderman 3 how it should be done this is a great film. Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create 'super soldiers'. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it's smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy."
"stallone-9","10","2","3","24 June 2008"," The Hulk movie I've always wanted!!!
","This was without a doubt one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen simply because it is awesome to see one of your favorite comic book characters on the big screen in all his might.The 2003 version was beyond disappointing because it was far from the source material,too long and boring and of course not enough Hulk smash action.Thank God director Louis Leterrier fixed the mistakes Ang Lee made and created one of the best comic adaptations ever.The cast is great and Eddy Norton once again proves he's one of the best actors of his generation and the perfect man to play the tormented Bruce Banner.The rest of the cast is great also:Liv Tyler is a great Betty and is really sympathetic with the monster just like in the comics.Tim Roth is a great Blonsky and an even better Abomination,he's just pure badass evil.William Hurt is the best General Ross ever!!!He is literally pulled from the pages of the comic-divided between the duty to capture the rampaging monster and the love for his daughter he really nailed the part.One of the biggest improvements from the previous film is definitely the CGI-The Hulk looks as real as he can be-the skin coloring,textures and shades are all superb bravo to the effects guys they did a fantastic job.Abomination looks great too.His final clash with Hulk is something to talk about for a long time.This is what I call an epic fight.In conclusion I'd like to say that if you are a Hulk fan you must absolutely see this film and I bet you will love it.If you're not a Hulk fan you will enjoy it still.One of the most entertaining action packed movies for years."
"on_the_can","8","2","3","23 June 2008"," Good one!
","I'll start by saying that I actually liked the 2003 Ang Lee Hulk and was initially disappointed when I heard they were rebooting rather than continuing, but when this movie was over and my friend said, ""that was a zillion times better than the first one,"" I had to agree.<br/><br/>With Louis Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, you get a much more down to earth streamlined version of the Hulk everybody wanted the first time around. This is not to say in the least that it's nothing but a CGI fest, all the contrary. The script is smart, not just in its science but in its dialog and handling of the otherworldly subject matter. Letterier, with the help of Edward Norton and company do a remarkable job of convincing you that this could actually happen, even though we all know it couldn't. Characters are strongly developed with well paced tension that eventually builds to a heart stopping climax on the streets of New York. Your movie ticket's gonna buy you heart, humor and loads of thrills and action folks.<br/><br/>It's a little disheartening to think that this film's success may easily be hampered by movie goers who still have a bad taste in their mouth from 2003, I wanna address that. This is not a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 film. This is a complete reboot, they started again from scratch, to make amends and they have succeeded. The movie does a great job of starting over by giving you only snippets in the form of early flashbacks to show how the Hulk was created and what sent Bruce Banner on the run from the law. This sets the movie into action in record time. We catch up with him some years later, he hasn't seen the love of his life, Betty in all that time and she has yet to see or even realize what Bruce's problem really is. Bruce is hiding in Brazil and has been off the grid for about six months, but when a freak accident catches the attention of his pursuers in the U.S. he's on the run again, and eventually forced back home.<br/><br/>Ironically, considering a common complaint of the original movie was its inaccuracies to the comic book, this film draws more from the 1970's TV series for its back story and the tone even follows suit somewhat as well. With Bruce on the run we get a lot of action and suspense even when he isn't green and we get our heart from his relationship with Betty. Some comic relief comes from this as well. The movie is much darker in tone than some of the more recent superhero movies and the action gets pretty intense too, they definitely push the boundaries of their PG-13 rating. If you've liked Marvel's other ventures you will probably like this film, but if you're a fan of the original series, the comic and or cartoons, or quite frankly a fan of action adventure movies in general, go see this movie, you WILL like it. I'll say it again, cuz I want Marvel to continue with what could easily be an amazing franchise. Go see this movie!!!"
"dantheman0056","9","2","3","23 June 2008"," The true Hulk Film!
","Let me start off by saying that for those of you who liked the Ang Lee version ( the minority) you may not like this. For those of you who didn't this is the movie for you! The Hulk is back in a reboot not connected to the Ang Lee's in anyway. Edward Norton is a great Bruce Banner, but it seems like he could have used a little more dialog and development to make him stand out better. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was passable but nothing really special. General Thunderbolt Ross and Emil Blonsky were both great in their roles as villains. Although Bruce isn't the Hulk for the majority of this movie the action scenes are very intense and I have to admit I liked them better than Iron Man's. The ending with Tony Stark was a nice surprise and will help build excitement for an Avengers movie. The CGI was a good improvement over the 2003 version. Abodmination was especially cool looking. Here's to the hope for a sequel or at the very least Edward Norton in the Avengers!"
"cultfilmfan","8","2","3","23 June 2008"," The Incredible Hulk
","The Incredible Hulk is a live action film version based upon the Marvel comic book's famous superhero who has become famous through both television and even a feature film from five years ago. I have seen small parts of the live action Hulk television series from the 70's, but only small parts and never an entire episode. Also growing up I did read some graphic novels, but I was never really into the many superhero comics that existed, so before going into this movie I only knew a little bit about the Hulk from what I have seen of the television shows and the trailers for the two films. I would guess that the more knowledge you have about the history of Bruce Banner and his alter ago the Hulk, the better off you are enjoying this movie. Unlike some of the other superhero films we have seen lately, this version does not really give us as much of a back story of the Hulk, or Bruce Banner. The film takes place after all this has happened and how Bruce became the Hulk, we learn in flashback scenes and just through conversations that the characters have with each other. Still, I did not find the film hard to follow because of this and it still made it easy enough to follow for someone like myself who was never really been into the comics, television shows, or other sources of media that the Hulk has been in. Reviewing a film like The Incredible Hulk, or even Iron Man, or some of the other action superhero movies lately, is not quite as fun, or always that easy to write about compared to an art film such as Mister Lonely, which was the last film I saw in theatres. I find it easier to write more about experimental, or artistic films, or even films with a lot of in depth characters or happenings going on. I personally like to analyze the films and characters in the movies that I 'am watching and I 'am not trying to sound biased, but usually in a film of this kind, you do not have a whole lot of character study, intelligent dialogue or thought provoking material that will stay with you long after the film is over. However, I can say that much like the other kind of films I have reviewed this summer (I'm talking more about the Hollywood releases that mostly have been about superheroes and have big budgets and so on) The Incredible Hulk is not anything groundbreaking or new and probably not even particularly needed since we just had a Hulk film a couple of years ago and we are getting bombarded with superhero films, but on the positive side this movie has an excellent pace and will have enough action and enough going on to please even the most particular film viewer. Like many of these type of films I see simply because my theatre doesn't usually get the artsy or intelligent films, I liked this film simply because of the entertainment factor and that is all I can really go by for my recommendation. And by recommending it, I'm given it a positive rating, but would much rather persuade people to see something like Mister Lonely if it is playing in your area, or even the vastly underrated film Sex And The City, which is a Hollywood film, but unlike the Hulk it is clever, has well developed characters and leaves you more to be satisfied with intellectually than two hours of mediocre special effects and action scenes that are really nothing new. If you are a big fan of Marvel comics and the Hulk then this film will be for you and for those who live in a city like mine where you are stuck with films like this, you could do worse than seeing this film because it is entertaining and even though it's strictly by the books it is entertainment and I guess that is what people want to see when they go to the theatre, so this may be right for you. As for me I liked it, but I don't think it will be something I'll see again, or remember even a couple of months from now when I have seen more and hopefully better films."

","I like to see this movie when compared to its awful predecessor as Batman Begins to Batman and Robin. Where as the latter is simply revolting, in both cases this movie makes up for those errors by completely rebooting the series and setting it right. When I left this movie, my heart was racing. Edward Norton, who is a superb actor, plays Bruce Banner and does it well. Acting overall is excellent, though I feel that Norton is the best. The filming was also very good, perfect camera angles and action shots were filmed excellently. And the action in this movie is some of the best I have seen in my life. I don't want to give it away, just watch it. I left this movie with my heart racing and you will too!"

","The Incredible Hulk continues Hollywood's list of 2008 Summer Blockbusters, as it does the number of comic book to celluloid adaptations for the year. With Iron Man already smashing the box office to become the first film this year to get over the 200 million dollar revenue mark, and with Berg's Hancock, Del Toro's Hellboy 2 and Nolan's The Dark Knight to come out next month, The Incredible Hulk has a lot of expectations on its head, especially after the failure of Ang Lee's The Hulk, five years ago.<br/><br/>Unlike in The Hulk, where Ang Lee put in a lot of effort to bring forward the origin of the Hulk, Louis Leterrier's new adaptation does that in less than 3 minutes via the opening credits. They probably did not want to show us what we had already seen and not appreciated in Ang Lee's version. There is no Nick Nolte here freaking us out with his creepy (not great!) performance as Bruce Banner's father. There are no gigantic poodles and bull dogs here. There film is not two hours and fifteen minutes long. It's doesn't even get to two. All that, added with a couple of good performances, great visuals, a gripping plot, and one helluva final showdown make The Incredible Hulk a brilliant movie! Louis Leterrier isn't a very well-known director. He directed The Transporter 2, and thats about all his resume says. The casting here is good. With Edward Norton capturing the essence of Bruce Banner very well. William Hurt gives us a the rather obsessive General Thadius Ross, where he acts like he owes no one nothing as long as he able to capture the green beast. Liv Tyler, however, is quite flat. Her dialogues don't really have any feeling in them. Now, I haven't seen Tim Roth in a long time. His portrayal of Emile Blonsky is the pick of the lot in this movie. Not only does he effectively act insane, but that part-Russian accent does wonders for him.<br/><br/>What they did, and did correctly in this film was the fact that they gave us a very raw and very real Hulk. (Read: No clinging on to a fighter jet till he reaches space!). Although all of it is CGI, it is very well done. The effects are mindblowing. The expected showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger which was given amiss by Jon Favreau in Iron Man, Marvel makes up for in The Incredible Hulk. The final fight between the Hulk and the Abomination is really something! Control - that is what the objective of this film is. How Bruce Banner takes control of the beast inside of him. He is desperately seeking an antidote, hiding from the Army, who have labeled him 'A fugitive who stole military secrets'. His living in tranquility for months and months so that he can grasp his anger instead of letting it lose. He even wears a heart-rate calculator. 'Can't get too excited', he says while on a kissing spree. Yes, it does have its fair share of comedy; and also eye-candy. Read: Débora Nascimento who plays Martina. She's there only in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Incident - is what they call the transformation in this one. They even show you a timeline that says - Days since Incident. The shots of rural Brazil in the introduction of the film are very nice. The Hulk too seems more lifelike. Not as rubbery as he did in the previous adaptation. Also, The Incredible Hulk hints at a good many other films that could be in store for us. Tim Blake Nelson plays Samuel Sterns - The Leader, a character from Marvel. There is also a small cameo by Robert Downey Jr. And yes, he is Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man. The weapons too, if one notices, are all Stark Industry products. Who knows.. this film might be an excuse of a movie just to introduce numerous other adaptations. Think - The Avengers! The Incredible Hulk does justice to one of Marvel's most famous characters. Although unexpected since most associate it with a rather comedic version of the Hulk, we finally hear the green beast say 'Hulk Smash'. And he really does..<br/><br/>8/10. Good. Very very good!"

","First, I have seen only parts of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk but never complete so if you want comparisons I can't give that to you. That said, let's focus on Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk; even that this film is like a reboot it begins more like a sequel, actually when Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is already in his ""exile"" due to his ""green"" problem. During his stay in Brazil, he has an accident that will put him again on the map of the US Army (in part courtesy of Stan Lee). Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is their ""special weapon"" and now we have just a search of Banner, who travels from Brazil to Guatemala to Mexico to finally the United States. There he meets again his love, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the rounds between Hulk and the Army really begins. The visual part is great and delivers a terrific Hulk and a terrific fight at the University. Tim Roth's character seems to be in personal fight against Hulk but at this point of the film, he is the only one who really believes that. I mean, the guy claims ""well this is our second round"" or something like that but actually he hasn't even touch Hulk during their first meet in Brazil and in the University Hulk beats him easily (funny scene by the way). Of course when Abomination finally appears, courtesy of Banner's helper Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), Hulk will have a true rival. Both deliver pure action in the climax of the film, and the entire film is just that: pure and fun action entertainment that, I guess, will be enjoyed by the true fans of the comic book.<br/><br/>Cast: For me Norton was a great choice for the role because he normally looks as a very calm guy like Banner, when he is in a sort of hangover after being Hulk all night, but sometimes Norton looks quite different for stronger roles (for example in American History X as Derek Vinyard). Tim Roth is also quite good, again on a blockbuster, and for me to have him in the cast is enough to can say that this Hulk has a better cast that the 2003 Hulk. Before this film, I haven't see Liv Tyler since Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Kings and here she looks beautiful as usual but her role is quite common yet I think she is just good. Two cameos: Lou Ferrigno appear as a security guard and also voices Hulk (I saw this dubbed in Spanish so I didn't heard Lou) and Stan Lee has his obligated cameo in Brazil. Robert Downey Jr. is also here as Tony Starks, Avengers?<br/><br/>Conclusion: Another enjoyable and entertaining film by Louis Leterrier. Another enjoyable and entertaining blockbuster and another fun Marvel world adaptation. Now let's see that Kung Fu panda."

","I saw this movie when it came out and i think it was so awesome. I saw the 2003 movie when it came out on opening night and i hated it. When i hear about the new movie i careless until the i saw the trailer which look good. The acting in this movie was very well done and Edward Norton as the Incredible Hulk did a great job. His acting fit very well with the role as Burce Banner. The fight scenes with abomination where awesome and very well done! The CGI in the movie was really good and it not bad as everyone said it was because The CGI in Hulk (2003) was bad due to the skin texture was crap. In the 2003 film, when bullets hit him, his skin ripples and wobbles. But in this new Hulk movie, the skin texture look better and more realistic then the design in the 2003 movie. The story is very simple to flow and the opening credits for the movie shows how Burce became the Hulk, so you don't have to worry about the story being slow.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome and it worth checking out."
"KUAlum26","8","2","3","18 June 2008"," Not easy being green...again. {{Spoilers??}}
","I was always a little curious as to why,of all the directors in the world,the producers of the 2003 big screen treatment of the Hulk chose Ang Lee. Sure enough,after seeing that version in the theater,while I wasn't entirely turned-off by that version,I came away wondering why what should've been a fun,rip-roaring adventure with everyone's favorite green,muscle-bound beastie formed from gamma rays and brought on by anger/adrenaline was,instead,something of a sort of florid,artsy and visceral film that only 3/4 of the way through remembered that it was a comic book character it was trying to cover and then tried to make up for it.<br/><br/>This version didn't leave me feeling that way at all.<br/><br/>I know much less about Louis Letterier,except that he's a relatively new director whose previous efforts were basically adrenaline-packed action films(The Transporter series,I think),but with that knowledge,I know he's perfect for this.<br/><br/>Picking up from Dr.Bruce Banner's retreat in hiding in South America--specifically,Brazil--after the horrific gamma accident,the erstwhile quiet and unassuming scientist(Edward Norton,maybe a little too good for this type of role,but he does it NO disservice whatsoever)tries in vain to quietly live an existence of meditation and finding a cure for his situation,but that won't last(or else there's no movie). From there,it becomes a transcontinental pursuit between and among Banner,General Thunderbolt Ross(William Hurt,separated at birth from Ted Levine here),Bruce's lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler,soothing the savage beast)and the mysterious ""Mr.Blue"" that Bruce is trying to work a ""cure"" with. Into the mix is ""Super Soldier"" Emil Blonsky(Tim Roth,who's never met a nefarious role he doesn't like,it seems),a fierce fighter whose interest in the Hulk threatens to turn him into something just as or more dangerous. <br/><br/>Come to think of it,this movie could(accent COULD)be considered a sequel to the first version,since its line of events doesn't vary or completely contradict the Ang Lee version. But otherwise,this is more treated as a ""do-over"" and that's just fine by me. This treatment seems more accurate.<br/><br/>The summary line basically comes from the fact that it's truly tough to translate this creature or action accurately without either A)sacrificing character in favor of CGI and ear-splitting boom or B)becoming so entranced in the whos and whys that the appeal of the show gets diluted. I,were I the director,would err on the side of the former(which this show sorta does),since that's probably what most audiences will go for. The screenplay and plot are neither that bad or that good. And that's just fine so long as it serves the Dr.Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk in the way those who've enjoyed the comics and/or TV show are acquainted. This film achieves that aim amicably."

","i liked the first live action hulk movie from 2003 somewhat,but this is an entirely different beast.for one thing,the story is much stronger and better developed.Edward Norton is fantastic as Bruce Banner,the hulk's alter ego.Liv Tyler is also strong as Betty Ross,Bruce's love interest.Tim Roth is also pretty good as a gung ho soldier recruited by General Thaddeus ""thunderbolt""Ross(William Hurt)to try and capture Banner/the hulk in hopes of finding a way to use Banner's affliction as a military weapon.in my mind Hurt gives the strongest performance in the movie.the action sequences are breath taking,and the hulk itself is much more gargantuan than in the 2003 version,although i think he actually looks a bit more cartoonish.the movie also pays tribute to the 1970's TV show at times,both in dialogue and in action.all in all, i had one heck of a good time here.for me,The Incredible Hulk is an 8/10"

","I can say that almost everyone's expectations were low on this film ever since Ang Lee's Abomination (no pun intended) that was known as ""Hulk"" So now it's been 5 years since that film and already we've gotten a Reboot sequel from Universal once again.<br/><br/>Now the one thing I was looking for in this film, was not an excellent story, but at least some good action, acting, and a movie that was far more superior than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Well...with ""The Incredible Hulk"" I got just that. If it had not been for Edward Norton and Tim Roth, then the film wouldn't nearly be as good.<br/><br/>But still, they finally get it right. The Hulk this time around is meaner, stronger, and resembles the comic book character a lot more.<br/><br/>Yes the CGI makes him look unrealistic, but what do you expect nowadays? But still. The Hulk in this film is a freaking monster. He'll tear up anything and everything when he feels threatened. He's like a wild animal.<br/><br/>The action sequences were good as well. The final fight scene is definitely the highlight of the film. I won't spoil what happens but It's definitely worth the price of a ticket.<br/><br/>Within the story, which has a few problems, Edward Norton really became Bruce Banner. In fact he felt so much like Bill Bixby.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk was a good Action Summer film and a movie far better than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The movie is actually better than I remembered. Telling the origin story with a credits opening montage is a really good idea for this character. There are some serious moments that work well and some funny moments that work well. Unfortunately there are some serious moments that end up being more silly as well.<br/><br/>The movie has a great cast as well. Edward Norton is a really good Bruce Banner and I remember being disappointed back in the day when I heard he was recast. Tim Roth is very entertaining as a villain. Him screaming ""IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?"" before getting yeeted into a tree is easily the best moment in the film. I wish we got the return of Tim Blake Nelson as the Leader in a later movie, he was a lot of fun in this one already. William Hurt is pretty good as General Ross, although my favourite scene of his is definitely the pre-post-credits scene with Robert Downey Jr.. Not a fan of Liv Tyler's performance and character though. Lovable Pizza Dad just wants to take care of Bruce before Betty comes along and steals him away, leaving him to feed her suddenly ex. And then she pulls the ""If you kill him, you're the monster"" at the end, despite having no idea if they'd be in any way capable of containing the Abomination."

","The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.<br/><br/>Out of all the MCU films I've seen, the one that didn't make as much money compared to the others is this. Which is a shame because this is directed by Louis Leterrier, who would later direct the terrible Clash of the Titans remake, Now You See Me, and the recent TV show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (which I severely liked). And the acting from everyone involved is good. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler from The Lord of the Rings trilogy does a good job too as Betty as did William Hurt and Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson. Sure, the villain could've been developed more and the second act of the film could've been better, but everything else is done very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, the pacing is decent, the editing is superb, the music from Craig Armstrong is rousing, and the action sequences are solid.<br/><br/>So, overall, this isn't a perfect film by any means but it's way better than the 2003 version (which isn't terrible but could've been much better). To those who have seen most of the MCU films or not, certainly give this one a go. :)"

The movie gives the audience very little background on the character and how he arrived at the point he is starting the film.

","'The Incredible Hulk (2008)' feels the least 'Marvel' of all the 'MCU', though the fact that a pseudo-series of non-directly linked films can have a 'feel' is slightly worrying and indicative of the greater 'Marvel problem' that I won't get into here'. It's actually quite refreshing, though, as it tells a rather insular and small tale that's true to the character, thanks in part to the rewrites done by the lead - who was such a fan of the eponymous hero he decided that he should be allowed to take a crack at the script. The piece also never really seems like it properly lets the hero loose, however. Indeed this version of the 'Hulk' is more of a character-study than anything else, a dark examination of the inner psyche that fuels his rage-induced transformation, and in this way it almost fails as the origin story it was intended to be. How this is supposed to directly transpose to Ruffalo's later, and arguably better, incarnation is anyone's guess. The picture as a whole is certainly not as bad as most people tend to give (or not give) it credit for and is actually quite interesting and entertaining throughout. It hits home the 'anger management' aspect that has essentially been lost, especially since 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' and its third-act reveal. This flick's issues mostly pertain to the cumbersome fact that it isn't quite 'Marvel' enough for most fans, especially when looked at retroactively. Really, it should be looked at as a stand-alone, though that's increasingly hard to do, and - even though it pales in comparison to what the studio would go on to do - it is a pretty strong piece in its own right. 7/10"

The effects in this film are the very definition of ""dated.""<br/><br/>Characters - A lot of the acting was ok. None of it was too terrible, but there aren't really any great performances in this movie. The characters themselves aren't very interesting and are best described as ""passable."" Bruce Banner on his own is a bit boring. I don't think that he works well as a main character. <br/><br/>Plot - This movie is drawn out. Most of the scenes are too long, and there are a few that could've been cut. There is a lot of stupid in this movie as well.

","The incredible hulk with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterization as its predecessor ""Iron Man"" but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.<br/><br/>Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.<br/><br/>Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"". Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in ""Iron Man"" and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else."

Don't get me wrong here, It IS better than the 2003 movie, but only because it's shorter and you won't have to endure the pain of watching it longer than necessary.<br/><br/>Why was this movie made? The story is EXTREMELY boring. I didn't really get what it was about, other than the Hulk being in there and getting angry once or twice, smashes stuff, you know the usual Hulk-thing. Nothing else really happens. Nothing new, groundbreaking, spectacular or even ""Incredible"". The acting was lame. How on earth did a B-movie like this manage to get that many great actors? But worst of all: the CGI. Think about when this film was made and compare it to Iron Man which came out the same year. At least the Hulk didn't look like Shrek this time, but seriously?<br/><br/>In conclusion, I don't believe you have to watch this even if you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or even a Hulk fan.

"michael-3204","5","1","1","30 January 2016"," A dull green hue
","The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rebooted Hulk that pretends the 2003 version directed by Ang Lee never happened. One of the virtues of this attempt is that it doesn't spend much time on Hulk's origin story, mostly dispensing with it in the opening credits montage. I think this is the filmmakers at least acknowledging that, yes, we all saw this story a few years prior and we really don't need much detail. Another virtue is Tim Roth, whose rat-like Emil Blonsky injects some much needed verve into the proceedings, as does Tim Blake Nelson in the smaller role of Samuel Sterns. The rest of the cast is saddled with playing one note each in one-dimensional roles. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler seem like they would be more convincing as a pair of siblings than as former lovers. Neither are quite as somber or severe as Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were in the same roles, but neither really manage to make Bruce Banner or Betty Ross terribly memorable. (We get a brief shout-out to Bill Bixby in the form of a television clip from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"" but that just brought home the sad fact that we haven't had a finer Bruce Banner than Bixby in the 1970's Hulk TV show. Sorry, Mark Ruffalo, thanks for trying.) It seems that most of whatever creative energy was spent here went into rendering a convincing Hulk who can convincingly smash stuff and interact with human characters, and on that score the film succeeds. If only the human characters were more interesting, we might have something here. This isn't the worst film in the MCU (the worst, to date, would come next), but it is the most boring."

","When people talk about the marvel cinematic universe they usually forget about this film and I must admit I was one of those. But now I have seen this film I will admit I think it is fantastic. The film starts with Bruce banner in Brazil attempting to find a cure to his hulk problem. When the American forces led by general Ross and emile blomsky arrive attempting to capture hulk it forces him back to the US to conquer a deadly foe. Now even though he is no longer Bruce banner I thought Edward Norton did a great job on this film and really encapsulated what Bruce banner should be compared to the hulk. You really feel for him throughout his journey and your hoping he wins at the end. Also the supporting cast does a great job I thought liv Tyler as betty Ross was a great choice and she does a great job in her role and the chemistry between her and Norton is also good. Tim Roth also does a fine job as blomsky and the abomination, which must have been hard because he had to be seen as a legitimate threat to the hulk which isn't easy. William hurt as the general was another great casting decision and one that I hope may be revisited one day as he is a good character as well. The story is alright, I like the beginning and I thought banners story was really interesting but the ending bugs me a little bit even though after seeing the avengers I understand why it was done. The script is very good with a serious tone but also a lot of good witty dialogue that helps humanize this story and character. The style is also really cool with both the hulk and the abomination looking great and the style of the film is a big positive. This film is hardly mentioned which is a shame because it is actually fantastic."

Still a good movie, though not as fun as other Marvel films.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Morbius_Fitzgerald","9","1","1","21 November 2013"," My favourite MCU film
","Marvel has had quite the starring achievement over the past couple of years. It generated a surprise hit with Iron Man, a monster hit with its sequel, another hit with Thor and Captain America but also giving the public one of the most over-hyped blockbusters of all time with The Avengers. For some reason in this little world of success, people forget this film, why? Its in my opinion, the best of all the ones mentioned in terms of story and characters. So why is this my favourite, the only one that flopped of the ones above? Let me explain.<br/><br/>The plot is that Bruce Banner has been on the run for 5 years, communicating with an unknown scientist about how to get rid of The Hulk but he accidentally reveals he's in Brazil to the American army who want to make The Hulk a weapon. He escapes by turning into the not-Jolly Green Giant and taking everyone out. He makes his way back to America and finds out Betty Ross is involved with someone else. The army finds him, after developing the only legitimate love relationship in these MCU films, and our friend, Hulk, makes an appearance and kills a soldier obsessed with him named Emil Blonskiy. Bruce then asks Betty if he could travel to New York city to meet with this scientist who apparently has a cure to Gamma radiation. They get it out of him but the obsessed soldier has been injected with the Super Soldier serum and asks to get some of The Hulk in him as well. He turns into The Abomination and Bruce unleashes The Hulk to battle him.<br/><br/>Okay I loved this movie as a kid and...I am amazed at how well it holds up. The development of Bruce and Betty's relationship is actually believable and it doesn't distract from the action scenes. The action scenes in this film are also very well paced, you can sit back and enjoy them without any questions of ""why are they doing this?"" because while the motivations are simple, they're fully explained and understandable. The Hulk is literally just the inside desire to destroy everything being unleashed and The Army wants that to be a new weapon...Its simple but understandable.<br/><br/>If I was to say anything against this film, I would probably have to say the supporting characters that are never experienced beyond 10 minutes of screen time. I mean there is Samuel Stern, the guy HAS A CURE TO GAMMA RADIATION and he's in it for literally less than 20 minutes. For people who have never read the comics, he also becomes The Hulk's arch nemesis who ends up controlling The Abomination, I'm guessing that would be important. Another character is Leonard Samson who would actually become The Hulk's sidekick and in this film is Betty's boyfriend. For the first few times he's introduced, we barely see the guy and he's in the movie for a count of 2 scenes. There is also Stanley, the pizza store owner who aided Bruce in remaining anonymous in the second act, giving him a job and even a place to live...he's in it for - get this - 2 scenes! I don't think the film suffers too much for this but I'd like to see more of them, please.<br/><br/>The thing that I do think is kind of ""love it or hate it"" is the humor. Personally, I'm in the middle. Some jokes have become cringe-worthy, others actually hold up to be pretty funny. The one where Bruce says ""Don't make me hungry"" instead of ""Don't make me angry"" in Portuguese has aged horribly, why? The joke was ""he said something outside of what he wanted to say"" (jesus, don't show people who found this funny Phoebe In Wonderland anytime soon). Betty screaming at a crazy cab driver, speeding through New York city, Bruce tells her to calm down, she tells him to shut up, thats funny because he's The Hulk, he can't complain about someone elses anger issues because he has the worst anger issues of anyone in that universe.<br/><br/>I also have to put in a compliment for the acting, Edward Nornton is fantastic as Bruce Banner, he understood the character better than anyone I've seen on screen. People hype up Mark Ruffalo but he came off as ""too calm"", even when he was angry at people and not The Hulk it was a testament to bad acting (and I know he can act!) and The Avengers also called for him to control the Hulk at will, so yeah, this might be the last Incredible Hulk movie we see for a while because all the struggles that this one set up of keeping the monster at bay, going through explosions and tons of property damage, that could've all been avoided if Nornton stayed ""always angry""...I know this isn't a review for The Avengers but come on, I can't not address that. The other performers do a very good job too Tim Roth and William Hurt actually do justice to how I'd imagine them and while Liv Tyler was a good Betty Ross, I prefer Jennifer Connely, but I digress. Those are the 4 major performances and they all do stand out.<br/><br/>Overall I thought this film was actually pretty good in terms of holding up. It appeals to both kids and adults, it has a well developed plot and well developed characters (well...for a Marvel movie) and to top it all off this is the only incarnation of the character where they didn't sodomize him (except the 1990's cartoon)."
"aesgaard41","9","1","1","11 September 2013"," Hulk Succeeds Over The First Hulk
","Despite the negative reviews of the first movie, I'm surprised that Hollywood gave the Hulk another chance; however, instead of picking up as a sequel, Hulk gets a reboot with a new back story retold in a flashback... or not. ""Incredible Hulk"" is meant to be a reboot, but it can be felt as a sequel. Banner's dream can be construed as revised imagery, and Ross's memories can be behind the scenes details of the first movie. There are no real contradictions that this movie is anything but a sequel; Betty is still a colleague, and Bruce is still in South America. The only problem I have is the cast. Edward Norton plays Banner much like Bana, and Liv Tyler and William Hurt replace Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot who I much preferred in the roles. Tim Roth, however, steals all his scenes as the power-hungry Emil Blonsky more obsessed with being like Banner than being a real soldier. That's kind of where it falls apart for me; you'd think Ross would hire more qualified men with less than shaky psyche evaluations. At some point, you'd think Blonsky would realize why Banner wants to get rid of this thing. One of the highlights is Tim Blake Nelson as the puckish and affable scientist who will become the future Leader. Unfortunately, Ty Burrell gets limited scenes as Doc Samson and is pretty much only an observer to the life Tyler's Betty Ross and her complicated relationship with her father. The plot and script, however, are excellent, the action is impressive and the brief jokes and ""Easter eggs"" along the way to the ""Avengers"" movie are enjoyable. What the movie lacks from the strong cast of the first movie, it actually makes up for a much tighter and lighter story, even going as far as embracing the scenery and imagery of the TV Hulk series. At times, Norton even looks like Bill Bixby. What I like even more is that the CGI is a bit better that we get slow tertiary shots of the Hulk before being blasted with him in entirety, eventually exploding toward a full-on animated climactic battle between the Hulk and Roth's Abomination (now a bit more reptilian and orange) on the streets and rooftops of Harlem. An earlier showdown between the Hulk and the Army deploying high-tech weapons is one of the top scenes in the movie. The only thing that would have made this movie even better than it already is would have been including Dean Cain as Superman to scrap with the Hulk, because, let's face it, the next top thing for comic book movies should be an inter-company crossover."
"lokethecheetah","8","1","1","11 June 2013"," It's Own Flavor
","""The Incredible Hulk"" was the last ""Avengers"" related movie I had not yet seen. I really wasn't very interested in seeing it really. I was ready to pass it up altogether when it came on TV one day. I was pleasantly surprised. It certainly had it's own flavor, different from the other ""Avengers"" pre-movies. It was not all action and fighting and humor. This movie was science and running from the real monsters in this world. There was no other world magic (as in ""Thor"") or incredibly advanced technology (as in ""Iron Man"") to make the movie attractive. There was realism matched with power gone wrong. I enjoyed this movie, despite some of its cliché beauty and the beast moments between Elizabeth and Bruce/Hulk."
"Rindiana","5","1","1","2 February 2011"," Big, Green and Mean
","One of those impersonal by-the-numbers comic adaptations with no real heart and soul, but lots of noisy mayhem and superficiality.<br/><br/>Edward Norton should've known better, Roth and Hurt chew the scenery, and Liv is her usual doll-like self.<br/><br/>The CGI work is rather bland, but the movie's energetic direction and some nice location work serve the entertainment factor. It could've been worse, it could've been better.<br/><br/>Ange Lee's Hulk movie at least tried to inject a personal point of view to the tired franchise, this one's just big mainstream stuff. In the end, both movies get the same rating. Life's unfair.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 bad Hulks"
"emil-karajic","9","1","1","20 April 2010"," A visually stunning and exciting movie!
","Now this is what I call a movie for the casual fans. I enjoyed the film every second of it, right down to the microscopic details in the lore and animation, to the grand action scenes and the marvelous acting, not just from Edward Norton but basically from the whole cast.<br/><br/>The movie progresses nicely with a steady pace. The action scenes are logical, lengthy and totally wicked. The calm dialog scenes are in contrast are calm, short and sweet. They are to the point and a lot of the time hilarious if you know at least a bit of the Hulk lore. The intro scene was a nice way to fill you in on how the Hulk got started and all that, so the movie basically tells you everything you need to know about Hulks beginnings in under 3 minutes, so you can jump directly into the main storyline. I liked that in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Watchmen too, so maybe this will become a must have in superhero movies.<br/><br/>There are many praises to be sang about the whole presentation so lets start with the most obvious, and that is the quality of the visual design. The Incredible Hulk looks absolutely amazing. The effort that was put into animating every little muscle in the Hulks body, every vein, pore, scar and drop of water on his skin is epic. And the attention to detail is just awesome, if you look for it. For example in one scene you can see the artery on his biceps beat in the rhythm of his hearth. Also the whole movie scenery is presented in a greenish hue, witch is to be expected, but it is not just a post production filter effect, as in The Matrix, but the green color is embedded into the scene itself. So the movie is full of green lights, trees and grass, green liquids, items and so on. Plus Banners journey takes you through many different locations but still manages to keep a sense of consistency and theme.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect down right to the last background soldier. Edward Norton fits like a glove for the role of Banner in a similar way Hugh Jackman is perfect for the Wolverine. You don't need to see Norton act, you can just look at a still picture to know that this is Bruce Banner. You can immediately recognize a smart, peace loving man, that wont hurt a fly. And that is a casting miracle in it self. To get such a perfect contrast going within a character is a hard thing to achieve. The puny and peaceful pacifist Bruce Banner turns into a raging, smashing and impossible to kill Hulk, a contrast made in heaven. Tim Roth, Liv Tyler and William Hurt also did a bang up job.<br/><br/>The ending is amazing, that is all I'm going to say. This is the type of movie that makes me run out of the movie theater to the nearest Internet point to check when is the sequel coming out. I will not compare this movie with the Hulk from 2003 because there is nothing to compare. The new one outshines the previous one in all aspects. Marvel Entertainment is off to an amazing start with movies such as The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man so let's hope they keep up the pace and keep bringing us marvelous superhero action."
"JustStone","7","1","1","8 April 2010"," Hey at least there weren't any mutated gamma poodles.
","When does a good premised film go bad? Is it the creation of a convoluted back-story involving a bitter, straggly Nick Nolte? Or could it be having an antagonist that out of nowhere becomes a mutated electro-absorbing thingy? Or maybe it was just that massive gamma poodle....Most people would say all of those things were reason enough to explain why Marvel Studios disowned and retconed the first ""Hulk"" movie made back in 2003 starring Eric Bana and the luscious Jennifer Connelly. And although director Ang Lee tried as he could, even with his unique and artistically clever editing style, the source material and script were just too derivative of a story that's essentially about a guy turning into a big green monster.<br/><br/>Five years later, Marvel who've essentially said ""our bad"" has completely forgone the first Hulk, ""rebooting"" the franchise with ""The Incredible Hulk"". This film looks to achieve what the first film should have; going with what the audience knows (aka the comics and the old television series). So much so Edward Norton (who plays the Hulk) took the liberty in re-tweaking the entire script to bring back the familiarity of the 70's TV show, which he was, obviously, a big fan of. The rest of the film indeed does play out like a long episode from the TV show; Bruce Banner hiding in South America to control his rage, trying to find a cure to his disease, and the Hulk remaining a tragic hero (even at one part having the TV's tragic hulk theme playing).<br/><br/>At some point during post-production, Marvel decisively stepped in to shorten and tighten Ed Norton's cut, which eventually led to Norton not receiving any writing credit on the film. I'm not sure what was left out (besides an hour worth of story) but the final cut is definitely more superhero-filmy. Its never been an easy task to relate the Hulk to an audience (unless they've all attended anger management classes) but here perhaps the footage left on the cutting room floor was extra story needed to identify with the Hulk, which is kind of essential unless you're a teenager who purely enjoys watching CGI monsters smash and fight. And most of the audience was that, so in that way, the film succeeds, but I'm guessing the DVD will have Norton's extended cut, and maybe a better film with it."
"eric262003","8","1","1","22 February 2010"," Where Edward Beats Eric
","Scoot over Spider-Man and all your other appalling sequels, there's a big, scary green man taking over. No it's not the jolly green giant on a vegetable shortage, it's another one of Stan Lee's creations that has become an icon in the superhero industry, the one and only, ""The Incredible Hulk"". When I left the theaters I'm pretty sure the reception was positive or satisfying to say the least. Who could blame them? With an outstanding plot, Edward Norton's amazingly breath-taking performance, the action that's always exciting, what's there to hate? This movie exceeds everything the original Hulk with Eric Bana in many of the essential ingredients that makes movie-making successful.<br/><br/>What scenes developed in the Eric Bana version was accomplished at a much shorter time in Edward Norton's version and more effectively. It gives you that extra boost as we see our hero who's running from the American government in South America. Nothing better than watching one monster collide with another one. He's not doing to flex his muscles and to look scary, but he's doing it to save his girlfriend and to protect humanity in every way possible. The message is quite sublime, you can see it to believe it.<br/><br/>I can't blame Eric Bana entirely why the acting in ""The Hulk"" was revolting. He showed his acting skills wonderfully in ""Troy"",so what went wrong? In ""The Incredible Hulk"", the love story was more immaculate and the dialogue was handled with more believable quotes from Mr. Norton and Liv Tyler. Norton is just an amazingly talented performer and his delivery of lines was simply poetic. There was a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, but unlike ""Transformers"", the one-liners were sporadic and not over-the-top silly.<br/><br/>The newly transformed Hulk looks more real and not heavily saturated in cheesy CGI. Even the design has more human looks than computerized adding effect to the fighting scenes. The action scenes were perfectly choreographed and the real-life Hulk design made it all the more possible.<br/><br/>I must say this is a great film to enjoy and a complete makeover from the abomination that was ""The Hulk"". I even had low expectations when seeing this movie, after watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" I was really marveled by the experience (pun intended)."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","1","19 January 2010"," The Hulk returns to the big screen... and there is much rejoicing
","This takes a considerably different approach than Lee's poetic, cerebral attempt. It is grittier, dirtier and considerably more intense. Props to Marvel for getting the rights back, and now doing these movies themselves. And on that note, I commend the people involved in making this for clearly not only knowing, but of infinitely greater importance, *understanding*, the material. From what I've read, which is admittedly not the most remarkable amount to boast with, they hit the mark to a large extent with this. The plot is engaging, develops nicely throughout, and remains interesting. Every bit of the plentiful action is awesome, epic, exciting and entertaining. That final fight... wow, that is the best of its kind that I've seen in recent memory. The writing is well-done all the way. Dialog, save for a few lines here and there, is magnificent. The characters are well-written, with some quirkiness here and there, fortunately seldom taking over. The humor in general is rather balanced, and the several solid laughs that are to be had do not detract from the rest. This holds talented actors, and it shows. I have to say, when I heard about Tyler, I couldn't see her in the part, though after I heard Leterrier's thoughts on it in an interview I was hopeful, and now I do get how she works as Betty. Norton beautifully internalizes, and he's not off in his performance for a second. Hurt *becomes* Thunderbolt Ross(if, arguably, the role isn't all that fleshed out in this). There is genuine emotion in this. Notable range is even found in the CGI(which gets a serious upgrade), with facial expressions and real weight to the beings. The FX in general are excellent. This gives fans numerous things that they would want in it. The pacing is fast, at times, perhaps too much so(then again, it's not overwhelming, and the audience always gets to catch their breath when needed). I've heard(well, read) that 70 minutes was cut out... obviously, that shows, at least a little. For my money, this is, nonetheless, amazing. The tone is well-achieved, and this can be dark, without reaching a point where only grown-ups can watch... and it never seems tame, either. Nods to the original medium are found in this, and they're well-integrated. There is a brief suggestive bit, a little moderate language, mild violence and/or disturbing images in this. The trailers give a lot away; however, it's still an awful lot of fun, and it is not terribly predictable. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD holds well-done featurettes(three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), with explaining of the effects and stunts, an alternate ending, 43 minutes of deleted scenes, a 6 minute animated comic, and an amusing and informative commentary track by the director and Tim Roth. All of the aforementioned is well worth watching. I recommend this to fans of those who put the film together and/or the comics. 8/10"
"alucardvenom","7","1","1","28 December 2009"," Marvel finally cares about it's product...
","After few dreadful movies based on Marvel comics, I went to this movie with low expectations, but I was wrong. It was great, fast-paced, highly entertaining experience. I'll be short on this write, because this is highly recommended for those who are not familiar with HULK comics, and must see for fans.<br/><br/>Even if I had low expectations about this, there was some spark of hope when I've seen that Edward Norton was cast as Dr. Banner, and he was terrific. He never disappoints me as an actor, and this was no exception. Tim Roth was awesome as always and climax fight between Hulk and Abomination was fantastic. Great CGI and action sequences which last for about 20 minutes were more then enough for me... Ending was also well done and ""opens the gate"" for many more elements from the comics. I wonder what we will get in the sequel.<br/><br/>It seems that Marvel finally understood that their movies were terrible, so decided to take more serious approach to their movies since IRON MAN was also great (in my opinion better then Hulk) and this gives me hope that upcoming movies will be also great, and possibly we will get more serious reboot of some other awesome heroes like Daredevil, Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four (which was entertaining, but bad. Sue and Reed were total miscast, and Dr. Doom was just horrible. I can't believe they turned one of the best comic book villains (and characters!) into joke)"
"Timstuff","8","1","1","7 October 2009"," An excellent, underrated action film
","When I first saw the teaser for this movie, I was a bit disappointed. I thought it looked too much like a cheap remake of the 2004 movie, and I had a hard time getting excited for it. Then, I saw the REAL trailer, and my anticipation grew. Finally, I saw the final film, and it became one of my favorite movies of 2008. This is a movie that IMO ought to please both hardcore fans of the comics who felt let down by Ang Lee's 2004 interpretation, as well as fans of the original TV series. It was a very tricky balance to achieve, but the movie somehow managed to pull it off.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is excellent as Dr. Banner, and is much more in line with what fans of both the comics and TV series would expect. Unlike rugged Aussie Eric Bana, Norton conveys the persona of a twerpy but vigilant scientist, and while his performance may not be as memorable as Robert Downy Jr's Tony Stark, he still delivers. The rest of the cast is great well, and if you've seen Iron Man the acting here is fairly consistent with it (which is good, since these are meant to be ""sister movies"" in the same continuity).<br/><br/>The action in this movie is fast paced and in good quantity, with a surprising amount of it focusing around Banner himself rather than his green alter-ego. Like I said, both fans of the comics and TV show should be pleased, because they managed to find a good screen time balance between the two, keeping our emotional investment in the movie firmly grounded on Norton's Banner. The scene where Hulk takes on the Humvees was awesome, and despite my initial skepticism based on the trailers, the climax with Abomination was top-notch monster mash goodness.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Hulk's brand doesn't seem to have much resonance with audiences, because this movie was pretty much exactly what I wanted when I walked into the theater. It's a fast action movie with heart and intelligence behind it, and it manages to respect the incarnations that came before it. Whether you're a fan of Superhero movies and comics or you just want a great action film, IMO this movie doesn't disappoint."
"eamon-hennedy","8","1","1","19 July 2009"," Really Incredible.
","You see, here's my problem, Ang Lee's Hulk was, to all intents and purposes, a noble film, very noble in fact. The man responsible for bringing one of the definitive Jane Austen adaptations to our screens as well as one of modern cinema's great martial arts epics, not to mention The Ice Storm, took it upon himself to art up, for lack of a better term, I do apologise, I'm sure I could have come up with something better, a property that consists of a man turning into a green monster who says 'Hulk smash' pretty much most of the time. It was noble, of course it was, layering in a foundation that took in split screen editing, that worked, and a complicated relationship with his father and a brooding atmosphere, it was just the film was turning the character and story into something it wasn't, which is why I think bringing in Louis Louterrier and essentially broadening the whole style of the film is a good move, and let's not beat around the bush, The Incredible Hulk, as opposed to Ang Lee's Hulk is a broader movie in every way. The film is not as inherently complex as the previous, the action is more frequent and a hell of lot more fun and more clear to see most of the time and the relationship between Betty and Bruce is a lot more romantic, with a lovely comedic element becoming a lot more engaging. In fact the whole film is engaging in every way that Lee's isn't. Edward Norton, an actor for fairly intense performances, brings that element, but also fun, to his performance and his uncredited work on the screenplay. He plays the more light hearted moments (stretchy pants, anyone, or inability to make love with Betty) beautifully, making his Banner quite a lovely character and you can't help but feel sympathetic to his plight. Liv Tyler is lovely throughout, but that's really all she brings to the table, but let's not get carried away, she does it well, whilst the villains, William Hurt and Tim Roth are fantastic, particularly Roth who literally becomes a worse character than the one he is chasing.<br/><br/>There are those who will undoubtedly bemoan that the film is dumbed down compared to Ang Lee's version, but to be honest with you, I think the film works best because of it. It may be wrong to refer to it as being dumbed down, I think calling it a broader film works better. The action is more elaborate and high octane, the CGI is miles better than before, with the Hulk himself looking less like Shrek's angrier twin brother and more like a flesh and blood creation. It's hair blowing in the wind and the vain's pumping through its green skin is a wonderful piece of visual effects work and the believability of it makes the film easier to enjoy, a major flaw of the previous version. If there is a criticism to level at it it has to be with the climax. The fight sequence between the Hulk and the Abomination starts of well, but does go on a bit long and at times, with all the CGI going starts to resemble a video game. It's the only fault with the movie, but not a glaring one, and when it's the only fault I am finding as compared to the many that film number one had, it's not bad going, and of course, as with all comic book adaptations nowadays, the ending only leaves you gagging for more. That is a great final shot.<br/><br/>Hulk, you are incredible again."
"xxxxts","4","8","22","13 June 2008"," Boring
","I will be the first to admit; I did not watch the television series, I did not read the comic books, I might of caught the last half of the 2003 Hulk on FX one night. However Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. This movie made me yawn numerious times. It was so generic, thin plot, not much character development (besides a few bad guys?), seeing big green monsters box over and over again gets boring after around 2 minuets. Now I usually like Marvel movies, even though I do not read comic books - I liked X-Men, I Loved Iron Man, and Batman Returns was great. Saw the 12:00 showing of Hulk, and I was far from impressed. The action didn't even get my blood pumping, it had much more action then Iron Man yet it did not nearly have the same effect. I apologize for comparing the two but I would rather pay to see Iron Man for the fourth time then see The Incredible Hulk again. I am actually looking forward to seeing The Happening tomorrow.<br/><br/>And a few notes:<br/><br/>Tim Roth was excellent Brazilian Woman should of had much more screen time Despite how bad the 2003 Hulk was, not many women can beat Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>Movies that were comparable/better: -Doom (Yes I am serious) -Godzilla (The newer one)"
"Zombie-Kermit","7","5","12","11 June 2008"," Pretty dang Good movie.
","To steal a line from a man of infinite wisdom, Welcome True Believers, to another exciting Kingdom Heartless review! Alright then! Time for what is essentially my first review of any relevance to current times. And I'm more than happy to be able to do it on a summer superhero movie. Before the real review gets under way, there are some things that need to be cleared up. Firstly, I don't mind Ang Lee's Hulk movie of 2003. When I first saw it I didn't particularly enjoy the movie, but on subsequent viewing I found appreciation for it. Secondly, my knowledge of the Hulk comics and such is far from perfect. I have a few comics floating around and I've read a few from libraries, but I am by no means an expert on the subject. So I guess you could call this a review from a semi-amateur. And Lastly, I am a simple man child. Put a lot of action and fun in a movie and I will be happy. This is evident from my love of movies like Transformers and X-Men: The Last Stand. Alright, now that we have those details out of the way, Let's Get Green. (Yep, I went there.)<br/><br/>I will start off by saying that the general opinion of this movies could really go either way. I'm not a very good judge with this sort of stuff. You could hate it. Myself, I enjoyed it quite a bit. No, it wasn't a perfect movie by any standard, but I still enjoyed it a great deal, and it's been added to my mental list of DVDs to be purchased. But it does appear like a movie that will have mixed reception. And I plan to give a few reasons why soon enough. <br/><br/>A big worry people seem to have with this movie is the CGI. To me, this was not a problem at all. It seems they have gone to a great deal of trouble to ensure that he did not look as cartoony as Ang Lee's Hulk did, and in that respect I feel they succeeded greatly. The detail of his facial expressions and body tone were done very well, and he didn't look as fake as some CGI does. The Abomination looked pretty damn awesome as well. But it's clear that there will be people who want to hate on the CGI. And as I was hoping for in the movie, there was enough explosions and missiles flying around and such to make Michael Bay wet himself. As stated above, simple mind to please. Also, this is no way like a sequel. I wouldn't think of it that way in the least. It is completely different in terms of background and such. <br/><br/>Edward Norton played his role pretty well. In fact the acting was pretty good all around, with solid performances from William Hurt and Tim Roth. And I will be honest, I thought Liv Tyler was great, and I know how much people like hating on her. I thought she was charming. I also thought Hulk's mindless roaring and stuff was cool. Heh. Of course there was a couple of cheesy jokes and self references, as we should all have come to expect from Marvel movies, but all of them were genuinely amusing and didn't distract from the story at all. I did notice at times, there was some weird camera shots that changed into another angle and just seemed a little off, in terms of timing. <br/><br/>The human side of the story was pretty good, albeit with a few pacing problems at times, but nothing to get Hulky about. The action scenes were really cool. Lots of Hulk randomly tearing things apart and causing carnage. I did notice some problems with some of the action being over when it just seemed to be getting revved up. Maybe it's just that I heard some different information regarding lengths. And similar to the earlier summer hit, Iron Man, the main villain didn't really seem to get as much screen time as expected. <br/><br/>I would also like to mention I enjoyed the score, and would like to note the presence of the original somber theme. Cool little thing for people who were fans of the original show. <br/><br/>All in all this was a largely enjoyable movie for me, and I'm hoping other people are able to enjoy it as well. The action scenes should be pleasing to most people at least. It's not the best Marvel movie for sure, but it is up there with the better ones. I'd like to give this movie about a 8.5 rating out of 10, and recommend you see this one at the cinemas. Well worth shelling out ten bucks to see. <br/><br/>Also, I would like to mention that people who whine about how illogical Bruce Banner's pants are can be quiet now. It doesn't go unexplained in the movie. All is well in the world."
"Ziya90","1","4","9","27 July 2016"," A pathetic attempt
","I know that 2003 ""Hulk"" movie by great filmmaker Ang Lee didn't please the majority, some viewers even hated it. That movie was unusual, but in a good way! When I read that some changes were made to ""improve"" the previous movie, my reaction was totally negative, because I loved the first film, seeing it an artful masterwork, I love the way of Lee's storytelling and I didn't get bored even one minute! Therefore, I knew that the changes which were claimed by audience and seen as improvements would ruin the movie. It did actually for me. This Hulk movie is an entertainment popcorn flick which was made to please mass audience, especially incorrigible action fans and kids. <br/><br/>Eric Bana was a realistic portrayal of Bruce Banner. He doesn't do something breathtaking in the movie, but he was fine and flawless in the movie. They replaced him with Edward Norton. One of the greatest actors of all time, but as Bruce Banner? Are you kidding? It is like to cast Nicolas Cage for Superman or to cast Leonardo di Caprio as Bruce Wayne! I like Bruce Banner here because I love Edward Norton, but on the other hand, we don't watch a real Bruce Banner. It doesn't feel like he is actually Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Sam Elliott was great and perfect as General Ross. William Hurt is a master, but I didn't get used to him, I couldn't like him, I couldn't hate him, as a summary, I couldn't be impressed by this new character. Jennifer Connelly was fine and flawless like Eric Bana. She was realistic, but not boring. Beautiful and talented actress Liv Tyler's Betty is unbearably boring here. I just couldn't watch her honestly. This movie has a serious casting problem. Tim Roth as a special team leader with some abilities? This must be a joke! I hate that some really talented character study actors are involved in action movies as action stars or villains. Remember Adrian Brody? However, vice versa is fine. An action star in an art film sounds exciting!<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes of the film is like a Jason Bourne movie or a new Die Hard sequel! Entertaining to watch, but wait, this is a ""Hulk"" movie! This is a comic book movie! The first twenty minutes of the film is suitable for a spy action thriller rather than a super hero movie, but that's OK due to some nice action and chase. The first action scene of Hulk is interesting and it was acclaimed by even some critics, but since the director hides Hulk from us, I didn't like that scene either. Maybe, technically, it looks little stylish, but not a big deal. <br/><br/>The relationship between Bruce and Betty is pathetic. It is extremely boring, uninspiring, cliché and unrealistic. It feels like it was made for an episode of soap opera! Also, Hulk is like a manly, but naive boy here. He tries to protect the girl who he loves! the relationship between Betty and her father is almost ridiculous because of theatrical tone. Because, this movie is an ordinary, crowd-pleaser popcorn entertainment, but a really mediocre one! All the character motivations, damsel in distress situations, decision moments and actions are formulaic, so predictable. The action sequence in the park is the most entertaining one in the movie, I have seen it dozens of times, it is pure fun, but nothing special. If we think about Ang Lee's craftsmanship by combining art with entertainment together and stylish action scenes with the help of some brilliant editing work, ""The Incredible Hulk"" falls short. By the way, it is possible that people may like the new appearance of Hulk, a grayish green color, a wrinkled skin, a naive monster who shouts ""Hulk smash!"" almost with no intelligence etc. Hulk is not a little kid playing with toys. This is really an insult to this great character. <br/><br/>The climactic final showdown in the city is a shame for CGI. Such cheesy visual effects and very poor CGI in some moments make the movie look like a computer game! The first movie was not boring, but slowly moving. This movie, however, was very boring other than the action scenes with the pathetic love story and some terrible CGI. In the second half, this movie can be labeled as a monster movie also, but a boring one with poor effects and some poor writing. After Ang Lee's smart, deep and powerful transformation story including a father son clash, but this must be for kids! Hulk is like a monster with little brain here and this must be an insult for our brains. Betty is in every action scene and mostly she cries! What an annoying piece of idea! Because it kills the suspense. Some people claim that Hulk is the strongest here, but I felt just the opposite. It was the first time for me to worry about Hulk getting hurt. Overall, this is a slightly enjoyable action film, but a really terrible super hero film!"

"H_Spengler","2","3","6","19 September 2009"," Cliché ridden, coma inducing snooze fest.
","Let's review this checklist of actors: Edward Norton, Tim Roth, William Hurt, and awesome cameos by Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey Jr., not to mention Stan Lee's. So how is it when you have this sort of team you manage to make a movie that is boring, dull, and convoluted? And that's even during the action sequences.<br/><br/>I don't blame the actors, they've well proved their abilities in other movies. (With the exception of Tyler, who's crowning cinematic achievement was in the LOTR trilogy, she was right where she should be...a minor character.) The performances are phoned in, and as the movie progresses, you can almost see the realization cross faces, as they realize how ridiculous, bland and half assed the lines they're reciting actually are. The story is overcomplicated and ridiculous.<br/><br/>There's nothing intelligent about this movie, nothing suspenseful, or even remotely insightful. The CGI is terrible and overwhelming, and battles wage on way too long. Hulk vs. bad guys, Hulk vs. military, Hulk vs. Tank, Hulk vs. government created super creature. Of course Hulk wins...was there ever a doubt? Not when a sequel could yank in more cash. <br/><br/>Norton looked about as enthusiastic as going to the restroom after eating some bad seafood, Roth tried his best with his overused clichéd character - evil, psychopath war vet part of gov't experimentation turning him into super evil, psychopath war vet, unstoppable creature hell bent on destroying Hulk and anyone else in the way. Hurt is out of place as a hippie looking general who's appearance alone violates several conditions of military protocol. Tyler's standard performance as love interest has been reheated so many times it's unrecognizable. There's not a convincing performance in the bunch! <br/><br/>Thankfully Downey Jr. & Ferrino spare themselves as they're in the movie for about a minute each. It's the only thing that prevents me from giving this one star. The Hulk is without a doubt Marvel's most boring franchise. (Ghost Rider was a least amusing, and the CGI was appropriate.) Sorry guys, Ferrino's late 70's Hulk TV show is still boss in my book. 2/10"
"Dunharrow","3","3","6","27 May 2009"," Pathetic inane babble
","This film is the epitome of what's wrong today in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The movie starts out great. It's different, it's interesting, it's mysterious. <br/><br/>Then, it becomes an action film, where sensitive characterization and plot development is sacrificed for CGI action sequences. <br/><br/>After seeing Iron Man, I thought Marvel was finally ready to put together some films made for fans of comic books and the hero genre. <br/><br/>A tip: If you're making a movie on a hero, try to abide by the Monomyth structure. <br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is not a hero movie. The Femme Fatale is not a femme fatale. The road of trials is not a road of trials, it is a confused set of meaningless action scenes during which the main character undergoes zero change. The belly of the whale - normally, a part where the hero enters a strange, dark world, which represents the fact that he is lost and scared (ex: Tony Stark in the cave). He comes out reborn, and ready for his destiny. This whole thing, important in any hero myth (Batman has a bunch of them.... Achilles has one, when Priam comes to him in the night), is absent.<br/><br/>But the worst is the 'Atonement with the Father' - ""The hero reconciles the tyrant and merciful aspects of the father-like authority figure to understand himself as well as this figure"" - this is usually at the climax, when the hero wins/comes to terms with his past. This scene, in this film, was the stupidest thing I ever saw. You just want to regurgitate. It is senseless.<br/><br/>But that's the film. Bruce Banner's actions are inexplicable. Normally, a character changes over the course of a film. This character for no reason accepts his fate over 2 seconds as Bruce Banner suddenly realizes his role in the world. <br/><br/>For all my complaints... I realize the true problem. Bruce Banner is a horrible character. Like Peter Parker. However, Spider-man is a sentient being, and so the character develops through him. The Hulk is a wild animal, and cannot be developed. And since there is a complete disconnect between Banner and Hulk, there is no character growth."
"rparham","7","3","6","27 November 2008"," This Hulk not exactly Incredible, but decent
","Marvel isn't one to let lackluster box-office and mixed reviews keep a good superhero franchise down. In the case of the the Hulk, one of their flagship characters, Ang Lee's 2003 film proved to not be the potent blockbuster they were after, so, five years later, Marvel has rebooted the character with The Incredible Hulk, featuring none of the cast or creative principals of the previous entry. So, what is the verdict of this do-over: a decent entry, featuring more action than the previous film, but not quite as deep in regards to character development.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk opens with a title sequence that wipes the memories of the first film completely away, re-establishing the origin story, albeit in a more compressed form. The film proper then opens in Brazil, where Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding from the government agents that are attempting to locate him. Bruce, it seems, has used himself as a guinea pig for a super-soldier serum, which, when his heart rate goes too high, leads to him transforming into a not-so-jolly green giant. While dodging the head of the super solider project, General Ross (William Hurt), Bruce is attempting to cure himself, with help from an unseen ally he communicates with over computer named Mr. Blue.<br/><br/>After an accident at a soda bottling factory leads Ross to him, Bruce goes on the run, returning to the US and seeking out his lost love Betty (Liv Tyler), while being tracked by Ross's chief lieutenant, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), who has volunteered to also take some of the super soldier serum to attempt to beat the Hulk at his own game, but quickly becomes addicted to the serum, and leads to him seeking more and more, with possibly disastrous results.<br/><br/>One thing was certain with this version of the Hulk, and that was that action, lacking in the first film, was to be more of a priority, and, for the most part, The Incredible Hulk delivers. There are no less than three major action sequences in the film, and each is reasonably well done, delivering decent thrills and energy. The Hulk, once again computer generated, is sufficiently convincing, a bit beefier and more muscular than the 2003 version.<br/><br/>While the action has been ratcheted up, the attention to character detail has been scaled back a degree or so. The romance is there between Bruce and Betty in the script, but their chemistry is mostly dead. The friction between her and her father also rings a bit hollow, and the face off between Bruce and Blonsky is almost exclusively physical, with no deeper level to it. While those searching for more fisticuffs will be pleased, anyone interested in greater depth to the proceedings will find The Incredible Hulk a bit lacking.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk boasts a strong cast, but they are used with mixed results. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana, but there is no real shift in quality. Norton delivers a good performance, but nothing exceptional. Liv Tyler is a step down from Jennifer Connolly's turn in the first film, not tremendously convincing as Betty. William Hurt doesn't give the best of performances as General Ross either, over the top in the wrong kind of way. Tim Roth gives another effective villainous turn as Emil Blonsky.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk proves to be a good comic book film, but not pushing the envelope at all. Marvel has proved that they can turn a lackluster showing of a character around by starting over, but it remains to be seen if this incarnation of the Hulk will be back for a second round. If you are looking for some well-done comic book action and decent special effects, then The Incredible Hulk will deliver the goods. If you want a film that stretches the boundaries of the the comic book film, then look to Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2."
"djean","9","3","6","14 August 2008"," Finally! The Hulk Is Given Justice
","Ah! June 21, 2003 a day that will live in infamy in my movie going experiences. Why will this day live in infamy for me? Well, it was the day i experienced Ang Lee's The Hulk on the big screen. The day provided me with one of the most crushing disappointments i've experienced in my life. I remember leaving the theater after the film was over confused by what i saw and angry that the hulk was completely distorted taking away his Hulk Smash and turning his story into a psychological drama dealing with his crazy scientist father and lame romance with Betty Ross. Topping it all off with killer mutant poodles and Nick Nolte turning into a lightning god, a rock, and a giant green nuclear cloud that fights the hulk before being blow up by a jet. Then the movie didn't show Hulk for 42 minutes and didn't end with him in a final shot. Talk about lame.<br/><br/>So now we flash forward 5 years later and everything has changed for the sequel. New cast, director, and tone than the original with this one putting more emphasis on action. I can pretty much tell you they hit a home run. Not only do they get it right this time they even change the backstory to what it was in the comics and completely ignore Lee's film even exists.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie lies with having things the original movie lacked like strong performances and a great villain. Ed Norton beats the crap out of Eric Bana's version of Bruce Banner. Norton's Banner is a man in control of his own world and has the ability to control his inner demon without sacrificing his inner human ability to care for others. Li Tyler is a much better Betty Ross simply because there's a warmth to her that was sorely missing from Jennifer Connely's take on he character. You actually feel she loves Bruce and would be devastated if something was to happen to him, where as Connely just stood on the side lines and let things happen to her hubby, just so she could yell at her general father. William Hurt does an admirable job replacing Sam Elliot as the general who wants Banner dead but i felt Eliot was far more menacing in the original (The only thing the original did better than this film. Finally, we get this film's biggest strength the villain. Tim Roth does a sensational job as Emil Blonsky aka Abomination a man fed up that he wasn't promoted higher up in military rankings, so he takes his anger out on Hulk and forces Hurt's character to steal a mutated Hulk serum that gives him super human strength thus turning him into the monster Abomination. Overall this film was action packed with wall to wall action that stayed true to the comic books. Plus Hulk even says his catch phrase Hulk Smask! Thank you to all involved with this for getting the Hulk right. This fan appreciates it."
"LinksPopcornPicks","8","3","6","8 August 2008"," Hulk Smash!
","-Let me just begin this review by saying ""I enjoyed it"". Its definitely no ""Iron Man"", but its fun. The movie stars Edward Norton as ""Bruce Banner"", Liv Tyler as ""Betty Ross"", Tim Roth as ""Emil Blonsky"" aka ""The Abomination"", William Hurt as ""General Thunderbolt"", and of course Lou Ferrigno providing the voice of The Incredible Hulk. -We all know that Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and so as a product of that became The Hulk. Instead of going through the origin again the film just dives into Bruce Banner hiding from the military since his body is technically ""military property"". The movie is kinda like a long chase sequence with a big fight at the end. That pretty much sums it up, but its better than it sounds. As the military searches for Banner, they decide to create another ""super soldier"" to combat The Hulk. This ""super soldier"" later becomes ""The Abomination"", which isn't good. -While the script is very action packed, the acting is what I really like. Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner as a mopey, regretful, scientist. I also forgot to mention Liv Tyler's and Norton's relationship is rather well done, its feels very heartfelt. Tim Roth is a pretty good villain too, as he gets creepier as the film progresses and its always fun to hear Lou Ferrigno belt out ""Hulk Smash!"". -One of the main problems that I have with the movie is they way the CGI was handled. While the first couple of scenes that featured The Hulk were dark and mysterious(well handled btw)the scenes that have him in open daylight are not particularly impressive, you can see all the contrasts of the CGI Hulk compared to the live-action sequences which clash a little bit. The CGI is fun to look at, but it can take you out of the film some when you see all this ridiculous stuff going down. -If you are a fan of the old TV series you will see many little shout outs to the fans, I won't spoil them for you, but there are a lot of them in there. Overall ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a fun popcorn summer movie with some pretty good action and great acting. Recommended for sure. I'll give it a...B"

","Going in thinking that this film would be a sequel to the first one, I was happy to say I was mistaken. What the first one lacked, this one surely fulfilled. Most of the reason that I believe that this did better was not adding characters that would only be fillers to the film. In this film everyone had a purpose and they did not over step that by adding twists and turns leading you to the wrong direction. Edward Norton is not too bad as the Hulk and plays a troubled hero quite well. Liv Tyler is a great actress that did provide a few comic moments for this film. While I did believe that this film lagged in some areas, it did have a plot and purpose. The CGI was awesome and the Hulk probably looked more as a hero every time he appeared. Though he was feared at first, society finally looked past the green exterior and saw compassion. By that, we see a different side of Hulk and welcome him as a truly incredible being. If you really want to see why the Hulk stands out as a superhero, than I would highly recommend this film."
"3xHCCH","5","3","6","8 July 2008"," Good but I Think It Was Just a Stepping Stone
","I think I am one of the minority who did like the first major Hulk movie by director Ang Lee, starring Eric Bana and Jennifer Connely. Maybe that is why, I did not really think this movie was actually necessary to begin with. I thought Ed Norton did not fit the Bruce Banner role very much. When I watched this, I did not really snap out of my preconceived opinion of the movie. It is not a bad movie, but I still think that this new Hulk movie was not a necessary movie since there was already another good one before.<br/><br/>The start is very unusual. The whole origins story is compressed into the opening credits, as if this was already the sequel. If you enter the movie house five minutes after the movie began, you would feel disoriented. What was Bruce Banner doing in the slums of Brazil (man, those are really squalid living conditions there!) and working in a soft drink factory? The actors I felt did not fit their roles. Not only Ed Norton, but also and especially Liv Tyler . She looked awkward in her role as a cell biologist Betty Ross. I also thought they did not have chemistry together. I am biased with the Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly team-up in the first ""Hulk"".<br/><br/>Of course, the CG effects of this new movie was much better than the first. Including the overall scarier and rougher look of the Hulk himself (compared to the smooth green creature in the Ang Lee version). That outdoor scene on the university grounds in broad daylight was very well executed in terms of the details! Congratulations to my cousin Marc, whose name I saw in the final credits as systems coordinator of the Rhythm and Hues crew that created the special effects of this film.<br/><br/>There were surprises in the way of cameo appearances. Stan Lee again, this time as the old guy who drinks the gamma contaminated drink. Bill Bixby (TV's Bruce Banner) on an old TV show. And TV Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno as a security guard.<br/><br/>Now the very end was another pleasant surprise indeed. However, it also made me feel that this movie was just a stepping stone to the next bigger Marvel project in line. I think that is why this version was done in the first place, so that the Hulk gets a new look and treatment in preparation for the bigger things to come."
"commandercool88","5","3","6","7 July 2008"," Uninteresting and without flavor.
","If I were Ed Norton, I wouldn't be too pleased either. Because when all is said and done, 'The Incredible Hulk' doesn't feel like anything much more than a second-rate superhero flick set on auto-pilot. It's never unwatchable, though the deafening noise doesn't help, but I felt resoundingly uninterested throughout the whole experience. 'The Incredible Hulk' hits many of the right notes, but without any gusto or flavor.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier's unsure direction seems evident around every corner, as if he's afraid to take any real chances to avoid another failure like the original 'Hulk' saw back in 2003. The result is a film that replaces any hint of developing plot and character with mindless action that pushes the decibel limit. It's entertaining in a forgettable kind of way, but it simply lacks the spark to make this stand out from the rest of the comic book crowd. 'The Incredible Hulk' plays a predictable hand and never branches out. And that's a disappointing shame.<br/><br/>A month after 'Iron Man' set the bar for the summer blockbuster season (and it's yet to be surpassed), 'Incredible Hulk' doesn't do much to follow in its footsteps. Edward Norton does fine in his turn as the green monster, though admittedly he doesn't have a great deal to work with. But after Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance practically made 'Iron Man', 'Hulk' lacks the substance and character to make a particularly memorable action flick. Do keep an eye out for a Tony Stark appearance though, continuing Marvel's clever ploy to market its upcoming 'Avengers' movie.<br/><br/>By the time we see Bruce Banner in all his green glory, we're reminded that while special effects have come a long way, they've still got a ways to go. The film looks good enough, but at times it feels as though we've watching a giant video game. The film culminates with an adequately exciting climax, but it doesn't do much to leave a lasting impression. 'The Incredible Hulk' is seeking to reinvent itself after an unsuccessful debut, but this second attempt seems to lack the confidence to really make us care.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","This was a great movie! Edward Norton IS Bruce Banner. The story, FX, acting, music (loved hearing the old tune from the series!) and scenes were great. This is what I expected five years ago when that other monstrosity ""The Hulk"" came out. Thankfully I didn't see that flop in the theater and watched it on home video. I remember being so disappointed with the whole movie. Nick Nolte as a drunk wife beating low life and the weird scenes along with the freaked up animals and...well not worth it because it doesn't deserve any space here. This movie is what I expected and more. Doing homage to the old show, i.e. Bill Bixby, Lou Ferigno and the old music was first class. Robert Downey Jr.'s cameo was first rate. Connecting two great films, Iron Man and this was perfect. The humor was done very well along with the drama of the story. Neither was over done and as a result gave just the right balance to make this a very enjoyable film. Spoiler ahead! I'm only removing one star because even though I'm a meat eater I didn't think that killing those two dogs was necessary and will gladly fast forward through those scenes when it comes out on DVD. Otherwise a great film and money well spent!"

","After testing an upcoming project on himself, Dr. Bruce Banner becomes a giant green monster, known as The Hulk. The father of his girlfriend is a general who wants to capture the creature and create an army of these monsters.<br/><br/>After The Hulk disappointed fans in 2003 because there wasn't even 'Hulk Smash', the people in suits decided to give it another go, this time less talk and more walk. This time there were changes all around. New director, new leads and a new HULK all together. This time we have a more gritty and mean hulk, yet at the same time it has that campy feel that throws back to the old TV show. While the new version is better then what Lee gave us a few years back, it still isn't an eye popper.<br/><br/>Out is Bana and in is Norton. A stronger actor, yet he is in unfamiliar territory. Norton is not really a blockbuster star, which begged the question ""Are they really going to make a blockbuster Hulk, or another artistic piece"". Norton brings more depth to the character, yet with the ongoing drama that plagued the film it is hard to tell what more he wanted to do with the character. William Hurt replaces Sam Elliott as the General, he chews the scenery he's in and plays up the comic book bad guy role very well. Finally Liv Tyler steps in for Jennifer Connelly, much like the last film that character isn't given too much to do except cry for Banner. Tim Roth makes his way into this film playing a bad guy yet again. He isn't given much to do here either and the reason behind him becoming what he becomes is a bit eye rolling.<br/><br/>Another problem the first film had was that the Hulk itself was too fake looking. This time they tried to ground this beast in reality a bit more, yet it still feels out of place. He is less green and a tad bigger I believe. While I still am not a big fan of this character he works better here. The Hulk finally sees his match here with the villain and no he does not battle with rabid overgrown dogs. The fight between these two beasts is action packed as they tear up the city (half of which was filmed in my hometown).<br/><br/>As decent as this film is it doesn't leave a lasting memory. It's a loud and fast paced action film, which is exactly what it should be. It will please those who might have wanted more from the first one, which took itself way too seriously. There's fun to be had here, watching a giant Hulk destroy army vehicles will please action junkies. But we are now on a high lever for comic book films. No longer can you just make a decent comic book film, you need to wow the audience and leave a lasting impression. The Incredible Hulk doesn't do this. You walk in, enjoy the two hours and then leave and don't really talk about it anymore."

Most of the action in the city streets looked very similar to Transformers or Spiderman or King Kong; looks like all these people are using the same template of movie making and just putting in their characters. So it does lack originality. When are we going to see real good original action movie which genuinely surprise on and all???

","In 2003 Marvel teamed up with Universal pictures, to make what was supposed to be their third blockbuster franchise film, simply titled Hulk (X-Men and Spider-Man were the other two). They assigned Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) to direct and casted Eric Banna (Black Hawk Down), Jennifer Connoley (Blood Diamond), and Nick Nolte (48 Hours) to star in the film, as well as having ""state of the art CGI"". Needless to say everything on the surface looked great. Then the film was released, and instead of a monster hit, Universal and Marvel had a monster bomb. The franchise was considered dead, and all plans for a sequel were scrapped.<br/><br/>Five years later Hulk fan Edward Norton goes to Marvel studios with a script he wrote along with Zak Penn. Marvel loved the script and gave it to universal and bam (or is that smash?) a new movie titled The Incredible Hulk gets the green light (no pun intended). Lee is replaced with Louis Letteier (Transporter) someone who knows about making action films), Banna is replaced with Norton, and Connoley is replaced with Liv Tyler (Lord Of The Rings, The Strangers).<br/><br/>Needless to say The Incredible Hulk is awesome and is so much better than the very slow, artsy version that Ang Lee gave us. As a matter of fact my exact words to my wife as the credits started to roll was ""The 2003 version no longer exists in my eyes"".<br/><br/>From the opening sequence, which reenacts the opening scene from the old television series, to the final scene The Incredible Hulk left me smiling. As a big fan of the old series and the comic book (which I still read to this day) I can honestly say this was done well and would entertain anybody that went to see it. There is so much action it's hard to pick a favorite scene, there's humor where there needs to be, and even a hint of romance in the air.<br/><br/>The best thing that works in the film is the final fight scene between The Hulk and The Abomination (played by Tim Roth) which is everything a movie about two monsters fighting should be, unlike the lame, short, and very dark fight scene in the original.<br/><br/>I know people that had suffered through the 2003 version were tempted to stay away for this film, but trust me the whole Batman Begins type recipe has wiped the slate clean and started fresh, and that is what makes this film a blast.<br/><br/>As I have mentioned in many reviews for these type of movies, I am a comic book geek that loves his superhero movies. It took Hollywood four films to get batman (my favorite) right. Now It's The Hulk's turn. Looks like Batman is holding the door open to Hollywood for him.<br/><br/>On a scale of 10 I give The Incredible Hulk a 10. Marvel is doing a great job making their own movies. First Iron Man, now this. It makes me very excited to see Thor and Captain America."

","Grade: B- ""The Incredible Hulk"" is technically the second theatrical release based on the Marvel Comics super-hero. However, this film, directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 2, Unleashed) apparently ignores the events of 2003's adjective-free Hulk which was directed by Ang Lee. Lead actor Edward Norton plays haunted scientist Bruce Banner in addition to contributing a script draft which was conditional upon his hiring as an actor (the WGA gives Zak Penn final official credit for the screenplay).<br/><br/>The story continuesor begins againthe saga of former research scientist Dr. Banner, whose body was drastically mutated in the aftermath of a botched experiment involving improving human resistance to radiation. Now, in times of extreme anger or stress, Banner's gamma-irradiated cells expand exponentially, turning him into the outsized, super-muscled Hulkdriven by rage and prone to lash out at his tormentors with little restraint.<br/><br/>General Thaddeus Ross (played by William Hurt) was present at the experiment that birthed the Hulk, as was his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Obsessed with bringing the fugitive Banner into custody, the general recruits a special commando unit, including one Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), on loan from the British military. When the general's team finally tracks down Banner to a Brazilian shantytown, things begin to go downhill for both Banner and the generalthe Hulk is unleashed and makes short work of everyone involved. But while most of the team is at least humbled by this turn of events, it only intrigues Blonsky, who then volunteers to be injected with a top-secret performance-enhancement cocktail.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the grim Blonsky doesn't remotely have the conscience of Banner, and he becomes increasingly aggressive in his attempts to bring down his quarry. Meanwhile, the trouble-prone scientist hitchhikes from Latin America all the way to the Virginia college where he and Betty worked. Stumbling into an awkward reunion with his former love, a second Hulk flare-up prompts the two to head to New York City, where a heretofore mysterious colleague of Banner has the equipment necessary to attempt a curebut the dogged Blonsky's lust for combat derails everything; his own mutation spins out of control, turning him into the monster Abomination. With military personnel literally being crushed by this new creature, a reluctant Banner realizes that the only thing that can stop the rampaging Blonsky may be the Hulk.<br/><br/>If one is apt to believe circulating entertainment reports, Norton was allegedly miffed with Marvel studio executives who wanted a leaner, more action-driven final cut of the film compared to Ang Lee's slower, ponderous interpretation. As viewed, the film is a taut action vehicle, essentially becoming a chase thriller after the first Hulk-eruption. Quieter moments such as when Bruce and Betty first reunite or trailer-glimpsed scenes of an Arctic sojourn and Bruce's chat with a psychologist (Ty Burrell) are either truncated or not seen at all. Marvel Studios is self-financing their comic-strip based features now, so there is legitimate commercial concern here.<br/><br/>Still, accommodating viewers who don't have stunted attention spans isn't really that bad. The Lord of the Rings movies found a way to keep the story literate and the action exciting. While prose-fiction hardliners may blanch at comparing Stan Lee's comic-book series to Tolkien, it helps to bear in mind that cool art-visuals alone aren't enough to keep a comic-book going for 45 years like the Hulk. The story, whether simple or complex, still needs to be in place. Hopefully it won't be another five years (or longer) before the Hulk shows up at cinema again, and maybe his handlers will believe in him enough to make the narrative as strong as the spectacle."
"jaredmobarak","6","3","6","15 June 2008"," Days since last incidentThe Incredible Hulk
","Leave it to this drama lover to think that the new film The Incredible Hulk is more boring than Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003, despite the fact that the entire world hated that version because they said it was too slow. Maybe it was the departure in genre tone that Lee brought to the movie, making it a psychological tale of humanity rather than an action, comic-book romp, but I was pleasantly surprised after thinking it would just be Hulk-Smash over and over again. The funny thing is that knowing this new variation, from Transporter director Louis Leterrier, would be action packed, destruction heavy chaos, I was all for it. I liked the original film and wasn't quite sure this reboot was totally necessary, but I have to admit I was excited to see some fights, especially after hearing the end battle lives up to the hype, something that lacked in Iron Man and Batman Begins. Unfortunately, while the scuffles were pretty hectic and a lot of fun, everything else, most noticeably the middle third, dragged. It could be that the extremes were too far apart, leaving the testosterone-laden mini-warzones to go to scientific computer speak or blatant sexual tension between the past loves of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, but I think it was just that those slow moments were too long and not the forte of the filmmakers. Leterrier handled the mix of drama and action much better in Danny the Dog, possibly due to the writing from auteur Luc Besson. Maybe it was Zak Penn's script, possibly it was the extreme highs of the fights creating even more extreme lows, either way, to me, Hulk was more consistent and a better film. That's not saying this new installment is bad; it has a lot going for it and if nothing else shows that the subject mater is still viable for a third film featuring The Leader as a villain.<br/><br/>The credit sequence shows how Banner infects himself with gamma radiation and what happens to make him leave the country as Betty and her General father recover from the aftereffects. Nothing about the past army base history of Banner's parents or Nick Nolte's electricity love is alluded to or acknowledged from Hulk. This film is a reboot through and through, just pretend the first never existed, it's what the filmmakers do. Basically, the exposition is glossed overhis experiment causing the infection, his inability to survive with it while amongst the ones he loves, and his self-imposed exile to Brazil in order to look for a cureall relayed in the first twenty or so minutes. The action really starts once General Ross catches up with his former employee and love of his daughter as he attempts to extract him back to the US. This mission expedites Banner's return for a cure and his crossing paths with Betty once again, as well as an encounter with the Russian-born Brit military man Emil Blonsky, whose craving for a fight and infatuation with the power he sees coming from the Hulk makes him decide to do whatever it takes to acquire that strength for himself. So, this film is really just an extended attempt to capture Banner as he tries to cure himself, (oh and the fact that we believe he might be cured for only ten seconds before they completely disregard that whole plot line in order for a war to break out is just one of the many failures of plot lines that could have been very interesting). At the end, we really find that we are in the exact same situation we were in at the startexcept now Betty knows her Bruce is alive.<br/><br/>While the story may be lacking, the action is not. Tim Roth, as Blonsky, has a wild fire raging behind his eyes. The guy will not give up, despite any odds piled against him. When he takes a taste of the gamma poisoning in order to even the playing field versus the Hulk, you just know that small sample will never satiate his lust for blood. Super-Roth goes against the green giant and it is pretty exciting, even the sonar cannon effects are cool to watch as they attempt to stop the monster. The final battle is a lot of fun with destruction, but it is the chase scene in Brazil that sticks to mind after leaving the theatre. Brazil's cityscape is ripe for an extended sequence with its housing and factories all jammed packed together on a hillside with barely room for a street between them. Banner and Blonsky run after each other while extras from Bruce's job crop up with a bad attitude. The first transformation finally occurs, yet most of it is seen from the shadows. A brilliant use of deflection helps make the chase more exhilarating than the computer generated fight at the finaleno matter how much fun that still ends up being.<br/><br/>The boring, drawn out exchanges between action set pieces may ruin the pacing and enjoyment, but to me it is really the new cast at fault. Whether you liked Lee's version or not, you shouldn't be able to question the actors involved. All those on screen here pale in comparison and probably cause the mediocrity of those scenes. Liv Tyler's whisper doesn't have the same panache as the strong-willed Jennifer Connolly, William Hurt's overacting to be the hardass can't touch Sam Elliot's natural born proclivity to that demeanor, and, no matter how much I like Ed Norton, Eric Bana hit the conflicted internal struggle emotive quality out of the park in Hulk. Maybe if the old cast was brought into this film, the parts that fail could have worked and rather then bring down the smash and grab moments, could have enhanced their success, making the enjoyment level higher and the film better as a result."
"bakes5981","7","3","6","14 June 2008"," Just came from the cinema
","The film begins with a quick, comprehensive look on the events leading up to the current situation of Dr. Bruce Banner. For someone like myself who opt skipping the previous Hulk installment, it's quite a helpful touch to help keep us up to speed.<br/><br/>The movie has an interesting plot (quite possibly more interesting than Marvel's other film, Iron Man). The human side of Dr. Bruce Banner is brought about by the superb acting of Edward Norton. The struggle to have control over the big green monster is felt. Dr. Banner goes into hiding and aims to control his emotions, his ""excitability"", which is at best as controllable at a Geiger counter near a construction site.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the fight scenes. There's enough fight scenes and explosives in the film to satisfy action fans (again, unlike Iron Man). The beast comes to life with the bangs, the screams, the thuds and the booms! (The CGI rendering of both Hulk and Abomination are convincingly real as there were children who began crying when the two beasts did battle - to the disappointment of their fan-fathers. Hehe!).<br/><br/>As previously stated, Hulk's humanity also is put to the fore especially during the times he struggles to push on for the protection of his love interest, Dr. Betty Ross, portrayed well by Liv Tyler. Convincingly, the viewers are led to feel that the Incredible Hulk has a heart.<br/><br/>But it's not all ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" with the fight sequences. There were only 2 civilian eyewitnesses to the encounter in Culver University - AT BROAD DAYLIGHT! Meanwhile, there were people allover the place - even staying to witness the fight despite the danger - during the brute strength versus brute strength, climactic battle between Abomination and The Incredible Hulk in New York City. Point is, I would have expected the people already to have run away to safety during Abomination's initial onslaught. But, there was a mother and son around after Abomination fell under the hands of the Incredible Hulk. Also, if it happened in New York, why was Spider Man nowhere to be found? Which brings me to my final point. Marvel has found an incredible way to tease their fans. Tony Stark (um, Iron Man) makes an appearance and talks to Gen. Ross about ""super soldier projects"". Do we smell an Incredible Hulk-Iron Man tandem in the making soon? Overall, there's enough reason for even the most casual of fans of comic book adaptation fans to watch the film. Norton is brilliant and so as the rest of the cast, like Roth who is brash, proud, and greedy in his portrayal of the ""god-like"" Abomination. All the ""negative"" points I have noted can easily be forgivable if you're not too meticulous. A must-see movie."
"diac228","5","17","64","14 June 2008"," He traveled from where to where in just over two weeks!?!?!!?!?
","It is never a good sign for a franchise to receive a reboot after just one installment. However, Hulk gets a second chance with the latest film from the Marvel team that has brought us this summer's biggest hit and best film thus farand that's an answer that shall not change by the end of this review. The Incredible Hulk handles just like a comic book: bad dialogue, plenty of action, massive-sized plot holes, plenty of cameos, and ends with us asking for more. The movie fails to really lift the franchise from the ashes of mediocrity as yet again we receive a sub par Hulk movie that fails to bring out the best in our green hero. Good acting and decent CGI is hampered by too many other errors, setbacks, and disappointments that turn Hulk into nothing more than an American version of Godzilla. Yes, there's more to Hulk than meets the eye, but Louis Leterrier and company fail to deliver this to us.<br/><br/>In a well-scripted prologue, we see Bruce Banner accidentally kill people and injure others after an experiment gone wrong; which we all know turns him into the Hulk. He hides in Brazil (Not the best place to hide if you are light-skinned, I know) as he tries to find a cure for his rage. While he hides and runs (In this movie, traveling from country to country and state to state on no money is no problem), the United States army is after him to use his accident and turn it into a successful innovation in warfare.<br/><br/>This isn't a continuation of the original Hulk, it's rather a refresher, or a reboot; in the sense of Batman Begins and Casino Royale. After the prologue, the dialogue goes downhill in a most awful way. Whether its lines that aren't supposed to deliver a laugh, to lines that should not have been said at all, there are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in Hulk just listening to people talk. The acting doesn't exactly help either, as only Tim Roth and Edward Norton pulling off respectable performances. The two actors are well-known for their versatility and breathing life into any role, and they are no exception here until the CGI gets mixed in.<br/><br/>While the trailers do promise action and more action, The Incredible Hulk is mostly running, hiding, talking, and preparation for the final act in the movie. The opening chase sequence is good; the rest of the action doesn't quite live up to it. When Banner becomes Hulk, it's like watching a very angry toddler wreck havoc on a town of Legos. Banner/Hulk just fails to have the charisma of Stark, the coolness of Batman, and the emotional depth of Peter Parker. Things get destroyed, and then Banner's love interest (pretty but meh Liv Tyler as Betty) stops the carnage; the formula doesn't quite change. Even the carnage itself becomes repetitive.<br/><br/>Hulk does lack the dimensions of a deep character, but it's hard to like the main character when he becomes the vicious being. Being able to calm down for only the love interest in the entire movie doesn't exactly garnish brownie points from the audience; luckily the audience wants to see epic fights and destruction to the nth degree (These people should not question the appeal of Godzilla).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The Incredible Hulk is nothing like the Ang Lee version, but it still fails to live up to most Marvel comic book movies. There's so much that went wrong here, its hard to praise anything going on. Most of the acting is bland, the final fight isn't as epic as one would hope, and it lacks the fun of Iron Man. Perhaps this character was never meant to be in a movie; that or needs a strong supporting role to help him entertain the audience. Another major drawback is the amount of wicked cop-outs and sudden disappearances of supporting roles. Luckily the final scene gives us all hope, as we are seeing the beginning of something potentially awesome. In the meantime, we have to suck up another second-rate Hulk movie.<br/><br/>At least its no Batman and Robin."
"dead47548","9","4","10","13 June 2008"," One of the very best of it's kind.
","The Incredible Hulk takes a slightly different approach to the normal routine of a superhero picture. Instead of focusing all the energy and screen time on trying to one-up the competition with the next best CGI sequence and the most explosive, ridiculous fight scenes, it takes a smaller approach and focuses on the characters. And it really works.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance is easily one of the best in a film of it's nature, as he perfectly displays the internal anguish of a man who can't lose control of his emotions. Early on he encounters a female co-worker (he's living in Brazil at the time, working at a soda-producing factory) being harassed by some other men and you can see in his eyes the heartache that comes with knowing that by getting involved in the situation he'll only make things much worse. His performance goes far beyond what the role calls for and adds another impressive entry to his phenomenal resume. On the other side of the battle is an equally impressive from the always incredible Tim Roth. His Emil Blonsky is a soldier who believes his only reason for living is to fight. He's hitting middle age and realizing that his body is not at all what it used to be, so when he sees this massive green symbol of pure power he sees a new hope. Blonsky wants to the power of the Hulk, and he wants more of it. Roth perfectly captures the greed, obsession and slight desperation of Blonsky and seeing the two of them on opposite sides of a battle is absolutely stunning. William Hurt provides excellent support as the explosive Thunderbolt Ross, a General leading the hunt for Hulk and also father to Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), the love of Banner's life. In fact the only major flaw in the film is Tyler's atrocious performance. She is unconvincing, bland and sticks out like a sore thumb in this epic ensemble.<br/><br/>On the surface, it's a chase film. Banner is in Brazil trying to find a cure for his gamma radiation poisoning, when General Ross finds him and the chase begins, ultimately resulting in one of the most adrenaline-fueled scenes in history when the army tries to bring Hulk down outside of the college where Betty works. So the chase aspect provides for absolutely incredible action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. But deep down, at the film's core is both a story of two lovers trying to be together and, more importantly, a story of a desperate man gaining control of his emotions and the explosive anger radiating inside of him. It makes for something very compelling, well-acted, explosive and well...incredible."
"etlatjcje","7","4","10","13 June 2008"," Possibly the best Superhero movie yet...
","The Incredible Hulk is definitely the movie that stays truest to the comic book, while still paying homage to the television series. Edward Norton does well as always as Bruce Banner and Tim Roth does especially well as the overly-masculine, power-hungry mercenary that becomes The Abomination. The movie does not make the mistake of trying to tackle too much, keeps the love interest (in my thoughts the weakest point) in the background, and boasts the best action scenes in any superhero movie, ending with the spectacular brawl between The Hulk and The Abomination. This movie has everything, and it mixes it together well for the most polished superhero movie ever."
"jian-shanshan","9","4","10","13 June 2008"," One of the best super hero movies, as good as 'iron man'
","After watching the iron man, I was pretty motivated for the summer superhero season. The total experience of watching incredible Hulk is sweet and satisfaction. I was stunned by the beauty of Liv, and actually felt that the Hulk was kinda good looking in the film. I'm not a big fan of the fist movie, though I don't think it is bad either. I've kept a high expectation of the second one ever since the trailer was out, but I never expect this to be such a fantastic and sexy movie. Nice little surprise at the end just round the story up perfectly, and (although don't want to say) I really look forward to the next Hulk movie."
"moldo_bmf","8","4","10","13 June 2008"," You wouldn't like him when he's angry....
","FIrst off I would like to state that I do not wish for Ang Lee to be cursed for a thousand years, and the last thing I'd want would be for his soul and the souls of his next of kin to burn in hell for millennia to come. I honestly didn't think that his vision of ""The Hulk"" was THAT bad. Of course, I expected more, but that doesn't mean that his movie was horrific. However, without a shadow of a doubt, Louis Leterrier's version of it was better. In many ways. First of all it picked up the action a little bit farther off than the previous movie, leaving us only with fragments of Banner's memories from when he first turned into the green beast. Instead of going into his past, Leterrier explores the present, and Banner's spiraling descent into madness, while he desperately tries to seize control and keep it. <br/><br/>In his search for a cure he ultimately delivers an even greater danger to the world. <br/><br/>In his search for control, he loses it hopelessly. <br/><br/>In his search for love, he finds greater obstacles than before. <br/><br/>But enough about that... let's move on to how the movie actually works for itself. The cast is very good, each one of the actors delivering believable roles, albeit the comic-book nature of the whole plot. Edward Norton is genuinely torn between his search for a cure and trying to save those close to him. Liv Tyler plays a good kind of damsel in distress while still maintaining a kick-ass sort of attitude at times (if you've seen the taxi scene you'll know what I mean), while William Hurt and Tim Roth provide the general antagonistic performance that one would expect. <br/><br/>The action is well dosed, and paused only by the dramatic or psychological moments that actually give the movie some kind of depth behind the whole ""HULK SMASH!!!"" routine. The special effects are top notch and a joy to watch, accompanied by a brilliant score by the brilliant Craig Armstrong, giving the film an epic feel. The sound effects are ear-blowing (literally) and only serve to emphasize the general ""Ouch!!!"" factor present in the action scenes. <br/><br/>The plot may not be so elaborate, the dialog not so engaging, but the general feel of the movie is a very good one and remains true to the iconic image of ""The Hulk"". The standard Stan Lee cameo is present in the form of a guy who dies after being poisoned by gamma radiation, while Robert Downey Jr. (as Tony Stark) makes a very surprising appearance towards the end of the movie, paving the way for ""The Avengers"" movie. If you enjoyed ""The Hulk"" as directed by Ang Lee, you'll love this movie. If you didn't... then chances are, if you're a Marvel fan, you'll still love this movie. I know I enjoyed it a lot, and I hope others will as well.<br/><br/>I sign off this review by saying.... HULK SMASH!!! :)"
"clifford-19","9","4","10","13 June 2008"," Finally, a Hulk film that hits (smashes) the right note
","I try to see most comic book films as I thoroughly enjoy this genre, some films don't quite make the grade but this is an excellent new interpretation of the most iconic 'Hulk' franchise. Certainly commendable for the slick mix of comic book lore and fond homage to the original TV series. An excellent cast pulled off playing great characters and (as with Iron Man) you can tell they really enjoy the roles and what they mean. Once the action starts it keeps you glued to the screen and is well paced. Special effects are cutting edge and, in general, the photography is superb and they blend very well. The story is not overly complicated however adequate for what is expected. If you love comic book films and love the big green guy, go see this film! :)"

","Erin Bana and Jennifer Connelly were not the reason why the 1st Hulk film bombed. That was Ang Lee's fault; he should stick to other things. Although, I must admit Edward Norton and Liv Tyler are much better actors and a refreshing change for ""The Incredible Hulk"". Louis Leterrier is a relatively unknown director with very few films, but he knows a little something about action. Leterrier also director ""The Transporter"" and ""The Transporter II."" Marvel comic films thrive from great action.<br/><br/>Doc Sampson (Ty Burrell) Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) were all great cameos for Hulk Comic Fans. Also the appearance of Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) indicates Hulk villain ""The Leader"" might be a future Hulk sequel. Tony Stark's comments open the gateway for an Avengers Film.<br/><br/>The film itself is filled with great action sequences. The computer created battle between Tim Roth's Abomination and Edward Norton's Hulk, was in my opinion, one of the greatest fight sequences ever filmed. High marks for helping regain hope for future Hulk films."

Hope it helps. Cheers!<br/><br/>This was far better than 2003's ""Hulk"", Ang Lee's previous attempt at the Marvel character. But then again, it would be hard to be worse. Nonetheless, this go round you get a straight forward shot at the makings of the Hulk, followed by scientist Bruce Banner trying to rid himself of his greener alter ego. This movie has action, action, and well, some more action.<br/><br/>Betty Ross is more memorably played by Jennifer Connelly, as is ""Thunderbolt"" Ross's performance by Sam Elliott. However, Edward Norton is a much better choice as the Incredible Hulk. Eric Bana is a great actor in his own right, but not necessarily right for this part. The story line also follows an edge closer to the TV show that aired during the late 70's and early 80's. And for those true Hulk fans, you will see several notable cameo appearances.<br/><br/>Either way, this Hulk definitely out performs its predecessor. And with the integration of characters like Iron Man, Nick Fury, the SHIELD, and soon to be Avengers, comic book fans everywhere will love the intertwining story lines and keep looking to the newly unveiled Marvel Studios (which is now releasing their own films) to thrill fans and stay true to their roots while adding a few new twists and interpretations now and again.<br/><br/>To those who have doubt after the 2003 Hulk bomb, give this Marvel superhero one more shot.

"Mike Carroll","9","4","10","13 June 2008"," Spectacular, fun, inventive and... wholly credible!
","This is a half-sequel / half-reboot of Ang Lee's 2003 movie, ditching the well-meant but ponderous art-house stuff and keeping the ""smashing things up"" stuff. It's a tremendously likable movie with Ed Norton in great form, Tim Roth and William Hurt clearly having lots of fun as the bad guys, and Liv Tyler giving a very solid performance.<br/><br/>As with most superhero movies, of course, the action sequences are what will make or break it, and in this case they make it. As any fan of the comic will be aware, the Hulk can't help but get involved in wholesale property destruction and this movie has that in bucket-loads. The action is inventive, spectacular and absolutely thrilling.<br/><br/>Despite the title, the Hulk is a remarkably credible character, much more realistic and sympathetic than his 2003 counterpart and definitely the movie's strongest point. On top of that there are plenty of subtle moments to make the die-hard Marvel fans (of which I am one) more than happy.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the movie mostly ignores the 2003 version (a reworked version of the origin appears in the opening credits) and focuses on Banner's search for a cure for his condition. It's this search that brings him to the attention of the US military and that's when the fun really begins...<br/><br/>Overall The Incredible Hulk isn't quite up there with Iron Man, but it's very close (certainly a lot closer than Spider-Man 3 which cost twice as much to make and isn't even half as good)."

"boierul","9","4","10","12 June 2008"," The BEST ever version of the HULK
","Growing up I used to watch the Hulk on TV as a series. I think through the years there were a few attempts at the movie, and then in 2003 Erica Bana starred as the hulk. At the time it was a great movie, and the action and graphics were great.<br/><br/>Today I had two and a half hours to kill and I happened to be in a shopping complex that had a cinema. The only films to be starting during this time was The Incredible Hulk and some chick flick. I chose the Incredible Hulk, not expecting much, with mixed memories of Spider man 3, I wasn't really expecting anything great. Gee was I in shock once the action started. I cant recall seeing another comic book come film ever being so good. <br/><br/>The graphics are awesome and are all believable, the action/fight scenes are unbelievably great, and awesome, and the film doesn't detract from the action. There is a great storyline which is followed, all blended in with sub plots and a twist. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler deliver excellent performances.<br/><br/>Make sure you go to the toilet before you watch this film, as you don't want to miss any of the action.<br/><br/>This is a great film if you want jaw dropping action and fight scenes. There are some funny moments thrown in and at the end, you are left wanting more....you don't realize that two hours have just passed.<br/><br/>If you want a feel good action movie, then this is for you."

","""There are aspects of my personality that I can't control. And when I lose control, it's very dangerous to be around me."" Bruce Banner <br/><br/>It's instructive to end the Incredible Hulk with the appearance of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) foreshadowing the reunion of Marvel superheroes in a few years and showing how limited Hulk as character is next to the complicated, interesting Iron Man. Where Hulk has to worry only about expunging his deadly radiation poisoning (that inflates his body to Kong size when he's angry), Iron Man runs an arms industry that helps defend the greatest society in the world but spawns enemies who use his own weapons against him,.<br/><br/>It's no Iron Man, but the Incredible Hulk will keep your adolescent boys' attention if they will stay for the hour or so of back story and set up. Maybe the lack of complicated character in Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) makes me long for Robert Downey, Jr.'s conflicted Iron Man; at any rate plenty of CGI fighting goes on here with few of the distractions along the psychoanalytical route there were for Iron Man.<br/><br/>Banner needs an antidote for his uncontrollable anger, which thrusts him into a Kong-sized dilemma as he contends not only with a monster just like him (Tim Roth), but also a love for Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) that has him engage in some Kong-like rescue for her, climbing buildings--you know the drill.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the consummate meany is General Ross (William Hurt), who wants more Hulks while Hulk would like to annihilate them, even his irascible self if the death could be arranged. If not, Hulk will return another day, but I won't be waiting for him: I have enough angry ex-wives who are more fearsome and more entertaining than this CGI-heavy, personality-light superhero."

","This far more action packed and stylized film reboot is more angry and action packed than the cerebral and slower 2003's Ang Lee directed Hulk( which I prefer over this one.) The Incredible Hulk is very fast paced and hurtles trough it's story at lighting fast speed ( which doesn't hinder the film at all.) the pace makes it easier and harder to follow, what makes it hard is the fact that it just doesn't take it's time to explain allot of the minor details and explore the story more.<br/><br/>On the flip what makes it easier is that it's complete fun form beginning to end and has a likable and well know actor at the helm as the main character, namely Edward Norton. Who did an exceptional job as Bruce Banner, Norton had the right mannerisms that Dr. Banner had in the comic. He put the his obsession with getting rid of the Hulk, he put his strong love for Betty Ross and his hatred for General Ross in there too.<br/><br/>But here was one thing they didn't put much effort into Norton's Banner, his genius. This reboot focused more on the action then the story of it all, but hat doesn't mean this was a bad film, no in fact this was a well made and well acted comic book film. Louis Leterier directs an exceptional cast to a whole new level of action and style in the incredible Hulk. This reboot should not be looked down on it's great fun and very well done,albeit it's got more of the 80's series in then the comic's, but still nothing to frown upon. All in all The Incredible Hulk is just what the title says, Incredible and is definitely worth the watch."

"das417","7","3","7","23 June 2008"," The Mediocre Hulk
","Hollywood is convinced that in order to tell a good story, especially in regards to a comic book movie, that it needs big actors and CGI effects that cost millions. While the first is understandable, the latter often means a lack of script, dialog, and overall plot which hinders the movie the CGI was supposed to help. This is the case with the latest installment of The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is desperate to escape not only United States Army General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) but the very ""beast"" within him that transforms him into a dangerous and powerful creature with powers of strength far beyond anything human. While in hiding Dr. Banner longs for his love Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who, ironically, happens to be the daughter of General Ross. His existence is a lonely one that has taken him across the Western Hemisphere in order to not only stay free but to also find a cure.<br/><br/>General Ross, a determined officer who sees weapon potentials in Dr. Banner's abilities, brings in Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to head a special forces team to track Dr. Banner who is discovered to be in Brazil. It is then that Blonsky will realize the force of Dr. Banner's power while coming to the realization that he wants that power as well.<br/><br/>The setup for The Incredible Hulk is one that promises more than the standard comic book fare. A unique introduction that tells the story of Banner's transformation, which later leaves to a desperate chase scene through the favelas of Brazil, are unfortunately the only moments of the Incredible Hulk worth remembering. The problems almost begin immediately when Dr. Banner returns to the US and contacts Betty before finding himself facing a now transformed Blonsky who is willing to take the power of gamma mutation to the next level.<br/><br/>However, if there is one thing to be critical about the Incredible Hulk, it is the poor writing which leads to unconvincing and poor dialogue. William Hurt and Tim Roth with the lines they were given might as well have been stage actors from some melodramatic stage play from the late 1890's. All they were missing where the long, black mustaches to twirl while they think of their devious plans. Liv Taylor in particular proves that either she has the ability to only find movies that give her clichéd and limited characters or, more likely, that she really can't act beyond a tearful love interest. Edward Norton himself is constrained by a script that leaves him little more than looks of desperation with wide eyes.<br/><br/>CGI is understandably an important factor in movies like the Incredible Hulk. However, when the CGI alone is the most impressive thing about any movie (and even some of the CGI battle scenes are silly even for a comic book movie) there is going to be problems elsewhere. The Incredible Hulk proves why CGI alone cannot and will not make a good story.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Where do I start...? The writing was probably the weakest aspect of this film with the directing close behind.<br/><br/>The pace of the film...? Seemed they wanted to build a fairly strong drama base yet it kept going on and on without good dialogue to support it.<br/><br/>I thought the CGI was 'far' below that of the 2003 version. Previous Hulk actually had depth! Emotion facially as well as in body language. This version seemed to have none. And the CGI being so bad that it was literally distracting.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler... she normally doesn't stand out for me however in my opinion, she did the most with her part, even more then Norton. And I'm a Norton fan yet he seemed to be less engaged characteristically then most of his other work.<br/><br/>Tim Roth... good effort however I just didn't buy him and I believe only due the director.<br/><br/>William Hurt as the General... Good choice, he did a decent job. Yet one major deficit to his character was he would flip flop so drastically on the connection with his daughter. One moment he couldn't care much less about her let alone help you believe he was her father. And the next, he's demanding she be protected, Huh? <br/><br/>I believe the ultimate downfall is owed to the Director for not joining all the pieces together to make an entertaining and well told story. His direction was weak, kept a weak script, infused no chemistry between the characters and the sad thing about it.... is other then a 'better writer' being needed, he had everything else from budget to talent to tent pole to make this film bring the character of the Hulk into the league it should and could be.<br/><br/>Why the suits let such an inexperienced director like Louis Leterrier helm such an important character and film is beyond me.

","You know how some movies make you want to get popcorn and a drink just to enjoy the movie that much better? This one put me to sleep. Considering how much dumber General Ross got, this also added a ton more openings in the story line. Not to mention the worst part is, the CGI and the camera worked was completely horrible. In several scenes you will notice a very clear difference in hulks. You will have the 2 foot taller hulk who looks like he works out every day at the gym but nothing hard.

I wish I saw Iron man again. If you want my opinion...save your gas money and food money for batman. That just cant be a disappointment."
"The_Dead_See","6","3","7","16 June 2008"," I preferred Ang Lee's version
","Ang Lee's 2003 version of the Hulk had flaws aplenty: hulked out puppies, plastic-looking CGI, an inexplicably ""acid-trip"" climax, and a baby-faced hulk design to name but a few. This reboot attempt neatly avoids many of those flaws but sadly introduces a whole new set of it's own.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the relationship between Banner and Betty Ross is far more palpable and emotional here - thanks mostly to Norton and Tyler's fantastic acting. The hulk design itself just looks cooler, with more realistic CGI (though still far from perfect), and more adult facial features. There are some great cameos and worthy homage paid to the TV series that many of us enjoyed when we were kids. Tim Roth is excellent as always. In other words, director Louis Leterrier has definitely gotten some things right.<br/><br/>For me though, this version falls down in two major aspects. First, there seems to be a lack of rising action in the script. The plot certainly escalates, but somehow the finale is no more exciting or interesting than the opening scenes. Each action scene, though fun in it's own right, does not increase the conflict, tension, or drama of the previous scenes. The result is a mechanistic emotional flatline. Put a simpler way, when two giant monsters are on-screen, battling and destroying a city, and I catch myself glancing at my watch, something, somewhere, ain't quite right.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have though, is that the essence of the Hulk is watered down here. Traditionally the Hulk is the raging, uncontrollable, dark side of man. And its strength and power increase according to the depths of its anger. The madder the Hulk gets, the stronger the Hulk gets. Ang Lee's Hulk did this - the bigger the threat, the bigger the Hulk! We saw him take out military helicopters and fighter jets as if they were children's toys. We saw him toss 70 tons of Abrams tank off to the horizon! This was the true essence of the Hulk. This new take, however, sees the Hulk diluted to a Disney version that flinches at bullets from a .45 handgun and hurts his head when he bumps it on a cave roof. The largest thing he handles is a small forklift truck.<br/><br/>It's a small gripe, I suppose, but an important one. I would think that if a film about a creature with superhuman strength is to be better than it's predecessors, surely the creature should be... well... better than it's predecessors.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want to see a better *film*, see this version; but if you want to see a better *Hulk*, then Ang Lee's version has that nailed."
"PWNYCNY","4","3","7","16 June 2008"," A remake of a remake and shows it.
","FIrst, Edward Norton is no Bill Bixby and second, how many ""Hulks"" does this movie need? This movie has several glaring weaknesses: first, the acting is laughable. Tim Roth must be considered as a candidate for the worst actor award for 2008. Second, the story is simplistic. Man is sick, man gets angry, man becomes a monster. Duh. Third, the special effects are almost cartoonish. Is this movie actually a cartoon interspersed with live acting? This confusion of style is now typical of most Hollywood action/sci-fi movies. Fourth, little character development. The characters are two-dimensional facsimiles directly out of the Hollywood potboiler mold. Liv Tyler's performance is utterly flat. It's not her fault; it's the material she has to work with. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford probably would have fared little better, but at least they would have given the role a little more flare. This movie is a remake of a remake and shows it, a really empty vessel. No originality. Intellectually empty. A huge Hollywood fx extravaganza that, like all the celluloid garbage that has preceded it, will eventually find its way to DVD land and oblivion."
"zetes","7","3","7","15 June 2008"," No better than Ang Lee's version, but if you want action, you'll get action
","A ""reboot"" of the series, following Ang Lee's disastrous (performance-wise) Hulk. I'm one of those who thought that film wasn't that bad. I'm not one who thinks it's great, either, but it was entertaining. I don't think The Incredible Hulk is any better, and I'd probably rank it a tad below Lee's film. This one is more action-oriented, although I honestly think the percentage of running time the action lasts is similar in both movies. The Incredible Hulk wraps its thin story around three giant action sequences, each better than the last. It's a lot of fun during those parts. Other parts, eh, not so much. It's fine, but it's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Okay, blow something up already."" I still have the same major problem with this one that I did with the last one: CGI. Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, if you're familiar with my point of view already. I especially don't think CGI works when the animated characters are supposed to be humanoid. When the Hulk is standing next to Liv Tyler, to me it's no more convincing an interaction than when Mary Poppins dances with cartoon penguins. I liked the nods to the TV series, including a hitchhiking scene, the sad piano music and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno."
"HulkVader","6","3","7","14 June 2008"," Good effort, though not the quality of the '03 version
","This is a good comic adaptation, period. There's action, the plot line is simple but effective, a little depth, it has all the necessary ingredients. Yet, it didn't live up to the underrated inaugural effort. The primary reason is the aforementioned depth. Lee's version possessed more heart than was anticipated by the average moviegoer and, thus, was met with mixed reviews. This isn't really to blame of the moviegoers who, perhaps, simply wanted more Smash with their Hulk. Had the original been received as a drama, as was intended by Lee and his longtime screenwriter, Jim Shamus, I believe it would have been appreciated much more.<br/><br/>I think the recasts in Incredible Hulk were a mistake, and feel that Bana, Connelly, & Elliot were all superior in the same roles. However, this may simply be a matter of personal taste. At this point, I feel I am making too many comparisons to the first effort that are unnecessary. Back to this film, the effects are good. The problem with Hulk CGI lies in facial expressions and muscle definition. With such Marvel films as Spider-Man and Ironman this point is moot, because both heroes wear masks and suits thus such things are unnecessary. However, with Incredible Hulk, the effects are, well, effective.<br/><br/>As was aforementioned, this is a solid comic adaptation. I consider Incredible Hulk on par with Ironman. This is a fine way to spend an afternoon. Cheers."

","This movie could have been great but it has two huge issues that hurt it. The story was OK but really now that I think about it almost a retelling of the TV show version with special effects and a equal to fight. 1. Major editing in the middle was botched. Timeline all wrong. Don't know how no one else saw this. Killed the mood and brought me out of the flow of the story. 2. CGI was actually not as good as the Ang Lee version over all. Close up scene were better but action scenes were easy to see as CGI both the Moster and background looked like a comic book page. Iron man did a better job of blending it all together. After watching both the newest and Ang Lee's I have to say the cerebral version is much better and more satisfying. Lastly Camera control. Normally I don't have a problem with camera jerk, I watch a ton of action movies but this is the first movie were I had trouble watching as the camera moved around to much. During the chase scene in the beginning and much of the fight scenes the camera was unsteady like it was a hand-held and would whip around away from the action at times. Very distracting and detracting from the movie."

","I've read today that Ed Norton has pulled out of the promotion for this film as he is unhappy with the final cut.I can kind of understand where he is coming from if this is the case.The Incredible Hulk is a decent enough comic book action film but i left the theatre with the feeling that they have failed to fully get to grips with the character and his dark inner workings.There is a lot of scope to go deeper into his psyche and explore the animal inside the man but any interesting dramatic themes are substituted for a computer generated frenzy and some pretty generic action film goings on.The film delivers as a spectacle though which is why most people will want to see it,the CGI looks like CGI but its not as bad as everyone seems to be making out.Norton does an okay job as Banner, injecting a little more life in to the character than a wooden Eric Bana managed in the previous film.There are some lighter moments of humour in the film and overall proceedings feel light and comic book, this may be why Nortons not happy.Hulk is not to be taken seriously though.If you let yourself get swept along you may enjoy it, i found it all a little tiresome but each to their own eih!?"
"alexmail-2","9","3","7","14 June 2008"," Another great Marvel movie this summer.
","I must say this movie really was........""Incredible"". I loved it. I went in expecting a movie that was going to lean on action sequences, and have some boring, pointless dialouge. I came out extremely satisfied. It wasn't as funny or as ""cool"" as Iron Man, but the action was just as good.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with some really well done editing, in which they show how Bruce Banner ""accidentally"" got his Hulk powers. Then it shows Banner in Brazil, where he works in a bottling factory. The U.S. Military learns of his location, and quickly dispatches commandos to capture him. The movie lifts off at this point, and doesn't come back down until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Edward Norton blows Eric Bana away with a much better performance as Banner, though Norton is no where near as witty as Robert Downey Jr. I think Liv Tyler really does an excellent job as Betty, Banner's Girlfriend. Betty is really the only person who believes that there is good inside the Hulk. Throughout the whole movie she stands by Bruce, and is the only one who supports him. William Hurt is awesome as General Ross. He really unleashes his acting ability in this movie. Tim Roth is an excellent villain. Roth's character really only cares about himself, and will double cross anyone for power.<br/><br/>The CGI is absolutely gorgeous looking, and some of the scenery can be very pretty. They finally get the Hulk to look somewhat realistic.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie is that it had a really good message in it. Throughout the whole movie Ross and military were trying to capture, and possibly kill Banner. At the end of the movie Banner is still willing to save humanity, and fight the abomination. From the beginning of the movie till the end Banner is acting like a true hero. He is trying to cure his ""disease"", and submits to being a lowly factory worker in the Brazilian slums. He dives out of a helicopter and hits the ground, hoping that he can turn into the Hulk, mind you, he doesn't know whether or not the he can still become the Hulk.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, and came out smiling. I would definitely see this movie if you want a thrilling and epic action movie."

The chaos and havoc brought the Hulk alive. The only failing is the CGI, but how real can a big green monster be? In my opinion if you like the Ang Lee version then this is probably not the movie for you and you are not a true Hulk fan. But, for the rest enjoy because this movie is up there with Iron Man even better cause of the action. I am a action buff. The final fight was way more satisfying than the final fight of Iron Man by far. Norton was great. Liv was good. And, the pacing is perfect. SPOILER. There is a cameo by Stark and hints of Captain America but no appearance that I saw of. That kind of was a downer. But, all and all this is a great summer blockbuster."
"kgprophet","6","3","7","13 June 2008"," Norton has difficulty emoting in cartoon movie.
","This movie feels more like a reboot, such as ""Batman Begins"", but it is missing the ""Alfred"", or Morgan Freeman's character, an ally. Here Bruce Banner is alone, with virtually no one to reveal his inner psyche to (at least for the first half of the movie). Poor William Hurt can't seem to find the soul of his character, and doesn't make a great villain either. I understand that 70 minutes of the film was removed, and I can only assume that the soul of these characters were lost in the editing room. As for the monster itself, that never felt like Bruce Banner. During the opening credits, we see the whole lab episode to show how Banner became Hulk. A great innovation during this sequence was ""Hulk Vision"", and eery POV shot that gave you an idea how it felt to be the Hulk. Sadly, this vehicle is never used again in the movie. There might need to be a change in the Hulk universe, where perhaps Hulk can speak a bit more, which works well when Tim Roth undergoes his transformation. Frankly, it's still too unbelievable that a man turns big and green, and back again when working it as a feature film. It still feels cartoonish.<br/><br/>So a delicate balance is needed, between the accepted reality these characters live in this movie, and the bizarre creatures that require a leap of imagination. Ed Norton, an Oscar calibre actor, invested a lot into internalising this character, so he is understandably upset that nuances were removed. As for the action set pieces, they are fun to watch, and the cinematography surpasses almost any other comic book movie, even better than ""300"". What the studios wanted with this reboot is not a lot of luggage, not another Ang Lee, and for that they get my approval (you can read about my ongoing rant about 2+ hour movies in my other reviews). I would have settled for perhaps 10 more minutes of Bruce's psyche, what helped make ""Batman Begins"" so good.<br/><br/>The problem with William Hurt; perhaps it was the moustache, or his non-military sounding voice, or the ambivalence of being both the bad guy and the father of the Bruce's romantic interest. He did not possess the tenacity to be feared and despised. Sam Elliot fit the bill very well in the last movie (and the moustache was even real). Tim Roth ends up being the only interesting character of the bunch, and his screen time is limited. This is a muddled effort to reboot the franchise, but I am happy that Ang Lee's disaster has been overlooked. I'm confident that a sequel will be made, and perhaps Ed Norton can show more psyche, and maybe someone more fierce can replace William Hurt (perhaps a friend of Tony Stark)."

But then I read some of the early reviews and it kind of changed my mind so I said I will give a crack at it and see what it is like and boy was I surprised. It turned out this movie is actually really good because it turns out that Edward Norton does a pretty good job as Bruce banner/Hulk, and not only that all the rest of the actors do a great job as well. The storyline turned out to be very good and very interesting. The special effects turned out to be great I don't understand why it looks more realistic in the theatres maybe because all of the special effects were not done when the trailer came out maybe. The way the hulk looks in the movie is very well done and it is cool that they got Lou ferrigno to do the voice of the hulk. The abomination is very well done also. The fight and action sequences are very good and well done especially the final fight scene. So this is really good and you should go see it.

The plot is much better portrayed than in any other Hulk I have seen, showing the Hulk's struggle to fight to find a cure for his gamma radiation. With a good love story in the mix, and action throughout(especially the 26 minute fight scene in the end), the Hulk is sure to keep you on the edge of your seats!

Hmmm, the guy is human, cries and gets bruises), why oh why would a multi-million slick production of Hulk skimp on authenticity when it would be so so easy to attain it? The initial scenes in Brazil rang as hollow as a cheap production of an NYC gangster film with the ""Family"" characters sounding Mexican instead of Italian. WHY!?!? <br/><br/>Apart from this annoying and glaring, gaping error, this version of the Hulk strikes a much better tone than the 2003 attempt. It is short on humour but big on heart, and absolutely huge on sequel potential.<br/><br/>I can't wait for said potential to materialise. But only if they treat the audience with respect and don't cut (silly) corners."

","Scouring the earth looking for a cure to his gamma ray poisoning, Bruce Banner is in Brazil when the army, who want to harness the monster within him as a weapon, locate him. General Ross and the power hungry Emil Blonsky will stop at nothing to capture Banner and his significant other angry half, but Banner's true love, Betty Ross, and the mysterious Mr Blue, are allies hoping to cure Bruce of his ills, but is it all in vain?<br/><br/>Those who hated Ang Lee's thoughtful and emotionally driven version of Hulk in 2003 will find this a far more rewarding experience, a mere 20 minutes in and the green one arrives to raise the pulses and set comic book enthusiasts hearts a racing. Not skimping on action or in fact an emotional core, the makers here have managed to blend both the fundamental aspects of the duality being and almost pulled off a great movie, but it's still some way short of being a comic book adapted classic. The pluses do however far outweigh the minuses, this Hulk incarnation is one you can take the kids to see and they can't possibly be bored, the introduction of the wonderfully named The Abomination as a Hulk nemesis ensures the audience is eagerly awaiting the big smack down, thankfully when it arrives it's thrilling, totally daft and entirely within the spirit of the Hulk origins. Major kudos to Tim Roth who as Blonsky, soon to be the monstrous looking Abomination, delivers a delicious line in ego driven badness, and with a fact of movie life being that a film of this type is only as good as its villain, Roth steps in to keep the film above ropey waters.<br/><br/>Annoyingly, considering the cast list here, the film is not without problems. Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors of the modern age, and his restrained showing here as Banner is certainly not at all bad, it's just an odd casting choice to me, almost as if this role is far too beneath him, watching his turn was like an itch I just couldn't scratch. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross steps into the slender shoes vacated by Jennifer Connelly in Lee's 2003 version, it may be unfair to compare the two, but where Connelly had much emotional heart in her portrayal, Tyler has nothing, and her emotional play off with Norton in the crucial scenes just lacks the spark needed to make it work to the full. William Hurt works well enough as General Ross, following on from his bad boy turns in A History Of Violence and Mr Brooks, Hurt is finding something of a working resurgence in devilment characters, while Tim Blake Nelson perfectly dons the caricature hat of scientist on the edge, Dr. Samuel Sterns.<br/><br/>The CGI of Hulk has vastly improved, still a borderline problem, it just may well be that we all should accept that Hulk as a character is never going to be a CGI dream? With that in mind it is perhaps churlish to do down Incredible Hulk based on its entertainment value? Which is certainly very high. Yet it's notable that Edward Norton offers nothing by way of a commentary on the DVD package of the film, Tim Roth joining director Louis Leterrier for the gag track only fuels the fire that apparently leading man and director were well at odds about the direction the film was taking. So is Incredible Hulk recommended to the average thrill seeking movie lover? Most assuredly yes. Is Incredible Hulk a worthwhile comic book adaptation? Well sort of: Better than Daredevil and Darkman, but well short of Spidey and The Bat. At times looking like a cheap knock off of Peter Jackson's King Kong, Incredible Hulk has a willingness to entertain, and maybe we all should just focus on that and enjoy the ride? 7/10"
"inkblot11","7","2","4","8 October 2008"," Incredible, no, but worthwhile, thanks to a touching performance by Norton, a great supporting cast and fabulous special effects
","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been living in a barrio in Brazil for the last year. This is because he is a wanted man, after a laboratory accident that went awry. As you may have heard, Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and when he is overly ""excited"", he turns into a nearly all-powerful monster called the Hulk. In his monstrous form, he killed several folks in the United States. But, unbelievably, that is not exactly why he is being pursued. A bonehead military man, Ross (William Hurt) is after Banner so that Bruce's blood can be used to generate another super-being, rendering the American army invincible. Ross' beautiful daughter, Elizabeth (Liv Tyler), a biology professor, was once involved with Banner and is still the object of the fugitive's affections. To help capture Banner, the elder Ross enlists the aid of a Russian-turned-Brit, Rambo-type (Tim Roth) who is very successful at snaring his prey. But, Banner still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he seeks the aid of an online scientist who may have a cure for his condition. So, who will emerge victorious, Banner or his misguided seekers? This is a good film with unbelievably great special effects and a wonderfully touching performance by Norton. It is on these two strengths that the film succeeds, for the script is uneven and inferior, the direction is one-handed and the events a series of implausibilities. No, it is not the science that is lacking, it is the supposed intelligence of the military. Knowing what this man-monster can do, how could anyone possibly believe that humans could claim victory? Yet, Hurt's character is built on that misguided belief. As stated, Norton is a wonder, for he infuses his character with courage, smarts, and sensitivity. The rest of the cast is quite fine, too, as Tyler, Hurt, and Roth fulfill their roles nicely and the lesser actors do a good job as well. The opening chase scene in the barrio is exciting, even though the viewer feels Banner was deliberately placed in Brazil so that the scene could happen. All other scenery is quite wonderful, too, as the viewer is transported to Guatemala, Mexico, D.C. and even to British Columbia. Costumes are fetching but of small importance. Noteworthy, too, are the fabulous special effects, as Banner's transformation into the Hulk is most impressive and the havoc that ensues when he is in action is mind-boggling. However, the storyline is not worthy of such dazzlement, being, virtually, one long hunting excursion. Should one skip it? No, not at all, as it has enough good elements to make it worthwhile. But, it is far below the bar set by such wonderful movies as this summer's Iron Man or the original Batman."

","What I enjoyed the most from this film was a fight between two monsters. Special effects wasn't very realistic but still it looked great. What else did I liked was Tim Roth's character but he somehow too often did a wrong decisions, like when Hulk crashed two cars, he come near him and asked if that's the best he can do and of course he was struck down by Hulk. Edward Norton also did a great job. What else did I like was Tim Blake Nelson's acting, I've seen him in some other movies but I newer noticed what a great actor he is. This movie is well filmed and the soundtrack somehow reminded me of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. There were few boring moments but still this movie is highly entertaining."

The Abonmination was an improvement over that weirdo. Sorry Tim, but you got a face that could stop a train and a body that needs a LOT of work. I loved the beginning in Brazil, having lived and worked there, I recognized the favellas immediately. My big question is what is Banner doing at the end? Hulking out in the wilds of British Columbia for kicks? I guess if I had that power, I'd green-man from time to time just to feel big and bad and swole! William Hurt follows the same driven, cycloptic militarist minded General that Sam Eliot did in 2003, inlcuding bad acting and a gruff almost unintelligible voice. And I kept looking for elf ears on Liv Tyler. She was seen so much during the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I feel her face has been typecast as an elf. All in all, a bit of an improvement on the 2003 Ang Lee epic, but Eric Bana is a lot easier on the eyes than Ed Norton any day. Can't wait for Captain America!!!"

Tim Roth always plays a great villain and there is no exception here. The effects were great....the Hulk didn't look like a cartoon....and the action was fast and furious. Loved the park scene. Can not wait until the sequel and the Avengers movie.<br/><br/>Although the movie is not quite as good as Ironman, it does make up for the lackluster adventures of a certain Mr. Jones."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","2","4","2 July 2008"," A fairly decent job was done this time, unlike before
","It was five years ago this month I went to see Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" in the theatre, and like many others, I was not too impressed. I last gave it a try on the small screen last year, and it certainly didn't improve. In fact, I probably noticed more flaws in it than before. However, when I learned that this second adaptation of the ""Incredible Hulk"" comic book series was coming, featuring a different cast and director, it was a film I intended to watch. Before I went to see it on the silver screen today, I knew it seemed to be widely considered superior to the 2003 film, so I was expecting it to be, and it was, even though it's not one of my favourite comic book movies.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner is now a fugitive from the U.S. Military in Brazil, and has managed not to turn into the Hulk for quite a while. He currently works in a bottling factory, and is learning anger management techniques. He also has conversations on the Internet with someone he knows as ""Mr. Blue"", discussing a possible cure for Bruce's condition. Unfortunately for Bruce, the military manages to track him down, and while they are after him, he is attacked by fellow factory employees, causing him to finally turn into the Hulk again! So, the military doesn't catch him this time, but he is once again on the run from them! He finds himself in Guatemala the next day, and soon makes his way back to the United States, where he meets his former girlfriend, Betty Ross, the daughter of General Ross. From here, his conflict with the military continues, and more trouble arises when another powerful giant green creature appears, The Abomination! <br/><br/>Things that sunk Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" include bad acting, some laughable lines in the script, Talbot being a fairly annoying character, and silly multiple scene framing. Fortunately, I didn't notice any of these things in this second attempt to bring The Incredible Hulk to the big screen. The acting isn't really anything to rave about, but at least it's better than before. The script may be a tad weak at times, but at least there are no lines as low as what Betty says to Bruce after he survives gamma radiation in the first film. Aside from that, we don't have any characters as annoying as Talbot, and there's none of the multiple scene framing. 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is also more exciting. I had trouble staying into it for a while, but eventually, the action had me in fairly consistent suspense for probably most of the rest of the film, starting with the battle between the Hulk and the military on the university campus. To add to the entertainment, there's also a bit of humour in this film, such as the crazy taxi driver. Some of the fight sequences may be a bit overlong, but I don't think any of them have anything on the tedious sequence with the Hulk fighting mutated dogs in the 2003 film.<br/><br/>With all its merits, this comic book movie is not the greatest one to reach the silver screen since the '90s (there have been lots of those), but it certainly does show a vast improvement after the first ""Hulk"" movie adaptation, and is definitely superior to certain other comic book movies of the decade, such as the Razzie Award-winning ""Catwoman"". Like Ang Lee's 2003 film, this one is dark, which some would like and some wouldn't, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the quality of the film. Unlike its predecessor, this 2008 version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" is actually a fairly decent dark film, and if you're a fan of these comic book movies and were displeased by the first Hulk movie adaptation (like many others were, myself included), well, that's no reason to avoid this second one."

","Well yesterday I went to see the new hulk and I've got to say it really was Incredible.This movie is not a sequel it is a relaunch of the whole Hulk franchise as the 2003 hulk was a total disaster. The film starts of slow but it soon gets better. At first I wasn't too sure about Edward Norton at first but by the end of it I think he played the part of Bruce Banner great.<br/><br/>The film builds you up until you finally see the hulk in full action, which I must say looks superb, the visual effects are breathtaking at times. But don't get me wrong this isn't purely a smash up film its more of a brilliant portrayal of how Banner is trying to cope with what he becomes and how to control it.<br/><br/>The end fight scene is brilliant with the Hulk facing The Abomination, plus a cameo at the very end was surprising and what he says gives you some answers to a future marvel film, I won't give it away, just watch it and find out.<br/><br/>All together this film has been done how hulk should have been done all along, this wipes the floor with the 2003 version. I will defiantly getting this when it comes out on DVD."

","If you were hoping for a big-screen version of the Hulk that would clear the vomit taste from your mouth left by Ang Lee's debacle a few years ago, you're in luck. This new film that starts over with the Hulk's story is lean, mean and green, much like its titular troubled soul. That troubled soul, who exists under the geeky guise of Bruce Banner during his more laid back moments, is played by Edward Norton, and that's largely why this film is better. Superhero movies are a dime a dozen anymore, and they all, to a lesser or greater extent, look and sound the same. One of the only things that distinguishes one from the other is the quality of the acting, which is why this film can hold its head up with that other surprisingly good superhero film from earlier this summer, ""Iron Man"".<br/><br/>Along with Norton, ""The Incredible Hulk"" features William Hurt, as the standard slightly crazy Army general that we all love to hate, Tim Roth, as the Hulk's nemesis, The Abomination, and Liv Tyler as Betty, the love interest. Tyler and Hurt get put through the usual acting paces their roles would suggest, which means Tyler must look worried and Hurt must glower, but they look worried and glower well, respectively. And the idiosyncratic casting of Roth as the film's villain actually lends the film a bit of novelty.<br/><br/>By the end, the movie devolves into an action film indistinguishable from any other, all deafening sound effects and been-there-done-that CGI. But everything leading up to that is slightly better than average for the genre.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Action packed and kinetic. This one maintains a better pace than the first one. The first attempt tried to be very cerebral and focus on the inner workings of the characters, forgetting to put in some real action. Here, that has been rectified.<br/><br/>The action is very well done and the effects of the Hulk character are about as realistic as you could expect a giant green man to appear.<br/><br/>However, a couple of the fight scenes -- particularly the last one between the Hulk and the Abomination -- are filmed a little too close to really be able to easily follow the action.<br/><br/>Other than that, this one is great.

","VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS Let's clear this up right from the offset, 'The Incredible Hulk' is not a remake of Ang Lee's 'Hulk' (2003), neither is it a sequel, the film is billed as a reboot of the franchise - which quite frankly means that it is a little bit of both. The film picks up five years after its disappointing predecessor, complete with a brand new cast, director and slightly altered back story. Confused? Don't worry, it's easier from here on in.<br/><br/>To it's credit the film isn't concerned with what has come before, Hulk's past being explained fleetingly yet effectively in flashes during the opening credits. We are introduced to Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), alter-ego of the titular character, hiding in Brazil from General Ross (William Hurt) who wishes to use him as a military weapon. The early scenes set the plot up well and introduce the Hulk early which will delight fans frustrated with the last film.<br/><br/>Norton deals with his role capably but one can't help but feel short-changed by an actor who has played the dual-personality role so well in 'Fight Club' amongst others, yet the script gives him little chance to convey this inner-conflict. Things really take a turn downhill when love-interest Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) is introduced. Tyler and Norton enjoy little to no chemistry, their dialogue seems forced and the occasional attempts at humour fall dreadfully flat. Tyler is distinctly insipid and struggles to match the efforts of her fellow cast-members.<br/><br/>Banner transforms on four occasions during the course of the film and provides us with three prolonged sequences of Hulk-smashing action. Hulk's nemesis is The Abomination (Tim Roth), alter ego of the stereotypical English/Russian villain Emil Blonsky. It is their final showdown which provides the best action, including the piece de resistance as Hulk uses a car as boxing gloves. But here in lies the films greatest flaw, neither The Incredible Hulk of The Abomination look even slightly like the actors playing them, consequently all we are treated to is two large CG-blobs having a big of a ruck on the streets of New York.<br/><br/>Bringing Hulk to the big screen, as proved before, is a difficult job and director Louis Letterrier has made an admirable attempt but yet again Hulk fails to shine, albeit for different reasons. Die-hard fans of the comic book and television shows may feel more satisfied with this version but for most viewers this will likely disappoint. Perhaps it is time Marvel accepted that although Hulk is a fantastic character with copious potential, that potential does not translate to the big screen.<br/><br/>Verdict: Hat's off to all involved for trying something different and having the guts to change things completely. Commiserations for not pulling it off. TWO STARS OUT OF FIVE!"

With references to others in the comic world storyline, I foresee more movies in the future having the Hulk character in them, as well as team ups.<br/><br/>If I had to find one thing that could have made this and all Marvel movies better it would be dropping the Stan Lee cameo's. Also, I think the time has come to retire Lou Ferigno from the Hulk franchise.

Tim roth turns himself into abomination with the help of a biologist who is initially trying to cur e hulk. Now in the initial part edward norton wants to get rid of the monster inside him. But later he wishfully turns into one wto stop the abomination.<br/><br/>Now the movie has certain clichÃ© where only tyler can turn him back to normal with her expression of love. The director just missed showing her kissing norton to convert him back into a normal person from a monster :-) . The climax has been compromised a little by giving hint of another sequel.

","I enjoyed the Ang Lee directed ""The Hulk"", but I was not entertained by it. I am not sure if that makes sense, but that is the easiest way I can explain the first film and my like/dislike of it. In the end I think Lee went away from the basics of the character and of the fan expectations and it was not what a film called ""The Hulk"" should have been.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 2008 and ""The Incredible Hulk"". This go around, with Marvel studios having a heavier hand in the production, most everything is done right. Instead of taking up loads of time exploring the ""why"" of Banner's transformation, Zak Penn's script handles the genesis of Banner's Gama radiation exposure during the opening credits. That sets up the story perfectly. Another aspect done right is Banner being portrayed as a man on the run. This is what most fans enjoyed and loved about the original series and lets face it, the movie version has to address the comic and TV version if it is going to succeed.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier brings a welcomed action sense to the film. Let's face it, we want to see Hulk smash things. We want to see Banner on the run for his life. All of this is brought together nicely by Leterrier.<br/><br/>My one nitpick of the film is the transition from some scenes to the next. There has been a lot of rumors circulating of chunks being removed from the final cut and in places it shows.<br/><br/>I was not keen on Edward Norton playing the role, yet 10mins into the film I was sold on him. He brings to the Banner role the same emotional struggle that Bill Bixby did with the TV character of David Banner. Liv Tyler is fantastic. Her scenes with the computer generated Hulk are light years ahead in emotion compared to those from the first film. Speaking of the CGI, all in all it is much improved from the first film. Tim Roth as Abomination is perfectly cast, he brings an absolute evil glee to the table. William Hurt does some of his best work of late as the ""General"".<br/><br/>There are ample cameos from the creator of The Hulk to the members of the TV series as well as a nod to another character in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Much improved over the first movie, there was a lot of nay-sayers out there when this project was announced. But they proved them wrong and now the Hulk train has been righted and it looks like we will be seeing a lot more of him in the future."

","The Incredible Hulk - A reboot of the franchise after the Abomination that was ""The Hulk"", Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) evades the military after a mixture of Super Soldier serum and gamma radiation turns him into the jolly Green Giant we all love.<br/><br/>I didn't like the first movie, for several reasons. It was slow. It was boring. Nick Nolte's heinous over-acting, and Eric Bana's aversion to acting. Oh, and the Poodle. Did I mention the Poodle? Who hasn't? It's become synonymous with the Bat-nipples at this point. While Incredible Hulk is no Batman Begins to Batman and Robin, it stays truer to the roots of the character than it's predecessor, and acknowledges the TV show, a wise move.<br/><br/>This film gives the fanbase a little more of what they expect and deserve from a movie about a monster that destroys property. There aren't the Banner-father issues that the first film had and didn't need. There're also more explosions, noise (Jesus is it loud), action, humor and movement. It unfortunately retreads a little too much familiar ground. I've seen the Hulk get chased by the military. I've already seen this love/hate triangle between Ross, Banner and Betty, though it's actually interesting here I read there's a scene where Bruce travels to the North pole and contemplates suicide. Now there's a scene I haven't seen before, and would like to see.<br/><br/>The trouble with the Incredible Hulk is unless you're a very very creative writer, The Hulk is a rather two dimensional character. He gets angry and then smashes crap up. The only memorable villain he ever has was The Abomination because the other secret to The Hulk is that he's a better villain (it's taken most of the Marvel universe to bring him down at varying points) than a hero. I applaud Norton for his creativity and the depth he brings to Banner. He also adds vitality and intelligence, whilst Eric Bana was having difficulty grasping the American accent. Liv Tyler adds a sweet sadness to the romantic interest. She is Banner's only connection to humanity when he transforms. Tim Roth plays the heavy pretty well, though I caught him overacting blatantly a couple times. The effects are pretty good and I enjoyed the action sequences.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the better Hulk movie should come out second (and behind Iron Man no less) which should be a lesson to Hollywood. Put your butts in gear and get it right the first time. Good, not ""Incredible"", The Incredible Hulk gets a B."

In Britain the reviews were at best average, but I thought it was good, especially against the Ang Lee version.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is that Bruce Banner already has the Hulk inside him and is on the run from the US government. He had settled in Brazil and lives in the slums of a city. He was working in a soft drinks factory and hadn't transformed into the Hulk in five months. However, he accidentally cuts himself and his blood falls into a bottle. After a man drinks from the bottle in the US General Ross, sends a team of Special Forces to capture him. In Brazil Banner is also trying to find a cure and was in contact with a scientist in the USA. He was able to reduct the gamma radiation in Banner's blood, but he needs data which Banner's can't provide. After the attack Banner decides to go back to America to get the data and his cure. He had to go to Virginia, to the University where he worked with Betty Ross and became the Hulk. He ends up battling the army on the campus, and both the Hulk and Betty are on the run, before heading off to New York to meet the scientist that could care Banner.<br/><br/>At the same time Ross meets an experience army soldier, Emil Blonsky, a Russian-born British marine (the ultimate Hollywood bad-guy) and discovers he has an ambition to fight and becomes interested in the Hulk and wants to defeat him. Ross tells Blonsky about the Super-Soldier programme from World War 2 and starts to injection with a gamma based serum that makes Blonsky more stronger and powerful then any other soldiers and gives him rapid healing abilities. However he is still not strong enough to beat the Hulk. It is only when his mixes the Hulk's blood into his own that he becomes the Abomination, a very powerful monster. This events leads to an epic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination in Harlem.<br/><br/>This film works because it doesn't take itself too seriously, doesn't deal with the father son relationship like in the Ang Lee version, has lots of actions and is influenced by the TV show. This film breaks away from the X-Men/Batman Begins approach of being as dark, serious and realistic as possible, and goes down the Spiderman/Iron Man idea of being a bit more fun. The Hulk looks better in this film, showing that he big and muscular and light green, compared to the bright green blob with a sad face in previous version. The action is better, even when the Hulk isn't involved, because there was a good chase scene in the Brazilian slums. I thought the Abomination looked really impressive, and the director, Louis Leterrier changed him from a reptilian to a bone like creature. This film also has better villains, the Abomination is a match for the Hulk and General Ross is more power mad in this version. I didn't like the fact that in the Ang Lee version the villain of the film was Bruce Banner's dad. I also felt that Ed Norton was better then Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>The film is also linked with other Marvel films, in the title sequence there is a mention of Stark Industries and Nick Fury. The super-serum from World War 2 is linked to Captain America which is going to be made into a film. Robert Downey Jr. also has a cameo as Tony Stark, and anyone who has seen the end sequence of Iron Man can guess what he is doing in the film, because it is going to be linked with the Avengers film that will be made. It is also hinted that the Leader is going to be a villain in the next film if it is made.<br/><br/>There are problems, I find it totally unrealistic that the Hulk could travel from Brazil to Guatemala in a day, even with super-powers, and that it is unlikely that the Hulk could blow out a fire just by clapping his hands.<br/><br/>The Hulk is however a good film, a solid 7.5 out of 10."

","Coming off the 'incredible' ""Iron Man"", Marvel Comics produces ""The Incredible Hulk"". Unfortunately, 'incredible' is a slight exaggeration. Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film; far more than the 2003 ""Hulk"" film which tended to take itself too seriously. This is the Hulk. Hulk smash should be the top priority of a Hulk film. For this reason, this film is a reboot rather than a sequel to the 2003 film. The Hulk's origin is told through still photos and captions during the opening credits and this origin tends to echo more of the TV show than either the comics (gamma bomb exposure) or the previous film (a convoluted mess). The CGI seemed a little sub par. At times I felt I was watching a cartoon. At least they rendered the Hulk a darker tone instead of the Shrek coloured green from the previous film. I suspect it will look better on the small screen. Comic fans will likely enjoy the loads of references to Marvel Comics characters, most notably, Captain America's super soldier formula. The film boasts an 'incredible' cast and everyone does a more than adequate job. I look forward to seeing what Marvel can do with their next project, Thor."

","I enjoyed this film i thought it was exciting and a good summer film When i compare it to Ang Lee's version overall this is better i did however think Eric Bana was a better Bruce Banner but what the first Hulk lacked was a poor story and was instead of an exciting summer action film it was a weak drama The new version however lived up to it's promise and had a much more exciting and had a lot more action. It wasn't as good as other recent comic book movies e.g. Iron-man and Batman Begins The special effects were quite disappointing they were fine when with the hulk and the other monster but when it threw a jeep or whatever it looked much more poor. So overall the first Hulk may had better acting by Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly but the weak and long story which began to drive your patience and lack of the hulk was too much of a let down while The Incredible Hulk had most of what the first one lacked and was much more enjoyable and focused much more on Bruce Banner trying to get rid of the disease instead of understand it which was more enjoyable so The Incredible Hulk was better and a good summer movie."

It was filled with shock, action, excitement, romance, and yes, even a little comedy was put in there. It was an amazing movie I saw yesterday and I might go see it again. I think this movie is going to make it big in the box office.<br/><br/>I think this movie really started the franchise of Marvel's Hulk and put the original Hulk film below. This is a recommended film to see that is fun for almost everybody. If you have seen and loved the original Hulk film or have been interested in watching one of the movies, watch the 2008 one. You'll enjoy it."

","Yes yes and more yes!! This is what a superhero movie is supposed to be like. It is catching its unfair share of knocks for not having the ""heart"" of Ironman but let me ask you something; didn't we have the heartfelt Hulk a few years back? And didn't even blind deaf mutes scream how bad it was? This is exactly what I want from a Hulk movie. There was pain and there was heart but when your ""superhero""(for lack of better words) uncontrollably transforms into a giant beast that kills anyone that isn't Betty Ross how much heart is there. Anyways enough about heart. This movie intrigues you with its portrayal of Bruce banner and would you expect any less from Ed Norton? The CGI is amazing and the battle scenes are all impressive in both their scale and effects. You feel bad for Banner as all he wants is to stop this beast within him and be with his one true love. The action scenes work. the love scenes work. The comedy works especially well. Overall this is an amazing Marvel flick that had it come out before Ironman would be getting all the love from everyone but was released an unfortunate few weeks too late. Do not compare this to another movie enjoy it for what it is and you'll be amazed!"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","18 June 2008"," In capable hands, reinvented Hulk is a smash
","After about 15 minutes of ""The Incredible Hulk,"" I easily tossed aside and deserted all thoughts and pre-existing connections to Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" and willingly accepted this film's complete makeover--that's how much better this film is than Hulk's first cut on the big screen. Writer Zak Penn and director Louis Leterrier's depiction of the green giant makes for a much more exciting action film and is way more believable. ""The Incredible Hulk"" epitomizes summer blockbuster while staying comic-friendly and not being completely devoid of audience empathy.<br/><br/>""Incredible Hulk"" picks off where 2003's Hulk left off, but basically rewrites everything up to that point. Banner is in hiding from the U.S. military, trying to find ways of controlling his anger/heart rate so he never becomes the Hulk, and in the meantime communicating secretly with a scientist who might be able to help him cure his condition. When General Ross (Hurt), who wants Banner for his blood to make it into a weapon, finds where Banner is hiding, the fun begins.<br/><br/>The plot is rather cyclical in that Ross tries to hunt down Banner three different times and then the Hulk gets away. Each time is a bit different, mostly because one decorated military soldier (Tim Roth) begins taking Ross' ""supersoldier"" serum in effort to bring the Hulk down and eventually his lust for strength turns him into the Abomination. It's not a great plot, but it's straightforward, really easy and exciting to follow, very comic-like, and we can identify with Banner's need to find a cure for the uncontrollable beast inside him.<br/><br/>Norton is infinitely better than Bana as Bruce Banner. The writing for his character is so much better to begin with--you actually get the sense that he's fighting the Hulk and you see the connection between Banner and this alter ego. They don't feel completely separate from one another, which is something ""Hulk"" of 2003 never did. Ang Lee gave us more introspective Hulk, but Leterrier gives us some of that in addition to a Hulk that is more fierce, visceral and untamed. The CGI is more realistic and Leterrier does a much better job at showing how inadvertently destructive the Hulk really is and why Banner wants it to go away.<br/><br/>The action in this film is top notch in both live action and CGI. Especially at the beginning it feels like a mix between superhero films and the ""Bourne"" movies. Marvel made a bold move bringing in ""Transporter 2"" director Leterrier, but Leterrier's command of action makes this film great in at least that aspect alone. The action is brutal and relentless, never going soft which is exactly what you want from a movie about an uncontrollable green monster, especially one who fights an even crazier monster at the end. This kind of action is incomparable to any superhero film I've seen and that's a credit to Leterrier.<br/><br/>The script only scratches the surface thematically in terms of Bruce's struggle, but it's enough to like and care about his character and let the action do the rest. You really get to know Norton's Banner and that's what matters. My other beefs with the film (Liv Tyler's mediocrity, Roth's dialogue, Abomination talking too much) are not significant enough to knock the film from its solid action superhero film status. Ultimately, this film is very satisfying--the direction, the creative hands that the Hulk franchise is in (should it continue) is an extremely gratifying one."
"fern818","7","2","4","18 June 2008"," It wont win any Oscars......
","But who cares? This is a good example of a film that was just made to entertain and succeeds. The first half hour are actually quite good, and when he transforms into the hulk it just becomes good, corny fun. It has a really good cast (Tim Roth, William Hurt, Liv Tyler, and Ed Norton as the title character) which helps it quite a bit. The scenes with Norton, who is a great actor, are the best in the film by far. For the rest of the time, just check your brain in at the front desk and enjoy.Their is definitely MAJOR improvement from the 2003 version, and I like that we don't have to see the same boring story that we always see explaining how he came to be the hulk.

","You've probably read that the movie in some people's opinion is a glorified chase scene for two hours with not much substance and overblown CGI effects. Or you've read that it delivers and The Hulk (franchise?) has been redeemed and that the action scenes are awesome, the pacing good, and The Hulk's roar loud. I would say that the truth, or my opinion, lies somewhere in between. While the CGI is at times egregious and fakely applied, so much so it could possibly take you out of the movie, so is the whole premise of the thing. But it is a comic book movie, and if you can suspend your disbelief for that, it is not too much further a stretch to just take the CGI for what it is: that is, a part of a nicely paced, entertaining chase film, with moderate character development and substance, that happens to be incorporated with comic book characters. The good guys most likely win--barely; and in the sequel we'll find out if the proverbial 'beast' or 'mutant' will be reunited with his 'girl-next-door'. All the while a new villain is making devious and disastrous plans, for what else would a comic hero do if not?"

Norton was strange as Banner, sometimes it seemed like he was trying too hard, but in others he was perfect. Liv Tyler was OK, not her best work ever, but she was nice to look at. Hurt was a bad bad man, and played his character well (hell by the end of the movie I was mad at him) And Roth was far from being the best villain in movie history, his acting in this film left MUCH to be desired. <br/><br/>The movie had its moments of humor (You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry)and the purple pants bit were great. Also it was nice to see a cameo by Stan Lee and a larger roll than just a walk by by Lou Ferrigno. Plus, we didn't have to wait till then end of the end credits for the extra cameo by Mr Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr). <br/><br/>The movie itself placed various other Marvel items through it, Stark Industires logos clearly visible, a medical report signed by Nick Fury, iron man hints, even talk of a super soldier formula....nice bits of trivia that were a welcome surprise. <br/><br/>All in all a good film, since the franchise couldn't get any worse, but this does what Batman Begins did for the Batman franchise. <br/><br/>Good job Marvel, keep it up."

","The incredible Hulk opens its way as one of the best action movies of the season. With a completely new adaptation of the movie combining parts from the comic and parts from the 70's T.V. series, the film comes full of action and adventure, a good story of love and even some humor moments. It was like an adrenaline shot right to the heart. The CGI and special effects are really great. We can see a more realistic, more human Hulk, of course that they still can make it better. The movie is full of references of the Marvel Universe like the brief appearance of Tony Stark talking about The Avengers. The cast is awesome, all-star actors and actresses like Edward Norton with a flawless performance, it's like he was born to be Bruce Banner, the character really fits him, Liv Tyler in the role of Betty Ross is great so sweet and cute. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a.k.a Abomination was the perfect villain and William Hurt give a convincing performance as General Ross. the brief cameos of Robert Downey Jr. Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee were a great add to the movie. In conclusion, this is by far a better Hulk movie than the one of 2003. Enjoyable, entertaining. One of the best movies of the season."
"colonel_green","8","2","4","14 June 2008"," Hulk returns to theatres, with more action and less introspection.
","I just got back; all in all, I'd say pretty good. It's hard to compare it with Hulk '03 as to which is better, since they're very different types of films, but I'd say this definitely meets audience expectations a lot better.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was good in the lead part, although, and perhaps this is a deliberate emphasizing of his need to control himself, he rarely seems to get very emotive, even when he's supposed to be really angry.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler; I really like her as an actress, performance-wise here I'd say she's a bit weak in the first half and really good in the second. Admittedly, some of that could be that when we first meet her the director spends a bunch of time shooting her in slo-mo with a lot of shots of her looking uncertain/stunned. Starting with the big shootout at the university (""DAAAD!"") she won me over.<br/><br/>Very effective use of humour; the interruptus scene in the motel room had the audience laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>I think they overused the ""Betty calms the Hulk"" routine; I count at least three instances, possibly more.<br/><br/>The villains, however, I didn't think much of, at least in human form. Tim Roth doesn't convey much menace as Blonsky; this is one instance where the CGI creature works a lot more than the actor (among other things, and I know this is something that can't be helped, he looks like a midget standing next to Ross (ie, pretty much all his scenes)). William Hurt as Ross wasn't nearly as good as Sam Elliot, though, to be fair, the character lacks the depth the first movie gave him. The biggest problem I have with Hurt's Ross, both in terms of writing and acting, is that there's really no sense that he gives a damn about Betty beyond one or two perfunctory expressions; the real conflict in Elliot's Ross made for a much more interesting dynamic.<br/><br/>One problem with writing the Hulk and villains is that he inevitably faces them as the Hulk, rather than as Banner, and it's really, really hard to convey any continuity in what the Hulk's personality thinks from transformation to transformation, especially since his expressions in battle are always very simplistic. Lee's Hulk did a really good job of investing the conflict between Banner and the remade Absorbing Man with real weight (it just fell down in the physical aspect, which this movie delivered on).<br/><br/>Great action; in terms of the finale, they outdid Iron Man in this respect; I think this is probably the best super-brawl that's yet been filmed in live-action, though (as Ebert pointed out in his review), the lack of any real relationship between Banner and Blonsky prior to the fight means it's mainly just a big fight.<br/><br/>Excellent cameo by Stan the Man, which reminded me irresistibly of ""I Am Furious (Yellow)"".<br/><br/>I give it an 8/10."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","14 June 2008"," A roaring commercial success
","""Roaring"" is a deliberate reference to what the Hulk did, maybe a couple of times too many, in the movie.<br/><br/>As Ang Lee's version of the thinking man's Hulk a few years ago quickly proved to be lethal for the box office, Hollywood clearly thought that the green monster is too much of a golden goose to abandon. When a suitable opportunity arises with the Marvel Comic revival, they bring him back, in a one-two punch release led by Iron Man. The rest is history.<br/><br/>This current version of Hulk has ""mainstream"" and ""popular entertainment"" written all over it. Handled deftly by the filmmakers, it starts with an efficient and economical establishing sequence of montages that doubles up with the opening credit, giving you the full background (or as much as you need to know anyway) of the story. The real opening sequence starts with Bruce Banner's hideout in Brazil and ends with the US army's special squad trying to take him in. This is as exciting as anything you've seen on screen, culminating in Banner's transformation into Hulk. The rest of the movie, which I'm not going to describe here, is somewhat predictable which doesn't mean to say that it is not entertainingly exciting. Even more predictable is of course the unspoken message: keep an eye open for the sequel.<br/><br/>While not as brilliant as Iron Man, this movie scores well above passing grade in every categorie essential for a box office success, starting with one of the best actors around today  Edward Norton. The rest of the cast goes from good to adequate: (in that order) Tim Roth, William Hurt, Liv Tyler and some others. CGI is good but if you tell yourself that you have not seen better, you either watch very few movies in this genre or are deceiving yourself. Ditto for cinematography. Script (with a good sprinkle of humour), editing and sound all contribute to one single objective  making this a very entertaining comic-adapted action sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Is there anything that makes this one stand out? To me, there are two that are worth mentioning. The first is what Ebert describes as the ""City of God"" neighborhood in the opening sequences, the real thing, not CGI generated, as he intimated in his review. The movie makers have spared no pain in capturing this stunning (in more ways than one) Brazilian neighborhood in as many angles as you can imagine, panoramic as well as microscopic, sweeping as well as stationary. This is a scene that I shall remember for a long time. <br/><br/>The other thing is the character Emil Blonsky, a pure fighter in every drop of his blood, lamenting that as his experience accumulates, his body (mid-forties) deteriorates. The substance that makes Hulk what he is becomes Blonsky's salvation. In one way, we can look at the movie as pivoted on three duels between Blonsky and Banner. The first one is no contest, their first encounter in Brazil when Blonsky leads a special squad to round up Banner, only to find him turning into Hulk. But even than, Blonsky shows a fighting spirit that looks like sheer madness. The last duel, albeit the climax, is all CGI. It's the middle one that is absolutely brilliant, because it ingeniously reverses the roles of David and Goliath. Blonsky has been injected by the army with some of the substance, making him stronger, faster, but still essentially a human being in form. In this, essentially still a no-contest duel, I find myself rooting for the ""little guy"" (literally, by comparison) rather than the hero Hulk who looks a bit like big, bad and bullying. Tim Roth, Quentin Tarantino's favorite (one of them anyway), is excellent as Blonsky and deserves more credit than he seems to be been given in this movie."

People forget that though the ""Hulk"" was such as disgrace it did manage to get positive reviews from every major critic. The problem with the original is that Lee tried to make it more of a drama then a mindless action film. This new one is not mindless but it has a lot more action. The special effects are really good and that was my problem with the last one. I thought everything in the lee version was great except for the villains and the CGI.

","The ugly duckling of the MCU, and yet had the potential to turn into its swan. The Incredible Hulk is a fun watch, very different from the usual MCU fare that we're now used to in 2020. It's dark, intense, devoid of humour, and more about the man behind the Mr.Green than the Hulk itself.<br/><br/>It is not an origins story, so that is a fresh side of the story. Bruce Banner's transformation story into the Hulk is covered as part of the opening credits scene, and then we're taken on a journey of a hunted man, on the run, desperate for a cure. There's action and adversity, lots of it infact, but it's the story of Banner that drives the movie.<br/><br/>Edward Norton does a great job bringing out the stark contrast in a vulnerable Banner and the Invincible Hulk. Liv Tyler makes Betty Ross believable and the two work well together.<br/><br/>Among the side cast William Hurt's Thunderbolt Ross and Tim Roth's Blonsky's suffer from inconsistent character development but both make the most of it, making the sudden changes in motivation and characters believable to an extent.<br/><br/>What brings the film down is that after an excellent first half, we get a very generic like for like antagonist, without any backstory or reason. General Ross who plays the primary antagonist in the first half, with his ruthless, win at any cost mentality, suddenly out of nowhere turns face. All this brings down what could have been a thrilling, dark tale of both external and internal conflicts, of how Dr. Banner comes to terms with his alter ego, how the Hulk goes from America's most wanted, to be a part of the Avengers initiative, but it was not to be.<br/><br/>Taking nothing away from it, The Incredible Hulk is a fun watch, excellent in parts, and a definite and welcome departure in tone to the usual Marvel fare, but a sloppy final half brings down what could have been the MCU's shining light, because this is where, and not Iron Man before it, that we get the first hints of a larger universe being built."

Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else."

","SYNOPSIS:
Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is keeping a safe distance from the US trying to cure himself of The Hulk. Unfortunately, things don't work out as planned and something much worse comes up.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Now, I think Norton is a fantastic actor and I enjoy many of his film, but with having seen Ruffalo in the same role, Norton just seems out of place. I will say that it's definitely possible I feel this way reduce to Norton only having been in one film and Ruffalo being in more. I do remember enjoying this film more than I did this last viewing. The writing was a bit choppy and the pacing felt like a rollercoaster, especially for a film about the military wanting to find a fugitive that holds the power of becoming a giant green destroying machine. I feel it could've kept a really solid fast pace. If my opinion mattered, I'd say to either cut a lot of the love story out or just remove it completely. Another aspect that I have a qualm with in every film that does this and it's unbelievably stupid brave soldiers. By this, I don't mean intellectually the soldiers can add 2+2, but they seem to not be able to put 2 and 2 together in certain situations due to how ""brave"" they are. When you are unloading full clips of ammo into a ridiculously big green monster that is bending solid steel and it's doing absolutely nothing to it, maybe just run away or hide. It makes no sense and completely takes me out. At the very least, if this is happening, the Hulk should take out every single character shooting at him. INCLUDING Tim Roth's character. I understand Tim Roth's character plays a large role, so how about you have him do what any real person would do if that was a real situation. Then we have General Ross (William Hurt) who I can't stand. That's nothing against the film, I just can't stand him. I want to say I don't believe anyone is truly like that in the military, but I can imagine there is. Aside from all of that, I do really like Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky and Norton is good enough. I think I could see Norton as Banner/Hulk in all of the films, but it's hard to say. What really saves this film for me, is the villain and end battle scene. Abomination is one of the greatest on screen supervillains we've had to date. As far as brute force (obviously when it comes to psychological parts we know far better characters). I was also left extremely confused after the battle, however. If I said what I was confused about, that would be giving spoilers, so I'll let you watch and maybe you'll know why I was confused. At the end of the day, this is on the lower end of MCU films and just like every other not great MCU, it has potential. Unfortunately, this one falls flat for me. 6/10."

","The Incredible Hulk was the second movie to be released by Marvel as part of their then new MCU idea and after Iron Man was such a massive success fans couldn't wait to see what Marvel had in store for the new Hulk reboot and it's safe to say they didn't disappoint fans.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk has been given many different interpretations since as early as 1977 with The Incredible Hulk TV show starring (Bill Bixby) as David Banner and (Lou Ferrigno) as the green menance The Hulk after that were some animated Hulk movies and a Cartoon series that were fun to watch as a kid in the 90s then in 2003 we got a live action movie simply named Hulk starring (Eric Banner) as Bruce Banner and a CGI Hulk the movie wasn't the greatest and most audiences and fans agreed that is was pretty boring and forgetable but the action and CGI looked great especially for the early 2000s no plans for a sequal were made and The Hulk just vanished from screens once again.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk (2008) is the best standalone Hulk movie ever made Marvel took what worked in the previous movie and improved upon it the CGI is better the Hulk is much more defined and detailed and instead of telling another Hulk origin story this movie basically gets straight into the story of (Edward Nortons) character Bruce Banner in hiding from the US military trying to find a way of controlling his anger while working to figure out a cure for his Hulk problem but the government tracks him down and plans to take control of the Hulk creation leading to Banner going on the run yet again tracking down a cure.<br/><br/>I personally liked that the movie doesn't hold your hand by having to fill you in on the back story of the Hulk and gets right into what people wanna see The Hulk and not Bruce Banner in a laboratory creating The Hulk for an hour like the last movie did you get filled in on the back story a little during the opening credits but that's it and that's not a bad thing we all know who The Hulk is even if you don't know the full back story it's easy to jump into this movie and enjoy it without all the boring exposition dialogue.<br/><br/>The special effects and CGI in this movie are top quality and while later movies in the MCU like the Avengers and Thor Ragnarok have a much better looking CGI Hulk and have Mark Ruffalo playing the role of Bruce Banner and The Hulk this standalone movie set the stage for The Hulk joining the Avengers and led to The Hulk becoming a fan favourite character in the MCU.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie especially if your a comic book fan and a Hulk fan even if your not into the MCU as a whole this is a good standalone movie that helped start everything along with Iron Man."

","Marvel's second film (in what would become the MCU) definitely did not hit any of the right spots regarding either superhero's or as a general standalone film. The normally reliable Leterrier (usually helped though by Luc Besson) and writer Penn (who should just stick to stories rather than the actual screenplay) dropped us a film that overall was what can only be described at best as average. Whether this was down to budget, time contraints, switching from Paramount to Universal, I'm not too sure but after the success of Iron Man, then this version of the Hulk certainly fell very flat indeed.<br/><br/>During the opening credits we see the expirment that turned the unfortunate David Banner (Norton) into a raging green monstrosity along with the devestation he can cause, especially those closest to him. we then switch to current times as we are told he gone one hundred and fifty-eight days without 'incident', which we assume means Bruce not going all green and crazy and then destroying a city block. Banner seems to have a measure of control over his alter-ego and is able to keep him at bay. Now living in the slums district of Rio de Janeiro he is hiding from the military who want to use him for their own nefarious devices.<br/><br/>While at his place of work (a soft drink bottling factory) a minor acident causes one of these bottles to be infected with Bruce's gamma contaminated blood which just by sheer chance is destined to be shipped to the United States, compromising his current anonymity. Naturally the military find out about this and are quickly in hot pursuit of Banner which as I'm sure you can imagine, causes all sorts of mayhem for the military and those around them when Banner is eventually cornered and loses control. Emil Blonsky (Roth) is the man tasked with bringing Banner down under the command of General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a great William Hurt as always).<br/><br/>And that is pretty much the crux and gist of this version of the Incredible Hulk. Many of the action scenes are lazy and predictable...its just chase...after chase...after chase. Who seriously though watching people run around panting would make for a good film? I'm sure as hell marvel didn't but hey, they commisioned this garbage which leads me to my opening statement. Sure the MCU was still in its infancy with this second film but it's almost as if they chose not to take a big risk with it in case things did not pan out. Considering this came out in the same year as Iron Man the effects and cgi look terrible in comparison, especially Hulk himself.<br/><br/>The we get to the actual main cast. Now I'm not sure if it's Norton and that I've never really been a fan of his, or that I'm just so indotctrinated with the late Bill Bixby being the character from when I was a kid but norton just doesn't do it for me at all. a good actor indeed in the right role but here he just seems lost, out of place and alrogether wrong for the character. I think perhaps they wanted a big name to draw people in and ultimately Norton for me was just not up to the task. he doesn't even really have the 'look' of someone supposedly in his field which is difficult to explain I suppose, he just seems like he should have been a coffee shop owner, not a nuclear physist.<br/><br/>Tim Roth for me is also incredibly weak and looks out of place, like his eyes are caught in the beam of a cars headlights. And I'm sure that was not good acting with a CGI Hulk, he just permanantly appears to be wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie. Likewise as his own alter-ego, he has far too little screen time to actually make his grand entrance anything other than more chase filler. As for Liv Tyler, she is just, well, Liv Tyler really and I don't think that needs any further explanation. Thankfully she only has one real kiss scene which I'm sure is the same one she uses for every film she is in. Lovely girl, reasonable actress, just always a little bland.<br/><br/>There are also some incredibly ridiculous plot moments and inconsistencies too. I shall not go in to any real detail but suffice to say at times (even for a comic book movie) I was left thinking 'what the actual' as the film rolled before my eyes. So is there actually anything good about The Incredible Hulk? The only two redeemable features that immediately spring to mind are the great Lou Ferigno in a security guard cameo role (and it's always great to see the man, he is just awesome) and some of the background music. It says a lot when the highlight of the film for me was seeing Banner walking in the rain along the side of the road with the old closing credits theme tune from the old television series. Lovely nod to the past.<br/><br/>So with that there really is not a lot more than can be said about this film. As stated previously, average at best for a either a general film or a superhero film. Not terribly exciting and very predictable. Norton was subsequently replaced and rarely that the events of this film are referenced later on in the universe says much. For a fan of the series then it's sure to be watched, but you will forget about it as quickly as the rest of the MCU seems to have done. Very below par for what Marvel is actually capable of.<br/><br/>

"Manveer_Mathur","7","0","0","9 March 2020"," The Forgotten MCU Movie!
","Contrary to popular belief, The Incredible Hulk is very much a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the MCU. The fact is that this is the lowest earning movie within the MCU and not had not been received well by critics and audience alike. A lot of people choose to ignore the existence of Ed Norton's Hulk which is why this movie could as well be called the ""The Forgotten MCU Movie"". In my opinion, this film was far from being a complete disaster and did manage to hit a lot of right notes. For example ,the portrayal of Bruce Banner's adversaries and his struggles to keep the Hulk at bay should be appreciated. Ed Norton ,being the commendable actor he is, did a good enough job playing Bruce Banner. We even get to see Hulk at his peak power while battling Abomination ,which we have yet to see with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. So why did the movie not work? Before the final battle which would peak the interest of any movie watcher, the rest of the film is fairly conventional and predictable and the plot doesn't have a lot to offer besides showing Bruce running away from the military and fighting tanks and soldiers.
Still, a couple of mentions about S.H.I.E.L.D and a Tony Stark cameo in the end confirm that it was intended to be the second installment in the MCU, right after the release of Iron Man. Ed Norton wasn't interested in playing the character for long and that is why Mark Ruffalo was brought in and the rest is history. Nonetheless, The incredible Hulk is still one of the better Hulk movies ever made and is entertaining enough to be a good watch."

","The forgotten movie of the MCU!<br/><br/>Either through the replacement of Edward Norton with Mark Ruffalo or the darker tone/setting this film seems to be the one people ignore in their trip through the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>I saw this in 2008 hot off the heels of Iron Man, and I was not disappointed! What a summer blockbuster! At the time it fit well into expanding the MCU, having a tonal shift from Iron Man made perfect sense fitting the character of The Hulk.<br/><br/>With 2020 vision; the CGI isnt quite what I rembered it being (I was in awe in 2008 of the Hulk after previously only seeing Ang Lee's Abomination). But irrespective, it does not hurt the films action sequences.<br/><br/>Speaking of action! The college campus scene is the standout, followed by the slums in Brazil. Both great sequences!<br/><br/>The last fight in Harlem is a CGI mash up, not bad, but not the most engaging sequence the film has. It has a predictable outcome, that set up the future of The Hulk that never happend!<br/><br/>Let's look at casting;<br/><br/>Roth as Blonksy is inspired. He comes across as a psychotic soldier, turned into an anti-hulk. It's a shame he hasn't been brought back into the fold. He was clearly set up for being in The Hulks future.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler plays the love interest well. She adds a subtext that serves the Banner character well in motivation. Bruce is a tragic figure, having this matched the tone the film was looking for. Again a shame she hasn't played a part in the future of the MCU. No Norton = no Tyler.<br/><br/>General Ross is perfectly cast and makes his return as the Thunderbolt later in the MCU and rightfully so! He is the antagonist of Banner, and plays the obsessive General brilliantly. Their relationship could have been better later on, but is ignored primarily because this film is!<br/><br/>Edward Norton as Bruce Banner...
The controversy! I enjoyed Norton as Banner, he played the quiet introvert aspect better than Ruffalo does.
Ruffalo brings the tragedy of the character out through comedy in comparison to Norton being melancholic.
Now... I would have been happy with a continuation of Norton but at the same time am happy it ended up being Ruffalo, whom could have easily starred in this film. Overall the tonal shift of the MCU fits Ruffalo better.<br/><br/>Do not miss this film. It sits in the MCU where it should and plays it's part! It introduces the super solider syrum, carrys on The Avengers tease, expands the universe and has some nice Stark Enterprises easter eggs! It is there to be enjoyed and too its credit, is entertaining in its execution."

The last time that people saw the Hulk on the big screen was way back in 2003 and people were not entirely impressed. While this is an MCU film, it has a completely different tone. It has a much darker tone to it. The story itself follows Bruce Banner who is in hiding from the US government while also trying to find a cure for his condition. Yeah, nothing spectacular but it was not badly done. The acting was good, and the action scenes were also good. Even the CGI was pretty good. What this film lacks is the ability to be rememberable. Maybe it is because this film does not have Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner or it has a different tone than any other MCU film. Whatever it is, I will not be remembering this film years and years from now. Not that it is a bad film, it actually is a good film.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2008. The movie is directed by Louis Leterrier, written by Zak Penn, and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. The movie is based on the character The Hulk created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The movie follows Bruce Banner as he becomes The Hulk and hides as a fugitive from the United States military.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk has a muddled story. The story is not as straightforward as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie of Iron Man. This movie has many problems in its narrative that shows in the story's structure. The movie jumps around in time and it makes it hard for the audience to care about Bruce Banner. None of the characters matter except for Bruce Banner. It is clear in this movie that the focus is only on Bruce Banner and the world is not as interesting as it was in Iron Man.<br/><br/>Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner. I enjoyed his performance in this movie as he goes from fugitive to hero. I was happy to see that Edward Norton made Bruce Banner out to be a scientist rather than the destructive Hulk that he has.<br/><br/>The action computer generated graphics is clear to the audience. The exposed computer generated imagery made for a rough experience as the action scenes did not have much weight to it. I felt that this was the movie's poor trait as the movie failed to have the action in the movie mean something. The action is still pretty and fun to look at but it failed to impress the audience from a story stand-point.<br/><br/>I would still recommend 'The Incredible Hulk'. Although there are problems in its story, the movie is still entertaining to watch and can keep the audience's interest for the 112 minutes of running time.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

The emotional connection is lost, and Edward Norton's Hulk looks neither impressive or anything like his comic origins, with the CGI noticeably less impressive than the 2003 monster that was both terrifying, immensely strong, and had an authentic emotional bond to the story.

Edward Norton does a worthy Job of Bruce Banner and his love interest Betty Ross Liv Tyler shows nice chemistry. You feel the emotional depth of seperation and loneliness for Bruce. You can empathise with his loneliness and issues of contamination due to the gamma radiation as he is hunted down by general thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is harmless, intelligent, reserved and condemned from society to an extent worried about anger and rage and how to prevent this. His only friend at first is online in the name of Mr Blue. Somebody he has never even met. The imprint of what modern society has become in some cases of today world. He goes about a general warehouse job in isolation trying to keep what's inside at bay. Tim Roth plays one of the army soldiers trying to take out the Hulk and ultimately becomes the Abomination. We can see the transformation in Tim Roth as he manages what's inside and the inevitability of it taking over. Although even before, he had a taste for destruction. Emulating parts of the King Kong story and how the general refuses to see anything but a monster inside the Hulk. General thunderbolt Ross has an obsession with weaponising the gamma radiation incident by injecting it out of Banner. Only his daughter can see more to the Hulk and who he truly is inside, Bruce Banner. But her father believes she is blinded by love and not thinking clear."

","I decided to refresh memories about all films MCU reviews on them. And today is the turn of the loudest, the meanest and greenest hero - Hulk.
The film was released in the same year as the first Iron Man, but was not received as warmly. Box office failure and defeat from critics followed. Part of the movie deserved it. Weak plot and dynamics - general characteristics of the movies of the Hulk. There was also very little action, always a hallmark of the green giant. Yes and no villain points clearly not added. But the Incredible Hulk has its advantages, and the main, in my opinion, of them - Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.
Yes, Bruce banner and Betty Ross in their performance came out slightly cardboard, but that's the fault of the weak script, not the actors themselves. Norton and Tyler got the best they could out of him. When you look at them, you believe they love each other, but there will always be the Hulk between them. I also liked General Ross, played by William hurt. I really hope to see the Red Hulk someday. And Stan Lee, as always, is beautiful. And after the credits, Tony stark appears.
The film as a whole is worthy of viewing. Hopefully, we'll see more solo films about the Hulk."

","Many people will agree that this is the worst Film in the MCU.... that's probably not wrong, BUT it defintely as bad as the wrap it gets. This was the second film of the franchise and it just didn't quite hit home obviously the antagonist of stories are huge parts and can make or break them. This film Bruce Banners' antagonist works for me with General Ross liked the character and his firm military always getting in the way. The Hulks' antagonist is for me where this film fell apart a younger version of Ross out for power just didn't live up for me. I would love to see Betty Ross make a comeback in the MCU, although that may never happen it was nice to see General Ross make it back to drive a knife through Tony and Capt in Civil war! Obviously there is still loads they could do with Ross's character and with Talbot showing up in Agents of Shield another Hulk film would be great to have Ross, Betty, Talbot, and Banner all in the mix. Likely we will just have to love the Hulk and forget about the Bruce Banner character, but at the end of the day MORE HULK is never a bad thing. You can also tell this Film didn't have that Marvel feel to it. The humor wasn't there it had a more end of the world vibe. The savor for this movie to me was actually the Hulk! Hulk Smash and the hand clap heard around the world were incredible and his interactions with Betty. Also the lightning scene in the cave!? The only thing I could think of is all the Hulk and Thor scenes we get as the franchise builds! This probably will always be considered the worst film in the MCU and that probably will be true but it was Marvel working out the kinks in the greatest movie franchise ever!"

","This early entry in the Marvel Universe is not quite as smoothly executed as its brethren. Perhaps it's that the formula wasn't quite as established at this point, but director Louis Leterrier seems a bit lost at the helm. His shots are impressive from a technical point of view but he has trouble with narrative flow and momentum, and the editing is choppy to the point of distraction. Additionally, Edward Norton is typically a strong actor but he's miscast here as Bruce Banner: There's no levity to his performance, it's all furrowed brows and pained looks, and he has little chemistry with Liv Tyler so their central romance fall flat. The movie also has a tendency to abandon many of its characters along the way, like Norton's dog and Tyler's fiance Ty Burrell, and main villain Tim Roth comes off more insufferable than menacing. It's not that the movie is bad per se, it's just that it's underwhelming, particularly when compared to its immediate predecessor, ""Iron Man,"" and the whole thing feels like it needed to be cooked longer. As it is, it has its moments, including a great scene at a university campus, but it's not without its flaws."

","It Is Obvious that the Hulk of 2003 was a film that many considered weak.
Hulk of 2008, instead, We Have a good interpretation of Edward Norton as a man who desperately does not want to become the Hulk, and goes to Brazil to study under a control of the breath to control his anger, and not become the Green Man, Shrek (?. And we have Liv Tyler in the midst of shaky sympathy. Banner's Brazilian stay begins with an astonishing shot: from an aerial point of view, we fly higher and higher above one of the River hills, seeing hundreds, thousands of small houses built on top of each other, all scratching air.
This is the ""City of God."" In the neighborhood, and as far as I could see, we're seeing the real, not CGI. The director lets the filming run longer than any reasonable requirement of the plot; My bet is that he was as astonished as I am. And let it run because it's incredibly amazing. The scenes involving Banner in Brazil are well conceived, although when it accidentally contaminates a bottled soda with its blood, the film does not really deal with the consequences when consuming the drink. United States. The contamination gives general Ross his clue to the whereabouts of Banner, and Army troops raze the hell of the City of God; Throughout the film, the general deploys his power of fire so recklessly that one wonders if he has a superior. , and if you ever have to account for the dozens, hundreds, thousands, who die while your boys are shooting at the Hulk without any favorable effect.
Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a marine that general Ross recruits because he is more cruel and deadly than anyone. Blonsky leads the chase in Rio. Later, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), associate researcher of Banner, is forced to inject a little juice from Hulkie to Blonsky, preparing a titanic battle on the roof of Harlem between Hulk and Blonsky. And This battle, as I have suggested, is waged relentlessly, taking as our first victim our patience. ""Iron Man"", the best spiritual Companion of this film, also ends with a clash between an original and a copycat, but involves two opponents who know who they are and why they are fighting.
When you put yourself to it, like a fictitious creature, the Incredible Hulk is as limited as a bad drunk. It Can be fun to be around when You're sober, but when You drink too much, You feel sorry for the boy.
By changes, the Hulk of 2008 is an improvement of the 2003, yes, but good movie? Well... No: C but it's decent. 3/5."

It's definitely one of the weakest MCU efforts, but it's not bad. Edward Norton is decent as Bruce Banner, and Tim Roth is good in his role.

","This is the marvel movie that marvel longs to forget. I however do not understand why. This movie felt like any other superhero movie and like other superhero movies always seems to have the same faults. <br/><br/>This movie, like other Marvel movies, has a problem with its villain. The villain is lazily thrown in there and comes out of nowhere. It turned one of the military men who are chasing after The Hulk into another huge green monster with little explanation as to why. The villain did not have really any character development and as a result, it was hard to feel an accomplishment from the overcoming of the villain.<br/><br/>One thing that Marvel movies usually exceed at are fight scenes and this movie is not any different. In short Hulk is a beast that pretty much destroys everything he touches and it is very visual pleasing. It was entertaining.<br/><br/>I can see why Marvel might be a little embarrassed by this movie, but there is no real reason to almost completely ignore it as a whole. Sure it has it's flaws, but overall was an entertaining film to pass the time.

This movie is filled with suspense and tension as Bruce Banner, played sombrely by Edward Norton, is on the run.

This movie opens up a can of worms to things that are never answered, such as what ever happened to Betty in future Marvel films?

How would it look if a new guy took the place of Chris Evans (Captain America) and appeared in the next film wearing a Union Jack?<br/><br/>When a new film is released in the MCU I like to rewatch films relating to that franchise.
E.G. before I saw Thor Ragnarok at the cinema I rewatched Thor, Avengers Assemble, Thor The Dark World and Avengers Age of Ultron. Bruce Banner is a big player in Thor Ragnarok too, and I saw the two Avengers films as catching up on him at the same time.

But what I am truly disappointed about is that there hasn't been a sequel, and I don't understand why that is considering how popular ""The Incredible Hulk"" is in the Marvel Universe. It's getting to the point where it's pretty embarrassing considering the ending we were given. When I saw the ending, I was actually excited and waiting for the ""sequel"" to come, but that hasn't happened since, and probably never will. It's five years too late for my liking. I'm not happy since this movie looks wasteful. It looks like The Incredible Hulk had the easy ride or something compared to his other superhero counterparts. The Incredible Hulk is a superhero which many people or fans like. Someone such as Iron Man and Captain America had three movies; The Incredible Hulk has only one movie to show.

","This movie starts off in strong with Bruce Banner in Brazil. The two last scenes in Brazil are two strong points in the film. There's chase that involves Bruce Banner, and a fight between the hulk and some soldiers that is actually kind of scary. After the movie leaves Brazil a chunk of quality leaves the movie as well. Basically the movie can outlined by saying that most of it is kind flat and slightly boring, but is buoyed by an awesome Hulk action scene in each act. The most successful part of this film is definitely the action. While the hulk design is good his CGI when in broad daylight doesn't hold up as well as the CGI in Iron Man. It hasn't aged well, but there's still a good sense of weight to the hulk that matters the most when it comes to making him feel dangerous, which he does. The final fight between The Hulk and Abomination still remains one of the top action sequences in all comic book movies in my opinion. The big and full of destruction with CGI that does hold up well and doesn't take you out of the movie. The Abomination remains one of the top 5 marvel villains. He's mean, powerful, and a menacing threat that succeeds as a villain. The love story between Bruce and Elizabeth Ross doesn't work at all. Liv Tyler is so unbelievably bad in it, and she really brings down the movies overall quality. Ed Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, nor good or bad he just fills the role. Every scene Bruce and Roth share weighs the movie down. Leaving you just waiting for the next action scene to come, which again are great. Overall, The Incredible Hulk succeeds in Action, and the hulk himself, but fails to make the scenes without him engaging, and a love interest who works as a quality vacuum. So I give it a 7.1"

","The Edward Norton version of The Incredible Hulk is a lost nugget in the MCU. As a stand-alone film, it does more to connect the universe than any Avengers film when you consider all the references to the Avengers, yet it's one of the more forgettable films in the MCU. And it's not because it's a bad film-because it's not. It's because this isn't the Hulk that Mark Ruffalo embodied and turned into the fun-loving brute with anger management problems that we've all come to love. This is The Incredible Hulk as envisioned by a producer at DC, not Marvel-dark, brooding, yet competently executed. It's entertaining, just not memorable.<br/><br/>The film starts in South America, with Banner in hiding, mastering breathing techniques from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighters and working at a bottle factory. He works with a band of scummy warehouse workers who sexually harass their co-workers and taunt him. Of course, they're just props for the Hulk to justifiably smash in between social messaging a scientist who is supposed to help him find a cure. Of course, Banner can't take a leak without the government tracking his scent, and the mad dog sent to track him is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), an angry Black-Ops guy with age insecurities. Luckily, the government just happens to have some of that handy Captain America super-soldier serum to give him, and unlike Rogers, the serum amplifies Blonsky's worst attributes. When Blonsky attempts to go one-on-one with the green one, and it ends with nearly catastrophic results for Blonsky. So note to Cap, don't fight don't Hulk. Leave that to Thor. Liv Tyler stars as Banner's estranged lover, Betty Ross, the daughter of the stone-faced general Admiral Ross, that's hunting the Hulk. She's completely wasted as a whispery and dotting ex who seems to serve the male gaze and not explore Liv's talents as an actress.<br/><br/>The film boasts some thrilling action sequences, so it has that going for it. The first battle between the military and the Hulk is fast, hard-hitting and badass. It's a huge improvement over the Ang Lee version that lulled audiences to sleep with psychedelic colors, mutant dogs, and real-life comic book frames that played out simultaneously to confuse everyone. No, this film doesn't make that mistake; it makes new mistakes. <br/><br/>Instead of building off of Blonsky as a human super soldier threat, they decide the only way he can battle the Hulk, is as a Hulk, or as comic book fans know him-Abomination. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the creation of Abomination happened earlier and presented an increasingly difficult challenge for the Hulk. At no point do you ever feel like the Hulk might lose? Abomination is literally a throw-away character that even Marvel chooses to forget about when it comes to the MCU. Toss in the dark and muddy tone of the film, and you have yourself just a run of the mill smash 'em up film in New York. But if that's what you came for, then this is a smashing good time."

Hurt and Tyler while good actors, feel like they're given nothing to work with, and Roth's character is written oddly.

Current and former military personnel will have to find a way to ignore a number of things that are obviously not right, such as exclusive use of uniforms (woodland BDU's) that were phased out of use by the time the movie was released (2008), and curious wear of those, such as only having name tapes but no service tapes ('U.S. ARMY') sewn on and flagrant violations of the grooming standards we're used to. Helicopters marked 'USAF' rather than 'United States Air Force' would be another oddity many will notice.

In the favelas of Brazil, Banner works to keep his inner monster under control with a series of meditations. He works at a bottling factory, studies the language, and tries to lay low but when a drop of his blood accidentally spills in a bottle, it triggers General Ross and his hunting party. A new member of his squad, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) takes a more ruthless approach to the pursuit but is stunned when he confronts the Hulk in a bottling factory.

","Yeah, you heard me better than the first one. As I have mentioned in my review in The Hulk. It had terrible special effects and bad acting this one changes all of that because the new actors did better and it wasn't just some cheesy special effects but more realistic. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is the fight between The Hulk and the Abomination. However what never made any sense was why was Tony Stark talking to General Ross in the post-credits. The overall good movie though."
"jhudson-11704","7","0","0","27 July 2017"," How are you feeling? Like a monster.
","When this movie came out, practically no one knew this existed in the same universe as Iron Man. There are clear signs in the opening credits with quick mentions of Stark Industries and Nick Fury. People in theaters didn't know that you were supposed to stay after the credits for the post-credits scene. Thanks to this movie, the Avengers wasn't just a dream, it was a possibility. Besides this, the movie itself was actually decent. Not great, not bad, just watchable.<br/><br/>Let's first focus on the big man himself, Bruce Banner/Hulk. I really liked Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Banner in the comics, is drawn as a really small, unassuming man. Norton did a great job because he did look frail, yet very smart. His version of the Hulk is clearly better than 2003 and actually looks threatening and powerful. His strength is very clear, with his muscles and veins popping out and the clear sense of rage that is fueling him, rather than Ang Lee's version. <br/><br/>The villain in the film is Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky/Abomination. Despite his final form just being a evil, reptilian version of the Hulk, his development was very good. An aging soldier, wanting to continue to fight, taking a experimental serum and getting more and more insane and rebellious. Roth is an incredible actor, who I loved in Tarantino films, and he expertly portrays the crazed fighter who wants to get the job done.<br/><br/>The action was a lot better with the Hulk fighting off the army as well as his final duel with the Abomination. Seeing the Hulk destroy a car to use as boxing gloves was awesome. The tone in this movie was well done as well as we could feel the desperation, fear and insecurity that Banner felt throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There were obviously aspects in this movie that I didn't like. First off, Samuel Sterns. A great character in the comics and a tremendous villain that can be used in the MCU. However, thanks to the restrictive terms by Universal Pictures, it looks like he won't be coming around which is a shame because Tim Blake Nelson was good as a wacko doctor. I also wasn't a big fan of Liv Tyler's Betty Ross. While she was undoubtedly better than 2003's Jennifer Connelly, who forgot to portray any emotion, I didn't really feel any chemistry between her and Bruce. Tyler is a good actress, like in LotR, but I still felt that she could've been better in this film. <br/><br/>+ Norton's Banner/Hulk + Roth's Blonsky/Abomination + Overall Tone and Action + Connection to Iron Man and confirms shared universe - Universal Pictures total control over character rights - Love interest lacking<br/><br/>7.4/10"

It was supposed to be the next big movie in the franchise, but instead, it was a letdown. There still were good parts like Ed Norton, and William Hurt. The story was at least a little interesting. The Hulk scenes are cool to see. Sometimes, I have fun watching this, but other times I can't. The music intensifies the action scenes, so that's good. Overall, it's not a terrible movie.

","Summary: G.I. D'oh *** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk (2008) is by no means a bad movie, but there are too many moments where I found myself unconvinced, or even confused, by what the characters were trying to accomplish. As the second entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film does something unique by not concentrating on the origins of the titular character, but that decision ultimately leaves too much confusion and fluff in the main plot.<br/><br/>That's not to say I disagree with this decision, as the creation of a mad green monster is a well- played movie trope that I'm am a bit glad they avoided (a trope most likely originating from Frankenstein, in which the original cinematic production creations an excellent creature). The problem with the film lies in what is actually on the screen, which in my opinion are a lot of nonsensical decisions.<br/><br/>The beginning search for a government project gone awry becomes too much of a concentration that comes off as a Jason Bourne movie instead of a concentration on who the character actually is. This problem may arise from the way I view Thunderbolt Ross, played by William Hurt, who seems too one-dimensional and obliviously ill-advised in his attempt to recreate green super soldiers who just seem so uncontrollable. In other words, by jumping immediately into action spy- thriller style, Ross seems unconvincing and that leaves little time to develop his character with any doubt to his own motives, something that worked so well in Iron Man.<br/><br/>Similarly, mercenary soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) seems like none other than a blockhead, and it's hard to relate to a character who stands toe-to-toe with a megaton creature like the Hulk who merely shakes his head with ""Is that all you got?"" Ross' lack of reigning in Blonsky just seems like another example of bad life choices in this movie. Finally, as far as negatives, While I like Liv Tyler, I found her romance as Betty Ross with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) rather flat, again amplified by Thunderbolt Ross' lack of empathy for her situation when it seems very clear rather early that Banner is not a bad guy.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that I enjoyed some things about this movie. I felt that Norton does a decent job as Banner/The Hulk, providing some seriousness to the role, albeit maybe too serious at times. Second, the cinematography was very well-done, especially the scenes in Brazil. Finally, while the film lacks emotional chemistry, an exception to this is ironically with the CGI; some of the most emotive scenes occur when Banner's alter ego comes out and I would liken this to Andy Serkis' work, notable in Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>All in all, this film provides a credible Hulk but I feel like I still needed more convincing given the excellent cast, so I give it 2 out of 4 smashes."

","The truth is that the Hulk character never had a good adaptation, above all, The Incredible Hulk and best of all, the film has a cool soundtrack, the visual effects are good, the cast is good, we have the excellent Edward Norton, the action scenes Hulk vs the army is good, plus the script does not make sense to the universe of Marvel since it simply does not explain anything in the Avengers movie like this film does not exist, for example, at the end of the film to understand that Bruce banner had finally managed to control the Hulk, the more the film is that the Avengers does not control, I found a giant script error scenes in Brazil are reasonable, and the film tries to be too dramatic, the director can not very well dispense with the movie, the final fight Hulk vs Abomination is good one of the cinematic universe of Marvel better, Edward Norton in my opinion made a hulk better than Mark Ruffalo, the film can be tiring sometimes, and the incredible Hulk is not a worthy adaptation of the Hulk deserves more but it is greater than the Ang Lee and have a good time.

"NeverEndr","6","0","0","17 April 2016"," Quickly Descends into Mindless Summer Movie Madness
","This movie begins pretty strongly but quickly descends into mindless summer movie madness. Dr. Banner (played by Edward Norton) is hiding out in Brazil, in the beginning, being taught breathing exercises to control his anger which is actually pretty interesting. The opening Hulk scene is also really memorable by delivering the Hulk in more of a monstrous fashion rather than some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film. As the movie goes on, however, it seems to dumb itself down more and more. We are given a damsel-in-distress performance by Liv Tyler as Banner's lost love...who is introduced as being involved with another man which doesn't seem to do anything but serve as a plot point. We are given the stereotypical ""bad military man"" chasing Banner with an unmemorable performance from Hurt. Worst of all, we are given an inexplicably suicidal merc who wants to confront the monstrous Hulk for nothing more than a seeming adrenaline rush. This reaches absurdity when, at one point in the film, this elite military veteran becomes so brazen as to confront the Hulk, weaponless (he literally throws his rifle away), goading him on. Even with all of the bad aspects, the movie does do a good job of remaining fun. The Hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a Hulk movie. Norton also does a decent job of playing Dr. Banner. Even Tyler's performance works some scenes were being the damsel in distress really fits (such as a cave scene during a storm midway through the film). Overall, this is a movie that is enjoyable for fans of comic book films or the Hulk, but doesn't really deliver enough to be memorable for a more neutral movie goer."
"troyputland","7","0","0","28 March 2016"," Incredible, not incredible?
","It boils down to this: what makes The Incredible Hulk incredible? Is it the newly appointed Edward Norton? Or love-interest Liv Tyler? Actually, it loses out on incredible credibility, as Norton's Bruce Banner chooses to flee rather than fight. He's a passive man on the run from the U.S. Army, looking for a cure. His ability to change in to a raging muscle-man is what they want. <br/><br/>TIH covers the origin story in the opening credits (sensible move, we've seen it before with Ang Lee's The Hulk). Banner's brute only surfaces when the army won't leave him be. Leave him alone they do not, as they crunch the middle act in to overdrive. Super- human military nut-job Tim Roth makes a cool central villain (the showdown is glorious). Tyler trades whimsical damsel for astute catalyst. It's our second helping on the lead-up to an Avengers movie. Leterrier's effort is a noble one, as Marvel know what direction they're heading. And did anyone think that Norton would make a fine Banner? I didn't see that one coming."

","A lot of scenes left me and my friend shaking our heads or laughing... and not because they were trying to be funny. Most notably, Liv Tyler repeatedly says Bruce's name in a breathy voice that became laughable. She seems to try too hard to act the calm presence, and it doesn't come off quite right. Ed Norton doesn't seem to fit the part of the Hulk either - maybe because he has too many bad boy roles in his past to get over in order to see him as a super hero. Predictable storyline, less than decent acting/writing - sadly, not to the quality of the current Marvel movies or TV series (namely Captain America, Avengers, Arrow). It was interesting to get more background on the Hulk, but overall a B- movie."

He manage to portrayed a troubled scientist fighting his own inner demon. Second, you gotta respect the movie for starting the MCU. Yeah people maybe forgot but it wasn't Iron Man who started it all. It was this film. Now the best part of the movie itself. Hulk vs Abomination Battle at Harlem. It was one of the best duel in all of Marvel films.

","""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" delivers the melodramatic thrills and chills conspicuously lacking in Ang Lee's self-conscious, brooding, tragic predecessor. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana. Ironically, Norton turned the role before Bana took it. Mind you, Norton is an exceptional actor, but he is basically miscast. Simply said, he doesn't look appropriate for the role of an action hero. Meantime, Mark Ruffalo qualifies as the cinema's best Hulk. Meantime, Bana was a better fit, but Norton is not without sympathy. Norton's Banner is a fugitive on the lam. If you have forgotten Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" Leterrier and Pen use the opening titles to retell the origins of the Hulk in the laboratory. Hardcore Hulk fans may not like this departure from the Marvel canon. The original ""Hulk"" movie followed the same strategy of orchestrating the transformation in a lab.<br/><br/>As the action unfolds, Leterrier and ""Elektra"" scenarist Zac Penn have our intelligent hero hiding out in Brazil and slumming as an employee at a dilapidated soda bottle plant. Bruce is their jack-of-all-trades handy man, and his ability to fix things is what gets him into trouble. After repairing a mechanism, he nicks a finger, and droplets of his blood stain the conveyor belt and contaminate one bottle. Clearly, quality control is not a strong point at this factory. When our hero isn't working in the factory, he communicates via the Internet with Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson of ""The Astronaut Farmer""), and they struggle to discover a cure. Of course, nothing works for Bruce. At the same time, Bruce is taking lessons from a martial arts mentor about how to control his rage. He wears a watch that monitors his pulse and develops deep-breathing from the diaphragm to curb his rage. Eventually, after that tainted bottle of Pingo Doce reaches America, an ordinary guy (""Hulk"" co-creator Stan Lee) in Milwaukee experiences a reaction to it, and General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt of ""Altered States"") assembles a team led by an elite commando, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Reservoir Dogs""), who is locked and loaded for combat. Blonsky and his team fly into Brazil and narrowly miss capturing Banner. Banner's mongrel dog awakens him in time for him to make his escape. Ross congratulates Blonsky for a good job, but Blonsky wants to take another crack at the monstrous green thing he encountered in the factory. ""It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball,"" he tells Ross. Banner makes his way up through Central America and reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler of ""Armageddon""), and Ross is on his trail again. This time Blonsky and his team are prepared better when they tangle with the Hulk on the Culver University campus. Betty tries to convince Bruce to turn himself over to her father. Bruce points out that Ross wants what is in him and will sacrifice him to extract his DNA to forge an army of super soldiers. Bruce reminds Betty that he wants to find a cure. Again, Ross wants to create super soldiers with Bruce's super strength and agility.<br/><br/>For the record, Banner transforms into the Hulk at about 23 minutes into ""The Incredible Hulk."" Leterrier stages some reasonably good action scenes. Ultimately, the Penn screenplay boils down to a chase thriller that concludes face to face showdown like an old fashioned western between Banner and Blonsky. Tim Roth makes a terrific adversary, but the final confrontation suffers because you know it is just a clash of CGI titans. Liv Tyler and William Hurt are serviceable as Banner's girlfriend and another of his adversaries. You can get your quotient of blood, gore, and violence out of this PG-13 epic."

","For some reason, The Hulk never had a great film of his very own, prior to this. The older films have not aged well. 2003's Hulk had its moments, but was inundated with style and storytelling choices that made it less palatable. Coming out at the very forefront of Marvel's Phase I wave, The Incredible Hulk follows the Hulk on his next logical step after fleeing the military and hiding out, only to have the past catch up to him again.<br/><br/>The bulk of this story revolves around Bruce Banner's continuing struggle to control his own power, which in turn correlates to his inner struggle with emotions and rage. Inevitably, he loses control a few times, resulting in several scenes of mass carnage. When the Hulk busts loose, he goes on to toss cars and bash buildings with impunity. The rampage in the university campus is probably the coolest scene, as the military pulls out sonic weapons while the Hulk bashes up hum-vees into tiny pieces. It all builds up to a lengthy city battle, where the Hulk clashes with a more monstrous opponent; their battle rips up the streets and causes so much carnage, it's incredible.<br/><br/>While there is definitely enough action to satiate action fans, the film evens itself out by occasionally focusing on the characters as they go on the run and connect the dots. Bruce Banner proves to be a compelling character that we can empathize with and root for; he's quite the sight when he hulks out and smashes things, but it's also touching to watch him temper the beast and try to set things right. His relationship with Betty is also touching, and the two form a very nice Beauty and the Beast type of relationship. All the bad guys are pretty one-dimensional. The plot breezes through several exotic locations before settling on the finale; it's not necessarily a great story, but the characters and action keep it fresh.<br/><br/>This film boasts splendid, colorful photography and solid editing. Acting seemed great at the time, for the cast is very notable. Edward Norton is a guy I enjoy watching; he looks rather scrawny when compared to other Hulk actors, but his performance isn't too terrible. I've always had a soft spot for Liv Tyler and William Hurt. Tim Roth is appropriately mean-spirited in his role. Writing is generally okay. This production uses good-looking locales, sets, props, and costumes. Special effects seemed really cool at the time, but haven't all aged well. Music is okay.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a perfectly enjoyable romp, but with quality characterization and a slick style that makes it one of the best by far.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"

","This is sort of the Jan Brady of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It doesn't reach the dizzying heights of 'Iron Man', 'The Avengers' or 'Captain America: Winter Soldier', but it's also not as languid and shrugtacular as 'Iron Man 3' or 'Thor: The Dark World'.<br/><br/>Edward Norton makes for a solid Bruce Banner in this man-on-the-run format, but I think Ruffalo is a better fit for 'The Avengers'. The Hulk himself still doesn't always appear photo-real here, and the re-design--where you can almost smell the Bead Head pomade in his artfully unkempt hair--left him looking like a giant green Hot Topic employee. The biggest problem, however, is that it all feels inconsequential.<br/><br/>It plays its role in the set-up for 'The Avengers', and it's moderately entertaining to boot."

","This is a Hulk movie I was looking forward and that is not only because I think Edward Norton is the perfect Bruce Banner and upset that he wasn't in ""The Avengers"" and the sequel. The direction this time is fast-paced and entertaining. And the only disappointment I can think of is that it just wasn't all that satisfying when the credits started rolling. It seemed like the movie needed a bit more of Hulk or something. However there is a more standout villain this time with Tim Roth who is this tough as nails bad-ass soldier. Seriously, he tries to take on the Hulk and actually lasts a while. Sometimes superhero movies need a standout villain to keep the momentum going. However I preferred Sam Elliott as Commander Ross over William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly over Liv Tyler as Betty. But that doesn't effect this movie all that much in that it has Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. The CGI is much better this time and Hulk doesn't look like some sort of green clay monster. Hickson Gracie making a appearance was a nice touch as well. Débora Nascimento is hot, whoever she is, it would have been awesome if she played a bit more into the story.

","I'm not a Marvel fanatic, but I enjoy the genre generally as good entertainment. However, this one has Ed Norton (an awesome actor) and Liv Tyler - beautiful and talented. I love their chemistry together and Ed Norton is by far the most believable Hulk. I like the CGI and SFX in this and whilst they are cartoon-ishly overblown in places it's all appropriate as it's Marvel. Tim Roth as the adversary is good; because he's not a normal and obvious choice for an action anti-hero, but then nor is Norton. Liv Tyler's gentle way is a perfect choice and believable as the subject of his undying love.<br/><br/>I like that Hulk, is a love story as well as hot action. It is tender and moving, and also funny. There's lots of physical humour, and the Hulk - although suffering with serious anger management issues - is likable and really rather cute.<br/><br/>You'd expect this sort of film to be just for the boys but there is plenty for (non-fan-girl) girls too. That said, there are also plenty of comic references for die hard fans to enjoy. Marvel aside, it's still a good fantasy/sci-fi film. I have to ask though, what is it with mad scientists?!"

","""Don't make me hungry you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry"" – Bruce Banner (in mispronounced Portuguese)<br/><br/>Summer 2008 gave birth to one of the greatest films of all time based on a comic book character named Bruce, and arguably one of the greatest films of all time, period. Unfortunately for Banner, it was Wayne who took the plaudits. Nonetheless, The Incredible Hulk is an important cog in the mechanics of Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble, and is a throwback to the original superhero cinema venture, something which films like The Dark Knight have tried to veer away from in recent years.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner's back-story is hurriedly introduced before we catch up with the fugitive in a Brazilian favela, working at bottling factory. Mistakenly contaminating a luminous green drinks bottle with his radioactive blood, Banner is placed on the US government's radar, and after a brief encounter with the ""big guy"", veteran soldier Emil Blonsky (Roth) decides he will be the man to tame the beast, and will do whatever it takes to succeed. Compromised Banner travels back to the USA and reunites with his former lover, Betty Ross (Tyler), in search of a cure for his condition.<br/><br/>Folks, grab some popcorn, a few bottles of beer/ glasses of wine, dim the lights and put your feet up after a hard day's work. The Incredible Hulk is not out there to challenge your original conceptions about the superhero genre, or blow you into submission by introducing a vast array of characters and settings. What it is going to do is treat you to a quarter-pounder of carnage and relentless action, with a side-salad of romance, which serves the purpose of garnishing this meaty venture of action with a softer side, the Bruce Banner side, if you will. Don't get me wrong, there isn't much depth at all to the film, and it doesn't reach many high points, but doesn't suffer many lows either.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is excellent as Banner. I'm always compelled by his performances, and hold him in high regard as an actor. He works great with Liv Tyler, who also gives an above par performance. It's just a shame that there isn't much substance to the film, as I think these two could have tackled a more gourmet superhero venture. Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky challenges the Hulk physically, whilst William Hurt's General Ross is there to defeat Banner mentally, and stop his movements across the US. The antagonists of the film don't really stand out at all, and are just there to provide a little fat between the bones that are the action scenes; Hurt does have some good scenes with Liv Tyler though.<br/><br/>Visually, The Incredible Hulk is presented much like a comic book, everything from the over-the-top, explosion drenched action scenes, to the rainy, melodramatic romance scenes between Banner and Ross has a pseudo-animated feel to it. The score is also very strong, particularly where Banner is involved, and especially in the foreign settings of the film (The Lonely Man song even makes an appearance as a leitmotif on Bruce's travels).<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is the most basic entry of Marvel: Phase One, though it's also the only ""does exactly what it says on the tin"" film of the bunch. And, although it was never going to win any awards for best screenplay, actors, cinematography or what have you, it isn't a terrible film. Most importantly, it doesn't try to fool you into thinking it's any more than a standard action film with some well known faces to brighten things up. Throw in a brief appearance from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man at the conclusion, and you can turn of the DVD player with a sense of satisfaction, without having to chew over any leftovers.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk (2008)<br/><br/>Allan's Score: 6/10"

","This is what a Hulk movie is supposed to be! This movie has all the action you can expect from a character like the Hulk, without turning into a mindless movie. I thought Edward Norton did a OK job being Banner, and has the advantage of being similar to the comic's Bruce Banner, than Eric Bana is. Tim Roth is also good in is role as Emil Blonsky. I didn't hate Ang Lee movie but it was too slow for a movie with a green giant monster being chased by the military.I can only expect that a sequel to this movie eventually comes out, because all of the ingredients to make another excellent action packed movie are there. So if you're expecting a complex story with great roles this is not your movie, but if you like action movies and especially if you are a Hulk fan you will not be disappointed. 7 out of 10."

","This movie was solid, and that's really all I can say about it. It's very decent, easy to watch and as far as popcorn movies go, I've seen much, much worse. That said, it's still one of the weakest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in my opinion. Does that make it a bad film? Not at all, but for me this film had the least amount of awe in it. It just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did.<br/><br/>So what does the movie get right? Well, the cast is very solid. Edward Norton is a very good choice to play the main character, as he has that kind of geeky yet understatedly dangerous quality to him. You can see that he's a peaceful man, but you really shouldn't mess with him. Ergo, the perfect Hulk. The rest of the actors didn't disappoint either, although Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns was a bit too all over the place for my tastes. But that's just me, as I've heard that most people like him just fine. I personally enjoyed Liv Tyler very much as Banner's (ex-)girlfriend Elizabeth Ross. That woman has the ability to capture your attention by just walking into the scene. In addition, the action was very well choreographed, being fast-paced, creative and easy to follow. The special effects look a bit out-dated by today's standards, mostly those dealing with the Hulk himself, but they weren't that bad.<br/><br/>So what didn't work? Well, I think the biggest problem is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously. It lacked that slight tongue in cheek humour that all the other Marvel films would have after this one. They also dealt with serious issues, but they were meant to entertain first and foremost. This film had some good jokes and I laughed from time to time, but it was still kind of dark for a superhero film. Not a bad thing, necessarily, if your main character is someone like, say, Daredevil, but when he's a humongous green giant... some humour wouldn't have gone amiss. And that's not to say that there isn't great tragedy to be found in the character of Hulk, and that is explored admirably in this film, but that tragedy needs humour to balance it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story wasn't that captivating as a whole. It hit most of the right notes and was well-written for the most part, but I did find it the slightest bit boring. It just seemed to go by so fast. Hulk had a problem, Hulk was presented with a solution, Hulk tried to reach the said solution, Hulk encountered some resistance, rinse and repeat. Plus, the villain of the film wasn't that interesting either. He was played by an entertaining actor (Tim Roth), but he never really rose above the usual blood knight/wardog clichés.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a bad film. If you're a fan of superhero movies, I'd definitely give this one a watch, and even if you're not, I'd say that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two."

","The Incredible Hulk, not to be confused with the movie Hulk, is the first of the individual movies that introduces us to The Avengers, and that's the only reason why I decided to see it, as I never really cared much for the character. I mean think about it, this scientist whose trying to create a super soldier tries the solution on himself, and now when he gets angry he turns into a WWE Superstar! As for the film, it's not much better. I love Edward Norton, he's a big name and a star in his own right, but he's just about the last person I would choose to be the Hulk. His whole personality wasn't right for the part. I like his co-star, Liv Tyler too, and it wasn't that she was bad in this film, it's that her role was a joke and she had absolutely no chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth was the bright spot in the movie, as he's one of those guys who can adapt to any role and I think I'd have preferred to see him as the Hulk. As for the story, parts of it were decent, but they skipped the whole part of the story that I wanted to see! The film starts five years later, in Brazil, I wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this. I hate superheroes and I hate their movies, but the Avengers stories have been different. With the exception of Thor, they have for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. The story here is lame and the movie is based on special effects which did nothing to help the film. The last half hour of the movie, I felt as though I was watching Peter Griffin fight the Big Chicken and I honestly hated every minute of it!"

","I have never read ""The Incredible Hulk"" comic strip. I have never seen the Bill Bixby TV series. I didn't even see the 2003 movie ""Hulk"". In fact, the only connection I have with the Hulk, is that I owned the the famous Hulk Hands toys as a young child. I watched this movie primarily so I could become familiar with each of the individual superheros before watching the recent popular movie, ""The Avengers"". It started off encouraging, showing flashbacks of how the Hulk came to be. Actually one of the coolest intros I have ever seen. Too bad that can't be said about the entire film. Everything about it felt a little off. First of all, I found much of the fault to be in the characterization of Bruce Banner. He felt very distant throughout. Yes, I understand he needs to be mellow, as to show the significant difference between him as Bruce and him as the Hulk, but even so. Edward Norton was not enjoyable to watch in this role. In addition, it really didn't feel like a superhero movie. I didn't see the Hulk as a hero and the villain didn't show up until the last twenty minutes. I did enjoy the small cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark. That for me was the highlight. Another cool thing about the film is that Lou Ferrigno, the original voice of the Hulk, is still lending his voice for this role. However, I am sorry to say that this movie was predictable and overall a disappointment. After watching this, I am quite interesting in seeing the the 2003 big screen adaption as to compare the two."

","Let's start out by saying that I do not like either ""Hulk"" movie. Also, I haven't seen the ""Avengers"" yet so I can't address the Hulk's role in that film.<br/><br/>The first Hulk movie had very bad CGI. It was like watching a live action film with animated inserts. In the first movie the Hulk turns into an ""Atomic Bomb"". They should have left him dead. But, like Frankenstein's monster, he had to be resurrected. <br/><br/>Anyway, in Hulk #2 (The Search for More Money), his new nemesis is a nightmarish ""lobster-man"" that upset me so that I haven't viewed this film in a long time. I am not a coward when it comes to these kinds of films. I have seen: all the original ""Nightmares on Elm St."", ""Jaws"", ""Alien"" Series and ""Hellraiser"" flicks. However, I choose not to watch most of these films ever again. I don't find these films enjoyable. Other films with nightmarish qualities that I do like include ""Van Helsing"" and ""What Dreams May Come"". Also, some of the Harry Potter series. But I tend to like sci-fi not sci-fi-shock movies. I'm not into vampires or werewolves these days, although in my youth, I loved them. Your tastes change as you get older and I am over 50. <br/><br/>I liked the green guy better when he wasn't quite so tall and wasn't fighting crustaceans. A new TV series would be better than the next Hulk movie which is planned for 2014. Also, a curvaceous ""she-hulk"" would liven up things quite a bit, don't you think?"

","Ang Lee's version of the hulk in 2003 brought disappoint among comic fans and so a lot of moviegoers weren't expecting much from the 2008 ""kinda"" sequel. Im sure a lot of them were pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Edward Norton is simply electric in this film and the story and action of the film blends together really well. I really enjoyed the films early setting and the beginning credits were put together really well. <br/><br/>The film has plenty of action sequences which are very cool indeed, however the final fight scene had abit too much cgi for my liking. The key moments in the film however, are those which further the storyline and i think this is what ang lee's 2003 hulk film lacked. Also the film has that classic cat and mouse feeling from which the original TV series gave to us .<br/><br/>However i felt that the hulk cgi was a little too ""fake"" and at times did not look realistic and that a more sinister villain was needed, although Tim Roth does a good job as the abomination, i would've like to see a character which really pushed Norton's character to the edge! <br/><br/>On an end note, i hope they conjure something up to follow up this film because it was spectacular but even if they don't, you should still go watch this film!"

","Scene 1: you see Dr. Bruce Banner sitting on the floor, dark small room, you can hear dog barking. Main light pointing down on him, so that it shows him sitting down, looking all worried, sweeting and breathing hard. What caught my attention is ""day without incident"" this raises the question what is he trying to prevent and how is he involved. Scene 2: then we move on to the next scene, this is a vital scene which shows the location, this tell the audience were he is which then raises the question: why would an American person be in a place like this, ""shanty towns"" in other word ghetto, where the poor and unfortunate people live (dangerous area). Also music is playing, it builds up tension, which is a sci-fi theme. the location shot, taken from a helicopter, basically and Arial shot Scene 3: next scene is Dr. Bruce banner (Edward Norton) is outside, this scene tell you 100% where he is, tracking shot to show location, camera movement from from behind and move around to his face, facial expression (worried). Music keeps playing. Scene 4: shows him and were is he living, give you and idea of the character, show how he lives (rich, poor) you can see that he lives alone just with his dog. Why does he live alone, he looks sad, like he is missing someone? <br/><br/>Tilt shot: when he is cocking ""ask the dog if it's ready"" then moves on to the next scene, camera tracks him picking up a book, music still playing, camera is zoomed on the TV screen, then zooms out, then you see him sitting down, he still has the book. The director use the 180 rule (where it shows him watching TV and eating) afterwards it's reviled that the book is an English to Portuguese translator (he hears a word in Portuguese) this tells you that he is somewhere in Portugal and that he has been here long because he is still trying to learn to speak Portuguese. Scene 5: this is a tracking shot (large shot) from the front he walking (music still playing) Scene 6: another tracking camera movement to give you an idea of location, you see he speaking with another person. They sit and start talking; the 180 rule is applied here as well. He is learning to control his emotion, this bring you back to the question ""days with out incident"" what is he trying to control or why is he trying to control his angry? 180 rule, zooming in and out to give you that tension, you need to move back, maybe something is going to happen. This is the interesting bit where Edward Norton, Dr. Bruce Banner get slapped on the face, then you hear a beeping sound, like an alarm warning you of something. An extreme close up of his watch; this watch monitors his heartbeat. he tells the person to stop so that he can calm down; this makes you thing what would happen if he get angry?<br/><br/>Scene 6: this show you the environment and living style, shows you people (extreme long shot), it's a gritty sweaty feel. We move to an indoor building, the director use a panning camera movement to the left. This shows you people getting change, which means that this could be a work place. Panning stops than there is a mid shot of Bruce, he get pushed by a person, he looks calm but annoyed at the same time. (no music)<br/><br/>Scene 7: this scene shows you the factory, which might play an import roll later on, panning and extreme wide shot is used to show the work environment (factory) 180 rule is used again, lady tries to make eye contact with Bruce which we now by now he is the main character (you can tell by her facial expression or eye contact that she like Bruce) maybe something might happen between them two later on The next scene is import this tell you how many months he has been here, (he is speaking to the boss) this gives you an idea how intelligent this person is, why would he be working here, is he trying to hind from someone? Tracking, panting, close ups and mid shots are used, this is the interesting bit, he cuts his finger, there is a tracking shot of the blood dropping or fouling down, he is worried, he telling the boss to shut it down, panicking, he runs to where the blood has dropped, the camera is tracking him running. Why is he so worried about this one drop of blood? Does he have a virus? Music is playing to build up tension. He finds and cleans of the bold from where it has dropped, he walking way, and the camera pans to the right reviling the blood which is in the class bottle, music is at a high point, which tells you that something interesting is going to happen (someone is going to drink it with the blood inside) to be honest there is a great ideal of camera angles used in this film. i think he is great director (Louis Leterrierand) and he did a wonderful job in making this film."

William Hurt and Tim Roth are slices of ham so thick that I thought the film's waist would explode from indigestion! Yet, both retain one's interest. The movie is much more faster paced than the Ang lee film. The CGI effects are much better as well. Look, this was a pretty decent film overall. Despite the new cast and director, the movie was a lot like the Ang Lee film. Some of the scenes were almost the same which when you look at this film director's work - we are now talking about Louis LeTerrier - he seems to do cinematic do-overs more often than not(he also directed the new Clash of the Titans!). That being said - the new film offers what the audiences wanted - an updated version to replace what many saw as a travesty. Now, we have it.

","Wow. There was film Hulk from Avenger. This film not like other film in Avenger but still not mean it any good. Stars Edward norton who used to be actor but now plank of wood with face drawn on it. He so good in Fight Club as crazy man putting penis clips in kid film but must be fluke. I hear he hard man to work because perfectionist. I think no. He can't act in this. Like he read lines from inside hand and shows emotion like sushi chef serving twitchy, still alive fish to fat tourist. Why tourists so fat? Nobody fat in films. So film looking bit tired. CGI got better now and big tantrum-monster look like green sock floating around in washing machine. Funny though, he more emotion than Edward Norton. OK, so this Incredible Hulk but another film called Hulk recent. This made to fit better into avenger film (why bother, film suck so hard it could pull monkey through 20 yards of garden hose?) So it is transparent and little bit embarrass. Like advert for worse film coming. Expect temper-monster to shout ""Give me your money or I punch you in 3D."" No canon to this film and begin only flashback in credits. Borrow little bit from other and from old TV series, even gamma radiate part copy from TV so audience can relate. Don't want to relate, want to be entertain. So monster do monster things. Blow up stuff, roar a lot. Nobody cares. Hollywood can't understand basic thing. We don't care. Give us character we relate. We invest, we want best outcome for them. Green temper-monster big version of annoy actor who entire facial expression is movement of left eyebrow by half centimeter. is not good. We don't care. Pause to make tea. We forget film is paused and not because tea full of special drink made in bathtub. Usually that but not this time. And his girlfriend. Her lips massive now, she been kissing angle grinder? She eat mushroom soup? She talk soft and with acting range of a hair dryer. She like on sleeping drugs all way through. She act like audience act when they watch this. So film a bit different from Captain iron man. Look a bit different and have own style. That is good, like that. Ends nowhere and hint at avengers in credits make no sense with other film meant to connect. Plot hole you can throw a tank thought. Nobody care though if Edward Norton throw it. Just make us yawn. It has villain who have own motivation although by end of film writers give up, probably drunk on bathtub liquor. End with big fight which taught me new thing. Apparent a big chain is more effective than all firepower of US army. Maybe this is why US army not good fighting wars. Other countries armed with chains and planks of wood with nails in while they only have tanks and cannons. Poor them. So we have lots of action scene and we have CGI monster sock creature. We have explode, villain who starts caring what he does but then just decide to be another monster for some reason. Is sloppy work but basically not terrible. Better than Thor. Not good as Iron man but villain far better than Captain American. Good enough if you don't take your brain with you to cinema. If you think film should pose interest question and be artistic then film might make you want gouge out your eyes with chopstick."

The main actress is absolute much better than the previous one as well. I don't know much about the acting stuff, but at least, when i watched Hulk 2, i was sorta convinced by the love story between two main characters and that i can hardly get from Hulk 1. I think both two actresses were given roughly the same important roles and scenes in the movies, but the first one is just blank and empty, the character itself is dull which is the script writer's fault. All i can think of her is her looking and screaming?(perhaps. no much impression for sure.) the second one is much more vivid and they added in some scenes (some very detail things)to show us their love to each other which is quite necessary and sweet. we wouldn't just suddenly believe they love each other so much when each time we see only the main actress could stop the Hulk when Hulk lost control(Hulk one). i mean, thats just so childish to me. Anyway, this movie , i would say, is alright, comparing to the previous one, this has been improved a lot. if you're a big Hulk fun, i recommend watching this one, never ever think about watching Hulk 1.

","Maybe its me. Somehow I find Bruce Banner infinitely more interesting than The Hulk. I know, I know, you can't have one without the other, but I've seen two Hulk movies now and I have arrived at the conclusion that this is a mythology that - like its hero - has two sides. One has Bruce trying to find a method by which he can control his metabolism in order to stop himself from turning into a 12-foot giant behemoth with an anger management problem. The other has Hulk throwing cars around and smashing walls.<br/><br/>The previous movie, 'Hulk' by Ang Lee, dealt with the former. That horribly underrated film shocked me by dealing with Bruce on his own terms and trying to explore the troubled spirit inside him. It dealt with Bruce's past, most especially he troubled relationship with his father. Sadly, it was devalued and accused of being too slow and took talky. This new film, 'The Incredible Hulk', devalues the character and affords him the minimum of down time to search for a method to get rid of his affliction. The rest of the time, he turns into his alter-ego and smashes, tanks, walls, glass, cars, pavement and my ear drums.<br/><br/>The story begins with a step in the right direction, with Bruce (Edward Norton) working in a bottling plant in South America while spending his off hours on his laptop talking to a scientist named Mr. Blue (Tim Blake Nelson) who is helping him find a cure. Meanwhile the government is scouring the earth looking for him. It turns out that he was part of an experiment to create a genetically enhanced super soldier - aren't they always? The search is led by the mustachioed General Ross (William Hurt) who is the father of Bruce's girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler). WOW! I'd love to be a fly on the wall at their house for Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>Ross' search team includes a former member of The Royal Army, a scraggly little foot-soldier named Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). Blonsky takes a personal interest in hunting down Banner when he is injected with a hormone that eventually turns him into a creature known as Abomination. The beast doesn't show up until the third act but he isn't much to see, he's just like Hulk except he has grayish skin and spines down his back.This movie doesn't have time for details like that. The entire second half of the movie is given over to Hulk running from The Army while smashing things real good. Then Abomination comes on the screen and we are treated to a climactic battle between two unconvincing looking CGI creatures.<br/><br/>I am much more interested in the science at work here. I know that in a smash-and-bash action movie and the hard science is simply connective tissue that pulls together the action scenes, but I would be interested in knowing how a man's level of accelerated blood pressure causes a metamorphoses that gives him super strength and the body of Mr. Universe? What makes him green? How is he able to take so many bullets without bleeding? Is his skin bulletproof? What causes Banner to grow from a 6 feet to 12 feet? What is the time between his fits of rage and when he becomes Hulk? What is the downtime before he changes back? Why am I having to ask questions that the movie should be answering? ** (of four)"

","I'm not going to claim that this movie was awful. It wasn't. I'll admit that the first time I saw it I was entertained, the second time even, but that doesn't make it a good movie. The film was only held up by special effects. Not story, and not acting by any means. Now, I would never call Edward Norton or Tim Roth horrible actors—even William Hurt, and Liv Tyler (whose work I am not a huge fan of) were decent, though I do prefer Sam Elliot and Jennifer Connelly, but that doesn't mean any of them were good actors in this movie. I appreciate their performances, especially as replacements for a sequel, but there was only so much they could do with the story they were given. Honestly, the best acting in the whole movie was when Edward Norton and Liv Tyler wanted to get freaky, but he can't get ""too excited"" and Liv Tyler gives him that perfect ""it's okay"" line that every embarrassed man has gotten from a woman at least once.<br/><br/>The fact is, the story was bad. It didn't go anywhere or do anything except set up and knock-down a random villain and show Bruce gaining some semblance of control over the Hulk in preparation for a third movie that will never happen because this one lost over $15 million at the box office. And in my opinion, the huge issue with these Marvel origin story movies is that the first ends up being too much exposition, and the second ends up being just action-based fan service with nary a leg to stand on. Maybe it is asking too much to see a half action, half well-written exposition superhero movie, but that is what we need. Some have come close, but ultimately, I feel these movies leave us with at least a small sense of disappointment, and that fault lies with the story. The actors give it their best, but they don't stand much of a chance."

","All my previous experiences with HULK movies have been disappointing. No offense intended to the people who made the previous movies, but this is what I had been expecting to see in a HULK movie, not just because of the top notch CGI or the casting choices(William Hurt was perfect as General Ross and so was Liv Tyler as Betty Ross. I was a little skeptical about Edward Norton, but he made a good Bruce Banner) but because it was like watching the pages of comic book come alive, like watching all those animated shows of HULK. While the Ang Lee version was a more intellectual and emotional approach to the story, this movie is simple and true to the characters. The beauty and beast love story, which according to me is the essence of the incredible tale, is more prominent in this movie. Sure there are lot of differences from the original story by Stan Lee, but it hardly bothered me as I watched the big green hero smash up all in his path and clash with the mighty Abomination. As opposed to Hulk(2003), this one was befittingly titled The ""INCREDIBLE"" Hulk."

But that is not really needed, as most of us has at least a rough idea of his history and character, and if not what is needed is provided in a 0nicely done flashback introduction.<br/><br/>It is an entertaining piece. Recommended for fans of the Hulk or fans of action movies. A little confusing though that it is mostly independent from the recent Hulk from 2003, with new actors in every role, the only remaining actor I think is Stan Lee and his cameo. Even if new, the cast is both well known and very good. Norton, Tyler, Hurt and Roth in the main roles. They all gives solid performances.<br/><br/>But all in all this is a movie that delivers what it should, nothing less, but not anything more either. It is something to watch and forget and I was about to rate it at a 6. But then there was the ending. Really the end after the end, a scene that just as well might have appeared after the credits, I would have placed it there anyway. That elevated it all, actually. SoÂ…<br/><br/>7/10"

","For me, The Indredible Hulk is the most special summer blockbuster movie of 2008, mainly because some of it was filmed in my neighbourhood, and I got to meet producer Gale Anne Hurd, and third time director Louis Leterrier. 2008 was a big Summer for superheroes, (Batman, Iron Man, Hell Boy and Hancock) but this one is my favourite. <br/><br/>Although it was never intended to be a sequel to Ang Lee's film, this one does in a way pick up from Where 'Hulk' left off. Bruce Banner is an American fugitive hiding in Rio from the government trying to cure himself. Circumstances force him to return home to Washington where he reunites with Betty Ross, who helps him flee the military and her father, General Ross. Their quest to cure him takes them to New York where Banner meets his match in the Abomination. Hulk must become the good guy in order to stop it.<br/><br/>Just as it was not intended to be a sequel, Letterier's approach was also not intended to be a brilliant movie, it was created simply to entertain, and it certainly does. Ignore the stupidity and you'll have a lot of fun."

","I thought I should warn you, because after reading some of the other comments, I think people came of wildly off base when reviewing the movie. Zak Penn should have his knees bludgeoned and Liv Tyler should be hung for putting us through that. The writing was flat out awful, an abomination if you will, and Liv was just unbelievably bad. Who does Betty Ross think she is running around shouting at heavy artillery and abominations of science to, ""STOP!! PLEASE STOP!!!"" He other lines consisted of her whispering, ""it's okay now,"" and ,""...Bruce,"" even though he was hundreds of feet away.<br/><br/>The romance scene came up drastically short, and if anything could have saved Liv Tyler from being the worst actress I've ever scene it would have been a steamy romantic scene. The action was mediocre, and the only parts I enjoyed were ones with Ed Norton and Ed Norton alone. If it had been a self-aware superhero film, like Ironman, it could have been at least a 5.

","I gave it 5 stars because as a movie, it was simply OK. Edward Norton once again brought a stellar acting performance to the screen. Liv Tyler on the other hand was at times very weak. The CGI was quite good, but not up to par as some of today's CGI movies. I only state that because it depends heavily on CGI and does a good, but not excellent job. It had a lot of good throwbacks to comic book readers too. In the end though, it was full of slow, almost stopping points, where nothing is given to the story. The action scenes were great, but not good enough to make me want to see this again. It may be worth spending $10 to see in theaters, but I wish I waited for DVD."

","I really liked this incarnation of Hulk, and hope that it spawns at least one sequel. I did not dislike the Ang Lee version of Hulk, but I think it fell short of capturing the essence of the original comic book and story. This version does a much better job! I cannot think where it could be improved. From the trailers, I was not thrilled at the appearance of this version of the Hulk. Except for being too green, the Ang Lee version more closely matched my recollection of the comic. But, after this new film gets going, the visual appearance of the Hulk grew on me and I cannot find fault. In the Ang Lee version, one was too aware that one was watching a comic book. In this version, though you know its a comic book story, the characterizations and raw action lend the kind of realism that comic book movies *should* strive for. I admit bias towards the two principle actors, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, but I really think that they delivered emotional performances that did justice to the characters and the film. Tim Roth's performance was also top notch; even as a mere mortal, his character exuded pure menace. If you're a Tim Roth fan (as I am), I don't think you'll be disappointed. In short, IMO the fledgling Marvel Studios has another solid hit. I can only hope that the in-the-works adaptation of ""Thor"" stands up well against ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Iron Man""."

","I just got home from the midnight showing of the hulk, and I must say, despite a lot of fears ( because of the 2003 ""movie"" ), I was extremely impressed. Edward Norton played the role of Bruce Banner beyond perfect, and I don't think it would be an easy role to play. Also, despite the fact that I can't stand Liv Tyler because she sounds like she's perpetually having an orgasm, I thought she did a fantastic job as Betty Ross.<br/><br/>The acting: I thought that the acting was superb, except for a few lines by William Hurt that just weren't quite believable, but absolutely nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>The plot: Extremely predictable. Then again, it's a superhero movie. I wasn't expecting a storyline that made the godfather look pathetic. The story was still immersing, and each character was introduced and developed quite well.<br/><br/>The filming: Excellent. My personal favorite shot was an overview of some mountains with a thick mist settling over them. Every scene with hulk is shot so that you get a good look at the big guy, but don't miss what's going on around him, and it's all done without showing you the view from every single camera on the set ( just some more complaining about the 2003 version ). The final fight is filmed incredibly, then again, its hard to make a fight between two 10-foot monsters look bad.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to any superhero fan, and also to someone not so fond of the genre. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
"mjscarface","7","3","8","12 June 2008"," A pleasant surprise!
","HULK SMASH! 'The Incredible Hulk', while not without it's flaws, is a much leaner and meaner version of the comic book tale than Ang Lee's disappointing 'Hulk'. Instead of delving too deep into psychological issues and family trauma, the new film keeps moving and never strays from the action.<br/><br/>Now let's get something out of the way that bothered me a lot. 'The Incredible Hulk' cheats here by being a sequel to a film that doesn't exist! It's not an origin story but it's not a sequel to Lee's film either. The opening sequence recaps events that didn't actually take place in 'Hulk' and this makes the first ten or fifteen minutes especially awkward. It's almost like you have to do your homework on HOW the Hulk gets created before turning up, which is OK I guess because it's such a well known character.<br/><br/>Now onto the positives. The opening action sequence in Rio's shanty towns is amazing, up there with something out of the Bourne movies, except with the added bonus of including a Hulking-out scene! Ed Norton and Tim Roth are both good as enemies while their digital counterparts are also rather impressive but more on those in a sec. There's some nice humour thrown into the mix, stopping the film from getting too serious.<br/><br/>With ten times more energy than 'Hulk', the movie leaps from one action sequence to another and although it gets a little bit choppy later on, it's much better than the incoherent finale of the other version. The effects range from fantastic to that kind of gravity defying look that most comic book movies seem to pick up. But on the whole I was impressed and every time the Hulk gets mad (which is a lot in this film) it always makes you smile.<br/><br/>The final battle between Hulk and Roth's Abomination is savage stuff, with the pair roaring and growling like wild beasts. If you a bit let down by the Transformers-lite showdown of Iron Man, then you might prefer this one which I'd say is better.<br/><br/>Sorry if this review is all over the place, I just felt I needed to say that 'Incredible Hulk' is a pleasing entry into the genre and I'm actually looking forward to the inevitable sequel!"
"neil-476","10","3","8","12 June 2008"," Hulk - smashing!
","The most useful piece of advice comes first - you don't have to stay until the end of the credits. The bit which you would expect to come after the credits is actually the very last bit before. Along comes the end of the film - and it's an ending which puts a big grin on your face - and then there's this extra bit, which puts an even bigger grin there. And then the titles.<br/><br/>This film is great. The Ang Lee movie was a big disappointment but, where that movie disappointed, this one pleases. I think there is probably less of the Hulk himself in this one, but the film itself works much better.<br/><br/>It's kind of a sequel - you can talk yourself into believing that it starts where the previous movie leaves off - although it ignores much of the origin in the first movie (and, thankfully, anything to do with Banner's father). But it is much more clearly inspired by the TV series - the opening credits clearly reference the TV series, the notion of Banner being on the run was, of course, a constant of the TV Hulk, the TV theme is quoted in the soundtrack music, there is a reporter called McGee, and Bill Bixby is gently referenced in the early minutes.<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, it has something which I call ""heart"". Perhaps it's as simple as this movie ""getting"" the Hulk, where Ang Lee didn't. But right from the off, this film emotionally involves the audience in a way which Lee's film, notwithstanding how touchy-feely the first hour was, never did.<br/><br/>Stan cameos (of course), as does Lou Ferrigno, and I was delighted to note that Lou also does the Hulk's voice (I'm not going to reveal what the Hulk actually says).<br/><br/>The script is miles better than the script of the Ang Lee film. Edward Norton is an excellent Banner, and William Hurt is a much better General Ross than Sam Elliott was - for one thing, you can understand what he's saying. Tim Roth is good as Blonsky. I felt there wasn't much to choose between Liv Tyler and Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross.<br/><br/>I think I preferred this visualisation of the Hulk - it is much more filled with uncontrollable rage. The CGI is mostly fine - a bit dodgy in places (the Abomination doesn't always convince, and there's a rain-soaked scene which would, I think, have been better dry).<br/><br/>But I really, really liked this film - more than Iron Man."
"MartinHafer","6","4","13","24 July 2010"," Despite a ton of smashing, this film actually was a tad dull...but watchable.
","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.<br/><br/>This film is a sequel (of sorts) and it's obvious from the beginning that the film has come after a lot of things have occurred. Bruce Banner is already the Hulk and how that all came to be was explored in the first film...or at least that's what I've been told. Oddly, he's in Brazil and perhaps he chose this nation because of their spiffy green flag. After a short time, the evil general (William Hurt) and his minions pounce on Banner and try to kidnap him. Not unexpectedly, Banner becomes Hulk and kicks butt. Later, they try the same thing repeatedly, but this time they give Tim Roth (why is an English guy playing a guy in the US Army, by the way--he certainly was no Rambo!) a series of injections to make him a super-soldier--and giving him a chance to defeat the Hulk. The only trouble is--who is going to control this new insanely dangerous nemesis.<br/><br/>Despite my being a relative Hulk newbie, I was surprised that my opinion AND the opinion of both my daughters (including the comic book geek one) was pretty much the same. The film had some nice action but not a whole lot else. As for the rest of the film, it was a tad dull and the relationship with the girl really seemed to slow down the film. As a result, the film is a time-passer and not a whole lot more. I sure hope that the folks at Marvel think twice about all their many, many announced upcoming films. If you keep making mediocre super-hero films, you might just end up killing the genre. This is NOT a film of the same quality as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (yes, Marvel fans, I know this is a DC franchise--back off, nerd-boys!!!)."
"leeharris100","8","3","9","13 June 2008"," Better than the first, but not perfect
","I'm a massive Hulk fanboy (it's the only thing I'm a true fanboy about), so take this with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>First off, they skip the entire story of how Bruce became the Hulk and they sum up what should have made the first 15 min of the movie in about 30 seconds. My girlfriend was pretty lost because of this and she didn't really know how the Hulk came to be.<br/><br/>Second, I really wish they would have picked someone other than Liv Tyler to do Betty. She shows so little emotion during the movie that it is nearly impossible to like her, hate her, etc. The rest of the cast (Norton, Roth, Hurt) did an amazing job and I felt like the bottleneck was Tyler.<br/><br/>Third, the action was really nice and really entertaining, but I hated how they downplayed the Hulk's power and anger so much. There were several times when Betty was about to be hurt or die and he doesn't get much stronger. The Hulk and the Abomination are about the same strength when they start but the Hulk gets more powerful as he gets angry. You don't really see much of that and it would have added so much to the movie. Also, in the comic book the Hulk could jump a few miles at once. One time he even jumped into ORBIT. In the movie he couldn't jump to the top of a building.<br/><br/>All in all though, it was a good movie. The pacing was a bit fast, but it was manageable. Don't let everything I said prevent you from watching the movie. As I said, I'm a huge fan of the Hulk and I could probably find a flaw with anything related to him."

The romantic side of the film was pleasantly kept to a minimum. Cameos, inside jokes and references were thrown in all over the place making it fun for comic book lovers and other movie goers. The movie has a slow start but it helps build the characters and one of the side female roles might confuse the audience.

","Just got back from the cinema after choosing to see this on opening day, rather than Mum's choice of the overlong Sex and the City. I'm glad I chose this.<br/><br/>While I can't speak for comic book fans, as I'm not one and even the 90s cartoon series was my least fave as a child, I enjoyed this retelling(not a remake) of the Mavel comic book a lot.<br/><br/>Acting: Ed Norton was good as Banner - he shows vulnerability well (but I thought they could've given him more chance to showcase his 'inner conflict' abilities in the script - which seems to, almost expectedly be mostly channelled into his green alter-ego), and I thought had some chemistry with his love interest - Liv Tyler. Poor Banner can't even be intimate without fear of turning green. Liv Tyler gives the film it's emotional heart and she's quite subtle to me (thankfully not OTT). She's involved in helping Banner find a cure. William Hurt is very good as the rogue general who dispatches soldiers and weapons to use against Hulk, so he can use him as a powerful super weapon. Another experiment he does with Tim Roth's character to create another Hulk though he does, quite catastrophically learn the consequences of his actions. Tim Roth plays his creepy, corrupt and greedy antagonist well - who later turns into The Abomination as aforementioned from a botched op. I thought his character could've had some more development. Other mentions go to who to Mr Blue(who banner instant messages for help with a cure). We find out he's an over enthusiastic scientist, but is somehow interesting in a way, as he's so fascinated by Bruce's infliction ( even calling it 'God-like').<br/><br/>Pacing: Starts with a view of green cells, and tells banner's past though a series of brief Bourne-type flashbacks. The scenes themselves runs at a expected pace. Liked the way it was shown on screen the number of days Banner had not had an 'incident' of turning into Hulk and if he had, it would start again at 0. the film dwells less on the angst of Bruce banner and more on the action, unlike the Ang Lee one.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The special effects were overall quite good and Hulk looked solid most of the time(as solid as CG can sort of look, even if it doesn't have that physical mass to it), apart from the odd shot where I thought I could tell it was blatant discernible CGI(in action sequences - particularly the full-on war battle on the uni campus). The fights those were too fast and a lot of it was a blur. It's pure spectacle these scenes though. The standout one for me was probably the uni campus turned military battlefield, with explosions aplenty. All the main military defence is used against this green monster, yet Hulk destroys them so easily. My sheer amazement and Hulk's strength(especially when he first transforms in the bottle factory and we see men go flying through the air) made me yell 'bloody hell' a lot.<br/><br/>Music: Pretty standard score. It did it's job really, but wasn't standout from my point of view.<br/><br/>Overall: An explosive, engaging action film, that while I don't think it necessarily does anything that innovative with the comic-book film genre, as a popcorn film to sit down and see, I think it works well. It has a subtly knowing script, and a majority of good acting in it. And I found the action scenes more satisfying in length(and the final fight between Hulk and Abomination smack down better) than Iron Man's action scenes and climax. It could've had more sense of fun about it though, as it was quite brooding and serious in tone. Only a handful of laughs (shopping for stretchy trousers in Brazil, 'you don't like me when I'm ... hungry' etc). There's no real connection between the two very separate entities of Hulk and Banner. It could've slowed down the action a bit, especially between the two creatures at the end(charging towards each other), and it did feel a bit generic. Again, it had the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, which i always like to spot in these sort of films. Tony Stark even makes a cameo at the end to make a tip-off about another forthcoming Avengers film."

You barely even see the hulk until the second half of the movie, and his first and second action scene wasn't very good, but the fight with Abomination was actually good.

","People continue to talk down on Ang Lee's version of the Hulk, but I'll say this for it, it made you think. His version had complicated relationships, a unique visual style, and overall good performances. This reboot required no thinking whatsoever. It was pure popcorn friendly cinema, which is great for some, but when you compare this movie to the Dark Knight or Iron Man, you see how thin it appears. Superhero movies can be more than just impressive CGI and battle scenes. They can provoke thought, they can be intriguing, it's totally OK for them to be, dare I say...good FILMS. Norton seems to be the only outstanding performance here, and that's to say that he stands out from the rest, not that he's outstanding. Liv Tyler's infinite compassion feels a bit overdone, and William Hurt seemed non-existent till perhaps the last scene of the movie. If you want a movie to test out your new plasma or surround sound system, have at it. If you want a good movie that actually engages you just a little, then move along. This isn't for you."
"angelsfang","Null","2","5","25 September 2008"," Time to end the franchise.
","I don't know why, but the Hulk has enjoyed very limited success on the silver screen. I remember watching the cartoons as a kid, I wasn't a huge fan but it was enjoyable. I didn't quite enjoy the first one by Ang Lee, and I barely managed to finish Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk, despite it starring Edward Norton who is one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Edward is so wasted here. His role does not require any special skills or talents at all, Bruce Banner could've been played by Matt Damon and it would just be the same. The reason I used Damon as an example is because he is also good at playing characters on the run, ala the Bourne series. I honestly did not really notice any of Norton's special acting abilities, such as his intense speeches or extremely in-depth moments. Bruce Banner is just a guy on the run, and a bit of a romantic. Liv Tyler is even worse, she is her usual bland self. She's quite good looking, but I remember her from Lord of the Rings and Armageddon, and she played the SAME bland characters with her bland emotionless acting. This isn't a criticism of her acting ability as a whole, since I haven't seen all her films, but her role contributes even more boring to an already very boring film. To make matters worse, The Incredible Hulk is filmed so dark, even darker than The Dark Knight. I could barely make out the last action scene. Oh and I know we should suspend belief for action hero flicks like these, but in the last scene where the helicoper ripped vulcan cannon fire at the Hulk right onto civilian buildings... uhh okay..... <br/><br/>It's odd really, what is it with superhero films and bland acting? Toby Maguire's Spider-Man, Christian Bale's Batman (incredible actor, but again his abilities severely limited as Bruce Wayne), Neo in The Matrix, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars II. I guess Robert Downey Jr's Ironman is one of the more successful projects in recent times, which is why the movie ended up so popular and even worthy of comparison to the powerhouse that is The Dark Knight. Ironically, the last scene reflects this as if to add insult to injury."

I mean the latest Batman film ""Dark Knight"" is amazing and although its left open it doesn't feel like the first part of a two parter.

Ed Norton is, unfortunately, totally miscast in this take on Bruce Banner. He's far too bland to command leading man status. The action scenes are tired and lifeless, with poor fire FX and some terrible ""eye line"" work on the CGI. Only the end scene fight between The Hulk and The Abomination look vaguely convincing.

Huh?<br/><br/>THE GOOD: They've managed not pump it up with the usual toxic drama and cheap bashing - it has a fine dosage which will save you all the ""Oh come on!"" and the usual exclamations of boredom from the people in the audience. Also Edward Norton seems a better choice than the last guy tough many people hate a to see a sequel with a new cast. So at least you won't regret watching it unless you are an edgy critic. And its better to see it than gamble for another movie of the season.<br/><br/>THE BAD: Its not much content to start with, but thats probably because the comic doesn't really offer much movie material to work with. To make comic live on screen you need some seriously profound storytelling abilities, and I'm afraid the The Incredible Hulk (2008) isn't a break from the usual weak comic movies. Liv Tyler seems like a bad choice, it may be just me but i think that she uses the same look on her face in one too many movies and it ain't all that convincing any more. There were no little sugar cubes in the form of elements bringing grace to scenes. The plot aside, there's always infinite possibility for turning a plain old story into a remarkable experience but it seems nobody tries now days.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see something with sensibly less of the usual cheap drama, profanity and lethally boring dialog you might wanna try the Hulk, with a bit of luck you might be fan of the green bag of muscles and enjoy your self without looking for special experience. But if you put that on the scales against going out with your friends on some other activity the movie should take a rain check."
"hardrock666","7","2","5","3 August 2008"," The Hulk returns with more effects, less soul
","Very few Hollywood action movies get it right. In this age of computer generated images in blockbusters, far too often, depth of character is sacrificed. They might thrill but fail to resonate emotionally. ""The Incredible Hulk"" has plenty going for it with its action, but just ends up being an action movie with very little to care about.<br/><br/>This movie seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to the Oscar winning director Ang Lee's more cerebral, brooding and introspective ""Hulk"" (2003). Hard-core fans were put off by the psychology of it all and wanted more action. So, director Louis Leterrier falls into that trap and unfortunately goes the other extreme. It is clearly more interested in the action and loses out on a potentially touching if not more visceral underpinnings.<br/><br/>The Hulk does not want to be a monster again and his love tries to help him against the wishes of her father. This plot line could have been further delved into without taking away from the action. The movie fails to do so.<br/><br/>The opening credits encapsulate the story of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) when angry turns into the Hulk. It then continues from where the earlier movie left off. We find Banner in a South American town trying to find a cure. He also learns to control his anger. The army general, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), is hell bent on finding him and extract that which makes him the Hulk and use it to make a weapon.<br/><br/>He eventually finds Banner with the help of a mercenary Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) but the Hulk escapes and returns home. But Blonsky also turns into a Hulk like monster called the Abomination and they face off in the end.<br/><br/>There is a new cast for this movie who really don't get much material to work with. Liv Tyler playing the love does a decent job and her scenes with Norton are tender. Roth playing the cold and ruthless Blonsky shines and injects the movie with some refreshing human edginess. Norton co-wrote the movie with Zac Penn. There were rumours that Norton was upset that the story of Banner was compromised for the sake of action and he even refused to do initial promotional work for the movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences are clearly better staged than the earlier movie and even Hulk looks much more believable. The film makers have clearly worked on the CG imagery. But it is very hard to look into the Hulk's soul and see any kind of anguish and turmoil the character is clearly going through. The only emotion that seems to be relayed is anger. This struggle between Banner and Hulk is woefully under worked and the movie's biggest failure.<br/><br/>The script is damp and could have done more with the humour. The other Marvel comic super hero movie ""Iron Man"" was well served with a witty script and thismovie could have done with more light hearted moments. Since the film makers seemed intent on satisfying fans, for those looking for a thrills and not much brooding this move will deliver."

","CGI effects are good, and what you would expect them to be to date, better than the original Hulk film due to technological progress. That's about the most positive thing that I can say about this film.<br/><br/>The bridging between action scenes progressed very slowly. The plot failed to interest me and therefore did not hold my attention. Edward Norton, a fine actor, should have declined the starring role. Liv Tyler needs to get some acting lessons, ASAP, her pretty face will not carry her through forever. William Hurt as the nefarious general, good actor, his talents wasted here. Tim Roth, in my view the best actor in this whole project, seems miscast as the human version of Hulk's nemesis.<br/><br/>Just how many bullets and rockets are going to be fired by the military before they figure out that they have no effect on the Hulk or his nemesis?? I guess the oxymoron 'military intelligence' holds true here. Despite the 'havoc' scenes in this film, plot, screenplay, execution fell well short of my expectations. I don't think that it was better or worse than the first Hulk film, just different.<br/><br/>I went to see this at the budget $2. theater and I'm glad that I did, particularly after the disappointment of Hellboy 2 which I saw at the expensive, fancy theater this past week. This will be a halfway decent DVD rental for those who enjoy the genre."
"imdb-211","6","2","5","2 August 2008"," Great action flick, but ultimately predictable
","When the first modern Hulk adaptation came out in 2003, most people were disappointed. This wasn't the Hulk they expected; this was a deep character with an interesting story, a movie with fantastic screenplay and great actors, but few and barely mediocre action scenes. And action scenes was what the fans wanted.<br/><br/>So the movie was seen as a failure, and plans were made to relaunch the franchise, giving people the movie they wanted in the first place; a movie that can be summarized in two words: ""Hulk Smash!""<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is out, and it's a great movie. It's quite the fan service: it has the typical Hulk lines, it has tons of action scenes, it has incredible CGI, and it has the obligatory even stronger villain who ultimately must lose because he does not have the power of good on his side, and it has purple underwear. On the minus side, The Abomination looks nothing like the comic version, and some of the acting is ridiculously bad, with actors standing there staring into nothingness as if they were waiting for instructions from the director. Some actions scenes are cut too quickly, which makes it hard to figure out what exactly is going on, but since that has become the norm for Hollywood movies, it may be a bit unfair to blame The Incredible Hulk for it.<br/><br/>Still, it's a great movie, but because it's exactly what people wanted, it's ultimately incredibly predictable. Ang Lee's Hulk was fascinating, challenging and innovative. Leterrier's Hulk is cookie cutter. When people will talk about ""the Hulk movie"" in a decade or so, they will talk about Ang Lee's Hulk, not Leterrier's Hulk.<br/><br/>As a mindless summer popcorn action flick, The Incredible Hulk is a winner. As a work of art, as a contribution to the Hulk mythology, as something that challenges its viewers, it's a failure."
"schnoidl","6","2","5","1 August 2008"," crappy physics always a dealbreaker
","it's hard enough to suspend disbelief for something like this, but when a body is running or jumping or throwing things, and the motion doesn't look right, that pops the bubble. aggravating that they can put so much effort into choreographing shots, blow all that money on extras and effects, yet they can't even be bothered to make the most elementary physics of the scene work. Bugs Bunny has a more convincing walk cycle, and I buy him as a character, no problem, totally transparent, and that was done with a bunch of pencil tests. Hulk and Abomination walk and run like marionettes. For all the computing power thrown at this, how hard can it be to set up a convincing dynamics rig? it's like running a formula one car on street tires or something.<br/><br/>plus it's a little odd that the transformation would double the number of teeth in his mouth. and Abomination's scale relative to the Hulk varied wildly, sometimes three or four times his size, sometimes almost the same size. I like to get sucked into big comic book movies, but when my bullshit detector goes off every ten seconds, it kind of spoils it for me.<br/><br/>if they ever need a supervillain called Wooden Man, William Hurt would be my first choice, he has about as little charisma as is possible."
"pc95","6","2","5","22 July 2008"," Strong Beginning but Poor Romance/Gratuitous effects
","The Incredible Hulk starts it's story moving immediately assuming we already know the story lines which is mostly true. This is a good idea as there's a quick prelude and setup to the story. I enjoyed the first 20 min of it pretty well - good pacing, good action, decent acting, and wonderful locale of Brazil capped off with a great chase scene. However Liv Tyler is a poor casting choice and it becomes a problem once she enters the story. Her acting is somewhat vanilla and the romance between her character and Edward Norton's is really flat. Detractingly awful actually. What's worse is there's a good 20 min of it at least during the movie - too much emphasis on a weak link. She needs some better direction and work with the scenes alongside the Hulk CGI too - she looks like she's staring off in different places instead of the Hulk's face. Additionally William Hurt is pretty forgettable as supposedly a brass general as there's too much subdued in his actions and conversations to make him believable as a leader. Edward Norton gives a rather standard performance - not as good as some of his past movies but satisfactory. This new Hulk is lavish with effects, some pretty exciting action sequences, and the Green man looks pretty good more like the comic-book looks like the aim of it. Probably the best performance is by Tim Roth as sort of an over-zealous soldier owing to good writing in this instance. Anyway The Incredible Hulk is not as good as Iron Man (spoiler - if you've seen Iron Man you'll love the cameo.) needing more humor, but definitely better than the earlier recent Hulk by Ang Lee who failed in the look. This is a good effort unfortunately with some standout flaws, but worth a watch certainly. Effects get piled on almost gratuitously towards the end though."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","5","13 July 2008"," Dumb and big but obviously entertaining.
","Seems like I'm one of the very few who actually liked Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". It was a movie that failed to attract and please the majority of people. Still they obviously thought there was lots of potential with the Hulk character for further movies and therefore 5 years later this movie got released, which is not a sequel to Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" and instead is a re-telling and re-establishment of the Hulk character. It ignores the facts from the first movie and doesn't very much concentrate on the Hulk origins or emotional aspect of Bruce Banner but it's more a movie that comes straight to the point and cuts to the chase immediately, so to speak. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is bigger, has more action and far more potential to please the mainstream crowd. It also of course obviously has as a result that the movie is rather simple.<br/><br/>Not only the director is different this time (Louis Leterrier) but also the cast is. Edward Norton seems like an unlikely choice for such a big mainstream blockbuster but he of course is more than a capable actor and therefore also pulls off just fine. Still I liked Eric Bana's more humane and emotional performance of Bruce Banner in ""Hulk"", despite the fact that I think Edward Norton is a better actor. But to be honest I liked every actor and performance from ""Hulk"" better than was the case with this movie. Liv Tyler replaced Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and William Hurt replaced Sam Elliott as general Ross. Completely new characters are being played by Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky and Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns, who are again, two actors who don't seem like very likely choices for such a big summer blockbuster but work out just fine for the movie. Of course especially Tim Roth, as the movie its main villain. Still funny though that a supposedly Russian character speaks with such a fat British accent. It was good though to see him in a big production again. He had been out of the picture for too long.<br/><br/>Of course this is no movie that pays particularly much attention to its story. Once you start over-analyzing it you'll find plenty of plot-holes and the movie leaves more questions then answers. But of course you shouldn't think too much about this though, for ""The Incredible Hulk"" is just not this kind of movie. It's a movie that is supposed to bring entertainment and at this it really does not fail.<br/><br/>This is obviously a movie that cost some serious money to make. With its budget around $150,000,000, this is a real big summer blockbuster. The money can mostly be seen back on screen with some big action sequences. I actually have to admit that some of the action is the best I've seen in recent years. It's of course also a movie that relies heavily on its CGI, for its Hulk character mostly. The special effects are simply great though so it shouldn't really ever 'trouble' you that this is a CGI heavy movie. This is also due to the directing approach of the movie, that shows the Hulk often more as a mysterious and dark creature who moves around in the shadows. The camera doesn't zoom all the time right into the Hulk or the villainous Abomination. They often instead more walk around in the background and the camera doesn't get a clear focus on them, as if it's 'bigfoot' footage, or the Loch Ness monster. This amateur, shaky, unclear looking style that has become recently popular for movies and is a style that I like very much for movies and also truly works out well for this particular movie.<br/><br/>It's a movie that shows that the Hulk and superhero movie genre in particular still has plenty of potential in it. The movie also hints at possible sequels and even for movies in which multiple Marvel comic book heroes are going to team up. I would pay money to see it happen all!<br/><br/>Even though I don't think it's the best the genre has to offer, it simply was a movie that I very much enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

However, even if I am the only one, I was very happy with the first Hulk movie - because of the depth of character shown in it (also thanks to an incredible and totally underrated Eric Bana).<br/><br/>All in all I find the new movie entertaining and I love the special effects... but where did the personality go? To be honest, with any different, less known and less credible actors I probably would have left the cinema during this movie - sorry to say.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it anyway."
"apetitefor","8","2","5","12 July 2008"," It is not incredible but its still a hulk
","As first words, I want to say that when I saw that this movie production involves the name of Edward Norton I was like a machine that is trying to combine two chemical mixtures that just can fit each other. The biggest problem for me was to overcome the prospect to see someone like Norton(who is really a magnificent actor) to start in a movie like that. It was truly a challenge for him and for us- the movie fans. But it all ended being good, like the happy ending we used to see in most of the movies. First of all Norton really fitted in the role, he was good, presenting to the public the complex figure of Bruce Banner- the big green guy.Because portraying a super hero is truly a hard job to do. Even if you are a fan of the particular monster, spider or something else. Maybe the biggest drawback of this movie was that you just can't enjoy the full power of the Hulk. Most of the scenes were really great, the special effects were on its top level, but still the battle's were short. Maybe because there were so intense that i didn't followed the passing time, I don't know, but it just felt like that. In conclusion this movie is far from being incredible, but its still worth to watch. And for most of the Marvel fans, there is maybe a surprise that you would enjoy at the end. But you have to watch at first! ;)"

","WHY??DID??THEY??MAKE??THIS?? This movie is BS and should never have been made, it doesn't stick to the comic at all, and the 'nice' connections to make us believe like Mr. McGee (from TOS) and the piano music when he's hitchhiking (again) aren't fooling me one bit. The storyline is boring, flat and simple, The relationship between the characters gave me the idea to watch another attempt of big egos who think they can do better. If you make fantasy, keep it credible. Extinguishing a kerosene fire by slapping hands... Even in this kind of crap it looks ridiculous and very unconvincing. Ang Lee's Hulk came quite close to the original idea, as is to see on the credit-list, there were some die-hard Marvel guys at work there. This is just a list of supposedly big names, who f''''éd up an already proved-to-be-great story. (Accounting the millions of readers) And what the hell is Abomination doing in here? If that's really him, because my sleepy fellows, ABOMINATION IS ALSO GREEN! He arrived a quite different way than the comic wrote, he shouldn't show it's ugly face for years. This movie is an insult to the cast and crew from the 2003 version, and to us die hard hulk fans. I've been collecting Hulk comics from 1977, so I'm spoiled, I know, but this production I'll consider never being made, and stick to Ang Lee and Eric Bana's version who made THE ONE AND ONLY HULK MOVIE!"
"Prince09","8","2","5","11 July 2008"," Watchable!
","The Incredible Hulk works well for most part. No, its not going to go down as one of those classics that will live timelessly, but ""Watchable"" would probably be the best way to describe it. Edward Norton delivers a fine performance as Bruce Banner and carries the movie on his shoulders, while Liv Tyler, William Hurt and Tim Roth are adequate in limited roles. <br/><br/>The scenes early on in Brazil are well-conceived; I liked the manner in which they trace Bruce Banner to his location in Brazil and the sequence with Blonsky (Tim Roth) chasing Banner over the roof-tops in Brazil. The special effects in the movie are decent for most part - I especially liked a sequence in the middle, where they corner the Hulk in a University. <br/><br/>But the climax, where the Hulk takes on a super-strong monster version of Blonsky (called the Abomination), is a let-down. Since the focus is on Bruce getting cured for about 75% of the movie, the final fight between the monsters doesn't have the right lead-up to it. The scenes leading to the climax are full of clichés and are cringe-worthy. The final fight itself is not so good, with the two monsters seeming right out of a cartoon. Perhaps it is a nod to the comic book, but doesn't sit well with the tone of the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>In a Nutshell: Barring a few scenes and the climax, The Incredible Hulk delivers good popcorn entertainment and is a good way to kill a lazy couple of hours. The fans of the Hulk series and teens will probably enjoy it a lot more, but still, it is a decent motion picture."
"Buddy-51","7","2","5","7 July 2008"," big and loud but with a certain amount of heart
","Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don't already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors). Though far from perfect, that earlier ""Hulk"" was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all). Well, most of that ""problem"" has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem. The good news, though, is that ""The Incredible Hulk"" boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.<br/><br/>For the most part, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today. Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.<br/><br/>Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be ""hulked."" The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV's ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."" The controversy over which of the two ""Hulk"" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come. I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest ""Hulk"" is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level. But thanks to Norton and Tyler, like the Lee version, it has some much-needed soul as well."
"satankitty13","8","2","5","6 July 2008"," It's almost like God compared to the 2003 film...
","First off, Edward Norton is a much better Bruce Banner, and actor than Eric Bana. He gives one of the best performances for a comic book film easily. Their are other great actors in this film such as Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and more. But what makes this movie is obviously the action. It's not even action, it's hyper action. It's like Live Free or Die Hard action. The battles are so intense in this film especially the final fight between the Hulk and Abomination. Now for the story, it is quite entertaining and the dialog works really well. The film is well executed and shows Hulk can do so much more than the atrocity from Ang Lee. Now the flaws in this film are minor, such as how sometimes the CGI Hulk looks incredible but half of the time he looks so unrealistic. Also, there are some parts where the story drags a bit such as the beginning of the film. But besides those small complaints, this is a great summer flick that will be enjoyed by most people but mainly enjoyed by the people who are really into the action genre.<br/><br/>I give The Incredible Hulk: 4/5 or 8/10"
"agonyzer","8","2","5","6 July 2008"," Hulk Smash!!!
","OK, so I thought the Hulk (2003) was pretty good. It used comic panels for scene cuts and montages. It co-starred Jennifer Connelly, my all-time favorite actress ever since Labyrinth. It was cheesy, sure, but so are the comics, at least in the main. The rewrite of the Hulk's origin was pretty flimsy, what with the atomic dad and all. The special effects were great, in spite of a few minor flubs. The design philosophy of the Hulk himself was just bad, though. He was too slow, which was obviously a failed effort to portray his enormity. Overall, the whole thing came across like an old-school comic film: poorly. Mind you, I do own the DVD.<br/><br/>The remake was justified. Miss Connelly was sadly replaced by the over-rated Liv Tyler, which is just a damn shame. Betsy was given a much better role this time around, and deserved more art than little Liv has to offer. Good Dr. Banner, played in the last film by Eric Bana, was this time portrayed with some actual character by dear old Ed Norton. He looks much more the scrawny scientist part and brought some direly needed pathos to the role, as is his wont. I've heard some people declare with ill-deserved authority that the Hulk shouldn't have pathos, to which I can only reply, ""Read more comics.""<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning, the character design of both the Hulk and arch-foe Abomination actually worked, and the combats were orchestrated with expert technique. Ang Lee totally flubbed that on the previous incarnation, which was rather a surprise. This Hulk is smaller, more like the raging greenskin of the seventies and eighties, which I frankly prefer. One of the great points about the Hulk was always his ability to conquer larger, seemingly stronger enemies with brutal will alone. Sure, he's big and strong, but biggest and strongest is frankly Superman territory.<br/><br/>While the plot and character development are much as one would expect, it really shouldn't be any other way. Hulk, after all, smash. I'm not one to throw a spoiler, but there's a bit at the end that's exciting to those of us who watch Marvel Studios with ever-growing anticipation, and this time it slipped in before the credits. There's also a lovely little scene in the wrap-up that should really thrill old-school Hulk readers who understand the unending search for mastery.<br/><br/>And I should also point out that Lou Ferrigno is looking good!<br/><br/>All in all, I would certainly recommend this one be seen in the theater. After all, it's no good to shrink the Incredible Hulk down to your little TV, even if it is a 70"" Bravia.<br/><br/>For the points breakdown, I have to admit one star was lost with Jennifer Connelly. Yes, I like her that much. The other point was dropped for ambiguity. While it didn't bother me much, it seemed like more distinction was needed in the origin. Many viewers will wonder whether this is a remake or a sequel. Call it a remake. Please. The 2003 version was passable, but it has no place on the same continent as this one. Just dump it in the bin with X3 and Daredevil.<br/><br/>'Nuff said."

","The first Hulk movie although had its moments was not the best. Its over development took way too long and rather than showing us a depressing movie , it just ended up being bleak and dull. When I heard Ed Norton had signed up for the role of Bruce Banner I was a bit hesitant at first but then after watching Bale as Batman and Cage as the Ghost Rider I welcomed the idea. After watching it , it easy to understand why Ed Norton can prove he is capable of standing toe to toe with the likes on Jhonny Depp , his ability to completely immerse him-self in a role really captivates. The best part about the The Incredble Hulk is that, it wastes no time getting straight into the action and rather than giving us a depressed man , we are given a desperate one driven. Right from start to finish it was a joy to check out , the special affects were brilliant as the director brings justice to the Hulk by making him the angry rampaging beast that he is rather than some sort of over grown mentally retarded child and truly at times he was scary. Tim Roth , Liv Tyler were both excellent at their roles and the fast pace of the movie truly left you wanting more. Another great thing about this movie was that is kept in spirit of the marvel comic universe and at the same time paid tribute to the original TV series listen to the music very carefully at one point and also starting a cross over into the marvel universe. My only complaint was that a little over cooked CGI made it look a little fake in places but that was me being too picky. To some it up Iron Man was already a great comic book summer flick and then with this realised it means things can only get better?

It's a torture to sit through The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>The first part is entertaining enough. The action sequences are well shot. But 45 minutes into the movie, it all spirals down to a repetitive sequence of the same stunts, the same old junk. Liv Tyler is pretty to look at, but she really needs acing lessons. She holds the same, dazed expression on her face throughout. Edward Norton is probably the only hope, but he fails to rescue the boring plot.<br/><br/>It's almost obvious what turns the story would take. And it's not entertaining enough to watch similar action sequences over & over & over again. You almost wish that they don't start blowing up & bashing up things yet again, but they just don't stop.

"Baldrick44","7","2","5","29 June 2008"," Will tie you over until your next superhero movie
","The Incredible Hulk is the second film to come out of the newly formed Marvel Studios and as such it would always be compared to the phenomenally successful Iron Man. It would be a brave studio then that deviates too much from what seemed like such a winning formula in Iron Man and Hulk doesn't. Like Iron Man, there is questions placed over the morality of armed forces, though more directly in the shape of General Ross ( William Hurt ) and like Iron Man there is a love interest in Liv Tyler playing the part of Elizabeth Ross. Like Iron Man also there is a villain which comes as a sort of deformed reflection of the hero which comes in the form of Emil Blonsky ( Tim Roth ), a Special Ops operative who gets obsessed with the idea of becoming bigger and better. Furthermore, like Iron Man it has a very commendable lead, with Edward Norton playing the tortured Dr Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>So surely it should be a great movie like the aforementioned metal dude. Well unfortunately, the one thing that the Hulk lacks that Iron Man oozes with is charm. This is a superhero movie that isn't really dark enough to taken totally seriously and so it badly needs the odd one liner or two. Unfortunately though, while in Iron Man they are fast and furious, in Hulk they are very, VERY sparse. Then there is the fact that Bruce Banner simply is not as likable as Tony Stark is, and the flaws which make Stark so endearing are nowhere to be seen- nor is anything else for that matter.<br/><br/>But the Incredible Hulk has still got some nice fight sequences ( though being the Hulk they do seem to entail finding different ways to smash things...) as well as some nice acting. This will at least keep you sated until THe Dark KNight if nothing else."
"DonFishies","7","2","5","28 June 2008"," Better than I expected, but still could have used improvement
","Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Ang Lee's Hulk. Yeah, there was not nearly as much action as any other comic film at the time (or since), but the psychological undertaking that Lee envisioned for the character, to me, worked out quite well. It was boring at times, but it was a much more artistically driven attempt at a comic character that we probably will never see again.<br/><br/>So enter The Incredible Hulk, a sequel/reimagining of sorts. The film picks up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil, searching for a cure to his ""disease"". The American government are still searching for him of course, and he is still trying to stay as far away as he can from them.<br/><br/>What is interesting about this film, is that if they had done away from the flashback sequences detailing how Banner became the Hulk, it could have easily been a flashier sequel to Lee's original film. But unfortunately (or fortunately for most), the basic skeleton of a storyline is just about the only thing that holds these two films in the same realm of contemporary comic film adaptations.<br/><br/>As said, this film is incredibly (no pun intended) flashier than the original. There are three huge action sequences involving the Hulk himself, and at least two other sequences where the Hulk appears not fighting others. These lengthy actions scenes are fairly well filmed, and nearly flawless in their use of CGI. The Hulk interacts with his environments excellently, and there was very little by way of him looking fake (whereas Lee's film struggled in a few scenes to make him look real). Making him smaller is an obvious help to the creators, and clearly allows for better character interactions. I was actually genuinely impressed by the action set pieces, and marvelled at how far special effects have come since Lee's film (obviously, he does not need to be hidden in shadows throughout the majority of his appearances).<br/><br/>What is also done well is how nostalgic the film feels. Yes, Lee had Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee show up, but that was about it. Here, director Louis Leterrier has added the two of them back into the mix, but as more than just small cameos. They actually have parts to play in the story, and Ferrigno even gets to voice the Hulk again. Not to mention the use of the theme song from the 1970's television series.<br/><br/>But for anyone looking for any sort of exposition, they may be in for a bit of a disappointment.<br/><br/>The story is interesting (about as much as a film that is primarily dictated by being an extended chase can be), and not just a typical sequel story. But it never delves into anyone's motivations for their actions. There is never a real reason why Banner wants to be cured, other than to lead a normal life. No reason for Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) to get Banner back to the US, other than to retrieve what he believes to be ""government property"". No reason for Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to go to the extremes he does, other than to take out the Hulk. It just seems all very one-dimensionally based, and any interactions just seem to be placed to move the film from one action piece to the next. Hell, as amazing as the actions scenes are, they seem extended simply to avoid having the characters engage in any development (outside of dropping obvious things that people who already know something about the Hulk would know).<br/><br/>For all the controversy leading up to the film's release, even to the naked eye, it looks like Norton is being held back in lieu of his green CGI counterpart. He never gets a real attempt to chew scenery, and never looks comfortable in any of his scenes. His brilliant repertoire of films suggest that he would have truly made something of this role, but it looks like it was either cut out, or he just failed to take the time to even try. Any character building scenes he has (especially when interacting with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) are either cut short, or begin and end faster than they started. I will say that his emotions and body language do a lot for his character, but unfortunately, not nearly enough to make this role be on par with anything he has ever done in the past.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is much the same. Roth really makes at attempt at making Blonsky to truly feel villainous, but he just seems too over-the-top to make it seem like anything other than a villain straight from the pages of a Hulk comic. I liked him in the role, but he too could have done with a bit more backstory and motivations for his later actions. Hurt is great as always, but only because he has very little to do with the material he is given. His obvious relationship (or lack thereof) with Tyler's character is almost entirely missing and we never truly understand his actions outside of their obviousness. Tyler is almost entirely devoid of anything to make her character feel worthwhile at all, and Tim Blake Nelson's character feels tacked on as a mere indication of a sequel.<br/><br/>It may sound like I hated the film, but it was so much more enjoyable than I imagined it would be. Leterrier had a huge undertaking to make his film feel completely different than Lee's, and whether I like his alternate vision or not, it cannot be said that he did not do a hell of a job making it come to life. It does not help that the film merely feels like a piece in the grand scheme of Marvel's attempts to bring an Avengers movie to life, but the film merely makes the most of what it was given. And it only could have been better if it was given more.<br/><br/>7/10."

","I can't say that this film blew me away but I must give credit to the producers and actors who made it a much better version than any previous attempts.<br/><br/>The romantic parts were a little overdrawn and found no problem taking bathroom breaks during those portions.<br/><br/>The film seems to borrow a little from a lot of other action films. I can see elements of King Kong, the Bourne films, First Blood, and others.<br/><br/>But it is a 10 of 10 if you are a Hulkster. If you are not I would rate it 6 of 10."

","I knew that this movie would be on the same lines of Iron Man, Spider man etc. with the latest hi-tech visual effects; just for the change of having one more hero on the big screen doing incredible things, I went to see Incredible Hunk.<br/><br/>Dr.Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is experimented on plasma cells by US defence to develop super - HERO soldier out of humans; things go wrong  and Bruce becomes an incredible huge monster and escapes the lab. The experiment leaves a pattern to Bruce's behavior  that whenever he gets angry he turns to an incredible hulk. The US defence is out to get him back. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is so fascinated while seeing, facing and fighting the Incredible Hulk  that he wants to be one. The result is - he becomes a Monster Hulk, and in the end, Incredible Hulk fights the monster Hulk to save New York City. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) plays the love angel of Bruce.<br/><br/>There is not much to the movie except the incredible action sequences and fights. They are a treat to enjoy on big screen. Edward Norton is okay, Tim Roth is better as a villain and Liv Tyler  whenever she comes on the screen  distracts the attention by her big upper lip. I had mentioned in my earlier review that she might have done plastic surgery or botox; there are many who think that way  but we do not know for sure; and would not be interested to know. The fact is that whatever her acting  her lips are a hindrance to her acting skills  if she has any. Coming back to movie This is Director Louis Leterrier third movie after Transporter 2. He has done good job to raise the bar from a B-grade movie to at least an A-grade look. The cinematography of Brazil Rio de Janeiro is breath-taking and wonderful.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good and better adaptation of the comic novel and previous film. With possibility of Iron Man joining hands with Incredible Hulk  we would wait for that movie next time.<br/><br/>Go and see it if you are an action movie or Super-human type of the movie addict. You will enjoy it.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.0 out of 10)"

"Carycomic","10","2","5","15 June 2008"," More of a remake than a sequel
","When I first saw the 2003 version, starring Eric Bana, I gave it 3.1 stars out of a possible five (with five=the best).<br/><br/>This version gets _all_ five.<br/><br/>For starters, we have a condensed origin/montage that's more reminiscent of the 1970's TV series than the 2003 movie. Absolutely no mention, or depiction, of Nick Nolte as the mad geneticist-father of Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Then, there's the series of tie-ins with the recently-released ""IRON MAN"" flick. Equipment bearing the label of ""Stark Industries;"" a cyberspace patch with the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on it; and an uncredited cameo by RDJ, himself.<br/><br/>Last, but not least? We have the angst and poignancy that is a mandatory part of any decent Hulk story. A prime example is the segment where Betty Ross finds out that Bruce is back in the Big Apple. When he discovers that she's moved on with her private life (in the form of psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Samson), he tries to stay away. But, when they accidentally glimpse each other, she pursues him. Picking him up on a rainy stretch of highway in a reunion scene that you'd have to be a ""Star Trek"" Vulcan to sit through with dry eyes.<br/><br/>The main villain this time around, though, is Emil Blonsky. Relative English newcomer Tim Roth (well, he's new to me) plays him as a professional covert-operations commando who prides himself on being one of the toughest men in the world. That is; until Bruce ""Hulks out"" on him, down in Brazil. He then becomes obsessed with getting a rematch on equal terms. And, he has very little trouble persuading Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross to arrange just that.<br/><br/>As played by William Hurt, Ross is even more of an unsympathetic super-patriot than Sam Elliot's version was. Perhaps, because Hurt might have been drawing on the same sinister streak that made him so frighteningly believable as Kevin Costner's alter-ego in ""MR. BROOKS.""<br/><br/>Either way; much as I enjoyed Eric Bana's portrayal of the Hulk, five years ago, Edward Norton's was twice as good. And, if you're wondering if Marvel Studios is already at work on sequel? Take a close look at Mr. Blue's forehead after Blonksy becomes the Abomination.<br/><br/>That's all I'm saying...till then. ;-)"
"dvanosdol","9","2","5","14 June 2008"," Hulk.... Smash!!!!
","This movie was awesome! For those who think this movie to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 The Hulk... think again. This movie is a reboot, and a freakin good one too. The Incredible Hulk is more or less progressed with the story, not the characters. Edward Norton is far better than Eric Bana as Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Liv Tyler is not bad as Bruce Banner's girlfriend, Betty Ross, but for some reason and I don't know why, but I like Jennifer Connelly as her in Ang Lee's version better. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy, Emil Blonsky a.k.a. Abomination and the William Hurt plays General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, who isn't half bad at the part. Bruce Banner has been on the run for five years and he lives in South Americ, trying to find a cure for what turns him into the big, green, fighting machine. The U.S. Army finds him and he has to go back to the United States to find the cure. He meets up with his old girlfriend Betty and they go to this scientist who Bruce had been talking to on his computer so he could help him find a cure. Emil Blonsky, after going up against the Hulk twice for the U.S. Army, wants to become as strong as he is. After Bruce and Betty are taken away in a helicopter, the scientist, Dr. Samuel Sterns who becomes the Leader, a villain, in the comics, injects Emil with the same stuff Bruce has in him. Emil becomes Abomination and he and the Hulk fight in a battle that is full of smashing and punching and kicking and more punching and so on and so forth. The action scenes in this movie are some of the best I've seen in most comic book movie adaptations. The story may not be all that great, but this is definitely a movie for action film lovers to go see."

"wolverinesforever","8","2","5","14 June 2008"," Tighty-paced ride; great entertainment
","I never saw Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" so I can't make comparisons. What I can say is that Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a good action romp that is definitely worth any action movie fan's $7.00 at the theater. This is an effective companion piece to Marvel's ""Iron Man"", providing action and thrills and a whole lot of on-screen fun that only a character like the Hulk can bring.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward: Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is the victim of a military experiment gone wrong and now must evade General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and the U.S. Army, who want Bruce as a weapon. Also involved in the hunt is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a rouge soldier who is bent on doing almost anything to get after Banner. Also caught in the fray is Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), who helps the fugitive Bruce when they run into each other at a university in Virginia.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that this is more of an action movie than an origin story. Those who come in expecting something ""smart"" may be disappointed. That's not to say ""The Incredible Hulk"" is poorly made; to the contrary it is a well put together thrill ride with many moments of suspense and anticipation. Whenever Bruce is desperately trying to evade capture, you feel his anguish. You feel his pain, yet realizing that at any moment, the beast will come out. Credit for this has to go to the consistent Edward Norton, who can now add his name to the list of great superheroes such as Robert Downey Jr. and Christian Bale. What director Louis Leterrier has done here is made a well-paced thrill ride, one that grabs your attention from the opening credits until the closing credits. In this sense, it is more like an old school action movie, one where you just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>But like other action movies, there are problems. Only Norton and Roth really get to shine as actors, and you have your usual far-fetched occurrences (Banner sure seems to get from place to place easily). There are a couple underdeveloped subplots that would have been better omitted; likely because of Universal trimming the project (hopefully we will see the intended cut). But in all honesty, these are minor quibbles. With movies like these you've got to look at the big picture, and from where I'm sitting, the picture looks great. Leterrier and Norton set out to create a thrill ride, and they have achieved just that. ""The Incredible Hulk"" provides us with the summer fun that many of us have come to love. This, coupled with ""Iron Man"" does indeed create a great duo for the summer of '08, and will make almost everyone forget about Marvel's disappointments from last year. All in all, another great time at the theater, and probably a film worth a second viewing.<br/><br/>One final note, if you are thinking about waiting for the movie to come out on DVD, you are making a huge mistake. ""The Incredible Hulk"" must be seen in the theater. The widescreen action and the surround sound make this perfect entertainment that can only be enjoyed best with the company of others watching the big screen."
"SLASHerMan","7","2","5","14 June 2008"," Packs a punch (and not just fight-wise)
","At the very beginning there were some issues with the projector, so the opening title sequence was sadly never seen in its ""full glory"". But once the movie got rolling, it was surprisingly captivating.<br/><br/>Edward Norton really gives us his Hulk-film - and as involved with every facet of it, he delivered a damn good one. The story is a simple one - even if you're not a fan, you could probably tell us what it's about in less than five minutes. But here it's (finally...) told with characters you feel for and care about. The humor is almost subtle, not overplayed, so it's funny without getting ""goofy"". The score and emotion is also beautiful - has there ever been a better suited main theme? It also has little in-nods (including four cameos of sorts and three other Marvel references) which is great to see.<br/><br/>Edward Norton as David Banner plays to the part that matters. Loneliness, isolation, slight obsession (maybe desperation). He's picking up what Bill Bixby did so great, and paying homage to it. Liv Tyler is usually all smiles, but when her emotions get going, they hit you where it matters. I was skeptical about Tim Roth, but for the most part he does just what he should be doing.<br/><br/>The action is loud and frantic, and the mostly CGI fight scenes were probably the biggest letdown of the whole thing. For me it's really worked out as a dramatic story with action, not an action movie with hints of drama. So after going through it with the characters, you mostly just find ""oh, it's time for another fight I guess"". (But I'll admit a few moments in particular satisfied the 8-year old Hulk-fan within).<br/><br/>If your choice is between The Happening and this, you might find as I did, that (maybe surprisingly) The Incredible Hulk tells a really involving and exciting story, while The Happening remains pretty hollow.<br/><br/>Give this not-so-jolly green giant a chance, folks. It's a truly entertaining movie-going experience."
"jfcthejock","8","2","5","14 June 2008"," A Decent Superhero Fantasy
","Well what can I say, this is an age of mediocre fantasy films and tales of superheroes and many do not yield to become good films. The Incredible Hulk is without a doubt a success, maybe due to the fact that they casted Edward Norton as the big, mean, green monster or maybe unlike the Eric Banner film of the same name back in 2003 it has a good plot and story. <br/><br/>Whatever the reason this film came out on top against Ironman, it had a good cast and plot and of course it wasn't laden with over the top graphics of CGI. This film has a good concept and does well with it through a good cast and almost blinding graphics. I liked this film, Edward Norton was great and even Liv Tyler was good enough to make the film feel that bit more real. This is not just a film for the Marvel fan, but an audience even bigger than just that."
"moviewizguy","6","2","5","14 June 2008"," Is It Really That Good?
","Depicting the events after the Gamma Bomb. 'The Incredible Hulk' tells the story of Dr Bruce Banner, who seeks a cure to his unique condition, which causes him to turn into a giant green monster under emotional stress. Whilst on the run from military which seeks his capture, Banner comes close to a cure. But all is lost when a new creature emerges; The Abomination.<br/><br/>Compared to this year's ""Iron Man,"" also released by Marvel, you can tell why that's the better movie than ""The Incredible Hulk."" I can't compare this film to Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" because I've forgotten all about it but as a movie for its own, I was expecting much more (probably because 'Iron Man' was so good).<br/><br/>The movie starts off really fast, much like ""Fantastic Four."" You don't get a chance to know the characters. It just starts off and minutes later, you find people chasing the main character, Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton. Well, they then changed their mind within the first few minutes to finally show us some characterization. Apart from that, this film is really mediocre.<br/><br/>The pacing is all over the place. The Hulk looks more or less CGI-ish. There's one scene where you can tell they want you to make it look real and it kind of does, because it gives off a rubber-ish effect. The action scenes was a let down. Even the showdown in the end between the Hulk and the Abomination was so disappointing because it felt like a video game. If you like it that way, it's fine by me.<br/><br/>However, the movie was fairly entertaining. Some may be disappointed by the dialog-filled scenes in the first 30 minutes of the film because they just want to see the Hulk. Edward Norton does a decent job as the Hulk. Liv Tyler did a well job as his girlfriend and Tim Roth did a decent job as well.<br/><br/>See it in theaters? Well, I think you should wait for it on DVD. Yes, there's a Tony Stark cameo but for that, you don't have to see the movie right this moment. Some of the action scenes wee a little entertaining and overall, it's just mediocre, I'm sorry to say. Watch ""Iron Man,"" instead, a much better movie."

","""The Incredible Hulk"" clearly this time around is a much better version than the one that Ang Lee made in 2003. As this time we see a film blended with more comedy, action, and less dramatization. From the start we see Ed Norton looking graceful and well prepared as he fits the role perfect for Bruce Banner the research scientist turned angry Hulk who will hide out in the slums of Brazil. Plus a good theme of character study is shown as Banner must do his own anger management control. Banner himself we see as a conflicted man not wanting the power of the Hulk yet his power is wanted by the service of the army enter Gen. Ross(William Hurt)who plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon in which leads to a showdown that goes across the globe. Memories are brought back by old ""Hulk"" fans as Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee have cameos. All during this action feast the Hulk is a rampaging force that can blast off even the biggest and baddest weapons the military has. Good chemistry is found in the film with his love interest Betty Ross as Liv Tyler does a fine job. Overall a better take on the green giant it's worth a watch if you want to see some roaring action."
"Jay_Exiomo","7","2","5","13 June 2008"," More blam, less blah
","I may be in the minority here, but I did like Ang Lee's take on ""Hulk"". I appreciated how it chose to be introspective and how it traded off much of the action for character study of a tortured individual. But I also know that such attempt, however earnest, seems more at home with art theaters and film festivals (or at least with late year releases) than with mainstream theaters in summer packed with audience looking for nothing more than a big popcorn movie. Thus, this immediate reboot of this Marvel comic book franchise.<br/><br/>Now helmed by ""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier, ""The Incredible Hulk"" completely ignores the existence of the 2003 film - heart, introspection and all - and goes for a more action-packed route. It's what fans are clamoring and the film delivers in that regard - it's definitely bigger, faster, and stronger.<br/><br/>Edward Norton now plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who exposed himself to gamma rays during an experiment gone awry, and now turns into a rampaging green giant when angry or overexcited. Now he's on the lam because the father of his flame Betty Ross (a wooden Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt), wants what's inside of him to build a team of superhuman soldiers. When General Ross tracks Banner in a Brazilian shanty town, he sends eager test subject Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to chase Banner and bring him back. More colossal action scenes and nods to the Marvel Universe ensue.<br/><br/>Despite the low risk approach and a pretty much straightforward plot line, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has its merits. The film clocks in at less than two hours and for most of its running time, it manages to be entertaining. The CGI is serviceable and Edward Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, though with the script's lightweight treatment on his character, much of the inner conflict is gone and non-action scenes are more of obligatory fillers Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn are too eager to be done with. Incidentally Norton, who is reported to have done rewrites with the script, is unhappy with the final cut, but then...<br/><br/>I'm not going to be hypocritical and say the absence of profound inward contemplation made the film less enjoyable. It does, to some degree, but all things considered, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has everything a fan of the series could ask for a summer movie: more smashing and less talking."

I watched all of em ,except Fantastic 4 movies,and I can clearly say that, Incredible Hulk is the best of all.<br/><br/>I was shocked when I heard that Edward Norton was going to be Banner. I knew that Norton is a good actor, but he was too good to act Banner. You know, in Fight Club, in American History X, he was amazing. Hulk would be an simple action film. Why would he was chosen? Well, this is the point where I'm totally wrong.<br/><br/>Edward Norton isn't just the actor, also the writer. You see that difference in every moment, you are not watching a decent action film. You really watch Banner on screen, not someone-who-supposed-to-be-Banner. He really fit himself on the Banner.<br/><br/>If you are not decided to see that movie, just do it.

"RikerDonegal","7","3","10","13 June 2008"," It's good. Lots of action, not much story or character development. But lots of action.
","It is structured as follows: chase, battle, short pause for talk, chase, battle, short pause for talk, big battle, the end. So, they may have set the bar a bit low, but they have certainly achieved their target. And it must be said that the few short scenes of character development are very good and make me wish Norton had won his battle to make it a longer film. Roll on the DVD release! (The blu-ray version will have 70 minutes of extra footage, according to the director!) But, missing scenes aside, what we do get is still good. Sure, it's not Iron Man, but then it's not trying to be. More than anything else, it's just trying hard to be different from the previous Hulk film (which I loved). This film wants to entertain you every step of the way, so it rarely pauses for breath. Somebody is always running, jumping and hitting someone else. And the producers are hoping you are invested enough in the characters as it is, without them stopping to talk very much about what is happening to them.<br/><br/>And it mostly works. We do know these characters, so we do care. And even if we don't know who they are we can see that Banner looks sad, keeps staring at a picture of pretty girl and has a nice dog, so we are going to like him. And Blonsky shows up and is mean to the dog, so we know to dislike him! (It's not rocket science, people. Pay attention!!) The film also manages to tie itself to the superb Bill Bixby television series in a million different ways (something the previous film chose not to do). Which makes it seem like a very humble film, approaching us with head bowed offering gifts to please us. The first film is a favourite of mine, but it wasn't a crowd-pleaser. This one has a real air of ""Hey, sorry about that. Look, there's more to the Hulk than that. He smashes stuff! Remember the old TV series? The Hulk can be fun!"" And...<br/><br/>It was.

","Having read some reviews before I saw it, I thought this film was going to be absolutely terrible, but it was not nearly so bad as people were making out. I think a lot of people were expecting far too much in terms of depth of character, and for every detail and relationship between characters to exactly reflect the thinking of the original comic writers. Well that might have pleased the comic fanatics, but it isn't going to fill the cinemas with the easily-entertained masses.<br/><br/>I have never read a Hulk comic, but I am a massive fan of the 70's/early 80's TV series with Bill Bixby. Hence I disliked the first Hulk film of 2003 very much.<br/><br/>I was expecting more of the same with this film, but was surprised to see that it did resemble the sort of dumb-ass Hulk entertainment that I know and love much more than the first film.<br/><br/>Ed Norton made a quite good David Banner - same sort of down-trodden far too nice born victim, and not too far off Bill Bixby's character. He looked quite hard in American History X, but now looks like Mr Puniverse.<br/><br/>Tim Roth - I can never take him seriously no matter what he does, since seeing him in 'Made In Britain' screaming ""Oi, I want my lunch!"" at Borstal canteen staff. His character, and indeed the stupid-looking second monster - which resembled Skeletor after taking a huge overdose of steroids - were rather unnecessary and added little to the film.<br/><br/>The plot was OK without looking too deeply at some of the ridiculous exploits of the hulk - such as running virtually all the way from Brazil to Mexico in one night, and the usual unlikely way in which Banner's trousers can be expanded to the size of a house, yet still remain in one piece.<br/><br/>I do wish that they would use a human actor to play the Hulk instead of this computer-generated rubbish. The hulk in this film just looked totally unbelievable and little like anything that a human could have possibly changed into. The Lou Ferrigno hulk was (relatively) believable and far more convincing and frightening than some 15 foot tall looney-toon.<br/><br/>The other thing that was missing and I wish it would be reinstated is the ""DING!"" sound when Banner's metamorphosis commences. It just isn't the same without that.<br/><br/>I have given it 6/10. I'd probably watch it again if it was on TV."

","Now, I'm a little bit curious. Am I the only one who thinks this script was incredibly lame? Apparently so, for no one else here seems to disagree on any level with it. Let me take this occasion to lay out some of my concerns for you: First of all, they started the thing with a huge montage, in order to get done most of the exposition they must have been afraid would take them half of the movie otherwise. Fine, the advent of The Hulk was displayed thoroughly in 2003's ""Hulk"", but still. Though I really don't know much about The Hulk, I'm rather confident I could have taken these revelations in a more subtle way.<br/><br/>Overally, the way exposition was handled throughout the movie didn't engage me at all. A typical case of ""on the nose"" writing, it mostly lacked any kind of subtext which would have been necessary in order to strengthen both plot and performances. It's not that they didn't try to avoid a lot of lengthy back story revelation, but still less would have been more, and so especially the antagonistic dialog came across as increasingly tedious. More focus on Banner's side of the story might have helped. After all, the climactic battle between The Hulk and The Abomination was more than obvious from the first time we grasped Blonsky's intentions. What else did their subplot offer? A ruthless father figure? Oh, yeah, that too. Other than that, the second act specifically had this really annoying stain. You know, how they like to screw it up altogether. Kinda felt like that.<br/><br/>Then, another thing: Why am I still carefree about all the things that happened or might ever happen to the protagonists in the future? It may have something to do with weak turning points which, though present at some points throughout the plot, in the end delivered me a character which didn't change in any direction. He ended up being in just exactly the same position he was at the beginning of this movie, only locality changed. What does he know now that he didn't know before? Betty loves him, alright, but obviously that was true all along the way, never shattered, and the army is still after him.<br/><br/>Even the climactic decision, his alleged crisis whether to fight The Abomination or flee was, in fact, basically a ""to do or not to do"" decision, featuring no inner conflict at all. For someone who's basically invincible, what's at stake? At least, I never felt like he was truly in danger, so even if that would have been the case, the script somehow failed to transport the message. Delivering on that premise was a climactic fight that made my mind wander to the one featured in Marvel's last effort, ""Iron Man"", which is, hands down, one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So I'm left wondering why the treats of ""Iron Man"" worked so well for me, when, comparing it's basic storyline with the one of ""The Incredible Hulk"", there's really not much of a difference to begin with. Could it have something to do with afore mentioned issues? Only: hell, yeah! At this point, I could share some more facts I didn't dig about this movie, like bland scene transitions, flimsy sound mix (especially score), CGI overuse, spontaneous decline into profanity featuring unintended humor, etc. But I guess it is time to drop some good news as well, after all, I still gave it six stars out of ten. So, photography was lush, of course, the only thing that kept up my interest was the nice camera work and the amazingly well done composition of the material. After last weeks ""Hancock"" experience a real calmer. CGI did blend in nicely, no doubt, if not as great as it did in ""Iron Man"" (again, hands smoothly down). The acting was pretty decent, Tyler and Norton great choices, only Hurt didn't convince me this time. Lighting and overall mood was satisfying, if nothing special, I assume. And yes, also the screenplay didn't completely suck, it just could have been a lot better, is all I'm saying. There was even one moment I liked, watch out for Liv Tyler's scissoring skills (totally not the way you think).<br/><br/>Well, closing this report I have to confess - though you might already have guessed it - that my primary attention was all turned towards the writing, which just happens to be my favorite subject (though usually in German, I truly hope you're forgiving readers). Alright, resolution-time! Did my recommendation for this movie survive this reviews devastating downs and minor ups? In a way, yes. Basically, same goes as usual. If you're looking for a thrill ride and aren't in any way interested in anything I've said so far, please give it a shot. If you don't care about The Hulk right now and want it to stay this way, you have two options, either watch it, or don't watch it. Really, it doesn't matter. If you like stories and superb acting, go get a copy of Kramer Vs Kramer and stay at home. Totally worth it.<br/><br/>Whatever your choice, may the force be with you! Wait. This reminds me of something else. Ah, yeah. Seen the trailer already? Well, expect this very review with minor changes, but obviously copy and pasted, coming to your galaxy soon..."
"JoeKarlosi","5","2","6","5 July 2008"," The Incredible Hulk (2008) **
","** out of ****<br/><br/>Laying my cards right out on the table here, I have long been a big fan of ""THE INCREDIBLE HULK"" -- the comic book, I mean; not the old Bill Bixby TV show (which didn't get the comics right), and I'll pull no punches in stating that I hated the other HULK film (by Ang Lee) which was released only a few years back. So it was only fitting that a second attempt was made to try and capture a more respectable representation of Marvel's iconic ""Green Goliath"". The results here are a little better, but that's still not saying much because it too misses the essence of the original comic book character. It all boils down to a matter of personal preference, and it seems that Hollywood is trying to satiate the expectations of those who grew up with the Bill Bixby variety of Hulkiness from the TV series. Which means that we get ""ol' Jade-Jaws"" as little more than an angry, roaring, enraged monster. It's a tragedy that filmmakers overlook the potential of the original Hulk comic character, who actually articulated with speech and therefore was able to come across as a more sympathetic, albeit child-like, character. There's more to the Hulk than just going ""RRRAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!"".<br/><br/>Edward Norton is physically a good choice to play a rather dweeby-looking Bruce Banner, if we're reflecting back to the old comic books (though we're not with this movie ... at least not very much). His love interest, Betty Ross, is also well-cast in Liv Tyler. She doesn't have much to do in the movie but that's okay since Betty was a nothing character in the comics as well. William Hurt is a pretty good Thunderbolt Ross, Betty's father and the General who's out to capture the Hulk ... though in the film he's way too villainous for his own evil purposes, where in the comics he was mostly apprehending Greenskin for the good of his country and to protect his daughter.<br/><br/>One of Hulk's most enduring adversaries turns up in this new movie, The Abomination. There's not much to say about Tim Roth, who plays the human side of this creature until he later becomes a computer generated figure (along with the cartoony Hulk). These two titans get to clash, but it's all CGI fisticuffs, and now's as good a time as any to address this current cinematic problem. Why this reliance on computer animated characters when an actor could work out nicely, and appear more real? Lou Ferrigno might have looked funny 30 years ago in green body makeup, but prosthetics have come a long way since that time. As originally conceived, The Hulk need not be as humongous in size as these movies make him out to be (the original comics have him at only 7 feet), so he's not much bigger than The Thing from the Fantastic Four. They had the right idea in those FF films by having The Thing played by a real actor in a body suit. So they could have found an actor large enough to play The Hulk, and then perhaps CG-tweaked him a little, if he's to be larger.<br/><br/>But ultimately, the cartoonishness of the Hulk and The Abomination is not what topples this house of cards anyway. It's because this feels like just an ""average"" comic book film, without much of a story and not enough of the Hulk as a communicative lost soul. Think of the lonely speaking Frankenstein monster from BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN... this is the type of Hulk a movie of this type needs. I will say that, at the very least, THE INCREDIBLE HULK manages to provide its star with a few words... the patented ""Hulk Smash!!"" and maybe one other, from what I remember. And there ARE brief moments where we do sense a twinge of sympathy and come to care about this green galoot... just a tiny bit. It was a hint of what could have been, had anyone in charge considered that there is more potential for this character than they think. ** out of ****"

Edward Norton was totally miscast. Too wimpy. Too hurt little boy looking. Liv Tyler, she of the big botox upper lip, was also way too tall for him. < 3. The Hulk's face looked like a cross between Michael J. Fox and Ray Liotta. Not scary at all, unless little boy faces scare you. Just a little boy Bluto head on top of a Lou Ferrigno on mutant monster steroids body, just an everyday green body you see all the time. < 4. Why did the Hulk have to roar like a gorilla or a lion all the time? Just for scares? Didn't work. Not with that little boy face. And, people, even Hulk/people, don't do that all the time where I live. < 5. If bullets and bombs, etc. couldn't take him out, how could the Hulk hurt his little headie-poo by bumping it on a cave ceiling? < 6. The movie set up yet another sequel so obviously and shamelessly it could have been a classroom case study on ""what not to do when ending a good film"", except for Hollywood blockbuster action filmmakers only caring about all the money they make from kids now and on the endless sequels, even if it is their parent's money. What do they care? < 7. This was the very last Hulk I will pay for. Seen it all."

This country has done to much for its people to grind it into the earth and even if a movie is well done, if it does that is stinks. Not really any morals involved and I personally prefer it when a movie has some sort of good moral because there are not enough of them in America or any other country.

","Wow. I have to admit that this is the first time I spend two hours watching a movie, where nothing is happening for 90% of the time.<br/><br/>The first hour was so eventful I decided to take a nap... only to be shoved by a mate minutes later telling me it's the break and we should go get a coke. A quick look around the theatre confirmed my suspicions - just about everyone had the shocked look of ""we've actually paid $10 to watch this?!"" on their faces.<br/><br/>The second half was marginally better. And by marginally, I mean that there were, at least, some cool scenes. Even though overall it was quite predictable, and the ending could be seen from miles away. I could tolerate it if they were trying to push this off as a pilot and fishing for a TV series (a-la ""Riverworld""), but as a movie it's just disappointing.<br/><br/>Oh, and while I can buy a military operation in the middle of Nowhere, Brazil, shouldn't a heavy gun battle in a college, and then in New York, of all places, have raised at least a few heads amongst the civilian population? But they just seem happy to get smashed/stepped on/crushed/shot by the main characters. Save your money."
"computerval","6","2","6","19 June 2008"," above average, kind like sequel of Ang Lee's Hulk
","I would give 5 if it's not for all those cheap computer animations. It does feels like a sequel to Ang Lee's Hulk because it begins exactly at the point where Ang Lee ended the last Hulk...He went to south America and keep telling people don't make him angry stuff. Plus it copied some parts from previous Hulk also. For example, the bullet bouncing skin, the magic underpants, the white hair white mustache warmonger general, going 1 on 1 with the military(again), even the animation character also look alike too. Many parts were like the remake of the previous Hulk movie. Also it took ""Mr. Gray"" from Dreamcatcher(2003) and use it as Mr. Blue and Mr. Green. One part where Hulk sit with his girl on the cliff reminded me of King Kong somehow. The writers must saw that movie too.<br/><br/>How about the story? The 2/3 part is like Jackie Chan movie where he was just being chasing around, except this time it's Mr. Bourne on Barry Bond's super steroid. The last 1/3 part of the movie made no sense at all. The bad guy just decided to ruin the town for no reason? Made no sense. I guess some people like it because of the big bang theory even it has no story at all.<br/><br/>In summary I still like Ang Lee's Hulk better because it got more characters, more stories in it, not just endless bang bang crash crash. This movie really got no stories in it, it's just an cheap extended version of previous Hulk mixed with more computer animation actions and then added with an meaningless ending, probably the writers were out of ideas on how to end the movie."

It was better than I expected (which isn't asking much after the last movie version)...<br/><br/>If you've seen Iron man recently then you'll probably prefer that but this film does a lot to redeem the hulk as a respect worthy comic book character in film format.<br/><br/>I look forward to the obvious sequel...!!<br/><br/>It appears I need 10 lines to get this comment posted so I'll suggest you review my YouTube account RodHullIAmHim and watch the Michael More interview with Stewart Lee as I believe the Hulk is mentioned and maybe it's time to see a Swamp Thing film for the same reasons this film was made...? i.e. they were all rubbish before so let's make a good one...<br/><br/>Basically, this is a good one, don't pay too much but you'll probably enjoy it anyway...<br/><br/>I liked it."
"dont_b_so_BBC","5","2","6","17 June 2008"," The Monster-Movie Version of Hulk
","This for me was the live-action MTV-styled re-make of the old campy cartoon version of Hulk. It essentially consists of 3 action sequences heavily underscored with music that tells the audience what they should feel, interspersed with exposition scenes so basic that the cast (with the likes of William Hurt, Edward Norton, etc.) can't really do anything with it-- complete with a predictable plot that makes all the other summer blockbuster movies of 2008 look smart by comparison.<br/><br/>But were the action sequences worth it? I'd say it yes, if that's the only thing you came for (and I admit I loved the ""Hulk Smash!"" bit). I didn't even mind clock-watching in-between the action sequences when the phoned-in (un)dramatic performances made me groan-- at my age I am no longer such a fan of the cartoon Hulk or the campy characterizations in this movie.<br/><br/>So this is almost the exact opposite of the moody old live-action TV series or Ang Lee's 2003 movie version of Hulk, where Banner spends more time in human than in Hulk form and you get some kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde drama. The 2008 Hulk is Frankestein-styled movie, where you go just to watch the monster do his stuff, and any drama is directed MTV style so as not to slow the movie down."

Edward Norton was a great choice to play as Bruce B. - the main character - which is a really rare thing in comic's super hero movies. Edward is capable of showing the depth the character has, even if the scrip simplifies Banner's choices a little. Unlike the first movie, this one nailed it. While I don't know what happened to the first ""Hulk"" that, in spite of the great actors is really what i consider one of the worse movies I've ever seen, followed closely by Batman and Robin, ""The Incredible Hulk"" measures up to it's name...

They certainly tried to make him a lot more scary in it with his animalistic growling etc and he does make the previous version seem tame in comparison.<br/><br/>The action was at it's best during the end battle between the hulk and the abomination, it was quite quite long and the most exciting part of the film.<br/><br/>The thing I liked best about it, being a fan of the original series was the references, they were quite a few of them.<br/><br/>Although overall not a perfect film, it's still quite satisfying and more entertaining than the previous Hulk film."

But the main reason why the film isn't remembered much nowadays is because the film admittedly lacks much of a connection with the franchise now that Mark Ruffalo has taken over the role of Bruce Banner AKA 'The Hulk'. However, Edward Norton was a pretty good Banner prior to that. And whereas Ang Lee's 'Hulk' film was a bit too melodramatic, dark, and slow-paced, this film benefits from being more action-focused and a much lighter atmosphere. Sure that comes at the cost of the script (Norton and director Louis Leterrier were forced to cut a good chunk of scenes out (where's that director's cut?) under pressure not to be like the 2003 'Hulk') but with solid action sequences and an excellent lead performance, I do feel that 'The Incredible Hulk' is still a solid entry in the superhero genre. At the very least, I do prefer it over the 2003 'Hulk' film which, disclaimer, actually isn't 'that bad'."

","How do you pick up the pieces from 'Hulk'? A remake perhaps? Instead they came up with a more daring plan, a loose sequel. This movie's opening credits are a recap of the last movie but at the same time not, things are slightly different and much less complicated then before so this film is actually both a loose sequel and a reboot. But instead of running us by the origin story all over again and wasting our time this film briefs us on the characters in the opening credits and then away we go for new adventures. This film is genius, unlike Hulk this film embraces it's premise and has fun with it, at the same time though it manages to be a more thoughtful movie then 'Hulk' but without sucking all the fun out of the enterprise. This movie does everything right but there are two things I have to give special attention to, firstly the effects are beyond awesome, some of the best CGI I have ever seen. Secondly this film's finale is the best ever: The Incredible Hulk vs. The Abomination in one of the best Superhero duels of all time. Two titans of pure physical strength duke it out in New York, and it is beyond awesome, the less I say the better but let me put it this way, Hulk uses a broken car as boxing gloves, What else can I say? One of my favourite MCU films and one of my favourite superhero movies period."

","The Incredible Hulk is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. It is directed by Louis Leterrier and stars Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner. This film establishes a new backstory where Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma radiation. Liv Tyler,Tim Roth,William Hurt,Tim Blake Nelson and Ty Burrell play key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner has been traveling the world in search of the antidote that will allow him to break free from his primal alter ego, but both the warmongers who long to exploit him for their own gain and a horrific creature known as The Abomination are determined to stop him from achieving his noble goal. For years, Bruce has been living in the shadows, pursued by the military and haunted by the rage within. But traveling the world in secrecy isn't easy, and as hard as he tries Bruce can't get Betty Ross off his mind. The daughter of Bruce's nemesis Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, Betty represents everything that is beautiful in the world to a man who lives his life on the run. Eventually, Bruce returns to civilization and faces the wrath of The Abomination. While the Hulk may be a formidable force of nature, The Abomination is decidedly more powerful, and determined to destroy Bruce Banner. Created when KGB agent Emil Blonsky exposed himself to a higher dose of the same radiation that transformed Bruce into The Hulk, The Abomination is unable to change back into human form and holds Bruce accountable for his frightful condition. With time fast running out for both Bruce and The Hulk, New York City is about to become the ultimate urban battle zone as two of the most powerful creatures ever to walk the earth clash in a massive, no-holds-barred fight to the finish.<br/><br/>This film provides the action and excitement to please comic book fans and re-ignite this fledgling franchise.Also,the wonderful performance of Edward Norton would make you want to see this.It was definitely well- done and entertaining that would definitely meet the audience expectations and one that they would truly enjoy."

","It wasn't a tall order to improve upon Ang Lee's disastrous 2003 effort, which was simply horrible in every way. Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.<br/><br/>Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it."

Norton is great as the sympathetic character, and brings more life to the role than Bana did.<br/><br/>The film is more focused om the action point of view, rather than Banners troubles, and it's to the films credit.

","The Incredible Hulk is definitely different in tone to the 2003 version of Ang Lee. I still cannot decide which is better. Neither are great films, but both are worth watching. The 2003 version is definitely the more ambitious, slower-paced, more character-centric film, but it has its flaws. The Incredible Hulk (2008 version) is more mindless (not a bad thing), more entertaining, and fits the tone of a comic book movie better, BUT it also has its flaws. I say that its easier to just pop in this version and watch, BUT I cannot help but feel that I do have more respect for what the filmmakers tried to do in the 2003 version. Anyways, this is worth watching as well, and it has a better Bruce Banner."
"ARTaylor","10","1","2","13 May 2011"," The Hulk Film We've Been Waiting For
","I thought this was an incredibly good Hulk movie. It was everything that Ang Lee's Hulk wasn't. The Incredible Hulk was perfectly reminiscent of the beloved Bill Bixby Hulk series. It had a great combination of smashing Hulk, ""just wants to be loved"" Hulk, tormented Banner, and ""learning the Hulk isn't completely evil"" Banner.<br/><br/>The cast does a terrific job. Norton certainly works better than Bana did. The others are quite good, though I can't really say whether they were better or worse than their counterparts in Ang Lee's version.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straightforward, without all the unnecessary art house mumbo jumbo. No overly complicated daddy issues. Just Bruce learning to accept his other half and Hulk looking for a place in the world. Emil Blonsky also has a good story arc with him trying to overcome his age limits and reclaim his glory.<br/><br/>I loved the slow reveal of the Hulk, much like what Paul Verhoeven did in RoboCop. The monster in the shadows then the hand in the fog. So that when Hulk is fully revealed he's been built up and appears even more spectacular.<br/><br/>The CGI is very well done. Hulk and Abomination look like they could actually appear in the real world. The level of detail on the two exceeds anything done in Lee's version.<br/><br/>The action was terrific. It didn't overwhelm the slower, character moments but it was enough to satisfy action fans. The chase in Rio and the college battle are both exciting. The ending is particularly what is needed more in comic book movies. Showing too powerful creatures beat the crap out of each other while innocents are caught in the crossfire. It's what too many others are lacking. When someone like Hulk or Superman has seemingly unlimited strength, they need to fight someone with similar abilities to really show off their powers.<br/><br/>The movie did a great job setting up future films without feeling forced like Iron Man 2. We get the set up for Leader, Doc Samson, S.H.I.E.L.D., Avengers, and Captain America. But it all feels natural, like all these characters exist in one universe whereas Iron Man 2 sometimes felt like ""Hey look, comic book references!""<br/><br/>My only real complaint is that General Ross is portrayed as more of a straight-forward villain. Sam Elliot's version was more a man doing what he needed to do. He loses some of his dynamic character in this version.<br/><br/>Overall the film did what it needed to do, it was fun from beginning to end and didn't dumb anything down just for entertainment."

","When I discovered a new take on the Hulk was coming out, after being painfully disappointed with the Ang Lee version, I hoped for a redeeming treatment of the material. The Hulk is one of Marvels' most enjoyable characters. This version exceeds the other by far. Its much more like the characters and story I remember from the comic book and doesn't take the story in a direction that leaves you scratching your head.<br/><br/>This version is closely tied to the TV series back in the 70's and doesn't try to hide it - the same gamma-ray experiment gone wrong and the same honorable Bruce Banner, forever on the move because he is a danger to all, especially the one's he loves. Edward Norton was very convincing in the role of Banner and just seems to come off more like the character I remember from the comic book. He is certainly more likable and more easily identifiable.<br/><br/>There's no wasted minutes explaining the entire back-story - the opening credits depicted in a montage of clips essentially take care of that detail and much is assumed that the audience is at least somewhat familiar with the character or the TV series. The action scenes are very well done and the final fight scene where the Hulk squares off against the monstrosity known as the ""Abomination"" is very exciting.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a commendable job - William Hurt as Gen. Ross and Liv Tyler as Betty do their characters justice - Tim Roth always brings intensity to his roles and this one is no exception, his character Blonsky is supplied by General Ross with an amped-up steroid cocktail known as ""super soldier serum"" and from then on - the intensity is taken up a few notches to say the least - its definitely there as evidenced by one of his lines - after he has confronted and battled the Hulk twice he is asked by the General - how he feels after recuperating from an almost fatal rumble with the green behemoth ""How do you feel?"" Blonsky answers ""Pissed off...and ready for round three.""<br/><br/>I'm personally disappointed that Edward Norton will not return to reprise his role in the upcoming ""Avengers"" after handling the role so well in this movie, but I'm guessing that we'll be seeing much more screen time with the Big Green Guy in that film anyway. It will be interesting to see how the Hulk character will be involved in that project."
"TheKarateSpider","8","1","2","20 October 2010"," Unfairly Overlooked, correct way to adapt a comic book to movie.
","As a die-hard Superhero/Comic Book movie fan reviewing this movie puts me in a strange position, it raises more questions than allows me to give answers. First of all, The Incredible Hulk is my favourite superhero. I was weened on the 70's/80's classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno TV series (still awesome after 30 odd years) and the fun 1982 Animated series. I had some terrific Hulk toys and when it came to reading comics i cut my teeth with Peter Davids run on the title. However that doesn't mean that i will view this movie with rose (or jade?) tinted glasses, because i was greatly deflated and bewildered by Ang Lee's Hulk (2003), see my review for details. I honestly believe that Louis Letterriers The Incredible Hulk, is a great adaptation of the comics, an entertaining piece of cinema and a faithful tribute to all the great writers and artists who have worked on the comics, and a nice way of acknowledging the great work Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno and Kenneth Johnson did on the TV series. Im confused as to why it didn't find a much bigger audience. With one of the great actors of our time, Edward Norton playing the lead character AND writing the screenplay, i thought a bigger buzz would have been generated by cinema goers. I think the answer as to why the movie wasn't as popular or as successful as say the X-Men or Iron Man movies is two fold: I think Ang Lees take on the character left a bad taste in the mouths of movie goers who went to see the first movie with genuine enthusiasm and felt left down and had no interest in a sequel. Secondly i think the fact that The Hulk himself is a CGI creation puts distance between audiences and the character, like Lou Ferrigno said "" A CGI Hulk cant shake your hand and sign an autograph"" and i think this is a potent factor in audiences dis interest. Hopefully by the time of Joss Whedons Avengers and subsequent Hulk movies effects will be so stellar that The Hulk will be a truly amazing CGI creation. I honestly believe this movie was unfairly over looked in a summer that brought us the return of Indiana Jones, Robert Downey JR as Iron Man and Heath Ledgers Joker facing off with the return of The Dark Knight. Edward Norton is fantastic as Bruce Banner, he brings the every man qualities that is vital to the part, nicely echoing Bill Bixbys classic performance. He also has the right air of a scientist, a fugitive on the run and a man who has difficulty controlling the great power and destruction he is capable of. His screenplay (for which he went uncredited!) is neat, with every thing needed for a fun, genre adventure movie present, with a nice blend of the exotic and breaking a few conventions. Norton really makes you believe in Banner and care for him and i for one was looking forward to seeing him in The Avengers and subsequent Hulk movies so it is a BIG shame he wont be reprising the role, but i eagerly await Mark Ruffalo as Banner (another case of great casting and hopefully 3rd time lucky). The supporting cast bring a lot to the movie, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and William Hurt as Thunderbolt are instantly more believable and relatable in this movie than both Jennifer Connolly and Sam Elliot in Ang Lee's film. There is a real nice sense of romance and love between Tyler and Norton and something insanely driven in Hurt's. Tim Blake Nelson as Sterns gives a strong impression of the unhinged craziness of a supervillain and i would place him in the same category as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, in that when the twist comes it is really unexpected. The only problem i had casting wise was Tim Roth as Blonsky/Abomination in that i did and do think he was unsuited to the role and that this one aspect of the movie needed a classic action movie heavy, someone who could go over the top and i just think Roths transition to Abomination is wobbly. The CGI realisation of The Hulk this time is spot on, he is designed the correct way in terms of height and scale, he is the right shade of green and manages to look mighty when in full rage. The only real problem i have with the movie is entirely down to Marvel, it seems they scaled down Edward Norton/Louis Letterrier's epic vision in order to accommodate the running time and i think this has the effect that it seems like it is trying to fit itself into a pop corn movie skin rather than being epic on the scale of The Dark Knight as it would appear was intended, and i can understand Norton being in conflict with Marvel for this reason. That said The Incredible Hulk is a great tribute to the classic comic book work of Stan Lee,Jack Kirby, Peter David Etc, and with its use of The Lonely Man theme and nice (cameo) from Bill Bixby, the fans who have grown up with and love the TV series. Letterrier gave us a movie we can enjoy with good pace and the right amount of excitement and thrills and his movie is an overlooked gem."
"NoelCT","7","1","2","18 October 2010"," Not great, but good enough for a fun time.
","You all know the plot: Dr. Bruce Banner is exposed to gamma radiation which turns him into a raging monster in times of emotional distress. The origin was already covered in Ang Lee's 2003 version, so this sorta-sequel sorta-reboot picks up with Bruce in hiding as the government continues its search. The two end up colliding when Bruce sets out to find a cure.<br/><br/>It's a shame Edward Norton might not be back for another, because I really like what he's done with the role. He really captures the tragic plight of Bruce's dilemma, constantly on the run from others, but unable to escape the demons within. And there's some wonderful, logical additions in the form of breathing techniques and a simple pulse counter that grounds the character in reality.<br/><br/>And when the beast comes out, wow. This rippling mass of fury feels as real a Hulk as we'll ever get when he lets out a Lou Ferrigno-voiced roar and tosses a boulder to the raining heavens. My only gripe is that they dropped his miles-wide leaps in favor of superpowered free-running. The sight of him hopping from rooftop to rooftop made a little girl in the theater laugh, ""It's just like Spider-Man!"" In terms of the again revised origin, I'm satisfied. Yes, I'd still like to see Banner silhouetted in front of a gamma mushroom cloud, but at least they found a nice way to use the version from the old TV series while slipping in some additional history that ties into the developing Marvel Film Universe.<br/><br/>There was nearly unanimous condemnation from critics of Liv Tyler's whispery performance as Betty Ross, Bruce's former love, but I didn't mind. She wasn't excellent, but she ably brought to life a woman gentle enough to sooth a raging monster, yet strong enough to stand toe-to-toe with some of the most aggressive military men on film. I read that Tyler and Norton did a lot of prep work on their characters' relationship, and it shows because Betty and Bruce are so visibly, beautifully, agonizingly in love, yet circumstances just won't let them be.<br/><br/>It terms of what I don't like, the major element is the portrayal of General 'Thunderbolt' Ross. It's a shame, because it is one of the most animated and memorable performances I've seen from William Hurt, but I really think the changes made to the character upset the fantastic dynamic offered by the comics. There, Ross was willing to do everything in his power to destroy the Hulk, which he sees as a chaotic threat to all of humanity. Everything, but use his daughter, Betty. His fear for her safety blinds him to the fact that she is the only hope of quelling the beast, which causes Ross to take devastating situations to extreme lengths that should have been avoided. In the film, Ross doesn't fear the Hulk, he wants to control it, harness it for the use of the government, and he'll do everything in his power to achieve his goals. Even exploit Betty.<br/><br/>Does my displeasure make sense? Not only did they upset a nice dynamic, but took an iconic supporting character and threw a complete 180 on his portrayal. Now, I can understand the need for such a threat, because it gives a reason for Bruce to keep himself out of their hands, but isn't that what Dr. Samuel Sterns is for? Sterns, in a gloriously wacky performance by Tim Blake Nelson, is a reckless scientist obsessed with the broad potential offered by gamma radiation. All they needed to do was boost his role so he, Blonsky, and Ross form a trifecta of antagonists in constant pursuit of our hero. One wants to posses the power, one wants to exploit the power, and one wants to destroy the power. Sadly, Sterns and his interests are tucked away in the final half-hour where they have little impact on the broader story beyond setting up the final fight.<br/><br/>And then there's Emil Blonsky. If they'd gone with the dynamic I mentioned a paragraph ago, then he would have fit perfectly into the picture. As it is, Blonsky is shoehorned into the script for no other reason than to create another monster for the Hulk to have a throw-down with. In terms of execution, I can't help but think it would have worked better if Tim Roth played him as a good, dedicated soldier slowly corrupted by the thirst for more power. Instead, he's a wolfish, sneering rogue who wants to take on the Hulk just because it'll make him feel like more of a man.<br/><br/>In terms of other problems, all I can think of is my regret that the scene between Leonard Samson (the always reliable Ty Burrell) and Bruce was cut because it was such a fantastic exploration of the Bruce/Betty relationship. Otherwise, this was a damn exciting, thoughtful superhero movie that, while not perfect, does show the continuing improvement of quality in the overall genre."

","I'm not a big fan of the Hulk but I do enjoy myself some Marvel comics. I saw the 2003 version or whatever year it came out and didn't enjoy it much. I enjoyed this one more, but it still wasn't great. I dislike CG, so I hated the fact that the Hulk, the Abomination and more were CG. It looked really unnatural (not that they look natural to begin with) but still. The effects and action were quite unrealistic and silly. The acting was bad and I'm sad to say that Edward Norton just didn't do it for me in this movie. He's one of my favorite actors. Liv Tyler was confusing and the worst of the cast. She would whisper too much, yell too much, cry too much, and it was ridiculous. I don't think that Hulk fans will love this movie either. He only says 'Hulk Smash' once and he doesn't make many appearances anyway. However, it did have a greatly satisfying ending, and there were some cool action sequences in it. It's a very mediocre movie so stay away unless you're a big Hulk fan and HAVE to see it, or you're bored sometime."

","Many fans of Marvel comics will be outraged by my score for The Incredible Hulk. After Iron Man which was only average by my standards, I thought Marvel could do no worse. They fail to realize that bringing in a quality director is immensely crucial to a film's critical success. Fair enough, Iron Man was Jon Favreau's fourth feature film after Zathura's unlikely hit.<br/><br/>That cannot be said of The Incredible Hulk, whose director Louis Leterrier has a poor track record, making bad pictures such as Transporter 2 and Unleashed. Financially, The Incredible Hulk will score big because of its wide fanbase, as well as being strategically released after Iron Man. However, critically it is a whole level below Ang Lee's Hulk.<br/><br/>If there's one aspect that The Incredible Hulk does well over Ang Lee's version, it's the visual effects. The grayish-green title character is digitally rendered so well that it makes Ang Lee's light-green monster seem cartoonish in comparison. The action sequences have more in quantity but lack in quality, though the climatic battle between the Incredible Hulk and an even more hulky nemesis is a notch more thrilling than the lackluster one in Iron Man.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is not well-cast, but he's a more solid actor than the spiritless Eric Bana in the earlier Hulk. Another miscast is Liv Tyler who plays Bruce Banner's love interest. The awkward drama scenes between them are so incompetent that their character developments are half-baked.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, at least Iron Man was enjoyable. Alas, The Incredible Hulk abandons the most fundamental quality of cinema - to entertain. The screenplay is so appalling that it makes George Lucas seems like Charles Dickens. No creative input and narrative breakthrough, the story of Bruce Banner is told in the most uninspired manner even for a comic book character.<br/><br/>I'm not against Marvel, but they are definitely alienating the critical half of cinema lovers by their choice of filmmakers. Yes, The Incredible Hulk will appeal to hardcore fans, though the scary part is not the huge green ogre itself but how these people actually part their money so nonchalantly.<br/><br/>SCORE: 4.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","After seeing Iron Man and really enjoying it, I was a little apprehensive to see another Hulk after the disaster from 2003 otherwise known as Ang Lee's Hulk. This one has better acting, a faster pace, and really good special effects that fit perfectly. Edward Norton is very good, again, as the famed scientist Bruce Banner, who gets mean and green when he gets angry. Liv Tyler is also very good as the damsel in distress, Betty Ross. I thought their scenes together were just as good if not better than the ones between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in the first two Spider-Man movies. As for the action sequences, they go on a tad too long for my taste, but they look great and are not done over the top. Hulk really looks realistic, as does the Abomination. And, of course, as is being advertised, the ending leaves fans wanting more and salivating for a movie about The Avengers. After the great success of Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, I can honestly say I am ready to join them."

","As far as entertainment value, here's where I'd put Hulk in relation to other Marvel-comic movies:<br/><br/>#1 = Spider-Man movies <br/><br/>#2 = Iron Man <br/><br/>#3 = The Incredible Hulk (this movie) <br/><br/>AND (tied)<br/><br/>#3 = X-Men movies<br/><br/>#4 = Fantastic 4 movies<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk was a bit of a mixed bad - some good parts and some bad ones. On the positive side, the movie picks up where the 2003 movie left off (so it's not a repeat) and there were some cool, energetic fight scenes, especially towards the end. On the minus side, the Hulk looked a noticeably cartoon-like and Edward Norton (who plays the lead character) sounded a bit too effeminate.<br/><br/>To its credit, the movie doesn't try to re-tell the story of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk (as was done in the 2003 movie), but rather continues the storyline of the government trying to capture him. He's on the run and yearning to get back with the girl he had to leave ... but worst problems are headed his way.<br/><br/>One of amusing aspects of the movie are the cameos by Stan Lee (founder of Marvel comics), Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk on TV), Robert Downey Jr. (playing his businessman character from Iron Man) and even a TV clip with Bill Bixby (who played the TV Bruce Banner). Those were fun to watch. Many of the energetic fight sequences were also pretty great.<br/><br/>However, the animation of the Hulk was almost like a cartoon. It was a bit annoying to watch given how well fictional characters can be made to look these days. Furthermore, Edward Norton's dialog was goofy sounding; he just didn't sound like a normal guy. His voice was about an octave too high (well, that's probably an exaggeration). <br/><br/>Fans of the comic book seem to really enjoy this movie - so you are lucky if you're part of that group. For everyone else, know that the movie is decently good and ""middle-of-the-road"" in terms of Marvel films."

","I was surprised that they tried to do the HULK again after the previous disaster, but when I saw that they were able to get Norton to sign on I was hopeful that It might turn out okay....it didn't. I hear that Norton attempted to help them with the script; they probably should have listened to him a little more. The dialog, as with most of the recent movies was terrible. You'd think they might write something interesting when two people who haven't seen each other for a while reunite, but no. And you'd think that they might spend sometime letting us know the motivation behind a few of the characters like Blounsky, but that would be too much like, good storytelling to please Hollywood. I only gave it a 6/10 for a decent effort."

Here they are: 1, Edward Norton, Liv Tailer, Tim Roth, William Hurt and even Robert Donney's performance. We got all these celebrities or should I say, award-winners. I wanted them to be explosive, which means more than average.<br/><br/>2, Since Tony Stark also give a cameo appearance in the movie, I also expect it to be solidly written like Iron Man. So I was really thirsty for some Sci-fi twists.<br/><br/>3, Ang Lee's Hulk is commented to be ""awful"", so at least the audiences are give rights to compare them.<br/><br/>So let's see the result. Quite interesting for me, I don't think this movie beats Ang Lee's ""awful"" one. For some obvious reasons that, 1, Edward Norton is not a mile far better than Eric Banner. Instead, he turned out to be also average, nothing like the movies he was in before. There are very few memorable moments about him alone. What about the romance? Well, Liv Tyler is sexy in her own type, but neither a female scientist type nor a hot babe type. The real problem is that she has absolutely no electricity with Norton. The scenes they are together are always distanced, both characters avoiding each other like strangers. Plus the only funny scene the director arrange for them is not funny due to Tyler's performance, which is the New York taxi scene... Other actors are also average, not in their most comfortable type of characters. I was keep guessing which part will Tony Stark(Robert Donney Jr) play, but to my disappointment he just stayed on stage for 15 seconds.<br/><br/>2, The movie is very stably paced, with each fight bigger than the former one. And all the characters made their senses in their actions during the storytelling. Tim Roth became obsessed with power alone and, General Hurt was proved to be wrong very clearly to the end. And Hulk just hide himself for a clearer reason than Ang Lee's version. But the problem comes. The movie leaves very few to be shot in a comical style, not even all the fight scenes. Ang Lee's version tried to produce an abusive visual style with an abusive Hulk, who's ultra-violent and the fans or non-fans can completely dip themselves in this style, enjoying. But Incredible Hulk tried to be average, producing nothing to blow the audiences away. In a less abusive manner, much of the story is straight-forward and easy to understand but also loses its dynamite.<br/><br/>3, So now you have my conclusion: Incredible Hulk has a clearer storyline but not as violent as Hulk.<br/><br/>7/10."
"NJRocker091188","8","2","7","13 June 2008"," it is incredible
","Do away with the 2003 hulk because this new hulk is bigger, better, and stronger then ever. Although this movie is not at all as great as iron man, the incredible hulk is almost just as powerful and just as strong in its attempts to keep you satisfied as a super-hero movie fan. The film has a much better plot, a much stronger script, and the actors and actresses are a lot more believable with their performance. This movie also has more action, and shows more of what hulk can really do, instead of just being chased by military officers. <br/><br/>What I really liked about this new hulk was that hulk appears not just when bruce banner is angry, but also when his blood pressure and heart rate rises. If bruce banner starts to get overly excited, he can also transform into the hulk. In the 2003 hulk, it seemed like you really needed to get bruce angry, whereas in this new film, all bruce as to do is get too excited and thats is it. It was fun to see hulk appearer when bruce's blood pressure and heart rate would rise because then you get to understand that it isn't just anger. I really enjoyed this movie, and I strongly suggest that anyone that has not seen it, to go and see the movie, do not wait till the d.v.d. I can say that you will not be disappointed. Great movie, great action, great effects, and just down right excellent."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","2","7","13 June 2008"," Now THAT'S what I call an action epic. Wonderful.
","The Incredible Hulk, in a word, is indeed incredible. If you're going to the movies to be entertained, and to see almost everything (including the film's villain) Hulk smashed into oblivion, odds are you're going to love Louis Leterier's take on the epic Marvel brute. Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Bruce Banner, and simply fantastic action sequences make all memory of Ang Lee's 2003 disaster evaporate. Leterrier's film is very good, well made, and wonderfully entertaining.<br/><br/>First things first. This is NOT a sequel of the previous Hulk. It's a restart. The Hulk's backstory is told through a series of flashbacks (a much better technique. What separates this Hulk from Lee's version is the fearless approach taken by the Green Machine's new engineers: Leterrier, Norton, and Zak Penn. Penn's script is far and away the best of his career, and Norton's assistance completely polishes it. Leterrier, of ""Transporter"" fame, definitely injects a sense of originality into the movie. It feels like a huge cross between the Hulk of old, the ""Transporter"" films, and also, the ""Bourne"" films. This is definitely a good thing.<br/><br/>Norton's performance as the reluctant hero Bruce Banner is tantalizing and engaging. You feel the hatred he has for not only the Hulk, but himself for allowing it to take over his life. It's a layered performance, and a fresh feeling after years of bland superhero performances *glares at Ben Affleck, Eric Bana, and Jessica Alba*. Liv Tyler's performance could go either way, as I can see why people may dislike her, but I enjoyed her take on Betty Ross. She brought the emotion to a movie where there isn't likely to be a lot outside of anger, and really shared excellent chemistry with Norton. It's magical. William Hurt does usual William Hurt things in his role as General Ross, but I wanted a bit more from him. The true gem is Tim Roth as the deliciously power hungry Emil Blonsky. Roth is simply excellent as Blonsky. It's a classic villainous showing from one of the best of his time. Brilliant casting. Tim Blake Nelson is a nice addition as Samuel Sterns...and it is because of his character that we have an opening for a sequel (Hulk fans rejoice)...that and the appearance of a certain Marvel hero at the end of the film...<br/><br/>The biggest difference and improvement in the film is the major increase in action. The action is INTENSE, not to mention breathtaking and jaw dropping. I see many technical Oscar nominations in this film's future, especially for Visual Effects, Sound, and Sound Editing. See this in the theater. The sound is very loud, yet distinct. You'll fell as if you are in every major sequence. What I also admired about Leterrier's direction is that the action is vast and varied, despite the simplistic Hulk. You've got chase scenes, fight scenes, martial arts scenes, explosions, projectiles, and just flat out ass whoopings. It's a hell of a time, and the action really puts the film over the top. HOWEVER! It is not bland and repetitive. There is your fair share of drama in it. Like I said before, Norton and Tyler have wonderful chemistry and it makes the Bruce/Betty scenes that much more entertaining. There is also some great comic relief, mostly between Bruce and Betty.<br/><br/>All in all, this is definitely an improvement and a gem of superhero films. While I wouldn't say it's better than Iron Man or Spider Man 2, The Incredible Hulk is definitely a great time at the movies, and a great action film. To not see it would be an...Abomination...(I had to say it)."
"GOWBTW","10","2","7","13 June 2008"," This isn't a sequel, this is an update: HULK LIKES!!
","The first HULK movie was just the beginning. It was a bit on the dark side. The only enemies he had to face were the Hulk-dogs and the Army. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is an overall improvement from the first. There was a plot, there was an enemy, there was some action. The cast was great. Edward Norton as the brilliant Dr. Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross; William Hurt as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky aka ""The Abomination""(A Hulk-wannabe). The CGI graphics were indeed top-notched. Better than Ang Lee's. But if it wasn't for Ang Lee's version 5 years ago, there wouldn't be another movie. So give that guy some credit! The battle scene between the Hulk(Norton) and the Army was classic. Taking out those Hummers, using the crude shields against the fire-power. The New York scene is great: Hulk vs. Abomination. Ilkied the part where the Hulk used the police car as ""boxing gloves"". The Abomination is stronger than the Hulk at first(He can lift 100 tons with ease), but he lacks the rage power. The Hulk's strength is unlimited(100 tons+) so he can kick serious butt with any enemy he faces. Dr. Samuel Sterns is another character to be reckoned with. He'll be known as the villainous Leader. The Hulk got to do more things in this movie: The Thunder Clap, and his trademark words: HULK SMASH!! Whch was voiced by the original, Lou Ferrigno which by chance plays a Security Guard who gets a free medium pizza. This movie is an improvement big time. Liked the cast, the storyline, the honorable mention of Bill Bixby in his earlier work. A younger Jack McGee who was played by the late Jack Colvin. This movie's got some 70's nostalgia there. I just want to Hulk out, and see it again and again. HULK SMASH! This one tops the 2003 version, big time! 5 STARS!"

It was gritty, true to the characters, and action-packed.<br/><br/>The special effects were mind-blowing, the actors were perfect, and the story was great.<br/><br/>Even my mother, who doesn't even watch super-hero movies (doesn't generally care for the genre) was blown away by it.<br/><br/>A big thanks to Edward Norton for pressing the studios to do this movie the right way.<br/><br/>Were he not involved, I don't see this movie being half as enjoyable."
"portfan","8","2","7","13 June 2008"," An excellent balance between action and drama.
","In my opinion this movie could very well be a first movie in a saga, a re-imagining of The Incredible Hulk franchise, or even a sequel to Ang Lee's Hulk. I may be one of the very few who liked Hulk, but this is a great counterpart to that movie. It explores more of the Hulk mythos, and in the process gives the audience an expertly balanced movie. As well, it provides many avenues in which Marvel can explore in other movies. As a casual fan, this movie may be on par with this summer's earlier entry, Iron Man, in it's intensity and amazing performances. The CGI work is done with great detail, down to facial hair, and veins, and most noticeably, a more realistic look for the Incredible Hulk. I believe this installment of the Hulk character benefits from the learned successes and pitfalls of other Marvel characters."

","In early April when I heard there was going to be ANOTHER Hulk movie my first thought was ""Why would they even bother again?"" Okay, scratch that, my actual first thought was ""A sequel???"" The first 2003 adaptation of the popular comic book flick was a sorry excuse for any Marvel film, being written off with such ""classics"" as Daredevil, Ghostrider and Electra (even though I love Jen Gardner).<br/><br/>I sat in the theater anticipating corny attempts at comedy, cringing at sappy romantic scenes and just plain covering my eyes as soon as the fake over sized CGI Hulk appeared on the screen. SURPRISINGLY I only did 1 of the 3. Though, there were sappy romantic scenes between Liv Tyler and Ed Norton I wasn't shoving my finger down my throat in mock sickness. The CGI was MUCH better and the storyline was definitely more believable than the father killing mother and turning into electrocution monster and son voluntarily transferring his Hulk genes through water to his dad thing. Ed Norton on the run from the government because of a science experiment GONE terribly wrong was much more believable, though, thoroughly predictable.<br/><br/>The action scenes where exactly what a pyromaniac would be proud of--stock full of exploding cars, exploding helicopters, exploding tanks and...well pretty much anything that could explode did. Very sleek and easy to follow even with all the fast camera movement.<br/><br/>The only things that still left me wondering ""what the heck happened to...?"" was the scientist in the lab with a throbbing forehead and Liv Tyler's psychologist pseudo-boyfriend who was unsuspectingly okay with her just skipping town with the Hulk.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Hulk smash!"" and so did Marvel with this movie."

","I just came back from the midnight showing of The Incredible Hulk. All I have to say is that it was worth the money. I really enjoyed the film, to the point where I wish it was longer. At first I had my doubts, but they were overcome by satisfaction once the film was done. I heard people complain about how bad the CGI was, but I thought it was well done. (Stop complaining!) The Story was well written, the acting was great, and I must say I loved the cameos and jokes through out the movie. Of course they had to change some of the story to make it work as a movie, but none of the other comic book fans I met complained after the movie, which means job well done. All in all this is a good action flick, and a worthy addition to the Comic book Movies (collection)."
"abmoorhead","4","2","8","15 June 2008"," Incredible Hulk; Cool action sequences meets worst screen play ever written
","The Incredible Hulk is a very confusing movie. Not because of the plot, but because for every moment that makes you like this movie, there is an even greater moment that makes you want to leave the theater and demand a refund. Going into the movie, I expected a strong script, and good acting, along with mediocre and boring visual effects. I expected that if Edward Norton was involved, then the acting and screenplay would be good, at least for a superhero flick. And from the previews, I was unimpressed with the visual effects, seeing little improvement from Ang Lee's. But after viewing the movie, I was completely wrong<br/><br/>The action sequences, though mostly just mass destruction, were well done. The Hulk looked great,or at least 10 times better then the previous Hulk. The climactic battle between Hulk and Abomination was especially well done. The visual effects were flawless, and the fighting was very climactic and enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>The other portion of this movie, every part without the big green Hulk, was an Abomination, seriously. The dialouge had absolutely no flow, each scene between Liv Tyler and Edward Norton was extremely painful to watch. In one scene, when Norton is in Tyler's home, and they bump into each other in the hallway. Thus begins the worst acted and written scene in the history of cinema. Some fellow patrons and I found ourselves laughing hysterically at this scene. Since words cannot describe the sheer lunacy of the scene, I advise you to look it up on YouTube and see for yourself. Other incredibly poorly written scenes, ex. all of them, and a few extremely bad cuts and plot holes added to the bad experience. The rest of the movie was so bad, that whenever the Hulk showed up, it felt unnatural, like the screenwriters timed it so that the Hulk would show up in precise intervals throughout the movie, making it seem forced<br/><br/>In conclusion, bad movie, if you have to seem a superhero movie, see Iron Man, and if you have to see the Incredible Hulk, wait till DVD and fast forward through every part without the Hulk."

The CG effects for the Hulk itself look ten times better than before. This movie plays much better with the effects in combination with the director's style. He makes full use of shadows in revealing when he wants to, not before.<br/><br/>This movie did not look like a comic book.

","Finally! I think this is the film I've unknowingly been waiting for this year. I don't think I can fault any part of it. I was sceptical at first - I often am with sequels where EVERY SINGLE cast member has been changed - but this was refreshingly good for a sequel, and I think it worked better than the original.<br/><br/>The opening is especially good to look at - covering parts of the story in the interim period since the first story (with some overlap I suspect). The story begins in a favela in Brazil, and the imagery of that 'suburb' was amazing to me - it seriously looks like a small, highly compact town made of lego or different coloured boxes. A brilliant choice of location. Norton and Tyler have great chemistry, I think, and Hurt steps into Sam Elliot's steps brilliantly as General Ross. Tim Roth is brilliantly psychotic, increasing as the film progresses, and for once, the 'showdown' at the end of the film isn't a disappointing series of flashing images. It actually touches on many points that were not quite clear in the first film: although he is to bullets, Hulk is not completely invulnerable. And even the use of the line ""Hulk Smash!"" doesn't seem inappropriate.<br/><br/>Beyond the film, it is clear that something big is in the making at Marvel: the cameo from Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark (tie-in to Iron Man) is very intriguing, and a little research will show films of The Avengers team (Wolverine in 2009, Thor in 2010, and Captain America and The Avengers in 2011).

","This is a reboot of Hulk franchise after not quite fair negative response from both audience and critics of Ang Lee ""The Hulk"". ""The Incredible Hulk"" goes completely different way than Ang Lee . This is no drama with serious ambitions , but simple and mindless popcorn action flick.<br/><br/>The obvious problem lies in the screenplay . The story is predictable , full of clichés and the characters are barely written . Maybe that's the reason why the actors can't show anything interesting. There are some nice jokes here and the movie has many easter eggs for Hulk fans (cameo of Stan Lee , cameo of Lou Ferrigno , the jokes with pants , the ""Lonely man"" theme). The bland direction from Louis Letterier doesn't help either , just as the rather awful CGI.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is a good actor , but she doesn't show here anything that any other actor could show. Tim Ruth is terribly weak and almost becomes a parody of himself. William Hurt is nice as the general Ross , especially considering that he's stuck in a very one-dimensional role. The worst performance of the movie certainly belongs to Liv Tyler . Not only she's been cast as the scientist Betty Ross , which is unbelievable , but her over dramatic performance gave me many laughs.<br/><br/>The fans of Hulk were rather pleased with this one . Other viewers will be rather disappointed with this quite boring movie . It's got nothing to impress the audience – no substance , no interesting action.

I kept asking myself why throughout. This one was a totally wasted effort, a waste of money, waste of time, waste of resources. The only reason, I believe, they wanted to make this one, was because they wanted to make the connection with Robert Downey Jr's Stark, and a possible set-up for a sequel based on that connection. Other than that, this one was poorly executed. The performances were fine. The direction wasn't.

","THE INCREDIBLE HULK<br/><br/>No Way! (Meeza's nostrils turn green!). You did not like my pun-infested movie reviews as the next one I will be throwing at you! (Meeza's shirt opens up while it pulsates as his entire body turns into a dark green complexion!). You thought the reviews were silly and a bit over-the-pun-top!!! (AAAHH!! Meeza is a pun green monster filled with rage & revenge!) OK, so these type of comments do make me angry! And you would not like me when I am angry, or maybe you would because I do not pun as much when I am angry. What also made me angry at times was viewing another mostly unsuccessful cinematic takeoff of the Marvel hero ""The Incredible Hulk"" story. Director Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk did break many backs but also showed Hulk as a silly crouching monster, hidden dragon; Sorry Ang! In this latest adaptation, Director Louis Leterrier does improve the Hulk story with a bit more power by giving it an alternative narrative but not enough to have a Hulkian cinematic effect. The steady Eddie, Edward Norton, stars as Dr. Bruce Banner (alter-ego Hulk). Leterrier quickly presents a five minute montage on why & how scientist Banner transformed himself into Hulk when he gets angry during the film's opening sequence. So kudos to Louis for getting those anger issues quickly out of the way. The rest of the film fixates on the cloistered Banner's quest to get the Hulk out of his system. Banner is being chased by arrogant General Thunderbolt Ross and his men to get the Hulkian formula out of poor Bruce to use it for weaponry defense purposes. The Thunderbolt eventually finds where the lightning Banner is hiding and therefore Banner returns back to the States. The good thing for Banner is that he has a banner time reuniting with his love Betty Ross; she even knits a Hulk flag for him and this Ross undresses for less for Bruce. OK, enough! General Ross is so livid that he cannot hunt down Banner that he eventually causes for one of his men Emil Blonsky to convert himself to another gargantuan creature named ""Who Cares? It's Big, Scary, and Ugly"" to battle & defeat Hulk. By the way, that is not the real name of Hulk's nemesis; but at that point I was not engaged in the whole formulaic monster battle between good vs. evil that most superhero films climax with. I do think that Norton was the right man for the Hulk acting job with his excellent performance. But the rest of the cast made me angry with their acting, and you would not like me when I am (ok, been there, said that). Liv Tyler as Ross, William Hurt as the General, and Tim Roth as Blonsky seemed were just doing their acting gigs to just collect the green. I was at a loss for words on how awful Zak Penn's harebrained loss-of-words screenplay was. Not good Pennmanship my dear Zak. ""The Incredible Hulk"" did have some action sequences that were a bit entertaining, but not enough originality was injected in the film to make me feel green with envy that I did not catch it during its original theatrical run. Therefore, I continue to have anger management issues with Hulk movies. *** Average"
"dfranzen70","4","1","3","3 December 2008"," That's Not Incredible
","Did I ask for a Hulk “reboot”? Did anyone? I guess they felt that the last one, succinctly titled Hulk, was somewhat lacking. But perhaps it just wasn’t meant to be; here we are, just a few years later, and the new Hulk movie is about as lifeless and predictable as the first, only with A-list actors suffering within it. The Incredible Hulk is ambitious but no more compelling or vivacious as an actual comic book, with one-dimensional characters and a perfectly horrendous stab at acting by the normally reliable William Hurt.<br/><br/>I remember that one of the big knocks against Hulk was the unconvincing CGI. I think that problem is more or less resolved here, as the new and improved Hulk looks terrifyingly real, not just an ogre with a soft center but really menacing. Sadly, though, this Hulk has more personality and joie de vive than any of his live-action counterparts. It’s perplexing, really, because this time around the studio opened up the checkbook for such bankable stars as Hurt, Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth. They’re all out acted by the fx (save Norton, who’s just as effortlessly wonderful as always), which has to be a jolt to the ol’ ego, but none greater than to Hurt, who has decades of flavorful, heavily nuanced performances on his resume.<br/><br/>As with most superheroes, Hulk is completely misunderstood. Bruce Banner has inflicted a metric ton of gamma rays on himself in the interest of science, only to find out the military for which he worked really wants to weaponize him, so he’s hiding out in Brazil when the movie opens. Somehow, he has to get information back to an unknown scientist contact, before the army, led by General Ross (Hurt), finds him first. He also wants to reconnect with his girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who happens to be Ross’ daughter. But darn the luck, he can’t keep his heart rate low enough to avoid Hulking all over the place. So it’s an protracted chase scene, with the faceless, heartless military running after the green thing.<br/><br/>There’s a wild card here, too. If you’ve read the comic books, you know there’s always gonna be another Big Bad Guy to fight someone like Hulk, because sooner or later watching him swat away missiles like he’s King Kong gets kind of dull. So writers gin up an even bigger dude for him to fight. Here, he’s played by Tim Roth, who’s a major following Ross’s orders.<br/><br/>The CGI still isn’t terribly believable, but sinking this one even further is the illogic of the plot. I love how nothing ever seems to hurt Hulk - bullets, shotgun shells, tanks, helicopters, they all roll off him and explode in a huge blast. But they keep firing anyway. Oh, and General Ross just keeps calling in bigger artillery. It ain’t working, fool! But the best is that of course only Hulk and Hulk alone can stop Roth, even if he’s not Hulky. Of course only he can save the day, him and his purple pants.<br/><br/>I still can’t get over the fact that William Hurt is playing this blustery, distant, single-minded authority figure. Was Powers Boothe not available? Kurtwood Smith? R. Lee Ermey? When I think of William Hurt, I think of quiet intellectualism. Sure, sometimes his characters are cold and aloof, but they’re still sensitive and pining and not at all like the overreaching, despotic Ross. Weird casting doesn’t always work, you know.<br/><br/>Norton does his level best, but the movie’s just a shambles. It’s stereotypical comic-book fare, only it’s not terribly interesting, and the effects are more akin to a good video game than an expensive Hollywood movie."

","The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's version too contemplative and overstylized. In fact, I have very picky comic book fanatic friends who thought it hit the nail on the head. But to me, on top of being understylized, it failed to deal with the interesting facets of Stan Lee's character. The backstory is itemized through flashbacks which are generally in the opening credits. William Hurt's mad Army general took on radiation expert Bruce Banner to revitalize WWII military bio-force enhancement research. Banner exposed himself to gamma radiation, which causes him to transform into a colossal green monster, and the hospitalization the general's daughter, a cellular biologist who was Banner's colleague and, naturally, his lover. Instantly a renegade from the U.S. Army, Banner has eluded them for five years.<br/><br/>Not all of us are writers, and The Incredible Hulk is not the sort of movie seen by people who take the existence of a writer into account, but let us really try to consider the dilemma of creating a story about the Hulk. You are taking in hand two different characters: Good- natured scientist Bruce Banner, and the berserk, devastating Hulk, who explodes into flurries of raging onslaught whenever he's annoyed, which is normally because the U.S. Army is more often than not wracking him with automatic weapons and missiles and tanks. There is still the remarkable uncertainty of whether or not Banner is actually cognizant within his Mr. Hyde. In the Ang Lee version, he was, relatively. In this version by Louis Leterrier, director of another disaster movie, Transporter 2, the most sufficient Edward Norton's vague, mostly closed-lipped Banner can supply is that being the Hulk is like an acid trip, and all he can evoke are abstract splinters of events.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's disastrously received Hulk was to a certain extent inspired in the way it arranged the Hulk tale into harmonizing clashes with repressive father figures: Betty was dismayed by her father, the general, and Banner agonized as a consequence of the Hulk genes originally created by his father, a scientist who passed them along to his child. <br/><br/>In this forgettable by-the-numbers summer blockbuster, Betty, now the consistently underwhelming Liv Tyler, still has significant troubles with her father the general, now William Hurt, owing to his ludicrous campaign to utilize the Hulk formula and generate a line of Hulk soldiers. Throughout the movie, Hurt so rashly and uncontrollably drenches countless square miles of open space in his military capability that one can only doubt if he has a senior officer with anything to say about having to answer for the indefinite mass of casualties of flinging endless fire at the Hulk with an utter lack of any benefit. Even if they did have some effect on the Hulk, how does that serve their cause really? If Hulk is dead, where's the Hulk formula? And again, Betty and Banner are in love, but don't follow through because the whole Hulk issue is a big concern, although I admit to a clever moment that brings enlightening insight to the Hulk story: Banner cuts short his great opening to have sex with her because when his heart rate exceeds a certain point, he becomes the Hulk.<br/><br/>The film flaunts an astounding early shot, not so much for any technical virtuosity but really for its exposure to a beautiful locale as we soar above a hill in Rio de Janeiro, seeing thousands of microscopic, colorful shacks crowding each other. After that, Leterrier's movie, unlike his Transporter 2, is not downright bad, for it has a diverting enough plot turn regarding a Russian special ops expert played by Tim Roth whose function is to become the bad Hulk, only with a mutated cranium to boot, and the movie has a clever little device at the end. It is essentially that the movie is so light, shallow, and only entertaining to a similar degree as a Luc Besson film, which, aptly enough is with whom Leterrier has worked on two previous films, Unleashed and the aforementioned catastrophe of a sequel. The fact is Lou Ferrigno not only has a cameo as a security guard but also evidently does the voiced over roars of Norton's Hulk.<br/><br/>I have yet to understand why such a capable actor like Edward Norton would not only star in but script doctor The Incredible Hulk. After an immaculate string of performances in Primal Fear, Rounders, American History X, Fight Club, 25th Hour, Frida, and even Death To Smoochy, it is almost as if he wanted a break from doing so many high-quality movies and a walk-through, generic-mean genre pleasure like The Incredible Hulk."
"Arks","6","1","3","24 June 2008"," Good Entertainment Value
","The obvious element to this film are the impressive special effects, which are a distinct improvement if comparing to Ang Lee's Hulk. This was the major driver of the film along with a more consistent storyline that compliments the comic book version.<br/><br/>However, with such a strong cast it had raised my expectations in terms of performance which were short lived. I believe Norton's performance was not suited to the role and personally felt it was not successfully delivered as Bruce Banner. No other actors really shined through either but I guess films such as these are not aiming to get best acting performance, but rather something related to the special effects.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for entertainment value as an action movie and not be too critical of the other elements (such as acting and script) as they are only just average."

","OK, start by forgetting Ang Lee's 2003 version of Hulk. As far as this movie is concerning that never existed and this is the one and only definitive version of Hulk (despite being also known as hulk 2).<br/><br/>Edward Norton is playing Bruce Banner (so Eric Bana is now confined to the annals of Hulk history and almost certainly doomed to be forgotten). This movie throws you right into the deep end having all the accident that turns Bruce into Hulk happen over the opening title credits as well as his running away, being chased by the authorities then going missing.<br/><br/>The last newspaper report says he hadn't been seen for 5 months. Bruce is hiding out in Brazil & we get our 1st nod back to the TV series when he sees Bill Bixby (Bruce Banner in the TV version of The Incredible Hulk) on TV in something, so their pleasing the hardcore Hulk fans pretty much right away.<br/><br/>Bruce is being taught by a martial arts instructor how to contain his anger by learning breathing techniques. We also get a joke about Banner's inability to full speak the local language when he mistakenly says ""Don't make me hungry"" because he doesn't know the right word for angry.<br/><br/>Stan Winston gets his standard cameo playing a man with gamma sickness infected after drinking a soda infected with Bruce's blood. This death alerts the military who send out a SEAL team plus Eric Blonsky (Tim Roth) on load from the Royal Marines so we're supposed to assume he's at least a Commando to capture Banner alive.<br/><br/>Banner goes Hulk in the Bottling Plant where he works having been chased there by bullies from his job after trying to avoid the SEAL team. Hulk is barely seen in this fight, even when Blonsky sees him its only for a few moments so they're sticking to the old tried & trusted adage that a creature looks better the less you see it.<br/><br/>After waking up in the jungle Banner discovers he has managed to travel from Brazil to Guatemala while he was Hulk. We also get another nod back to the TV series when they play the TV end title music as Banner is walking the streets in Mexico. He is also sold some purple trousers which is a nod back to the original Hulk comic strip.<br/><br/>He makes it back to America to Culver University where he's looking for Dr Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) who we'd seen get injured during the Hulk accident in the opening titles. It was her father General Ross (William Hurt) who sent the SEAL team after Banner in Brazil. We get yet another nod to the TV series when Banner meets the night security guard (played by Lou Ferrigno, the original TV Hulk!). We get a flashback to the accident & it's practically the TV version stolen shot for shot replacing Bixby with Norton. There's a very huge plot goof that Betty has the lab data on a USB stick (most can hold 16 gig max?) but that she was able to get it at all seeing as she was very badly injured in a hospital bed you'd think the data would have been moved/deleted while she was out of commission? <br/><br/>The 2nd big Hulk fight sequence has him in clear view and the CGI model looks good (but I still think Ang Lee's Hulk looked better!), this battle appears to end in the death of Blomsky. I assume Hulk banging his head in the cave was thrown in for the children likely to be watching this? Way to make your hero seem like an idiot, I thought.<br/><br/>That scene in the rain with Betty was very reminiscent of the original Frankenstein movie where he plays with the little girl though. We're shown Blomsky was badly injured but survived being attacked by Hulk, he goes onto make a ""miracle"" recovery almost certainly thanks to whatever it was they had injected him with before the battle. We also get yet another nod to the TV series when they refer to student Jack McGee (the name of the reporter who constantly hounded Bruce Banner in the TV series) who is a reporter for the Culver campus newspaper.<br/><br/>Betty & Bruce decide to meet with Bruce's contact in New York, the mysterious Mr Blue who turns out to be Dr Stern to try and cure him which at the time does appear to have taken effect. We then get a bit of pseudo science explaining why Bruce didn't die of radiation sickness years ago.<br/><br/>Blomsky forces Stern to inject him with whatever had been removed from Banner & Blomsky becomes SOMETHING (you can't call it Abomination because it's never official named that. Stern only said Blomsky would become AN Abomination) that the Delta Force soldiers (how have they gone from being Navy SEALS to Delta Force?) mistakenly think is Hulk. In an attempt to stop whatever it is Blomsky has become, Banner jumps from a helicopter hoping he'll become Hulk. Which luckily for him he does as it'd have been awful to have ended the film with Banner as pavement pizza.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear from the start that the Blomsky beast is stronger than Hulk & their fight is pretty impressive but Hulk manages to defeat the Blomsky beast by choking him with a chain (where'd that come from, by the way? And did Hulk actually KILL Blomsky there?).<br/><br/>The ending is very weak, the Tony Stark (fron Iron Man) cameo is short & pointless. I hope this doesn't lead to a sequel."
"frankenbenz","6","1","3","14 June 2008"," Does a bigger Hulk make for a better movie?
","Edward Norton not only stars as Bruce Banner but pulls double duty as screenwriter, picking up where Zak Penn left off. Norton boasts being a Marvel kid while growing up and says he always loved the mythic dimension and contemporary themes of the Hulk. He also claims to be well versed on the original TV series, a nod I was hoping hinted towards a movie driven by character development, as opposed to (what Penn's work has previously exhibited) large scale spectacles of action.<br/><br/>The film's opening credit sequence establishes ties to the TV series by replicating Banner's gamma ray accident, utilizing identical equipment and a few signature shots. Later on we're even treated to a cameo from Lou Ferrigno (who also voices this version of the Hulk), but once we jump into Banner's current situation as a fugitive hiding out in a Brazilian favela, the divide between the TV series and the movie starts to widen.<br/><br/>Before long, General Ross (William Hurt) has caught a whiff of Banner's scent and dispatches a commando team led by über-soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture the outlaw scientist. Banner's concentrated efforts (meditation, jiu-jitsu) to keep the beast within from rearing its big, ugly, green head are wasted when the commando's push become a vicious shove in the darkened bowels of a Brazilian pop bottling plant. From the shadows, the Hulk emerges and shatters nearly everyone and everything around him including any potential for realism this movie may have had.<br/><br/>Once the cartoony Hulk emerges, it displaces Banner's tortured struggle for normalcy as the focal point of the movie. That's not to say Norton doesn't get his share of screen time, but by the time the third act rolls around and Roth's English accented Russian soldier morphs into a hulk-like beast of his own, very little happens aside from things being smashed, blown up and punched at for the remainder of the movie. I might have even enjoyed all this mayhem if it didn't all look so incredibly animated, which (of course) it was.<br/><br/>When you get to a point where you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a movie, there seems to be a disconnect. At this point, the characters you've been asked to invest into are bankrupted and the movie loses whatever potential it had to connect on any profound or engaging levels. <br/><br/>Once the CG trumps the real world, I wondered if, despite its campiness, the Lou Ferrigno Hulk was a better alternative to the big-budget, physics defying cartoon Hulk before me now? There's no question the 70's series suffers from its campiness and budgetary constraints, but at least it managed to create a world where Banner was a compelling character worthy of holding my attention week after week. Is asking a $125 million dollar production to develop complex characters too much to ask? Is it easier making special FX and CG laden spectacles? Is it really a surefire formula for big box office? I'm sure Norton would beg to differ and based on the fact approximately 70 minutes of character driven footage is slated to be released on the inevitable Blu-Ray, maybe we'll be able to judge for ourselves whether character really is more compelling than CG.<br/><br/>As it is, this installment of the Hulk leaves as much to be desired as Ang Lee's did back in 2003. Neither movie is terrible and both have their merits, but each one is incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying for their own unique reasons. In my humble opinion, Bill Bixby still holds the crown as the most complex and engaging Hulk on the block. Hard to believe 1970's low budget camp could out hustle a mega-budget, star laden block buster...but it does. I guess small is often better than big, even if we're talking about a hulk."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","10","13 June 2008"," Hulk Smash! Abomination fights! Pretty good movie!
","I wasn't sure if this new reboot-cum-remake-cum-sequel to 2003's Ang Lee Hulk would make as good, or better than the predecessor. Turns out that the director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn capture the spirit of the Hulk from the comics with lots of fiery action and panache, if not with the flawed ambition of Lee's vision. It's a bashing, smashing, exciting summer blockbuster, giving what it delivers for the fans of the books and even the cheesy 70s TV series, even if it's not quite a great comic book movie. It's also less substantive than other Marvel movies like Spider-Man and Iron Man.<br/><br/>Actually, in a couple of ways, it's close to being better entry than the previous entry, and not simply because Leterrier is suited for the material. Edward Norton fulfills the role of Banner/Hulk with a level of intelligence and subtlety that is uncommon for a role like this. It's great to see him and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination face off and fill up their two-dimensional roles to the hilt. William Hurt is also good as the General Ross, after him with any and all means at his disposal but not a clue to how really to stop him (mostly his role consists of commands barked and some glances of concern over his daughter). Only Liv Tyler is only so-so, often pouting or giving the same look of concern or affection for Banner that makes one pine for Jennifer Connelly from the previous Hulk.<br/><br/>There are moments that disappoint or feel unfulfilled (Stan Lee's cameo here is just a plot device for a bit with Banner's blood in a drink where it could've made for something more interesting than a ""hey, it's Stan Lee"" cameo), and the drive of the story for Leterrier is to load it with music in pretty much every scene. But then there are those terrific scenes of the Hulk doing what many of us love best about the jolly green giant: smashing s*** up to pieces, and having the occasional King Kong beat as the only one who can make him calm down is the girl of his life. Hell, we even get an artistically amazing scene when the Hulk first emerges out of the shadows and darkness in the factory. And by the time Leterrier gets us to the climax, with Hulk and Abomination facing off, it's like eating a box of candy: CGI coated and with the only necessity to keep the action fast and harrowing, but not rushed.<br/><br/>In short, it's an improvement in some ways (not to totally trash Ang Lee's film), and only as satisfying as a big-budget summer popcorn flick can be. It's a fun ride, in short, without too much pretension and good performances (plus, of course, the obligatory ""hint"" for an Avengers movie in the last scene)."
"J_M_Kiff","7","4","33","12 June 2008"," Excellent. (very minor spoiler)
","Very well done. Much better than I expected. Much better than the previous Hulk movie (not that that would be tough). I especially loved the cameos by Stan Lee and Big Lou. Without them it just wouldn't be the Hulk. I grew up watching the TV show, and to me Lou Ferrigno IS the Hulk and always will be. And from the brief look at Lou in the movie, he's still in incredible shape. You only get to see him in one scene, but his arms are just HUGE! How old is he anyhow? He must've been in his twenties when he did the TV show, and that was darn near 30 years ago! I wish I could be jacked up like Big Lou when I'm in my 50's. Very well done."
"TheMovieDoctorful","1","1","4","20 November 2018"," One Of The Worst Comic Book Films of All Time
","Do you remember the film Barton Fink? Where playwright Barton Fink is hired by a Hollywood studio to write a script for a wrestling picture, a script that's thought provoking, intelligent and artistic, but audiences hate it, so his ideas get ditched and the studio goes with an intelligence insulting slugfest to appease the masses? Think of Ang Lee's Hulk as Fink's original vision and the MCU's Incredible Hulk as its pandering, soulless, beat-em-up successor. The only difference is that the source material behind The Incredible Hulk is, contrary to popular belief, some of the most emotional, complex and thematically rich material in all of superhero comics. However, that's apparently not what mainstream audiences think of when they think of The Hulk. They think of a big green monster who smashes things and sometimes hits other big color monsters. Which is exactly what we got with this.<br/><br/>If I could describe The Incredible Hulk in 2 words, it would be ""missed opportunities."" Whether it's genuinely interesting stuff, like having the Hulk actually put Betty in the ER in the beginning of the film, or just common sense that the writers missed, like having the Hulk go on a rampage on a college campus in one of the most densely populated cities in the United States in the DAYTIME with no civilians panicking and nobody getting definitive proof of his existence. Nothing in this film that can be executed competently is. The script is so unfathomably dumb that characters will forget things that already happened. Major events, too! For example, when Hulk transforms at the college campus, Thunderbolt Ross says ""Now she'll see!"" Despite the fact that he knows Betty saw Bruce when he first transformed! THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM! Hell, earlier in that scene, Betty refers to her own father as ""General!""<br/><br/>Edward Norton as the Hulk is just underwhelming. I simply don't buy him as an angry person, even a bottled up one. Whereas both Eric Bana and Mark Ruffalo conveyed their anger very intensely, Norton just seems anxious and nervous. There's no tension or suspense when he's about to transform, it never feels like a horrible curse as it should. It feels more like a self defense weapon if anything. In the end, this may be chalked up more to bad writing a bit more than bad acting, with the film having no idea what made the Hulk's anger relatable. That being said, this defense can only go so far, and by the time the film hits the third act, it becomes painfully apparent in Norton's increasingly wooden delivery that he's just phoning it in.<br/><br/>Okay, so while Edward Norton is a phenomenal actor who, at the end of the day, really isn't trying, Tim Roth is just absolute trash in this. Especially in the few scenes where he genuinely tries to give an emotion. His portrayal of blinding actor is not significantly different from my reaction to getting a C+ on a college essay. That's not even mentioning the 3rd act, where his delivery is so bad that it genuinely sounds like he can't speak English and is about to pass out from over-exhaustion. However, the absolute worst sin of this movie, for me personally, the one massive failure for which I can't forgive, is its depiction of Abomination. Emil Blonsky was hardly a perfect person in the comics, but he wasn't an abusive dick either. His selflessness, charitable nature, intellect and capacity for unconditional love all imbued the character with a real humanity and relatability that ultimately made him my 3rd favorite Marvel comics character. He was a character who was always quick to put his neck out for the outcast; the domestic abuse victim, the homeless man, the orphaned child. He even gave up any chance for a happy life with his wife Nadia for her own happiness. One could argue the only reason he ended up a villain at all is because fate and outside intervention consistently force him into that role. Blonsky in this movie is the kind of person who would beat up a prostitute. It's really not a stretch, he already beats up 2 women in this movie for literally no reason. I could care less about his aesthetic design (Despite the fact it's laughably poor and lacks personality of any kind), my problem is that he acts nothing like Abomination. There's no talk of him mourning his old wife Nadia (In fact, Nadia isn't mentioned at all, despite being central to Abomination's character development in the comics), there's no talk of how he desires to be a hero deep down, there's no talk of how his life has been taken from him or how he regrets his terrible decision. This film's incarnation of Abomination was so soulless and so devoid of anything resembling depth, character or nuance, that it ultimately led to Marvel killing off the character in the comics due to plummeting popularity. Yes, this film adapted a character so badly that it literally killed him. I'm almost impressed.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is an Incredible Flop. I've heard a lot of people say on social media that it's secretly ""underrated"" and I'd agree; Underrated in how bad it is. From its missed creative opportunities to its awful acting performances to its dumbed down characterizations all within a nonsensical and childish screenplay. This is one of the worst comic book films I've ever seen, MCU or non-MCU. It is right down there with Green Lantern and Ghost Rider. The MCU can give us 15 more excellent Captain America films. As far as I'm concerned, it will never make up for this hulking trainwreck."

","Hulkamania is back on the screen! He's green! He's mean! He's ...uh ...green and mean.<br/><br/>With less than five years separating Ang Lee's 2003 version entitled simply HULK, French director Louis Leterrier (who's done a few questionable films in the recent past, including TRANSPORTER 2 and DANNY THE DOG aka UNLEASHED), takes up the Marvel comic book reigns and takes a shot at the pi$$ed off Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Replacing Erica Bana (MUNICH) as the Hulk/Bruce Banner is film star Edward Norton (THE PAINTED VEIL). Norton's film repertoire up to now has been fairly superlative: American HISTORY X, DEATH TO SMOOCHY, FIGHT CLUB, THE Italian JOB, DOWN IN THE VALLEY, THE ILLUSIONIST, and several other high caliber films decorate his resume, so I was expecting another engaging film from him. Although I found his performance to be good, the story suffered from a lack of direction; it's goal seeming to be only to tell you that another film is coming with the Hulk's involvement. In other words, no plot.<br/><br/>Marvel has had a couple of successes lately, though, and one can't necessarily knock them for doing what they're doing, which is setting comic book fans up for ""something big"". Their highest claim to fame is undoubtedly IRON MAN starring Robert Downey Jr. I loved Iron Man. Downey Jr. encapsulated the character and was both funny and cocky. A great match. But here, with THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we get a jumble of quality.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is undeniably due to the fact that this film comes off the heals of Ang Lee's version. Lee's Hulk was anything but perfect, let's make that perfectly clear. But it did reinvent Hulk and gave us a unique look at the dynamics behind the character. Here in The Incredible Hulk, we get a forced love story (with no background, really), an intro to the Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns. The Abomination's inclusion will obviously play a vital part in upcoming films, and I appreciate that, but let's tell a good story along with it. Lee's Hulk, at the very least, did that.<br/><br/>There are a few positive qualities here, though. The cast is fairly strong except for another wooden performance by William Hurt (INTO THE WILD). He seemed to be just going through the motions. There's also the fact that the film feels more like the television series, jumping us right into Bannon's life and his isolation due to his medical condition. We also get a glimpse of the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno (if you pay attention).<br/><br/>But these positives do not outweigh the negatives. Lacking any real direction, The Incredible Hulk is interesting eye-candy with plenty of action but little substance ...which made me turn a bit green."

It's no surprise that the studios decided to forget the first Hulk movie ever happened. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have learned from their errors, because after five years of waiting we get another Hulk movie that is almost as slow, melodramatic, poorly acted, and silly looking as the other one.<br/><br/>The one thing that is fairly decent is the action itself. It's by no means great, there are a lot of anti-climaxes and it's not very suspenseful to see nearly-invincible heroes in action, but it does have its moments.<br/><br/>Sadly, there isn't all that much action though, which would not be such a big problem if there was something else in lieu of the action. Whereas a similar movie like Iron Man had fun characters, a lot of humor, and a serviceable story, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has, well, nothing.<br/><br/>Seriously, this movie is virtually plot less. Hulk fights, hulk escapes, hulk gets found again, hulk fights. Rinse and repeat. The editing is all over the place, whole chunks of the movie seem to have gone missing, resulting in sloppiness like the Hulk being in Rio one moment, and thousands of miles away in Nicaragua the next. It's almost like they didn't have a script due to the screen writer's strike and just made something up on the spot, then added dramatic music to every scene to cover up the fact that nothing actually happens.<br/><br/>The actors are doing their best I suppose, but even Edward Norton cannot save the horribly dry and cliché dialog. The characters are all wooden, and miss any kind of motivation. Why on earth did the military guy, Blonksy, suddenly want to be the bad guy, it felt totally random just like about everything else in this movie, and I'm not even talking about the totally anticlimactic and nonsensical way the bad guy is defeated.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm expecting a bit too much from a ""mindless"" action movie, but ""Hulk"" obviously tries to be a bit more than just mindless action, and fails spectacularly in that aspect. It's not as cringe-inducingly bad as the Ang Lee version, it's just profoundly dull."

","After Transformers and Ironman didn't make me turn off the TV I thought I might give this one a try as well. It wasn't really bad either but clearly inferior to the other two. The entire story just was just building up the main fight, the movie felt forced a lot. Special effects weren't always top notch, many of Hulk's animations looked unnatural. I also expected more action scenes - he turns into Hulk just three times! Ironman also had only three big action/fighting scenes but Ironman also had all those scenes where he was improving and testing the suits. When the final battle started I had this ""Okay, just get it over with"" feeling and wasn't excited at all. But I have to say that Tim Roth gave a wonderful performance as Hulks adversary. I enjoyed his scenes many times more than Hulk's."

","When I first saw that this movie was coming out to theaters...I was a little disappointed. My first reaction was ""oh great. another unneeded remake. most likely just to make a quick buck"". I will also add that I was surprised and relieved after i viewed this film because it was not at all what I had expected at first. and come on Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt all together...that's the sign of great potential to be a good film. Overall, it was a ""decent"" (don't take that word for any more than I'm trying to use it as) film that at least kept me awake and maybe a little interested. it definitely had its downfalls (for example: who goes to watch a movie called ""The Incredible Hulk"" to watch a bunch of people discuss what they should do?....no! they come to watch Hulk Smash!!!! So, my suggestion is that they should have shown more Hulk than just the characters running from each other). Anyways, I will compare this film to the original because I didn't mind the original...even though it seems everyone else did. I thought it wasn't as bad as everyone said, but that's not the important issue. I believe this movie and the original are about the same, so if you hated the original I wouldn't give this a try, but if you loved the original then don't expect any differences but do expect coming out with a good feeling. So, even though I didn't come out that disappointed there were still some pretty major flaws that brought it down on its knees. It's just the same old superhero concept; The main character has superhuman abilities, has to learn to control them and use them for good, the conflict arises as another equally powerful villain, and thus ending in a great battle between good vs. evil and, of course, good comes out victorious. 6/10 for enjoyment reasons only....oh and P.S. ***spoilers (not bad ones though) spoilers*** Robert Downey Jr. makes a surprise appearance at the end as Mr. Tony Stark (Iron Man) in which he discusses with one of the main characters that he and his group are thinking about making a team...most likely hinting that there will be a movie with all the superheroes and villains to make one colossal movie (something along the lines of The Avengers)...that got me excited."
"Monotreme02","6","1","4","18 October 2008"," Average; the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero genre
","If the most commonly remembered generalization of the film output of the 1980's is teen comedies with synthesized soundtracks, the 2000's will be most remembered and generalized as the decade of the comic book movies. I have no specific qualms with the genre, quite the contrary: I think there are a handful of superhero films that are conversely at the top of their game and major recent plus points for the action-adventure genre, and this Summer also brought us the genre's greatest output, The Dark Knight. Great films like Batman Begins, X2 and Spider-Man 2 were countered by pretty lousy adaptations like Elektra and Fantastic Four, but it is The Incredible Hulk, I think, that signifies the beginning of the end for the genre.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't really bad by any means at all, certainly not like Fantastic Four. Much effort has been put into both production value and telling a quality story while avoiding camp and cheesiness. Special effects are top-notch and there are plenty of grand, crowd-pleasing set pieces and action sequences that really keep the ball rolling. On the other hand, an effort has been made to attempt to keep the movie in a semi-realistic setting: sure, there are fantastical elements such as gene-altering radiation, superhuman creatures like Hulk and Abomination, far-fetched and fantastical military technology and other such things, but like Spider-Man 2 these factors are regulated to a realistic setting, avoiding the camp and altogether silliness that abound films such as Joel Schumacher's Batman films or Elektra. Marvel's taking over of their film properties and self-producing the blockbusters seems to indicate an increase in the quality of the productions, as the Marvel producers take pride in their creations, treat them with respect and take them very seriously.<br/><br/>As with this summer's Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk has also managed to attract to itself a major star who is not usually associated with this type of work and who takes it seriously. Edward Norton brings a little something else to the table, and it is evident that he tries his best to do the most with the Bruce Banner character and make him as believable and accessible as possible, without much success as the script basically requires him to sleepwalk through the Banner scenes as preludes to the centerpiece Hulk sequences. The rest of the supporting cast are strong as well, with such heavyweights as William Hurt and Tim Roth rounding it all out and bringing in their own signature styles and commanding presences.<br/><br/>Hollywood has already attempted to bring Marvel's Hulk character to the big screen once before, resulting in one of the most polarizing comic book movies ever made. Some people can't stand a minute of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk movie, while others praise it and see its merit through the flaws. I belong in the second group, and furthermore feel like the two Hulk movies really complete one another. While Ang Lee's film was indefinitely flawed, both in its special effects work and in its ridiculously over-the-top set pieces that really took away from the experience, from a Hulk poodle attack to the terrible final showdown with Nick Nolte's villain. But on the other hand, the characterization and character development in the film was among the strongest of any superhero movie yet. Banner was made out as someone out of a Shakespearian tragedy  wrongfully accused, misunderstood, thrust into a situation against his will. He is not exhilarated from his powers but rather afraid, mortified of them. We are also treated to the revelation that Bruce and Betty Ross' relationship revolves around their both having fathers they couldn't count on, although both of their fathers are featured in the film and are shown as caring and compassionate as well as monstrous and abusive.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk serves as an anti-thesis to Lee's film. While Lee's film was weak on the action scenes, Leterrier's film excels in them, portraying them as realistic, gritty and thrilling, and avoiding camp altogether. Unfortunately, this seems to come at the expense of character development, even though Edward Norton really tries his best to up the ante.<br/><br/>Now, I would like to bring this back to my initial point, and explain why The Incredible Hulk marks the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero comic book adaptation genre. While Iron Man benefited from a sense of fun and Robert Downey, Jr.'s irresistible charm, and The Dark Knight was something in a completely different league, The Incredible Hulk, which was released in theatres right between the two other comic book juggernauts, comes across as frightfully run-of-the-mill: good, well-made, but bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. With Marvel studios lining up feature films for Thor, Captain America, Ant-Man and Nick Fury, as well as one massive The Avengers film bringing together all their independently produced film characters, it can very easily be seen that unless each film takes a completely unique standpoint and brings something really special and new to the table, they will all start feeling redundant really fast and really soon. Also, what after The Avengers? There aren't nearly enough comic book superheroes to bankroll endless comic book adaptation films, and there can only be so many sequels  both the X-Men and Spider-Man franchises crashed-and-burned whatever quality they had by film 3, Superman is already washed up, Christopher Nolan probably won't make any more than one more Batman film, and who knows how successful Marvel's upcoming, lesser-known superhero movies will fare. The Incredible Hulk, featuring a fairly universally known hero, didn't fare too well at the box office, which leaves the future of the genre, at least in my opinion, pretty clear."

","Far be it from me to point these things out (my own RATMAN is a cross between The Shadow, Zorro, and Batman), but this latest version of THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS isn't much better than the previous one.

Time had clearly taken its toll on Johnson, but there he was, lurching around in his ragged shirt, making inarticulate growling noises. At one point, vice-presidential wannabe (and real life Stepford Wife) Sarah ""Six Pack"" Palin puts in an appearance. It didn't save the movie (nor will it save the Republican Party), but at least THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS was an honest attempt at telling the story of THE INCREDIBLE HULK OF YUCCA FLATS."

","Firstly, the Hulk is the star, an impressive beast that smashes things up. His expressions are soulful. His rage is real. Kudos to the effects team on creating this likable green monster and its surrounding action scenes. If this is all you want from a Hulk film then enjoy! They really deliver the goods with Hulk action.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there isn't much else to enjoy about the film and it really hurts to say it. Well there are a couple of comedy moments to chuckle at there is a sprinkle of cross over elements with Iron Man and future films set in the Marvel universe which makes for an exciting prospect for fans.<br/><br/>This movie stars Ed Norton, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and Liv Tyler. A high calibre cast indeed with a beautiful Elf thrown in to the mix. Shame then that they are all miscast or to be quite blunt very very bland including the bad guys which is a crime for this kind of movie. The characters had zero entertainment value that I was crying for more Hulk. <br/><br/>Another major problem I had with this film is the story. Bruce Banner quite understandably in context with the story wants to get rid of the hulk and spends the whole movie trying to banish him whilst being on the run from the military who wants his blood to create super soldiers. That's the whole story of the film. My problem is I don't want Bruce to banish the hulk because his character is so bland I want more Hulk! Plus we know he wont succeed anyway, otherwise what kind of a hulk movie would this be if we don't see the hulk? In other words, the story had no tension. <br/><br/>But as I said earlier, the hulk segments are most enjoyable. There are tender scenes with Hulk and Liv that reminded me of Peter Jackson's King Kong, in fact I would have to say they blatantly ripped off a few scenes from King Kong but as I was a bit desperate to enjoy what this movie has to offer, I let that go!<br/><br/>This is the second movie in a new Marvel comic movie franchise. The first was Iron Man which was a far more entertaining movie because the main characters (good and bad) were dynamic and had charisma, something sorely lacking in the Hulk. I am sorry this is a rather negative review but Marvel set a good standard with Iron Man and then lowered the bar half way down on this film. Lower you expectations and you may not be as disappointed as I. I rate this 6/10."
"lefsug99","6","1","4","17 September 2008"," Norton good, action boring
","I must admit I never liked the HULK concept. An angry green guy that smashes things... I do like the concept of Bruce Banner. Torn apart by the unstoppable force that gets unleashed as soon as he gets too upset he can't live a normal life. The only choice he has is to become a drifter outside society.<br/><br/>In the incredible Hulk Edward Norton makes a great Bruce Banner. Far away from his earlier life we find him working in a third world factory. There's no question he want his old life back, he carries a picture of Liv Tyler with him and on his laptop he has a contact (Mr Blue) that is trying to find a solution to his HULK problem.<br/><br/>So far, the story and acting is good. The problem with many superhero-movies is that they need super-villains. We've seen the problem with one villain too much in spiderman 3 and that is what the incredible hulk suffers from as well. The action sequences with the abomination is plain boring and it would be enough to see Bruce Banner gets hunted by the authorities without having to involve something just to get to sell plastic toys to kids..."

The hulk is not supposed to be fit and trim but an over-sized oddity, obscenely huge, defying reality as in the comic book.<br/><br/>It appears that Stan Lee bowed to public pressure and made a movie called ""big green monster"". Angst Lee had it right. The first iteration was true to the comic book and the acting was better with real interaction and feeling between the characters.

I gave ""Hulk"" a three rating, so this one was twice as good.<br/><br/>There was definitely better action in this one. The aggressors/bad guys Hulk fought were more worthy and had more to offer which made the action sequences a lot better. I think the '03 Hulk color and image was good enough without making him grayer with more muscle striations as they did in the '08 Hulk.<br/><br/>I still wasn't incredibly impressed with the overall product. Maybe because Iron Man preceded this movie, or maybe it just wasn't great, but I thought the movie could still be better. The story was too generic and didn't offer much, plus the bad guy was too contrived. Betty Ross detracted from the story and after Spiderman, I'm getting sick of affection in the rain. Plus, the damage and fights weren't creative enough.

"fertilecelluloid","4","1","4","1 July 2008"," Big budget wrestling movie not my drop of poison
","A wrestling movie with a green guy gets boring after a while; I guess that's why the brainiacs at the studio hired Edward Norton to play the wrestler in the non-wrestling scenes. A film version of the Lou Ferrigno- and Bill Bixby-starring TV series, this is a reasonable waste of time that outstays its welcome once the wrestling takes over. Norton, a troubled fellow who's carrying a dangerous chemical in his blood, is hiding in Brazil from government agents who want to use him as a weapon. As you already know, when he gets angry he gets violent. He starts throwing stuff around and deflecting bullets. When the government, personified by William Hurt, learns of Norton's whereabouts, they ambush his hideout and shoot lots of bullets that get deflected. Tim Roth, a professional soldier, is brought in as a secret weapon who also likes to wrestle and cause mayhem; only difference is, he's bigger and uglier. Like most Marvel material, this is predictable and inspired by a thousand other stories. The climactic showdown is just another video game featuring violent pounding and mass destruction. Having decent actors in clichÃ©d parts adds credibility, I guess, to this bloated, overproduced exercise, but it just felt like lots of noise to me.

"naun","6","1","4","23 June 2008"," Hulk vs Hulk
","*** SPOILERS BELOW *** <br/><br/>Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk film was perhaps less than the sum of its parts. Still, the parts themselves were often striking, and as long as you had nothing against exploding frogs, split screens, heavily italicized comic-book dialogue, psychedelic Dali-inspired dream sequences, Hulk poodles, and a deranged Nick Nolte, you could be more than adequately entertained for long stretches of the film. Its main problem was that its notion of the Hulk as embodying a regression to a state of infantile rage sounded better in theory than it worked on the screen. The fanboys who complained about their hero being reduced to a big green baby weren't wrong.<br/><br/>The new Hulk film returns to the more familiar -- to those of us raised on the TV series -- Jekyll-and-Hyde archetype, now with Edward Norton credibly stepping into the Bill Bixby role. Dr Banner is again the haunted scientist searching to cure his terrible secret affliction. The Jekyll-and-Hyde premise is a tried-and-tested formula, and the new film begins well, with shrewd borrowings from the earlier film (the first of many, right from the imagery and expository use of the opening credits) and the Bond franchise. In no time at all we are in the midst of a superbly executed street chase, culminating in our first dramatic glimpse of the Hulk.<br/><br/>The trouble is, none of the film's later action sequences equal the tension of this early scene. By the time the Hulk takes melancholy refuge in a hillside cave midway through the movie, a sense of deja vu is already sinking in; and when we reach the ostensibly climactic final fight, we are, as one critic rightly observed, in King Kong versus Godzilla territory. For this turns out to be a film, assuredly intelligent and accomplished though it is in places, that nonetheless has not a single original idea of its own. Can anyone doubt that, this time, the studio made sure it got exactly the film it ordered? The cast looks good on paper, but thanks to a moderate script mostly delivers one-note performances. It's particularly disappointing to see William Hurt wasted in the role of General Ross. In the earlier film Sam Elliott brought both menace and empathy to the role. Hurt can manage neither, but he is not given much to work with. I also sorely missed the earlier film's sheer visual spectacle. The new film begins amid stunning views of an impoverished Brazilian township, but there is nothing later in the film to match the first film's desert chase, where the Hulk does battle with the military against a backdrop of vast sand dunes, ancient rock formations, and finally San Francisco's traffic.<br/><br/>The Hulk utters one of his signature lines at the climax of that scene: ""Puny human!"" He is hallucinating as he falls unconscious from a fighter plane he has ridden into the stratosphere, and he is addressing his terrified human alter ego. The new film gives him his other signature utterance, also at the climax of the action: ""Hulk SMASH!"" At this point the Hulk pounds a hole in the ground and his opponent falls into it. The contrast just about sums up the difference in ambition between the two films."
"TermlnatriX","7","1","4","20 June 2008"," Entertaining, but lacks the depth of the first.
","I think this version gets it easier than Ang Lee's Hulk because most already saw the origin story in Lee's attempt and see Leterrier's as a continuation of the series. There's slightest attempt here at an explanation or background, just small flashes and fragments in the opening credit sequence. And to my understanding this was just a ""re-imagining"" ? so where's all that? Seems like they're exploiting Lee's HULK in that department. All that aside, this version does provide what the original was lacking; the showdown between two big monsters. And we are supplied with a lot more action than in the first, if my memory serves me right. Pace is clearly faster, because they don't have to worry about building up any kind of background story (Hey, I can't just let it go if this is being labeled as a ""re-imagining"") so the emphasis is on other things.<br/><br/>I think this version has what the first lacked, but it lacks what the first had.

","For old time HULK fan, the story didn't quite make it. Whenever Hollywood messes with Stan Lee's plot, it always seems to come out worse. The plot is pure Hollywood - movie trying to put one action scene after another, but nothing innovative about cars being tossed around or chopper coming crashing down, or soldiers chasing Bruce Banner. What I'm complaining here is - it didn't capture the essence of the HULK. It was just a busy movie. HULK CG also didn't capture the subtle character of the HULK either. Good was Edward Norton as Dr. Banner. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was somewhat of a mismatch also. I think they teach method acting to the actors, but do the actors really have the time to assimilate the characters that are fleshed out so well by Stan Lee ? Maybe that's not the point since Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow did a pretty credible job of portraying Tony Stark and Pepper Pots in Ironman. I think Ironman's success was it wasn't a Hollywood production, but Marvel had ownership of the production. So I guess my wish for the future of the HULK is - Marvel will take on the production, and nail the great story with subtleties that only the owner of that culture can put into the scenes."

Bruce Banner mumbles in mangled Portuguese at the start of this all-or-nothing stab at reanimating the DOA Hulk franchise.<br/><br/>Delivered to a bunch of gringo-hating factory workers at the Rio bottling plant where the fugitive scientist is working undercover, it's the first indication of the bold new direction French director Louis Leterrier (The Transporters 1 & 2, Unleashed) wants to take with what is, for all Universal's protestations to the contrary, Hulk Part Deux. Out go Ang Lee's comic book panel-replicating visuals, his ponderous art-house sensibilities and those long, lingering close-ups on his stars' anguished features. Instead, his successor does something very different Â– he brings the funny. Whether seeking out elasticised trousers in a Mexican market or trying to keep his cool in a speeding New York taxi cab, it's a tactic Edward Norton seems more than happy to run with. As both leading man and pseudonymous co-writer (a sign of a mooted dispute with Leterrier and producers Marvel over the final cut), the Fight Club actor has more riding on this than anyone else and responds with what may be his most appealingly quicksilver performance to date.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine anybody making a runaway boffin poisoned by gamma radiation trying desperately to contain the raging id within even halfway credible. But Norton somehow does, implicating us in his protagonist's Jekyll-and-Hyde dilemma while gently tipping the wink to its essential ludicrousness. (If you're unconvinced, check out the scene where he apologetically desists from coitus with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross lest it escalate his heart rate and bring on a transformation.) All of which creates an unusual problem: The Incredible Hulk is at its most entertaining when the Hulk himself is off-screen. Bring him on and the picture becomes spectacularly average: a bland CGI extravaganza which pits Banner's green alter-ego (leaner and more sinewy than the original's bulbous Gumby) against hi-tech military hardware, exploding fireballs and a fellow pixellated mutant to increasingly numbing effect. The last of these, the much-vaunted Abomination, is the movie's deadliest WMD, facilitating as it does an extended smackdown on the streets of Harlem that gives the film its set-piece climax. As with the Hulk, though, he's much more compelling in human form, Tim Roth evincing a snarling ferocity and feral machismo as the carnage-craving commando who lives for the fight. It's telling that the single most exciting sequence Â– a breathless foot pursuit through Rio's cramped, vertiginous favelas Â– has not one fantastical bogeyman in sight.<br/><br/>After all, who needs computers when you have two of the greatest actors of their generation going hell for leather in one of the most geographically improbable locations on the planet?<br/><br/>Better than Hulk? That's a given, especially with Norton and Roth leading the cast. When they give way to their CG replacements, though, Leterrier's film loses the very elements that lift it out of the ordinary."
"john-quel","8","1","4","14 June 2008"," Not ""Iron Man"" but good enough for now
","There is nothing wrong with this version of the ""Incredible Hulk."" Everything from the actors to the production values feels right. In brief, the story gets the job done and there are enough human moments to carry the viewer through the action sequences that on occasion have a little too much action. The effects are fine, though most of them are standard issue things-blow-up-real-good stuff and sophisticated viewers will no doubt ""see the wires"" in some of the shots. (I must mention that the effect involving the Sound Cannons is new and very well done -- such a weapon is I believe feasible and readers of ""Atlas Shrugged"" will not doubt appreciate the possible reference to the ""Thompson Harmonizer."") <br/><br/>I liked the movie in other words and I think most people will too, but leaving the theater, keeping in mind all that the movie had going for it, I had to wonder why I didn't like it as much as ""Iron Man."" It's hard to pin down but I think the gist of it is that Tony Stark the hero of ""Iron Man"" is always engaging the world, positively or negatively, and there is a pronounced character arc to his story. We get a real sense, thanks to Downey's remarkable performance, that his transformation could really happen. That it does happen in movie time, of course, means they happens way too fast for real life, but Downey makes us believe it. We like and cheer for him no matter what he does. There is never a trace of self-pity in him. Banner on the other hand is always on the run and his determined refusal to come to grips with his world distances himself from us throughout the movie. Likely his particular plight works better on television then on the large screen, especially in a movie as over the top as this one. Plenty of us can feel sympathy for Banner, I certainly can, but on the whole most of us aren't that compelled to watch a movie about it.<br/><br/>Another complaint I had was his relationship with Betty. Since we see nothing of what transpired before the laboratory episode between them, I had strong doubts that she would pitch aside her current relationship in an instant when Banner makes an appearance. I kept waiting for the ""I love you Bruce but I'm not in love with you"" scene, but it never came. Tiresome as that scene is, it is credible, and what I was seeing on the screen was not. Even Spiderman II handled that situation better, though admittedly not by much.<br/><br/>The final problem is this: what is really going on inside the Hulk's mind? Banner dismisses the notion but the transformation from raw, unstoppable force, to caring super-beast is strongly implied but we have no idea why, let alone how, it took place. Iron man inside his suit is still Tony Stark, but Banner inside the Hulk we are told is nothing, a zero, gone. We don't believe it, we can't believe it on the basis of what is happening on the screen, yet we are given nothing to work with to resolve the conflict.<br/><br/>So the film is a good beginning to the series and the way these stories interlock in future films should be quite interesting. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is not ""Iron Man"" but by the very nature of the material it was probably impossible that it would be."
"IMDb_advocate","8","1","4","14 June 2008"," Overall very entertaining but CGI can still be improved upon...
","I must agree with some of the positive comments as well as some of the not-so-positive ones. First off I want to say that I'm a huge Hulk fan and was really hopeful that I'd be blown away by this movie. In some aspects, I was. In others, not so much. Props go to the casting director(with two small exceptions), Leterrier's trademark fast-paced direction, his homage paid to the TV series and the somewhat improved CGI. William Norton is perfectly cast for this role. It showed that he researched and really knew the character he was portraying. William Hurt I thought at first would not do as good a job playing Ross as Sam Elliott did but I was completely wrong in that prediction. He was wonderful! Great pacing in this movie. Never a dull moment. True Leterrier style movie-making! The scenes shot in Brazil were breathtaking and my favorite portion of the movie. The disappointments? While Norton resembled Banner better in all aspects than Eric Bana, Liv Tyler pales in comparison to Jennifer Connelly. There never seemed to be much range of emotion from her. Just this constant look of shock/astonishment. Though nice to look at, never does she convince me she has the intellect, confidence or wherewithal a brilliant scientist would exude. She comes off like a little girl in awe of everything happening around her. I'm probably exaggerating here but that is all I can honestly remember about her performance. The other casting gaffe in my opinion was Tim Roth. Not because of his acting ability (he was excellent in that regard) but, instead, because his diminutive stature. As at least one previous poster stated, Roth looks absolutely puny beside Hurt plus, as evidenced in the scenes with his shirt off, his physical conditioning doesn't resemble what I would picture an elite soldier possessing. And what's up with the facial hair? Is that even allowed in the military? Those were the two slight casting flubs in my opinion but the bigger problem I had with the movie was the erratic quality of the CGI. I'm not going to totally bash it like some have because it was excellent at times, like during the closeups. The ""cave"" scene demonstrated the highs and lows perfectly. Overall I thought that scene fared poorly on the CGI scale but, for a few short seconds, when the camera got especially close to Hulk it looked quite realistic! The Abomination, BTW, looked consistently fantastic and was truly fearsome looking! While Hulk's anatomy was much improved over the 2003 version, I'm not sure Rhythm & Hues upped the illusion of realism that much. Finally, I thought the final scene wasn't as dramatic as it should have been. I'm not saying it was lame by any stretch of the imagination but it definitely could have been improved upon. I didn't see what caused Hulk to get the upper hand on the Abomination after getting his butt kicked thoroughly up until then. Also, after ""brilliant"" Betty stopped Hulk from justifiably killing the Abomination, how are we to conceive that the military could contain him once he revives? In the comics, even though he always finds a way back into the storyline, we're at least led to believe the Abomination is killed by Hulk. I guess there's always a possibility that's all planned out in the sequel. Maybe the Abomination pairing up with the Leader, possibly leading to Iron Man coming to Hulk's aid? Sounds interesting...<br/><br/>I'd rate it a success overall and worth seeing at least once. For me, I'll wait until it is released in the dollar theater to see it a second time and then anxiously await the DVD release."
"MJalazo","8","1","4","14 June 2008"," A worthy comic book adaptation... just leave your memories of the TV show at the door
","First off, like many others here, I am a huge Hulk fan, and am prone to minimize what's wrong with this movie (I'm putting that bias up front, so people can judge my comments more objectively). Second, I loved the television series, and had much less exposure to the comics, but am familiar with the comic book adaptation enough to draw some basic comparisons.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with very high expectations that it would rival or exceed the dramatic flair of the television series. This was a big mistake. Why? Well, the television series was an adaptation of the comic. Plus, it was filmed in the late seventies, when CGI didn't exist, budgets were limited, and stories were simpler in their formulation and execution. With these constraints, it made perfect sense for the series to focus on the dramatic internal struggle of Bill Bixby. He usually had forty minutes of every hour to do this, prior to his two ""Hulk-Outs."" The Hulk itself, as a human, could only destroy so much.<br/><br/>As a fan of the comic, though, where the only limits are set by the reader's imagination, the Hulk story was very different. The comic-book Hulk was boundless, larger than life, relentless in its destruction, and occasionally evil. So, if you're going to make a movie with a $130 million dollar budget, by a studio with comic-book origins, it's natural that the movie should be an overblown feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>This movie will give you that, and more. The CGI Hulk is magnificent in its destruction. I very much felt like I was watching the ape from the recent King Kong, both in terms of its nuances and overall movement patterns. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the same architects were behind both. The violence is strong and occasionally unsettling, but very much in keeping with the Hulk from the comics. General Ross, played by William Hurt, is a great adversary, as is the Abomination. I wasn't too keen on Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, for although he did an adequate job, he's too short and not a worthy foe. If they wanted a credible foreign villain who was physically imposing, I would have much preferred to see the new James Bond in this role. The origin of the character of the Leader is cleverly done, and the actor who played him did a nice job.<br/><br/>As for one of the fundamental elements, how does Edward Norton do? Again, trying to leave my bias for the TV show aside, he does well. He captures the pain of being a loner well, but I felt there wasn't enough conviction to his anger, and he doesn't sell that emotion well. The leadups to the Hulk-outs felt somewhat rushed, as were the Hulkouts themselves. But once we see the Hulk... wow.<br/><br/>In sum, if you're a fan of the comics and just want to see visceral rage and all-out destruction, this is a very good movie. 8.5 out of 10. If you're more a fan of the series and want a serious amount of drama so you care more both for Banner and the Hulk's plight, this movie was okay but somewhat lacking in this area. 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that Norton wanted a movie that was thirty minutes longer and more dramatic. Had he gotten his wish, I think Marvel would have had a blockbuster on their hands, well better than Iron Man, which I also liked. I'll see what the extended version DVD brings... even if it's more dramatic, though, I'll hope for the rumored deleted scene involving a standoff between Hulk and polar bears, as the action never gets old.<br/><br/>Hulk Smash!!!"

"jboothmillard","8","1","5","28 April 2009"," The Incredible Hulk
","This isn't a sequel to the 2003 Ang Lee/Eric Bana version, and compared to that rubbish, this is a great revamp of the popular green anti-hero monster, from director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2). The story is set after the gamma rays accident with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding in the slums of Brazil, finding ways to control his anger to stop himself turning into the Hulk. Mainly though he is trying to find the cure to his condition with the help of a computer friend named ""Mr. Blue"", and with Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) and his troops finding and chasing him, that could prove difficult. After an ""incident"", Bruce returns to America to find past love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to get her help to find a cure for his condition. Meanwhile, soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) wants to become like Bruce after seeing his transformation and strength, but obviously more controlled. Bruce and Betty do eventually find ""Mr. Blue"", Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) and they try to find the cure, or at least something to help control his condition. It is when insane-with-power Blonsky manages to turn into the big monster, or The Abomination, that Bruce decides he has to try and turn into Hulk again to defeat him, and then he runs away into hiding. The film ends with Gen. Ross being told by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, of a ""team"" being made, so this is either to be a continuation, or spin-off film about all the Marvel superheroes being brought together. Also starring Christina Cabot as Major Kathleen Sparr, Ty Burrell as Leonard, Lou Ferrigno as The Incredible Hulk and a Security Guard and Stan Lee as an Old Man. Norton is much more convincing than Bana, the supporting cast all do very well, the special effects are impressive, and the action and chases are much more engaging. Very good!"
"theskulI42","5","1","5","7 November 2008"," A gross overcorrection in tone provides the same result.
","Well, here we are, in possibly the most unique situation in film history: a film that is simultaneously a remake, a sequel, a new adaptation, an adaptation functioning as a sequel, a sequel functioning as a remake, and you could add the word ""pseudo"" to everything in the paragraph.<br/><br/>'The Incredible Hulk', as it stands, exists because of the film it precedes, Ang Lee's oft-criticized 'Hulk', a film that had the gall to take a comic book hero whose main characteristic is that he smashes things, and give him a backstory and character development, in an attempt to add some depth to the usual action movie histrionics. Unfortunately, he failed miserably, as there is both too much chatter and worse, almost all of it is the same sort of generic, familiar pap that all comic book films have. It wasn't any smarter or more intellectual than the other films of its ilk, it just wanted you to think it was because it treated what most entries use as montages as the main action, and the action scenes as short punctuation in between blocks of text.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the mainstream, people who hate dialogue-heavy films when they DO possess intelligence and depth, hated this pseudo-intellectual, hideously over-directed nonsense, and Marvel realized if they wanted to continue, they were going to have to do a reboot. Unfortunately, when they rebooted, the filmmakers (and presumably their backers) panicked, and overcompensated the other way, removing any and all traces of character development, and merely making it a string of action sequences, with a bland throw-in romance that isn't developed past base. The opening sequence is actually surprisingly well-done, but once they begin to chase him, I felt my attention start to wane, and the film never regained the goodwill I felt for it early.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Edward Norton is certainly a step up from Eric Bana, but he's given much of the same bland platitudes, without much of the overabundance of whining that Bana had to slog through, so really, although Bana's effect on me was certainly negative, it's more to speak of than Norton's effect on me, which was almost wholly negligible, because a good actor can only be a good actor if you actually give him worthwhile material, and it's just not here. Liv Tyler is just as much a useless wet blanket as Jennifer Connelly was half a decade ago, but Jennifer Connelly was far more attractive, so I guess that's a downgrade? Speaking of downgrades, the one person that really was fully-formed, refreshingly realistic and well-acted in 'Hulk' was Sam Elliott as General Ross. It was really neat to see him play someone who wasn't just the usual Military Man who is just constantly yelling to shoot clip after clip after clip into the hero, and it was too bad to see him get stuck in such a lame flick. Well, William Hurt takes over the role here, and sadly, he has been turned into exactly the sort of ineffectual, gung-ho, bullet-abuser that it was refreshing to see Elliott go away from, and he also fades without any impact. In supporting roles, Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson are solid in smaller roles, but other than a few choice lines here and there, aren't really given anything to really unleash a character from.<br/><br/>The film's action climax and its extra final scene tie it inseparably with this spring's 'Iron Man', another film that was critically and commercially acclaimed, and underwhelmed me with its laziness and mediocrity. 'Iron Man', though, at least had a charismatic centerpiece character, and although I grew completely tired of his shtick by the end of that film, it was still a positive point to hang its hat on. This film has no such centerpiece, despite the presence of a better actor, and suffers for it.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that that film had the same sort of 'gathering and joining up' final scene means without question that these are all leading up to a movie sometime in the future which may very well be the biggest comic book movie ever made. I can only hope that by then, they took the time to craft realistic, thought-out characters, an original storyline, and yet, still realize that at the end of the day, we'd all like, not just explosions, not just exposition, but a balanced diet of depth AND destruction, and when that happens, you'll have your comic book masterpiece, something that 'The Incredible Hulk' surely ain't.<br/><br/>{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #45 (of 79) of 2008}"

","I just saw the Incredible Hulk yesterday and I was more then pleased. Not to hate on Ang Lee's version but it just wasn't as good in a lot of aspects. The CGI was waaaay better and the fight scenes were nasty. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was mad good, Tim Roth was also really good playing the villain, and William Hurt did a good job playing the general. When Bruce's blood drips onto sterns I'm not sure what happens he starts to mutate, hes prolly going to be a villain in future films.I like how marvel is incorporating their movies together like with the tony stark cameo and the nick fury one in iron man, i didn't see the captain America clue which i was a little disappointed about. SO overall did they reboot the franchise I think without a doubt yes."
"imdb-20924","6","1","6","14 June 2008"," Good Overall, Still Too Much CGI, and VERY LOUD
","First, I went to this movie to see the Tony Stark cameo.<br/><br/>Second, this movie is much better than the first one, but that's not hard to do since the first one was so bad.<br/><br/>Third, this movie tries too hard. It's a bit sappy love story, and a bit action film. It largely succeeds in the action film department, but the love story bit is forced.<br/><br/>Fourth it is LOUD. My ears are still ringing after fifteen hours. I don't know whether it was my particular theatre (I don't think so) or whether it was the movie itself, but when my seat was literally shaking and the movie was still too loud with my fingers in my ears, that's a problem. It largely detracted from the experience. (Yes, I may be too old, but at 33 I don't think so!)<br/><br/>Fifth, it's a good movie. It's not great, mind you - it's exactly what you'd expect from a summer action-flick. It's a little over the top with the action and the CGI, but it is a comic book movie, and that level provides for the comic book feel, which is a credit to the filmmakers. It's got the tag-lines that The Hulk is famous for, and a cool cameo that isn't Stan Lee or Robert Downey Jr."

","I've seen my fair share of bad movies and big letdowns and this one is definitely not it. Despite their lower-than-ironman budget, they delivered and did a better job than Ironman. Unlike Ironman, it had a longer fighting scene and was not anti-climatic. <br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how a casual viewer would find this movie but as a fan, i gave it plenty of 'nods of approval'. They did change the story abit here and there, but i personally feel that the changes are for the better, and certainly better than Stan Lee's version.<br/><br/>Also, if you're a big fan of Bruce Jones work on The Incredible Hulk comics, you'd love this. It's almost identical in atmosphere and style; which makes sense since the director studied Bruce Jones' work prior to making this movie.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies, although there was some romance, it didn't ruin the movie at all (unlike the love triangle in X-men). Instead, this movie brought out great depth of character for both Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Even the Hulk himself...<br/><br/>The only possible flaw would be at the climax, where it didn't last as long as desired. The other flaw (only the fans would understand this) is that hulk's anger level seems to be at a 8/10. His 'sanity barrier' did not break, which was such a waste..<br/><br/>Overall, i gave this movie a 9 out of 10. If the climax was fixed, it would easily be a legendary 9.5, up there with the Godfather.<br/><br/>Enjoy Hulk fans!"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","11","26 January 2012"," A very solid movie, and much better than the 2003 film
","There may be those who agree with me, and those also who will disagree, but while it is not devoid of flaws I really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk, whereas I was disappointed in 2003's The Hulk, and I'm saying this as someone who loved Ang Lee's other films.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that Lee's film succeeds better in, it is the visuals, don't get me wrong they are very stylish here but the ones in the 2003 film were slicker even if The Incredible Hulk is bigger and brasher. This said, the cinematography and editing are great and the locations and lighting look fantastic. The music rouses, the story compels most of the time and the dialogue provokes both in a thoughtful and emotional way.<br/><br/>I do think that director Louis Letterier brings a lot of passion into the film, especially with the use of the form of street running called Parkour that he also used in The Transporter. The action sequences are suitably thumping, with efficient choreography and slick editing. The romantic elements are handled in a shrewd manner in alternative to the danger of slowing the film down, and thankfully there is no underdeveloped and convoluted subplot like Lee's film did with Nick Nolte.<br/><br/>The first half though in a sense is better than the second. The second half is in no way bad, it's that the first half was very clever and compelling, and although you do identify with the titular character all the time and the finale is earth-shattering the film loses it a bit with the rather clichÃ©d way the villain Blonsky is written and that his motives are not always very clear or as believable as they had potential to be.<br/><br/>Casting-wise The Incredible Hulk is excellent. Edward Norton brims with intensity but he is also sympathetic. The Incredible Hulk also succeeds in making a real sense that Banner and the Hulk inhabit the same tortured mind, which made it much more accessible to identify with him, something that Lee's film did not do. William Hurt is appropriately steely as General Ross, Liv Tyler is attractive and the essence of sympathy as Banner's girlfriend and although his character is not as believable Tim Roth does somehow manage to bring some credibility to him.<br/><br/>Overall, a very solid film, not perfect but better than the 2003 film by quite some distance. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","This film seems to me to be a sequel to the film made in 2003 around the same character. However, apart from the characters, I was unable to discern any obvious connection between the two films. It is, for me, quite clear that, to be a sequel, it was made by others than the original actors and crew. When this happens, in general, the feeling of unity and continuity ceases to exist. And so it was.<br/><br/>In this film, Bruce Banner is a man on a mission: while remaining hidden from the American authorities, he tries as much as he can to find a cure or remedy for the genetic mutation he has and that leads him to transform. Interestingly, he is in Brazil, with no explanation as to why he is living in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, where a foreigner draws attention like an elephant in a china shop. Perhaps the director, Louis Leterrier, does not have a clear understanding of what these areas are like and how Brazil works. But we will continue ... and we will watch several attempts by the American army to capture Banner, which almost always end up in the same way: a lot of things destroyed and Hulk giving a brutal beating to the G.I.Â´s. The ending turns out to be easy to predict from the middle of the film.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is an extraordinary actor but he never seemed cut out for me to play this character, and I think he will have realized that himself later. Despite his talent, he never goes beyond average. William Hurt also looked very bad, in a cardboard villain that never proves to be credible or more than a walking clichÃ©. Tim Roth was a casting error starting with the fact that he was not even American, or was able to disguise his accent. Liv Tyler was cold and unable to maintain good chemistry with Norton.<br/><br/>Technically, the film has qualities. Taking advantage of the large budget available to him, he uses and abuses CGI, special effects and sound, action scenes loaded with broken things and beating. Like the first film, the strong feature of this film is the pure and hard action, without any consistent plot. The result of this is a forgettable film, weak enough to not even be an option when we just want to spend some idle time."

","So, this is the  child of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, huh? I cannot say that I'm terribly surprised.<br/><br/>This movie was a slog. It was a series of miscalculations, unsupported emotional moments, and poorly framed action, all while being arranged without anything really resembling dramatic structure. Let's take an early scene that works as a wonderful microcosm of the film's overall issues.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil for some time. Through a series of very quick shots in the opening credits, we get the very basics of the story that Banner is the Hulk, he went nuts, nearly killed his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's father (General Ross) is a military man who almost died defending her life. Banner gets found out and tracked down by General Ross in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>The way the scene plays out is that Bruce is alone in his little living space when he feels the presence of some soldiers just outside. He manages to escape down the side of the building and begins to run. As he twists and turns through the byzantine streets with the soldiers in hot pursuit, he accidentally runs into some guy he had a brief and unpleasant interaction with earlier. That guy brings his buddies along to then chase Banner. They end up at the factory that Banner works at where he finally becomes the Hulk, and fights off the locals and then the soldiers.<br/><br/>What's wrong with that scene? The stakes of the action seesaw back and forth from Banner being pursued by trained killers to him being chased by some local thugs to Hulk taking out the thugs and then the soldiers. It's in the wrong order. ""This is how the movie is upping the stakes?"" With just the slightest bit of consideration, that whole sequence should have been rearranged so that it begins with the local thugs, escalates to the soldiers, and then the Hulk comes out. As it is, it's confusing at best but mostly just frustrating.<br/><br/>One of the things about franchise films is that they develop a certain shorthand about characters that allow for audiences to follow without requiring a lot of catchup from the previous movie. The problem with that approach regarding the characters in The Incredible Hulk is that this isn't a sequel. There had been Hulk by Ang Lee a few years before, but this is obviously not a follow up to that (aside from the character names, there's nothing that carries from the previous film to this one). So, when Betty Ross has a big emotional moment as she sees Bruce for the first time in years, it falls extremely flat. Yes, this is the man who was her boyfriend a few years ago, but aside from some very brief shots of her in the opening credits, we've never seen the two characters together before. We don't have a good feeling about their relationship, so as Betty immediately walks away from the man that's supposedly her current flame at the drop of a hat that audience isn't along with that decision. They don't understand the emotional particulars that would lead this specific woman to make this specific choice. It feels random instead of touching.<br/><br/>That interaction happens when Banner begs his way up through Brazil and Central America into Virginia (in 17 whole days) and he heads for Culver University where Betty works. He shows up to find the data she should have stored in order to help him find a cure. They meet, she gives him the data in a flash drive, and then the military shows up again. We then get one of the most incomprehensible action scenes I've seen in modern movies. For being an action director Louis Leterrier is surprisingly bad at directing action. The basic geography of where people are never really gets established and it seems to change from shot to shot. Humvees appear out of nowhere, the Hulk moves all around the open field without any real explanation. Yeah, there are some cool shots here and there, but they're unmoored from anything relatable or intelligible.<br/><br/>There are antagonists as well. The first is General Ross, but he's caught somewhere between a bad guy and a good guy. His stated objectives of wanting to essentially dissect Banner are bad, but the movie obviously doesn't want the audience to consider him that bad. His objectives get brushed under the rug and largely forgotten about because of the second antagonist, Emil Bronsky. Bronsky is a military man (with an unnecessarily complicated backstory that seems designed to justify the last name and Tim Roth's cockney accent). His pride gets wounded by the fact that a giant monster beat him in a fight, and he must take it out. Ross gives him some sort of super serum that turns him into a super soldier, and then he later gets...something else that turns him into another Hulk-like monster called Abomination. Then we get a giant CGI fight between two CGI monsters that is as uncompelling as Betty Ross's entire storyline.<br/><br/>This film is poorly made, terribly written, and a bit of a complete disaster. The MCU really didn't start very well, did it?"

For this status a lot of people doesn't know its existence or consider it bad before watching. Instead it is a decent film, likeable, with action and a bit of fun. The real and only criticism against this movie is his regularity. Every aspect of it is simply regular, exactly what you are expecting by this type of films. There's no surprising aspects nor disappointing ones and everything is predictable. Also the last battle follows this rules: it is entertaining and visually good, but it isn't something different from a classical blockbuster movie. It's important to underline that regularity it isn't only a flaw but also a quality.

","This film is the second one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after ""Iron Man"". It's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually quite a lot of fun, that is if you ignore its many flaws.<br/><br/>The producers of this film decided not to completely film The Hulk's origin story here, except through the opening credits, a decision they would repeat 10 years later on Spiderman: Homecoming. At the time it was probably seen as a wise decision, since a previous standalone version, Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" came out 5 years before and was already on the minds of comic book fans. However in hindsight, I feel this lessens the impact of the character in the minds of fans.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is in it, and he's excellent. However he was a poor choice of casting by Marvel, because he's a difficult to work with. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was going to be his only Marvel movie at the time. His reputation was already known.<br/><br/>In many ways I prefer this Norton's version to Ruffalo's. This is a real movie, and Hulk is a true character, rather than the comic relief he serves as in later MCU films. He has a love interest in Betty Ross, who is played excellently by Liv Tyler. William Hurt is also perfectly cast as General Ross, and outdoes Sam Elliot, who appeared in Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which is no mean feat."

","Norton is fine in this. He plays the role of Banner quite well. Both he and Liv Tyler come out of this review largely unscathed. Tim Roth is over rated as ever. His character is just silly and his fate just as silly.<br/><br/>The worst IMO is the General, Hurt is awful. His fake hair and moustache, his make up is as bad as the Hulk CGI (which given the age of this film is almost, almost understandable).<br/><br/>There were so many things in this film that made no sense:<br/><br/>1. Why was a UK officer (stated to be from the Royal Marines - which are not special forces at all but really just a light infantry unit) wearing a US Army uniform along with a chest full of US ribbons?<br/><br/>2. Cuts on the Hulk after the fight at the uni - you can see them on his shoulders - inconsistent with the rest of the MCU where such things don't happen even when he's dragged down a building or hit numerous times by Iron Man's Hulk smashing suit.<br/><br/>3. Guatemala - erm, so how close is that to Brazil?<br/><br/>4. The Apache Gunship crashes in Hulk and Liv Tyler, surrounding them in an inferno of jet fuel. Hulk stands up holding her in the midst of what must be 1000 degree flames and stares - by which time she'd be barbecued.<br/><br/>5. Blomsky - he has an incredibly weedy body, yet he seems to have abilities far beyond that body. I just didn't take to him at all as a credible opponent to the Hulk, let's be honest, Hulk would just pull him in half effortlessly, Blonsky as the adversary is patently ridiculous.<br/><br/>There were more issues i spotted in the movie, but back to the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is a movie that is best forgotten in the MCU. It's doesn't really contribute or fit in. Hulk/Banner as played by Ruffalo is great. I don't think a stand alone Hulk film works at all. The character (Hulk) simply does not have the finesse to be a hero in a movie taking on baddies. He's too reckless, smashing everything, so is better suited as a side kick within the context of the broader avenger movies."
"ssquatche","5","0","2","24 April 2019"," An enjoyable watch, but there are too many inconsistencies
","In preparation for Avengers: Endgame, I watched The Incredible Hulk. Due to the fact that I've heard and read an unbelievable amount of hate towards this film (and I had been putting off watching this movie for a long time), I was pleasantly surprised. It is certainly the black sheep of the MCU.<br/><br/>The Good:
The story was certainly interesting and gauged my interest.
I also really like the opening sequence of the film. The theme used during this was astoundingly spine-chilling, which instantly set up a dark mood compared to other MCU entries. The lighting only furthered the sombre atmosphere.
I really liked Edward Norton's troubled portrayal of Bruce Banner; it was a shame that he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo (although I thoroughly enjoy Mark's portrayal of Bruce and the Hulk.
William Hurt shines in every scene as General Ross.
I quite like the subtle details of the relationship between Betty and Bruce.
The action sequence in the second act was outstanding.
The post-credits scene is a marvel. Watch it.<br/><br/>The Bad:
The amount of inconsistencies throughout this film was very, very distracting to me. A gigantic example of this is when Bruce Banner somehow makes it from Rio de Janeiro to Guatemala in one single day. I used Google Maps to measure the distance: it came to over 6500 kilometres. The Hulk changed back into Banner somewhere along the way, but Banner could not have trekked through the Amazon and through the DariÃ©n Gap in one day, even as the Hulk. Another inconsistency is when Banner goes to a woman to buy some trousers, she speaks Portuguese instead of Spanish. There are many more littered among the story. It seems as if the story just goes to where it needs to go, without actually logically thinking about how and why?
Due to the aforementioned point, the pacing was very erratic, which distracted me from what was actually happening.
Some character motivations and decisions were questionable. Bruce is very aware of what his blood can do if it is exposed, but he sends a blood sample to 'Mr. Blue' from Rio all the way to NYC in a parcel, which will be tossed around and abused during its transit, which could put so many people handling the package at risk.
Emil Blonsky was a terrible villain. Abomination was terrible. The fight scene in the third act was not thrilling at all. He should have killed him, as it would be something that the Hulk would do, fuelled by rage as he nearly killed his love.
They should have killed Betty off during that scene, as it would give Hulk even more motivation to kill Abomination. (I sincerely doubt that Betty will return in Endgame, so this would have been perfect).<br/><br/>Overall Verdict:
I didn't respond to this film in the way that Betty does when she gets out of the taxi driven by the crazy, road-rage guy. I wouldn't say it's essential to watch in order to understand the MCU (as the first Avengers movie successfully re-introduces you to Hulk), but if you have some time and you want to watch a movie that doesn't require your full attention, this suits the situation.
Therefore, I have given this a 5/10 star rating, as it has some major flaws
which drew me away from the film. However, there were some positive aspects, which saved it from going down in my books as a disaster."

Even in these rewatchings, I watched them chronologically, which just heightened the disparity. I'm disappointed to give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10.

This is my third time watching the movie the two times i watched it i liked it but the third time i didn't.<br/><br/>CHARACTER
Bruce Banner is pretty bland.
He is not realy bad but he is just a boring character with a weak character arc.
Betty is bad she is terrible.
The actor just whispers through her lines and is just there to be Bruce's love interest.
They did something interesting were Betty has a boyfriend and it added conflict to the story, they even presented it good they showed her relationship by using visual story telling which is great.
But then they ruined it by Betty seeing Bruce and Bruce deciding to hide from Betty for some stupid reason, then Betty finding Bruce and they just become a couple.
They ignored the conflict they added and they just made this excuse that the boyfriend is really nice.<br/><br/>RELATIONSHIP
Their relationship is bad.
There is never conflict when it comes to their relationship and they don't even communicate well.
You just don't believe that they have been a couple for awhile cause it looks like they become awkward when they are together.<br/><br/>FINAL ACT
The final act was the worst part of this movie.
They just ignored what they have set-up for over an hour to end the movie.
Blonsky (the terrible underdeveloped villain) want's the stuff to defeat Hulk, he becomes crazy and want's to kill everyone for some reason, and then the military and Bruce just team up to defeat him even though they have hunted Bruce for more than two years.
And the fight was horrible it looked like a Ps2 game and when i say it looks like a Ps2 game i really really mean it.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie does not really fit in with the MCU.

","The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Marvel Cinematic Universe #2
Director: Louis Leterrier<br/><br/>Right, after my fantastic time the other night rewatching the exceptional Iron Man, I have to say without any build up that this was a very dull, if not entirely disappointing, first time watch.<br/><br/>I get it. Ed Norton is the last person you'd expect to have a superpower. This should make his character relatable but it could also have made him an icon. But it didn't. After an absolutely mesmerising performance from Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, I went into this expecting another really awesome powerhouse performance. What I actually got was a merely decent portrayal of a nice bloke who somehow (in a very rushed opening montage) has become afflicted with gamma ray poisoning that can turn him from looking like a janitor to Jason Momoa's angry uncle in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>Now as for The Hulk himself, he is a force to be reckoned with and thankfully the scenes where (I assume it is still Norton via motion capture) he interacts with the love interest (Liv Tyler in a really subtle and affecting turn as Betty) as The Big Green are touching and oddly affecting in a way that Bruce Banner as himself isn't quite. The action sequences are mostly predictable but I felt they used a King Kong style template to help really get the audience involved (especially in the climactic final battle amongst the big city skyscrapers between two enraged Hulks). The end fight was not a patch on the final battle in Iron Man, but it's not for a want of trying. And the inventiveness during the fight on the college campus was terrific fun (although the flames that engulfed Hulk and Betty appeared to cause no damage to skin, hair or clothing and OF COURSE it rained heavily).<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie, but after kicking off the MCU with a major bang, The Incredible Hulk fails to captivate in the same way. Liv Tyler stole the film for me, and I really wish we could have seen her acting alongside Mark Ruffalo here. It's a great shame to me that she doesn't appear later in the franchise, but it's fine. We end up with enough characters to compensate (and then some!). I won't criticise the special effects too much, only to say that we have come a long way since even 2008 in terms of full CGI rendering of characters in a live action setting. When we finally see The Hulk in all his glory he truly does give off a Roger Rabbit type vibe, of animation bursting into the real world, and it's jarring. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it did on occasion take me out of the moment. But I love Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie, and that too suffered similar issues.<br/><br/>This is not a great movie. It does everything a superhero movie should, and it does so in a rather pedestrian manner. It's fairly likeable, it certainly passes the time, and at the end when for a brief moment we see Tony Stark arrive to make some sort of deal, well, it became positively rousing. And that is my issue here, the best time I had watching this movie was the last minute with Tony Stark. Oh dear. As for the villian...I found him very forgettable. Next.<br/><br/>But I may watch this again. It was good, and coming out the same year as Iron Man leaves me with the impression that the director had little idea what the movie was going to follow. As a standalone movie, it's just fine. As the first sequel in a longstanding, multi-character lead franchise, it is a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>4/10"

"yihdzelonh","4","0","3","24 November 2018"," A mediocre, mindless, dumb -though entertaining- action flic....with spotty CGI
","One of my favorite T.V. shows of all time, is '1970s-'1980s ""The Incredible Hulk"" -starring the very underrated actor, Bill Bixby and his alter-ego........the renowned body-builder Lou Ferrigno.
This T.V. show's 2-hour pilot episode was very, interesting, superbly-well done, and very dramatic: Bixby -otherwise known as 'David Banner'- was involved in a car accident in which he was unable to save his wife from dying (if my 'recall' is correct). In his frustration to his wife's death, Bixby then begins experimenting with small doses of gamma ray doses to see if it will stimulate a natural 'adrenalin reaction' -the type of reaction that he LACKED at the time that he felt he SHOULD HAVE HAD IT when he was unable to save his wife's life.<br/><br/>These controlled experiments eventually go awry....and Bixby in one freak accident of this controlled experiment transforms into the hulk, inadvertedly creating a fire which accidentally kills his colleague who was assisting him. I believe that Bill Bixby was born to play this role as the Hulk, and he plays it superbly; he is extremely likeable, charismatic, and it is very easy to empathize for him. He truly does come across as someone that is genuinely good......who is extremely tortured, always looking for a 'cure' to his dilemma...<br/><br/>Having never read any Marvel Comics of any type throughout my life -which is still currently the case- my knowledge and interpretations of what The Incredible Hulk is 'SUPPOSED' to closely resemble have always been based on the original '70s-80s T.V. series.<br/><br/>About 5 years ago, I 'attempted' to watch fairly new Louis Leterrier-directed ""The Incredible Hulk"" movie -starring Edward Norton. I gave up after only about 10 minutes, as I realized that it was in VERY STARK CONTRADICTION to the T.V. series and my notion of what the Incredible Hulk is supposed to be like.....that is,MUCH, MUCH, MUCH 'DUMBER' and purely action-oriented and grotesquely fake and stupid compared to the T.V. series.<br/><br/>That being said, very recently, I decided to give it one last 'go'.......and I finally just now -as I had nothing better to do- did watch in its entirety the Leterrier-directed ""The Incredible Hulk.""<br/><br/>In recent years, some of the best 'superhero' movies ever.....have been made.....partly as a result of the directors having the knowledge and incentive to fully show the superhero's 'character development' in a very thorough, engrossing, and realistic approach that has never been done in the past: For example, the Christopher Nolan-directed ""Batman Begins"" is easily the best Batman-directed movie ever, in my opinion; Batman's 'beginnings' are fully explained and very believably-developed in this film. To a great degree, this also applies to the movie ""Spiderman"" starring Tobey Maguire and the first ""X-Men"" movie starring Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>In contradistinction, the movie 'The Incredible Hulk' begins very 'unintelligibly' with little or no character development concerning Bruce Banner's beginnings or how he became the Hulk. The movie begins with a drop of his blood accidentally falling into a soda bottle or something similar to that. Somewhat later the military is actively seeking him. He then transforms into the Hulk.<br/><br/>""The Incredible Hulk"" pretty much is a pure mindless action movie which is centered on action sequences; nearly all of which are extremely unrealistic. The actual CGI used to create the Hulk's appearance is appallingly-fake....it is probably the MOST FAKE LOOKING 'humanoid' or 'monster' replication that I have EVER seen in ANY movie, EVER. It is absurdly-faked; grotesquely-fake. It is very possible that the actual APPEARANCE of the Hulk in this film -IS a much more accurate physical rendition of what the Hulk is SUPPOSED to look like than what he does in the T.V. series. It is also possible that in the D.C. Comics, that the Hulk is supposed to be utterly-invincible, unbelievably 'GARGANTUAN' (18 foot tall/several tons?), that he can take any amount of bullets from any type of gun or cannon, can leap DOZENS of feet in the air, and can free-fall 20,000 feet from a helicopter and not even break a bone.<br/><br/>The end result -whether this is an accurate D.C. Comics-replication or not- is a LUDICROUSLY-fake and stupid movie that maybe should have been 'animated' -as it is much more like a bona fida 'CARTOON' than anything that has any remote realism.<br/><br/>All in all, I rate ""The Incredible Hulk"" 4 stars -- because it does succeed, to an extent, as a dumb, pure action movie....."

How the movie does this is through its clever use of exposition in the movie's ingenious opening sequence along with the fugitive storyline that has been at the core of many classic Hulk comic books.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier shoots some gorgeous sequences throughout this film: from the lush evergreens of Brazil to Culver University and onwards, the film always feels open and brings something visually interesting to the screen. The best sequence, however, goes to our first on-screen introduction to the Green Goliath within a bottle factory. Shot like a horror film, Hulk is painted as the monstrous force of nature that he is. I still remember smiling widely throughout that whole sequence the first time I saw it, and it still has that effect on me now.<br/><br/>Where the film falters is sometimes in the CGI, especially in the final act and confrontation between Hulk and the Abomination. Some moments script-wise are also predictable. Where it succeeds is in its sharp wit instead of by a need for slapstick like later MCU flicks.<br/><br/>The cast are all top-notch, with Edward Norton's Banner convincing throughout. Tim Roth's Blonsky/Abomination is a highlight and poses a real threat to Hulk and others, bringing Hulk to his knees on a number of occasions. This is a solid superhero movie."

","After with the surprise blockbuster hit of Iron Man, it was only natural that Marvel would team with Universal to make the next installment of their universe based on a more popular character, the Hulk. But it received mixed reviews at the time, but is it really just okay? <br/><br/>Though this wasn't the first movie based on the character. 2003's Hulk directed by Ang Lee and starring Eric Bana was mostly hated for being boring. So this was a reboot of the franchise, within the MCU. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Edward Nortan makes a great Bruce Banner, and plays the duality of Banner and Hulk well, though not as good as Ruffalo later on. Liv Tyler is perfectly acceptable as Betty Ross. William Hurt is great as Thunderbolt Ross, and you believe in his cause against Banner. Finally Tim Roth does a good job with what he's given, though he's much more entertaining as a person then he is as the Abomination. Sterns and the RDJ cameo are also highlights. <br/><br/>The script is decent, it captures all the main ideas that you want in a Hulk movie. Banner on the run from military, the duality of the characters, Hulk smashes things, it's great. But it suffers the ""villain who suddenly goes crazy"" syndrome. Though, it does have a rushed explanation, with the super soldier serum driving him nuts. <br/><br/>The visual effects are okay. It's always fun to watch Hulk smash tanks and other gamma monsters. I don't love the design of the Hulk, the main reason is that he doesn't look like Edward Norton, and the Hulk should look like Banner. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I like the Incredible Hulk, but it's not one of the best MCU movies. It's entertaining, and the cast is great, but the writing and effects could be a lot better. <br/><br/>7/10"

It's not really a bad film, it's just a bit dull - the moves are predictable, the characters aren't engaging, and it doesn't leave any kind of impression beyond 'I guess that was ok.'

There's not much character or emotion in the film, but seeing this movie's reputation over the years, that's kind of how it should be.<br/><br/>Not everything about this movie was entirely mixed, some aspects were good, while some aspect were bad. It's as OK as Marvel gets, I don't really expect anyone to remember this film, but if you want to have something playing on the background when you're busy doing something else, it's probably the best way to watch this film. Watching this with your undivided attention, however, results in some pretty boring experiences. I don't have any strong opinions about this film. It's one of the most OK films I've ever seen. It's decent, but it should be awesome! How did they blow it?<br/><br/>So, yeah. It's not a terrible film, just a film with a lot of potential that could have been really good that took the least interesting directions. When it wants to be action-packed, it can be. It's alright for movie standards, but I expect much more out of such an exciting concept that this film ended up being a disappointment.

","After Director Ang Lee's (Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) artsy-fartsy take on The Hulk tanked at the box office a few years ago, things looked dire for the big green dude. So what was in order? Recast the franchise, get a new director, and basically pretend the first one never happened. This is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, and it's a credit to the filmmakers that I very much enjoyed this film, given that I have no history of giving a crap about the Hulk or his tendency to smash things. I've always looked on the character with mild disdain, writing him off as a Jekyll & Hyde-type on steroids. But this Hulk kept me entertained from start to finish.<br/><br/>Credit must be given to Edward Norton, whose Bruce Banner is a lonely, tortured soul who struggles to keep the rageful beast within him at bay. Norton makes a sympathetic lead, and he does some fine character work here. Nothing amazing, ala Christian Bale or Robert Downey Jr., but solid nonetheless. Liv Tyler does just fine (though there's sure to be some inexplicable hatred for her by the public there always is for the love interest in superhero movies! I don't get it. I liked Katie Holmes, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Bosworth just fine). William Hurt, Tim Roththe entire cast turns in good performances. The cinematography is excellent (some stuff in Brazil is particularly eye-catching). The pacing is great, and while there is some down-time between Hulk moments, the film doesn't lag. This is a much more somber movie than the crowd-pleasing Iron Man, but the handful of attempts at humor hit the mark just fine.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film gives you a good dose of Hulk smashing things real good. The CGI on the Hulk is far better than the trailers made me think it'd be (with a few exceptions). The action in this movie is fantastic, visceral, hard-hitting stuff. You truly feel the physical power of the character, and a couple moments startle you with their raw power. The final battle in particular is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the exploration of the villain's motives (villains who think they're doing the right thing are always more interesting), as well as Bruce's desire to control his demons. Good people have a dark side, and bad people often have some virtue left in them, and this movie explores that idea to good effect.<br/><br/>Flaws? Well, being a comic-book movie, you have to suspend disbelief (even within the rules of its own universe) about what's possible or even plausible. Some plot-holes arise (although some are later explained, in the moment I was thinking ""wait, what?""). One side character's actions seem like a bit of a stretch. But mostly, any qualms I have stem from the fact that I've been spoiled by excellent superhero movies, like Iron Man and Batman Begins. This is not an excellent superhero movie. It is, however, a very good superhero movie that has some truly rockin' action, solid character work, and good acting. It's more than worth catching in the theatres. (Rated PG-13 for action violence, mild language, and a brief foreplay scene that goes nowhere). ***1/2 (out of five)."
"generationofswine","7","0","1","16 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","It's darker than the Hulk and that works well. Darker as in literally darker, darker as in it is dark enough to hide a lot of the CGI that made The Hulk look fake and boring in the action.<br/><br/>It also has a better cast. Anyone that has seen The Avengers is going to prefer Mark Ruffalo, because he nailed the part, but Edward Norton is leagues better than Eric Bana. So now you have a Bruce Banner that can actually add depth to the role, something that was seriously lacking in The Hulk.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler as well is a breath of fresh air given that Jennifer Connolly seemingly needs the tightest of scrips to actually emote and Tyler can act even in the worst of films. For her playing a believable Betty was a lot better than Connolly's cardboard cut out.<br/><br/>The approach was refreshing for a comic book movie. We've seen the Wayne's get killed over and over again, we've seen Uncle Ben die too often for his own good. We've seen the introductory stories told so often we can repeat them with our eyes closed.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk assumes that we already know how things came to be and doesn't spend a life time retelling the same old story. It starts off assuming that the foundations are well in place in the minds of the audience and that allows the movie to come in on its own.<br/><br/>We have more movie than rehash in the Incredible Hulk and that too adds to its charm.<br/><br/>Still, you are ultimately going to get a lot of mindless carnage and that can be a bit...dull after a while.<br/><br/>On the whole though, The Incredible Hulk succeeds where the Hulk failed."

","This movie was intended to be a reboot, but it comes across feeling like a direct to video sequel in terms of the story. The action luckily was a bit better. <br/><br/>The story begins with Hulk where he ended up at the end of Hulk even though this is supposed to be a new story and a different hulk. This time around though the story is lighter but still not as light heart-ed as it could be. The story follows Bruce looking for a cure to his anger management with the help of a scientist he met online while his old enemy General Thadeus Ross continues his efforts to get him by recruiting a new soldier who he has enhanced to make him better equipped to take down the hulk. The movie covers what happens if the hulk were to temporarily lose his powers and if an enemy were introduced who could match hulk (Abomination). The story was watchable without getting too weird making it easier to watch then the other Hulk movie but it still wasn't as much fun as Iron Man. That said it was watchable even if not as memorable as Iron Man. It works as its own movie but it's really more a background noise or popcorn flick. I wouldn't say it was an improvement over Hulk.. just a different kind of movie."

","This sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 HULK revamp is brought to us by Louis Leterrier, the man responsible for the highly ludicrous (but entertaining) TRANSPORTER 2. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is equally ludicrous but not quite as entertaining, although it does all right for what it is: a simple, shallow, effects-driven adventure aimed at bringing the comic-book storyline into the 21st century. It's certainly a lot more fun than the deadly dull Ang Lee attempt, a hodge podge of plot lines and events seemingly cobbled together from various different movies.<br/><br/>The first third involves Edward Norton (replacing Eric Bana as Bruce Banner) hiding out in South America, pursued by government agents in various foot chase scenes reminiscent of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (although nowhere near as good). The second third moves back to the USA for some schmaltzy love stuff involving the terribly insipid Liv Tyler, whose presence screams of miscasting. The final third goes for all-out action as two super-beasts pummel each other into submission in the streets of a bustling city.<br/><br/>I'm not a great fan of superhero movies but THE INCREDIBLE HULK passes the time readily enough. Edward Norton is a better actor than the film warrants, and he kept me watching despite my reservations. I thought there were too many scenes involving his green alter ego, and the CGI varies between impressive and quite crude. A lengthy bit with the creature and Tyler in a rain-bound cave smacks of KING KONG without any of the pathos.<br/><br/>Tim Roth is on hand playing the movie's villain, and he's pretty good, filling his character with unmentioned depravity despite the sometimes lacklustre script. William Hurt is Liv Tyler's dad, and doesn't have much to go with. There are various scenery-smashing interludes involving the big green guy, but they go over the top with the CGI and are quite boring compared to the moments with the human actors. The ending is similar to IRON MAN in that it involves two CGI creations beating each other up, but manages to be a little bit more involved than that catastrophe."
"barbagvido","7","0","1","27 June 2016"," So different from other movies in MCU that it almost seems non-canon
","Iron Man was a great start of Marvel Cinematic Universe that gets you excited to see more. The second outing is The Incredible Hulk which stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner a.k.a. The Hulk. Hulk appears in some other movies in MCU, but he's never played by Edward Norton again and is replaced by Mark Ruffalo, and also Hulk never looks the way he does in this movie again and all that makes it seem like Marvel decided to ignore this movie. Which is strange, because this movie is actually pretty decent.<br/><br/>It's not as good as most of the MCU movies that are out by now, but what I liked about it is that they actually tried something different and this is probably the only movie in MCU's Phase One that actually took itself completely seriously. Who says it always has to be cheesy with jokes in the middle of the battle? Characters are fleshed out pretty well and Norton's portrayal of Hulk shows us what being Hulk really is like. It's not cool, it's not awesome. In fact, it's terrible. He doesn't want to be this way and I think it's very well shown. The Hulk also looks very menacing and scary and the villain, Abomination, even more. But still, no matter how much mayhem he causes sometimes, he's just misunderstood and I heard Norton was involved in some creative process, so that was probably him. The problem with this movie is that the story itself isn't memorable enough. At least for me. They had a good idea, showing how Bruce Banner struggles with Hulk, but they could still do more with all that. The effects also don't look as believable as they should and considering how big the budget was, it's not really a good thing. But one more good thing is that it's not setting up anything except in the last scene so it's not distracting and this movie can be easily seen as a stand- alone.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't bad. It tried to have a more serious approach and that made me appreciate it a lot. The problem is that it's just not that memorable and that's the reason while it's almost the weakest movie in MCU."

","I actually missed this one when it hit the cinemas, probably because I wasn't really all that interested in superhero movies at the time. Well, come to think of it the only reason that I watch superhero movies these days is because they are entertaining, and the Marvel Cinematic movies have actually been quite good, even if it is just for a couple of hours of mindless entertainment. However, since I have decided to rewatch them again, if only to familiarise myself with the back story, I decided to include the Incredible Hulk among them.<br/><br/>From what I gather this is a reboot, though it actually begins in Brazil after Bruce Banner become the Hulk, suggesting that the events from the Ang Lee film occurred, just not how they happened in that film (for instance it is indicated that a lot less people where killed when Bruce Banner escaped than what happened in the Ang Lee film, which involved the Hulk smashing up a huge number of tanks). Anyway, the film starts off in Brazil where Banner is living an anonymous life working in a factory and learning to control his anger so that he doesn't turn into the Hulk and end up smashing everything up. However, things sort of go sour when a drop of his blood lands in a bottle of juice that makes its way to America and ends up getting drunk by Stan Lee. This alerts the US army, and they make their way to Brazil to try and capture him.<br/><br/>It's probably a good thing that Marvel didn't make another origin film with the Hulk, but rather began the film with a couple of flash backs to his origin. It sort of provides a bit of continuity, and doesn't go over old ground, something that I quite like. It also allows the creators to move into a new story without having to rehash an origin again. This is the case with this film, where we have Bruce, the super soldier, and Emil Bronsky, the special forces operative that is given the opportunity to regain some of the stamina, and agility, of his youth. However, as they suggest, power corrupts, and once he has a taste of this power he wants more. This inevitability results in him becoming a monster – thus cue the villain the Abomination.<br/><br/>However this sort of runs along the theme that appeared in Iron Man where the army is trying to get its hands on weapons to give them an edge in war, however these weapons are being developed in their own labs. Yet there are big differences between the films, as here we have the military developing these weapons, what are in effect genetic mutations, that inevitably turn against them. Whereas Iron Man has a weapons company playing both sides up against each other, and profiting from it, Hulk has the military developing the weapon, and then losing control of it. Actually, we see two super soldiers here, though Bruce is a scientist, not a soldier, which means that he runs from the military so that he isn't used as a weapon, whereas Bronsky embraces his new power, and inevitably becomes the enemy – the weapon that the military created turns on them, and they quickly discover that now that it is out of their control, they have no way of stopping it.<br/><br/>In fact this wasn't a bad film at all, and certainly doesn't deserve the bad ratings that it received. I was actually quite surprised that I really enjoyed it, moreso because I probably didn't know what to expect as opposed to expecting it to be either really good, or really bad. It probably had more to do with me not really being bothered watching it that it took me so long to get around to seeing, but I'm glad that I did."

"Tyson14","8","0","1","7 May 2016"," Marvel's most underrated movie
","with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterisation as its predecessor ""Iron Man"" but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.<br/><br/>Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.<br/><br/>Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"". Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in ""Iron Man"" and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very enjoyable films which film rollicks along at a great pace and does not take itself too seriously."

His secret - every time he gets angry, he transforms into a giant, green monster he has nicknamed the ""hulk."" Once the government catches up with him, he faces a mercenary that fears nothing, not even the incredible hulk.<br/><br/>To jump right in, this movie isn't great. It's not even particularly good. However, it isn't bad. This movie is not bad in any means, but it's extremely boring. It's hard to sit through the two hour run time of this film, and believe me, I just did it. The Hulk shows up only four times throughout the entire movie, and one of them isn't even a fight scene. Some films can have little to no action, and still be really good, but this movie is about the incredible hulk, so it should have quite a bit more action.<br/><br/>The directing is fine, and so is the acting. Ed Norton definitely doesn't do his best in this movie, although he doesn't do necessarily bad. Liv Tyler doesn't do great either, and neither does Tim Roth. The only performance that actually seemed fairly good was that of William Hurt as general Thunderbolt Ross. He's returning in Captain America: Civil War (2016), which I'm somewhat happy about.<br/><br/>The absolute worst thing about this movie is the CGI. The special effects throughout the film, especially during the final fight scene between the Hulk and the Abomination. Most of the CG is plain horrendous. Every time the Hulk shows up, the viewer is completely taken out of the movie. This is also true for the Abomination. Every time he shows up on screen, the film looks fake, and pulls the audience out.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll mention is the rewatchability, because I've covered everything else so far. Like mentioned above, the film is very boring, and has about 20% rewatchability. There is rarely any time that I will just want to pop in The Incredible Hulk for a fun time. Maybe, if I'm in the mood to have a somewhat of a destructive movie on while doing something else, I might put this on. However, other than that specific situation, I won't be putting this movie on too much.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk is a decent movie, with okay acting and all right direction. The film is littered with bad CGI, and some indecent plot structure. The Incredible Hulk deserves a B-, or a 7 out of 10."

","Finally, this is similar to what I call ""The Batman Solution."" Some people dislike this movie's lack of a superhero movie feeling, or for better analogy the feeling of a ""Classic Hulk Movie,"" but that's really not what the Hulk's first outing should be about. It should have the same thematic journey as the comics, which of course this movie had as the comic makers made it this time. It's the same problem with Batman, they've never gotten his character right with the same flawless thematic formation as the comic version, instead creating their own version that's almost in name, action, and task only but essentially not Batman. The Hulk movies and shows ALL had this same problem, their version being Bruce is smart and Hulk is dumb and end of story, when it really is not that black and white and fundamentally not the Hulk. This movie finally got it right, and I think it will be better remembered in retrospect just because people aren't used to a Hulk movie that has as deep an insight into both the characters of the Hulk and Banner as this movie and were busy looking for an action movie, which the Hulk's first outing should not be and thankfully wasn't.<br/><br/>It starts out with Banner and the Hulk as rival forces, co-existing, Banner actually contradicting the superhero movie aesthetic and going on a journey to rid himself of his powers, not stop a villain. This chronicle perfectly mirrors the first Hulk arc ever in the comics, and it is essential to defining the chemistry between the Hulk and Banner. Banner hates the Hulk because he does not recognize he is the offspring of him and is his reflection so he only sees potential for destruction and hate and thus wants to kill this new life-form. The Hulk, although simple minded he's not stupid, hates Banner because he can only be angry and never happy or else Banner locks him up in his cage of Banner's inner mind again, never to be happy or safe when he's free, and also hating the fact Banner wants to kill him. Subtly, without realizing it, the audience roots for the Hulk because of this, feeling bad for him. But when we see in the final scenes that Bruce recognizes the Hulk can be used for good and thus form an uneasy respect for each other, their chemistry is taken to a new level of respect. Bruce can now control the Hulk for good, and thus in any future Hulk movies the Hulk can now go battle evil because Banner has a reason to do so, trusting the creature. This chemistry is incredible, and shouldn't be lost in a proper Hulk film."

","Thor. Iron Man. The Avengers. It's pretty impressive how the Marvel Studios can make one memorable hit film after the next. And then you had the Incredible Hulk. Somewhere. Seeing as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America seem to have pushed themselves to the forefront of the Marvel Universe, sometimes it's easy to forget that there was also a film dedicated to the big green grumpy fella! Or maybe that's because there were actually TWO movies, but we won't really touch on that.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk movie was actually a remake of a similar Marvel movie only a few years before. However, it totally bombed at the Box Office and was therefore quickly forgotten as soon as possible, especially when the Hulk was to be drafted into the same on screen universe as Iron Man and co. It's not a bad film, it just has problems. One of which is the lack of originality. It's basically Iron Man (1), only with different characters. The story is pretty much identical, only with a green star instead of a guy in a metal suit.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this is more of a downside that's applicable after the film was made, the Hulk's human alter-ego played by Edward Norton, decided to leave the franchise. Therefore, all Hulk-related scenes in everything from the Avengers onwards was taken over by Mark Ruffalo. I think the studio was hoping that the Hulk would become more of a franchise in its own right, as there are plenty of little plot points in the film which aren't resolved, clearly so that they can be addressed in later instalments. I guess only time will tell if these will ever see the light of day, or whether the Avengers will take over and the Hulk will just be a background character in the overall story.<br/><br/>However, that was to come. Judging the film on its own and it's not that bad. It has some pretty impressive action scenes which are fun to watch, but it's main plus point is Tim Roth. Yes, he's the man tasked with bringing down the Hulk at any costs, but I was on his side. He pretty much saved the film for me. The Hulk (when big, green and generally smashing things) was fun, however Edward Norton (despite being a great actor) just didn't really have much to work with. Therefore it was up to Roth to steal every scene.<br/><br/>I know the Hulk is based on a comic book and the monster itself did (still) look pretty computer-generated, which was a bit disappointing as it looked only slightly better than its forgotten predecessor 'Hulk.' The Incredible Hulk doesn't really feel that bigger part of the overall 'Marvel shared universe,' but it is a fun enough little jaunt that is worth a watch just for Tim Roth's performance."
"rjsf96","6","0","1","28 September 2015"," A Wholly Unnecessary Reboot
","Whilst 'Hulk' focused on character relationships, Louis Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' puts the action upfront, almost outright ignoring any traces of character depth. The reboot as a result feels too numb and empty to enjoy on its own mindless B-movie monster terms.<br/><br/>Scientist Bruce Banner is in hiding in South America, trying to find a cure for his condition, whilst evading the US military who believe him to be a potential threat. But soon Banner is forced into changing into his alter ego, in order to stop a powerful enemy.<br/><br/>To be fair to 'The Incredible Hulk', it was already at a disadvantage, released between two of the best super-hero films of all time; 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight'. Where those films pushed the boundaries of the genre and shattered audience expectations, 'The Incredible Hulk' feels far too complacent and worried to take risks, which would benefit the overall quality of the film.<br/><br/>Edward Norton as Bruce Banner fails to generate enough interest in his character. He is too calm and never appears to have a darker side to his personality. Liv Tyler does not fare any better as Betty Ross, her lines whispered and lacking any chemistry or spark between Norton. This is unfortunate because we begin to care less about the characters as a result. They cannot go beyond their stereotypes, Banner the nerdy scientist and Ross the emotional, ever loving girlfriend. Tim Roth as the villainous Emil Blonsky is thankfully as deranged and unhinged as possible, so his scenes come as a breath of fresh air, as one of the few things that the film does right.<br/><br/>A significant improvement in this instalment though is the CGI. In 'Hulk' the effects looked unnatural and off-putting; whereas in 'The Incredible Hulk', the effect of the raging green monster looks seamless. The Hulk blends in with the environment and never looks out of place for a second. If only the director had applied as much thought for the story and characters as he did for the CGI.<br/><br/>Considering that the main appeal of a film that revolves around the Hulk is the fight scenes, it is astonishing that none of them remain in my memory for long. Perhaps, it is the fact that they are undistinguishable from one another and lack the thrills of the better structured 'Iron Man' in comparison.<br/><br/>As the second film in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, it's astonishing that 'The Incredible Hulk' did not lay waste to Marvel's plans for the future. It remains a severe misjudgement that rests far too heavily on action and explosions, than ideas and characters. We as an audience deserve more, if the super hero genre is to stay fresh and thriving. No doubt it will, but films with the same mentalities as 'The Incredible Hulk' can't be helping.<br/><br/>Leterrier's reboot will please Marvel die hards, but those that crave substance amongst ongoing chaos and destruction, will be feeling that this Hulk is anything but incredible."
"GusF","Null","0","1","16 September 2015"," Great fun from start to finish
","After the X-Men and Spider-Man, the title character is probably the Marvel superhero with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterisation as its predecessor ""Iron Man"" but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.<br/><br/>Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.<br/><br/>Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"". Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in ""Iron Man"" and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very enjoyable films which film rollicks along at a great pace and does not take itself too seriously. After ""Magic"", this the second film that I have watched in three days which explores the idea of a person having two personalities, incidentally."

","I thought this was the weakest of the Marvel films. I don't expect I would even take the time to watch it again. I didn't like Ed Norton as Banner, and now that we've seen Mark Ruffalo in the role, this film seems even more obsolete. I didn't care much about the story--they stuck with the most basic, commonly told Hulk storyline, yet it was done in a way that I don't think it would play well to younger viewers. I didn't much care for William Hurt or Tim Roth either, and that goes for their performances as well as what's in the script. I almost liked Liv Tyler as Betty, since she had some scenes where she got to show some strength of spirit. There were some technical aspects that were well done also, the most impressive being the overhead shots of the Brazilian slums. I had to look up whether or not this was a real place because the movie made it look so incredible. The abomination looked terrible, and the ending fight in Toronto (actual filming location) was pretty lame. And yet, there were so many inside references to the history of the character that you have to assume the filmmakers wanted to do him justice. Supposedly the principal actors were big Hulk fans too. Somehow, it just didn't work."

","Marvel did not serve this movie justice! The only reason I liked this film, is because Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. My problem with this movie is that they made the hulk look like a cartoon character more than something realistic. I really liked Ed as 'Bruce banner' but until I saw 'The Avengers Assemble' I thought Mark Ruffalo portrayed the character justice. The acting is somewhat good. Tim Roth who played 'The Abomination' also made this movie more enjoyable but other than that I think it was very disappointing. I am such a huge Hulk fan and for them to design the hulk the way that they did, really made me think that there will never be a good hulk movie. Hopefully Mark Ruffalo will have his own solo movie as 'Bruce Banner' and we will get the best hulk movie it deserves."

"firstruleofmethclub","6","0","1","17 April 2015"," Arguably the weakest MCU movie
","Dubbed as a ""re-quel"", The Incredible Hulk was first released in 2008, and now, I'm here to review it in the line of Marvel films I'm getting through a the moment. I always like to think of films individually, but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big, that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, parodies and the like, know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits, or lack thereof. It's pretty crazy seeing Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon) as a very scrawny Bruce Banner, considering that he turns into the giant, muscular Hulk. But to me it totally worked. As an interesting side-note, Norton co-wrote the script, which may or may not have contributed to his being ousted as Banner for any future films after the movie was released. Not because the script is particularly awful or anything, but because as a general rule production doesn't like actors ""getting all up in dey grillz"" half way through. Although it's not like Norton's never done this sort of thing before. Under-appreciated Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) is also excellent (as far as I'm concerned) playing the role of Abomination/Emil Blonsky. Interesting side-note, no, he's not related to Eli Roth, who's also a friend and actor of Quentin Tarantino and his films. Ultimately, The Incredible Hulk is a fine film, but it just can't stand up to the superior writing and character building of Thor, Iron Man or Iron Man 2. Liv Tyler (The Strangers, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Armageddon) is rather a non-event as supposed love interest Betty Ross. And William Hurt (A History of Violence, Dark City) as semi-antagonist General Thunderbolt Ross, is nothing but annoying (although it is pretty cool to see just how much they got him looking like the comic book character he is based on. You would've thought that having a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story to run with, backing from the success of the franchise you've got supporting you, that it would be easy to write strong characters, unfortunately, it's not the case. And while the action sequences are cool, and the fighting is possibly some of the best that Marvel's come up with, it's not enough to bring this film up to the standards of the other 3. The film lacks the flair I'm sure everyone would be expecting, and while it's a perfectly good monster-movie movie, perhaps a completely separate Super Hero origin story would have been better than the overly-CGI- ridden quasi-sequel to 2003's The Hulk that we ended up with. 60% -Gimly"

","Completely ignoring Ang Lee's 2003 feature about the same character as if it never existed, The Incredible Hulk is the second instalment in Marvel Cinematic Universe that marks yet another attempt to bring on screen the fascinating story of Bruce Banner & his alter ego. And while the first attempt was a disaster, the second venture is no jackpot material either.<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk tells the story of Dr. Bruce Banner; a nuclear physicist who is on the run from US military after an experiment carried out on him goes horribly wrong & transforms him into a green humanoid monster for a brief period of time whenever he's stressed, angry or excited. The plot covers Banner attempting to cure himself of his alter ego while a power-hungry soldier wants to become just like him.<br/><br/>Directed by Louis Leterrier, The Incredible Hulk presents the green monster in its absolute form & captures the process of Banner becoming Hulk in brief flashbacks instead of going through it all over again. The first act is brilliantly done & is quite engaging but after that, everything starts heading downstream until it becomes laughably bad in its final moments.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Edward Norton is nothing special in the role of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler is annoyingly bad, Tim Roth gets to have few good moments while the rest just fill in ably in their given roles. Visual effects is a mixed bag for the CGI only becomes worse as story progresses. Hulk never appears convincing enough on the screen, Abomination is even worse & the action sequences are just hollow.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Incredible Hulk is a very average output from the studio that began on a high with Iron Man. It's a mildly entertaining, empty-shelled & marginally passable piece of work that adds nothing to Marvel Cinematic Universe but then, it doesn't take away much from it as well. Watching it or skipping it won't make any difference in your Marvel marathon for this second attempt is almost as forgettable as the first."

","Wow. Who knew there would be so much eagerness to reboot the Hulk franchise only five years after Ang Lee's 2003 failure only to release an even bigger disaster. So now, after glossing over a new backstory in the lame opening credits, we have Edward Norton as Bruce Banner now, on the run while attempting to find a cure for himself before he is captured or before someone far less responsible than he obtains similar superpowers. While it should be embarrassing to reboot a story that was only done half a decade earlier, and that visual effects have not come all that far within that timeframe; what's worse than that and the lack of any other essential story elements is the simple fact that the plot does not MOVE.

"caseynicholson","7","0","1","16 January 2015"," A Film with Issues--But Fun Nonetheless
","If you know anything about Marvel Comics' ongoing drama over its licenses with its characters that it leased out to various production companies at the turn of the century before creating its own movie studio, then you will understand a bit about the strange way in which ""The Incredible Hulk"" movie was scripted.<br/><br/>In 2003, a Universal Pictures film directed by Ang Lee and called simply, ""Hulk"", was released to mixed reviews. I personally enjoyed that movie, though some say it suffered from some creative cinematography that tried a bit too hard to be like a comic book.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, five years later, Marvel Comics had founded its own movie production studio and was looking to start its own film sequence in which various characters could cross over into each others' films, i.e. the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". For reasons both creative and proprietary, this required a fresh start, which led to a ""reboot"" of the Hulk franchise.<br/><br/>And yet, in the case of the Hulk, the basic origin story had been told just five years before hand, and it didn't make much sense to remake that same movie. And so, a ""loose sequel"" was devised in which the audience could assume that the basic gist of the information that they remembered from the 2003 ""Hulk"" carried over into this movie, despite its having a totally different (and in my view inferior) cast. Eric Bana was replaced by Edward Norton; Jennifer Connelly became Liv Tyler; and the most regrettable replacement of all, Sam Elliott's spot on depiction of General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross became.......some random actor who I have no idea what his name is and don't even want to take the time to look it up right now because he wasn't very good in the role.<br/><br/>At any rate, the 2008 ""Incredible Hulk"" movie is perhaps the weakest film in the MCU lineup. It is an attempt at making the Hulk story fit into the larger narrative of the MCU, which it does by retconning the origin story so that the gamma ray experiments that led to Banner's transformation were the result of army experiments that were attempts at rejuvenating a ""Super Soldier"" program from World War II. In other words, the Hulk was a failed attempt at making an army of Captain Americas.<br/><br/>Whatever one makes of that, the story itself isn't terribly bad. What makes the film somewhat hard to watch, though, is the acting, and one can only assume that that also means that the film was poorly directed as well. Edward Norton is a great actor--but go watch his portrayal of Bruce Banner, and you'll find that Norton is no Bill Bixby. His dialogue is stiff and forced. He carries little emotion, even when becoming angry enough to transform into an 800 pound green monster. The whole role just felt very mismatched.<br/><br/>Tim Roth's performance doesn't shine very well, either. One can only imagine why a man with a British accent is in the U.S. Army. But even after you get past that, Roth's portrayal of a villain is a hyperbole, even for the comics genre. <br/><br/>The same can be said for Liv Tyler, who is gorgeous but rigid in this film. Aside from one brief moment where she yells at an NYC cab driver, there's not a lot of dynamism in her portrayal of Betty Ross. And as for her father, well, see my comment above.<br/><br/>None of these people are poor actors, which again draws into question the directorial skills in this film.<br/><br/>And yet despite all of the flawed, unemotional acting, this movie is still enjoyable to watch. The CGI Hulk is amazing, and the battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is fun. As such, in spite of the peculiarity of its being a ""loose sequel"" and in spite of lackluster performances, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is still worthy of 7/10 stars. It has its issues, but it's nonetheless a good movie overall."

","The Incredible Hulk is the least satisfying of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films by a long shot. Cramming the Hulk's origins into a five minute opening montage, Director Louis Leterrier subjects us to a boring, predictable and stupid second chapter. Writer/Star Edward Norton strikes out twice, first with a painful screenplay - everything from the romance to the Lou Ferrigno cameo to Ty Burrell's character feels forced, clichéd or unnecessary - and secondly with a dull performance. Norton is miscast as Banner, unbelievable both as a scientist and a man concealing his rage and inner demon. He is comedic when the situation calls for seriousness, and at all times bears a vacant expression unworthy of his talent. Accomplished actors like Hurt and Roth overact frequently, to the point where it is obvious that they are struggling with the stupidity. Visually, the Hulk looks like an unfinished rendering of the final product, and the action sequences are well choreographed but so full of explosions that there is nothing fun to be gained. The Incredible Hulk is an incredible disappointment, with as little character development and as many explosions, clichés and mindless action scenes as to be expected from a poor film in Michael Bay's filmography."

","When The Incredible Hulk came out back in 2008 I watched it in a movie theater. I remember thinking that this is the best film portrayal of the Hulk yet. It's by no means a perfect film but it gets a number of things right. It definitely has replay value. Casting Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was a curious but inspired move. Norton is a good actor. In this film his Banner is a likable and charismatic character from the beginning. This reluctant hero gets a dramatic treatment like never before in film. In addition to the well-handled romance between Banner and Betty Ross (a perfectly cast Liv Tyler) we're also shown how he relates to his work. Since this is a beginnings story Banner can't yet control the Hulk and he wants to rid himself of the green monster. This drags down the action scenes a bit because the Hulk fights against Thunderbolt Ross' (William Hurt) army units. It's not very exciting stuff because he isn't facing a supervillain. So he smashes some armored cars and brings down a chopper. Only at the end of the film do we get to see some real Hulk action when he faces Emil Blonsky. But, surprisingly, the action involving the Hulk isn't even the best aspect of this film. It's more interesting to see Norton play Banner while he's on the run from Ross. The inclusion of some good natured humor is also a plus. Hurt lent an air of respectability to the film in his role as General Ross just as Jeff Bridges did in Iron Man (2008). It's unfortunate that Norton didn't get to reprise his role as Banner in The Avengers (2012) because he made Banner a believable character. In The Avengers Banner is often used for comic relief while the Hulk is used only for action. Sure, the fight featuring the Hulk and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is exciting. But when written by Joss Whedon and played by Mark Ruffalo Banner has none of the mystery and charisma that Norton brought to the role. Norton said that his dispute with Marvel producers was about money, while Kevin Feige claimed that they didn't get along with Norton. Perhaps Norton disagreed with Whedon's comical take on the character, or perhaps Feige thought that the box office returns were below expectations and decided not to spend more time and effort on Hulk films. It's too bad because out of all the Marvel superheroes I was most excited about seeing the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk achieved what it set out to do. Norton and director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Now You See Me) successfully revived the character and did it in a smart way. The CGI was provided by Rhythm And Hues and not by Industrial Light & Magic, the company that created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). They succeeded in making the Hulk a vivid on-screen presence. Craig Armstrong provided a memorable music score, and if you want to get it it's available on two discs. There's a significant amount of footage that wasn't included in the final cut of the film. For example, the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide was cut out. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Some of the flashbacks that were placed across the film were compressed to the film's start. I would have liked seeing these in the final cut though. I recommend The Incredible Hulk. It's one of my favorite Marvel Studios films."

Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) finds out and reunites with Banner.<br/><br/>This is a good improvement from 2003. Edward Norton can play a wider range and make Banner more charming. Starting it in the Rio slums really ups the ante. It puts a bit of Jason Bourne in Banner. William Hurt is the weak spot. He doesn't have quite enough of the threatening demeanor. Tim Roth is able to pick up some of the slack as the baddie.<br/><br/>The CGI fights are still CGI fights. It still feels like a video game.

","Here's another movie I'll add to my ""I wanted to like more and, yet, continuously watch it"" film list.<br/><br/>By leaps and bounds, The Incredible Hulk (2008) is better than the Ang Lee's Hulk movie five years prior. But, it's still not great.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I found was that the cast was in reverse. I loved the entire cast of the first movie, but thought the movie was so-so. Here, I disliked each choice for the well-known to the Hulk universe characters and wished they were swapped. At least, they got brave and smart enough to replace Bruce Banner, yet again, with Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers.<br/><br/>I used to appreciate Edward Norton. I loved him in Fight Club, Rounders and American History X. But, the last two adaptations he took over, The Incredible Hulk and Red Dragon, he stunk. And bad.<br/><br/>Oh, well. I try and get past him and Liv Tyler's lips, the ho-hum Tim Roth and misplaced (and normally great, himself) William Hurt. When I do move on from those bad choices, along with the wide-open plot holes, I can enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>As I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series and not the comics, I enjoy the obvious and welcomed TV series tie-ins. Such as: the theme song used, the reporter (note: his name) filming the outdoor University fight, Bixby on the tele, the exciting opening credit scene, the signature lines – albeit humoritized and of course, Lou Ferrigno's (second movie-Hulk) cameo. I enjoyed the HULK-OUT scenes a lot and most importantly, I loved the video-game ending. This is coming from someone who plays very few video games, but did play to completion: The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction on Xbox. The finale to this movie was almost verbatim the game and that was so much fun to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>After a rebooted look on how Dr. Bruce David Banner became the Hulk – so, FORGET the original 2003 movie, Banner's on the run and eventually, though questionably and unrealistically, comes ""home"" to the USA in order to try and find a cure to his green alter-ego. Meanwhile, a military man wants to be the next super soldier and a great match to meet up with Hulk for theULTIMATE DESTRUCTION in NYC.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT terrible by any means. It's pretty cool on how it ties in with the eventual Avengers mythos, years later and its special effects trump the previous movie. In addition, it's refreshing he doesn't grow to 6-stories in this installment.<br/><br/>And even though they got the Hulk right even more in The Avengers, to date, 2013, they had very good special effects for the Hulk.<br/><br/>Now, my gripes: I want to see less drama and more Hulk-outs. I want to see the Hulk change more. I want to see less dark scenes with the Hulk than trying to cover him up.<br/><br/>Yes, I know they (probably mostly from Norton, from what I've read) wanted a more realistic and dramatic approach. Damnit, please just treat a superhero film like a superhero film and leave the art house crap for independent films.<br/><br/>That all said, it's still enjoyable, when Hulk is on screen, especially the mid-daylight scene and the fantastic finale. (Though, what was with Betty stopping the killing? Finish him! Okay, okay, that was one of the plot holes)"
"joshua-303-92778","5","0","2","28 April 2013"," The worst Hulk movie
","Right out of the gate, it's confusing whether this is a sequel or a reboot of the superior Hulk movie which was released only a few years prior. That film was directed by Ang Lee, one of the best filmmakers working today. This movie aims lower, and in that regard, I suppose it's successful.<br/><br/>My chief complaint about this film is that there's not enough action. This is a Hulk movie. People watch it to see the Incredible Hulk go nuts and destroy everything in sight. This film has one brief action scene (on a college campus, where apparently no one thinks it's unusual to see an armored military squad roll onto the lawn and start shooting). And what an amazing coincidence that Liv Tyler's father is in the lead Humvee.<br/><br/>The other action sequence of course takes place at the end, and while engrossing, it's not enough to make up for the other 1 hour and 45 minutes of Ed Norton and Tyler. By far, the weakest link in this movie is Tyler. Her acting is wooden and not convincing in the least.<br/><br/>If this film was as good as everyone else here seems to think, then Marvel would have retained Norton for the role. They didn't. This film ends up being an ugly ducking and an incomplete story."

","...that was it. These days, with so many superhero movies coming out, you gotta make your movie stand out. And The Incredible Hulk really didn't stand out for me - there were certain moments that did, for sure, but the movie as a whole was kind of bland.<br/><br/>Edward Norton as Bruce Banner - great choice. His physique, especially, made him a great pick - Ed Norton's a skinny guy, and, compared to the Hulk, it makes the transformation even more grave. Liv Tyler didn't stand out to me, either (at least she didn't annoy me) - neither did Tim Blake Nelson, or William Hurt. Tim Roth was cool, though.<br/><br/>There were certain elements that I really liked about The Incredible Hulk - mainly when Bruce Banner is just Bruce Banner. I honestly wasn't interested in the parts where he Hulks out. I don't know why - I was just so enveloped in his search for a cure that I just got bored of the action scenes and wanted them to be over.<br/><br/>Overall, I cared more about the guy way more than the Hulk, and I think that's where this movie failed - it didn't strike a balance. It's worth checking out, though."

"tim-764-291856","5","0","1","11 June 2012"," High energy action but plastic looking Hulk...
","I feel I should be more enthusiastic about this update on the Marvel comic hero, after Ang Lee's dodgy misfire, it could only get better, right?<br/><br/>Being too old and wise (supposedly) to only appreciate the action, I was looking for rather more. Watching on ITV, it's taken a good hour (less on the DVD, adverts considering) for flimsy Edward Norton to really let rip - and I don't just mean his shirt buttons! Throwing tanks around like toys and being blasted by flame-throwers, now, that's real bionic Rambo.<br/><br/>It all starts off too vaguely and slowly and it takes Tim Roth an awful long time before he finally gets going, as a sort of rival to the Hulk, known as 'Abomination', manufactured by the Military to be a fighting machine and eventually gets to fight to the death with Norton's Hulk right at the end, in quite a hell raiser of a climax!<br/><br/>The Beauty & the Beast/King Kong elements, which are evident and profound, where Liv Tyler is calling out to the Hulk in the pouring rain, is touching but just was not exploited enough. Then, snap back to reality and Norton's bruised and battered body lays in a hospital bed. When they go on the run together later, (as human) it's the same old clichéd 'don't use a cell-phone or credit card, because they can trace them' scenario, which admittedly must be new to someone, but surely not many now and where's the chemistry between them?<br/><br/>I'm no up-to-the-minute expert on the latest CGI/latex industry, but the Hulk still looks ridiculous, sticking out like a sore thumb from whatever background or scene he's in. At times, he's no more than a plastic cereal-box toy, a shiny, olive-green plastic figure, albeit a very big one...<br/><br/>That aside, I used to enjoy movies like this when I was ten (or, their equivalents) and I haven't been that for a long time. Whilst I'm moaning, another favourite of mine, an actor capable of great depth and sensitivity, William Hurt, becomes a quite ordinary Army General, though he plays Betty's (Tyler) father.<br/><br/>Of its type, Louis Leterrier's Incredible Hulk is OK and my rating reflects that, but it has to said, even this latest reincarnation already seems dated."

This was very well done!It has a lot of good actions, really! I've never seen the first Hulk movie, but at least I've seen the second one. The Hulk was very amazing like hero and stronger and deadlier than ever and that is what is very good about him! I realized that the Hulk has very powerful feelings.

"nickmesafilms","7","0","1","20 May 2012"," The Incredible Hulk (2008) - Hulk Smash!
","After receiving harsh reviews for 2003's ""Hulk"", starring Eric Bana, Marvel immediately decided to reboot the Hulk franchise with 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"", this time, starring Edward Norton as the giant, raging green monster. Now, the Hulk isn't my favorite Marvel superhero, but is rather considered as one of the coolest superheroes. Set with a new back-story on Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk, Banner travels from place to place, to help find a cure to prevent himself from becoming the Hulk, while making sure to not be spotted by the military. Although this isn't the best portrayal of the Hulk that I've seen in a while, Edward Norton does deliver a fine quality and relativity to the Bruce Banner character. But the visual effects perform a weak job at making the Hulk effect look like Edward Norton. Besides Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell, and Tim Blake Nelson round up the rest of the supporting cast. Tim Roth shares a pretty decent portrayal of Emil Blonsky, a.k.a The Abomination, and William Hurt does his best playing General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, obsessed in capturing the Hulk. But Liv Tyler brings out the weakest performance of the entire cast, playing Norton's love-interest, Elizabeth Ross. She spits out her dialouge in such a cheesy manner, and she delivers bland execution to go along with it. I honestly don't know why she's even in this movie! This movie does deliver some impressive action scenes that are quite enjoyable to watch, but they're placed in the wrong place at the wrong time. These scenes are just placed in random elements of the plot, and they don't fit appropriately into the story as it progresses. It feels like it's just there to promise the audience for there to be an action movie. For example, the final battle scene between the Hulk and the Abomination was entertaining to watch, but it just didn't develop into the plot precisely, so that the audience can see a fight scene already. But those scenes are enjoyable to watch, however, and worth the price of admission. ""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't one of the best Marvel films I've seen in my life, but it's still quite an entertaining movie that sometimes knew what it wanted to be. I just wished that the movie would have been so much better at arranging the action scenes at a more precise moment, fitting perfectly in the story itself. But it's still a pretty damn fun movie to watch with your friends. ""The Incredible Hulk"", in my review, ""poorly executed, but undeniably entertaining""."
"kdnor2011","7","0","1","30 April 2012"," It was Good...that's really all I can say
","This was actually the last Avengers movie that I watched, I saw it for the first time a couple months ago, and my opinion really hasn't changed much. Basically all I can say is, The Incredible Hulk is good, it wasn't great, wasn't bad. The film doesn't have many bad things, but it also doesn't have many great things.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding. The acting is...good. The characters are fine. The special effects are good but nothing mind blowing. The action scenes are entertaining enough and well shot but didn't enthrall me. The villain is good. I liked the way it tied into the Avengers. The film was just...good.<br/><br/>There are really only a couple of things I didn't like. One was Liv Tyler, for the most part she wasn't bad, but at times she was so bland and it didn't even seem like she was trying. And the other...the first two thirds take themselves a little too seriously. I don't mean to say every major blockbuster has to be part comedy. But come on this is a film needed a little more humor. And we kind of get that in the last third with Dr. Blue. I liked this guy, he was really funny. But the humor seemed really out of place when compared to the rest of the film. Also, what happened to Blue, is he going to be in the Avengers? The Incredible Hulk is a good popcorn movie. Not one I'll be watching over and over, but it doesn't really have much wrong with it. It just doesn't have many great things in it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","7","30 April 2012"," Great Performance by Norton
","The Incredible Hulk (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), not being able to control his powers, goes to Brazil to hide from his past but he ends up back in the states once the government comes after him. With the help of a former flame (Liv Tyler) he tries to learn to control himself but soon he's got an enemy (Tim Roth) gunning for him. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a pretty good comic adaptation that even those people who aren't fans of comics should enjoy. I think there's a lot of good stuff going on in the picture but I'd say the majority of the credit has to go to Norton for his great performance. When I heard Norton was going to be appearing in a comic movie it took me by surprise because he really doesn't seem to be the type. If rumors are true and he was unhappy with the film it really doesn't show. I thought Norton did a terrific job at showing the characters wide emotions as he fights himself to try and not turn into that towering green guy. I thought the human element Norton was able to bring to the part not only made you feel for the character but it also built up the other relationships in the film. Tyler's character isn't nearly as well-written but I thought she was fine in her part as was William Hurt playing the bad General. Roth is always fun in villain roles and that remains true here. The CGI in the film is rather obvious at times but I thought the filmmakers did a nice job with the Hulk character. The visual look of him was quite good and I thought he blended into the scenes well. The action scenes are all at a high level and especially the final battle."
"Wuchakk","7","0","1","10 April 2012"," Comparing the '08 and '03 versions
","I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.<br/><br/>The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.<br/><br/>Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.<br/><br/>Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.<br/><br/>The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps – almost flying – as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area. <br/><br/>Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table. <br/><br/>The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the ""super soldier"" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.<br/><br/>Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.<br/><br/>Great soundtracks in both versions. <br/><br/>So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (sorry) <br/><br/>Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"
"MaximumMadness","8","0","2","6 March 2012"," ""The Incredible Hulk""- the 2008 reboot is a fun and very decent action picture with some large problems
","I am one of the rare fans of Ang Lee's 2005 ""Hulk"" adaptation. It is a very underrated, provocative and cerebral analysis of the character, and is an interesting character study of everyone's favorite not-so-jolly green giant. That being said, I'm also an enormous fan of the two ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", and I'm very excited about the upcoming ""Avengers"" crossover featuring those three characters plus the title character of this 2008 reboot, so I recently decided to sit down and watch this film after having put it off for the past few years.<br/><br/>Directed by Louis Letterier (""Transporter 2"") and written by action-veteran Zak Penn, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a step-up as an action film. Whereas the Ang Lee version was a complex mind-bending genre film with little awe-inspiring action but a deep analysis of what makes the Hulk tick, this is more of what audiences were apparently expecting- a lot of ""Hulk smash!"" moments without a particularly deep and moving plot. That being said, it's still an involving, fun film, and despite some shaky storytelling, it's worth seeing, especially as a precursor to the upcoming ""Avengers"" film.<br/><br/>On the surface, this largely seems to be an homage to the classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno series from the 70's. (With a lot of references, including the use of Ferrigno as the voice of the Hulk, the iconic ""Lonely Man"" theme, and even some flashbacks that look startlingly like the opening of the TV-series) Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been on the run from the army for the past few years, and is holding up in Brazil, where he trains to control he breathing and temper, and works in a soda-packing plant. General Ross (William Hurt) is still pursuing him, and when a sample of Bruce's blood is accidentally mixed in with one of the sodas, poisoning an American man, Ross dispatches Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a Russian-born army man, to track him down and bring him back. Bruce also yearns for his past love- Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), the General's daughter. Soon, Bruce finds Betty and they most go on the run from Ross and from Blonsky, whom is given a ""super-soldier"" treatment and eventually becomes the Hulk-like villain ""The Abomination."" <br/><br/>The film, to its credit, is a fun movie. It's a blast to watch, and it serves as a nice set-up to ""The Avengers."" The action is a lot stronger, and particularly the climactic battle is very awe-inspiring. Unlike ""Thor"", ""Captain America"" and the two ""Iron Man"" films, the action here is very drawn out and brutal, and never feels anticlimactic. (Which is a problem I had with the other ""Avengers"" films- too little action, and they were somewhat anticlimactic.) The acting is generally superb as well, and despite there not being much character development, the roles are all filled perfectly, and you will feel for each one.<br/><br/>That being said, there are some problems. For one, as I mentioned above, there is exceedingly little character development. This takes place after Hulk's origins, so we miss out on a lot of establishments of characters. This almost feels like a sequel to a non-existent film, as we don't really get to learn about the characters, and we are expected to have built-in knowledge. (To be honest, this could very-well have been a sequel to the Ang Lee film with the omission of one or two flashbacks, as it almost feels like it was written as a sequel then retooled into a reboot at the last minute.) <br/><br/>Second, Hulk looks less realistic than he did in the Ang Lee film three years prior, oddly enough. People complained about him being too bright a hue of green in the last film, and it took people out of the movie, but other than his bright color, the character model, lighting and animation was suburb, and there were a few shots that were among the best CGI I've ever seen. Here, they tried (and failed, in my opinion) to redesign the character and he looks much faker as a result. They darkened his skin, which gives him the unfortunate look of a dill-pickle in wide-shots, and the lighting makes him look a bit too ""plastic-like"" in some moments, and the way the model's skin moves over his muscles looks fake. Also, the animation is too quick and too smooth looking, which gives him away as a CGI creation. Abomination, the ""evil Hulk"", actually looks far better, more detailed and more realistic.<br/><br/>Finally, the film does take a bit too long to get going. I had actually rented the film when it first came out, and shut it off after 15 minutes, because I was bored. It does take a good 20-30 minutes to get moving, which does hurt it.<br/><br/>Those complaints being said, however, this is still a fast, fun, furious ride, and it's very wild and exciting to watch. I'm giving it a good 8 out of 10. It's one of the weakest ""Avengers"" movies, but it's still a good film."

","This re-booting of The Hulk begins with Bruce Banner working in a bottling plant in Brazil, on the run from the US authorities and seeking a cure to his rampaging alter-ego. Edward Norton takes over from Eric Bana in the central role and does well at capturing the vulnerable Banner - and he gets the best joke in the movie due to his sketchy knowledge of Portugeuse. I won't spoil it but a knowledge of the 70s TV show helps.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler is Banner's love interest Betty Ross, and William Hurt plays General Thunderbolt Ross, here given a darker side as it's revealed his character wants to use the technique that created the Hulk as a military weapon. Ross calls in Emil Blonsky, a Russian-born British Intelligence operative to help take Banner down. And it's Blonsky who gradually emerges as the real villain of the piece.<br/><br/>Banner must journey to New York to meet a mysterious scientist ""Mr. Blue"" who may be able to develop a cure for the Hulk, but learns little along the way. Ross father and daughter feel pretty one-dimensional. Roth, an unlikely cock-er-ney Russian, is pretty effective. By no means a standard comic book bad guy, he has more complexity to his character than usual, and compares well with, say, Micky Rourke's undercooked villain in Iron Man 2, Some of the plot points feel a little forced; yet the action is well mounted and director Louis Leterrier manages some impressive sequences. As in Iron Man the action is never allowed to dominate the story. We even get a brief reprise of the ""Banner moving on"" theme from the TV. show.<br/><br/>The final battle between the Hulk and the newly gamma-powered Blonsky, however, is something of a let down, with little imagination applied. It merely consists of the two titans whacking each other a lot into buildings etc. The big character revelation moment for the Hulk is similarly mishandled. The Cgi is a big improvement on Ang Lee's Hulk, with the green Goliath feeling physically solid this time out. There's also a nice moment with Hulk and Betty sheltering from a storm in a cave - something taken directly from the comic in the Stan Lee years. Yep, Stan the Man, who's now been in more of these films than Hitchcock in his own movies, amusingly cameos again.<br/><br/>This is a pretty good effort; in the year of the Dark Knight and Iron Man The Incredible Hulk was somewhat overlooked. But I viewed if for the second time recently and it still holds up. Don't expect the adjective ""Incredible"" and you will probably like it. I certainly did."

","Edward Norton seems unsatisfied. With dialog consisting exclusively of oneliners, you can not define or build any kind of character. Given nothing to work with he's right in acting bored, so is the rest of the otherwise potent cast, each of them trying to coop with the situation in their on manner. Everyone is playing some generic character that they played before, placing this movie into a generic universe inhabited by generic people doing generic stuff. Which is a pity, as otherwise this is a rough, intense action spectacle with a truly incredible, brutal Hulk. The beautiful, mature cinematography is easily the best of any Marvel flick and the CGI is mind blowing, incarnating the Hulk in exactly the form, he deserves to have.<br/><br/>2008 was a good year for comic book fans, with Ironman, the best Marvel adaptation so far, and Hulk, a merely adult try on the genre, Marvel seemed illuminated, promising a darker, more mature, more intense, more human direction for their upcoming line of movies. Unfortunately, rather then working more in this direction, Disney seemed to have turned the wheel and as things look now, Hulk is going to stay the darkest and roughest feature that Marvel is willing to put money into. Mothers are not willing to take their five year olds to this kind of stuff, that's bad for the business, I get it.<br/><br/>So ""The Incredible Hulk"" feels a little bit like the incidentally created monster itself and comic book characters are not yet to enter the adult world like they would deserve."

"Lomedin","Null","0","1","7 April 2011"," Entertaining and deep enough for the most part
","I remember watching some of the old ""The Hulk"" series on TV when I was a kid. That's basically all my history with this green big guy. I saw the 2003 film, but either I didn't watch it completely or was overall bad enough to make me forget several pieces here and there. I admit that I'm a bit of a fan of Norton and I find Miss Taylor quite an attractive woman, so I decided to watch this movie right after my terrible experience with Iron Man 1 and 2. The first 10 minutes of The Incredible Hulk were already better than both Iron Man films. It feels, somehow, more mature, whereas Iron Man is a big budget shallow film directed to teenagers and people who don't give a damn about anything but simple action and special effects. The 2008 Hulk gives you a deeper look into the character of Bruce Banner, and his inner struggles fighting to control the green beast known as The Hulk. This alone makes the whole difference compared to, let's say, the narcissist and egomaniac Tony Starks in Iron Man. The Hulk is also packed with action and, although the special effects aren't as mind-blowing as in Iron Man, they will keep you stuck to your seat. The film loses a bit towards the last 30 min, although the very (open) end leaves you with a nice feeling. I also like the crossover stuff in it (The Leader, The Avengers...), even when that means the appearance of Tony Starks. I'd have liked to see more of Norton's acting instead of so much of his CGI face for The Hulk during the last part of the film, but still, not a bad movie."
"japamo","7","0","1","11 March 2011"," We'll make a conventional superhero out of the Hulk yet!
","Let me state unequivocally at the outset that in comparing Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" and Louis Leterrier's ""Incredible Hulk"" movies, I believe Ang Lee's version is superior. My reason for this can be summed up by a paraphrase of a quote from Roger Ebert's review of ""1984"": ""(Leterrier's) version of (Marvel's tormented green character) turned (the Hulk's plight) into a cautionary, simplistic (superhero) tale. (Ang Lee's ""Hulk"") penetrates much more deeply into (the character's psychological) heart of darkness."" If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of my reasoning, I refer you to my ""Ph.D. thesis"" review of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" on IMDb.<br/><br/>However, all that psychological complexity elicited a lot of discomfort and hostility from ""Hulk"" viewers. They didn't want to see a tragic, emotionally reserved character struggling with mental and father dilemmas and abuse as well as his gamma-irradiated condition. God damn it, they wanted an unambiguous superhero rising up to beat the bad guys to a pulp and save humanity, the world, or something. They wanted the most unconventional, unlikely ""superhero"" of all to follow the old movie superhero formula: 1) Origin of good guy superhero, 2) Origin of good guy superhero's nemesis, 3) Circumstances that bring the superhero and nemesis together to fight. Apparently, the corporate suits listened to this plea and gave the world ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br/><br/>Consequently, Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" takes the character nuances and motivations Lee's ""Hulk"" worked so hard to cultivate and makes them slicker, simpler and more basic. The Hulk/Bruce Banner no longer is the reluctant or accidental hero who only wants to live a peaceful life and inherits his powers by accident. This time Banner (Edward Norton) is a rash, ambitious graduate student who deliberately subjects himself to gamma radiation almost as a lark, to see what superpowers he'll get and soon rues his choice. The Hulk's/Bruce's anger no longer arises from trauma suffered from years of parental abuse. This time, being chased around by the military because he is ""U.S. government property"" as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) puts it, and has a power Ross and many others want to scientifically duplicate, makes Banner lose it and ""Hulk out"". General Ross himself is no longer an ambivalent character, a dutiful soldier bent on crushing the menacing Hulk but also obsessively protective of his only child, Betty Ross. Instead, he is a purely unscrupulous, selfish villain. However, the Hulk himself does manage to keep most of his pathos and sympathy in spite of Leterrier's efforts to steer him into superhero status.<br/><br/>Leterrier glosses over the Hulk's creation in a frantic montage, instead of Lee's deliberate, contemplative origin story. Conversely, however, he takes more time following the creation of the Hulk's ultimate nemesis, another gamma creature known as the Abomination (not named in the film). The Abomination is actually Emil Blonsky, a Slavic (?) mercenary Ross retains to help his troops capture the Hulk. Blonsky, a veteran soldier past his prime, is apparently an adrenaline and power junkie. Impressed by his first encounter with the Hulk in South America, and gradually learning from the reticent Ross about his origin, Blonsky is insanely eager to become a match for the Hulk.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, chased from his hideout in the Rio favela slums by Ross's troops but escaping to Culver University in Virginia (I think) partly by transforming into the Hulk, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and conspires with her to go to New York and meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns, to whom he has shipped blood samples in hopes of finding a cure. Unfortunately, Banner learns to his shock that the animated Dr. Sterns too has jumped on the ""Super Soldier"" bandwagon and has cloned his blood proteins to discover their amazing properties. Before Dr. Stearns can proceed with his research, Ross, Blonsky, and the military arrive. Having received an initial dose of the ""Super Soldier formula"" from Ross and already lost to the Hulk in an initial confrontation, Blonsky comes back for Round 2. Blonsky forces Dr. Stearns to give him a booster shot of Banner's proteins, which completely transform him into the Abomination. He goes on a rampage.<br/><br/>To save New York, Banner skydives from a military helicopter without a parachute to compel himself to transform into the Hulk. He does so just in time before hitting the pavement. He collides with the Abomination in the night-time New York streets and the two behemoths have a battle royal which culminates on a building roof. After about a half-hour of punishing blows, the Hulk eventually triumphs and jumps away. Humanity is saved (and the Hulk has caused minimal collateral damage).<br/><br/>Despite the ""dumbing-down"" of this iconic ""monster"", I still enjoyed ""The Incredible Hulk"" as a well-paced, exciting action flick that makes some improvements on Ang Lee's version. Much as I like Eric Bana in Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", he's really too tall and muscular to play Bruce Banner. Edward Norton's slighter build is more suitable to the role. Norton's Banner also projects more vulnerability and desperation. Liv Tyler's performance as Betty Ross reinforces Banner's humanity even as the Hulk even more than Jennifer Connelly's version in ""Hulk"". Tim Roth's manic, driven Blonsky/Abomination promises to give the Hulk more headaches in sequels. And we get to see the Hulk act truly heroic, with hints that he will do so again in the future, if Banner has anything to say about it."

","I know I'm probably in the minority but I much preferred Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" to this meandering mess.<br/><br/>Firstly, I found Lee's version to be much more akin to the comic books and the cartoon-ish framing and appearance of the Hulk really played well.<br/><br/>Alternatively, this version has some serious flaws. The first major one is the casting of Ed Norton. I consider myself a fan of EN's but in this film he seems too effeminate and not intellectual enough. Bill Bixby had a much better command of the internal conflict that Banner must have been experiencing. In contrast, Norton's interpretation seems flat with little or no emotion until he morphs into The Hulk.<br/><br/>The second major flaw is with Liv Tyler. I'm sorry, I have personal fantasies about this woman and to cast her in such a frumpy role really degrades her presence. She seems to emerge as more of herself in the latter scenes but initially she is truly horrid to watch. And this from the woman who will one day carry my babies ;-) It's not a bad movie. In fact, if Ang Lee's version didn't exist it would be quite good. But, alas, it doesn't compare well enough for me to give it more that 4 stars out of ten.<br/><br/>OK, now with the flaming!!! ;-)"

","There's a huge discussion going on about which is the better Hulk movie. The 2003 movie, directed by Ang Lee or this recent one.<br/><br/>For me, it's a hard choice.<br/><br/>I like the 2003 movie for the (deep) storyline and story development. I like the effects and CGI slightly better in there too. Although some things are a bit over-the-top (like the Hulk jumping over a huge canyon, I know he is incredible, but come on!).<br/><br/>This movie however, delivers entertainment on a different level. I like this movie for it's mystery (at first) and the slow uprising of one of Hulk's most stubborn enemies, the Abomination.<br/><br/>I liked the acting. Each character plays their role well and there aren't many stupid moments in the dialog. It's all believable enough. I found the scientist, mr. Blue, quite hilarious.<br/><br/>Amazing special effects and CGI in this movie. Although I like this version of Hulk slightly less when compared to the 2003 one. But that's just one opinion, so feel free to discard my statement.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes or so are filled to the brink with tough action and fighting. It really gives you a moment of 'wow'. And 'ouch' sometimes too. It's one of the most intense fights I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>In overall, the Incredible Hulk is an enjoyable, fun movie. But to me, it isn't as incredible as the 2003 movie.<br/><br/>Still, 7 out of 10 stars."
"Ibuk","6","0","1","28 May 2009"," Finally a Hulk movie to be proud of
","I know I have been probably a year late in posting my review for this movie but I honestly didn't feel I couldn't post a review for it till I watch it again. Despite being a financial success TIH had the misfortune of being released amongst other Superhero movies, The Iron Man and more famously The Dark Knight. I saw Ang Lee's Hulk in the cinema and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I refused to see the Ed Norton version. I later caught TIH on DVD and regretted the fact that I didn't catch it on the big screen because in my opinion it is far far better.<br/><br/>In my opinion Ang Lee's version was a ponderous mess that should have been less talky and had more action. Another criticism I have of Ang Lee's version is that in my opinion they overcomplicated the story, instead of being just about Bruce and his battle to cure himself they tried to link it back to his father whilst TIH is far more simple.<br/><br/>After the critical backlash Hulk received it does look the producers learnt their less. Hulk in my opinion waffled on quite a bit whilst TIH is more to the point. For instance we see the gamma radiation accident in the opening credits so we skip right to the action whilst Ang Lee's version took up at least half an hour before that even occurred. TIH boasts of some good action sequences and a fine story to back it up. Plus Ed Norton is a far better actor than Eric Bana. I love how it toffs it cap to the TV show, Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee both have special appearances and Bill Bixby is seen on TV and there was an instance where they used the music from the original show.<br/><br/>My only criticism of TIH is that they didn't show enough of The Abomination and felt they only included him so that Hulk could fight him at the end and give the audience a thrilling ending. In my opinion TIH is head and shoulders above most recent superheroes movies(Fantastic Four,Spiderman 3, X Men 3 etc)."

","had the better actors with Eric Bana, Jennifer Connley, and Sam Elliott. I liked all 3 actors better than the ones in the new Hulk version. But, this new Hulk overall was a little better; the story flowed better.<br/><br/>The film begins with Bruce Banner living in Brazil in hiding working at a bottling plant. Some of his blood lands in a bottle and the General is able to track him there. The General has enlisted the help of aging soldier, Emil Blonsky (whom was great played by Tim Roth) to capture Banner. Of course, Banner gets angry and we get the first glimpse of Hulk. Blonsky is in awe of the Hulk's power and wants the same.<br/><br/>Banner makes his way to Virginia to see Betty. Meanwhile, General Ross decides to allow Blonsky to be injected with a serum similar to what Banner had, giving him super power. Ross is tipped to Banner's where abouts and this is the first encounter with Hulk and a vamped up Blonsky. Blonskly proves he can take a licking and keep on ticking. This encounter also offers some great special effects.<br/><br/>Hulk gets away with Betty, and the two are on a mission to seek out Mr. Blue who maybe able to reverse the effects of the gamma radiation. Ross finds Mr. Blue and so does Blonsky who insists he be given a dose of Banner's blood.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is a cool fight between Hulk and Blonsky's version of the Hulk. Good special effects.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: While not the best comic movie to come out, this one was pretty good. I wanted to see it in the theater last year, but didn't. After seeing it, I think that was a good choice because it's not worth 10 dollars to see. It's a good action, popcorn flick, but definitely lacks some of the humor in the Spiderman films."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","29 April 2009"," It isn't easy being green...
","Ed Norton may well go down in movie history as the only character to be less handsome than his monstrous alter-ego in this film. A hulk this brute may well be, but he's a rugged, strong-jawed fellow with a sensitive nature lurking just beneath the rippling green muscles...<br/><br/>The Incredible Hulk is pretty good as far as Superhero movies go, but I can't help wondering why Norton felt it necessary to apparently change so much of Zak Penn's screenplay given the latter's track record in superhero screen adaptations. Whatever the reason, the first half of the film, in which the story explores the lonely, wretched existence of the fugitive Bruce Banner is quite involving. Unfortunately the film's second half, which concentrates more on the cartoonish elements of the character's adventures, is not quite so engaging and, in the final confrontation, it is numbingly obvious that all we are watching is two cartoons duking it out.<br/><br/>The cast here is also pretty good for a superhero flick aimed at the teens, even though Norton, Hurt, Roth, et al, often appear to merely be going through the motions. Nevertheless, if you're in the mood for some undemanding entertainment this will fit the bill nicely."

However, the Hulk is a bit unique because even though he is a crazed behemoth, he still has a moral compass when enraged as the Hulk.<br/><br/>I don't like providing spoilers so I'll be short with this review. The acting is decent and the special effects are great. The story is a bit of a drag and doesn't focus on Banner's struggle enough.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining watch but you probably won't be craving for multiple viewings. It's a good flick to waste a couple hours on but nothing special here."

","Unlike the majority of subscribers that respectable site, I think it still was not able to take this time to film all the magic of super-hero, unlike what occurred with other Marvel heroes (such as Spiderman, Superman, etc.). The film is full of clichés. Even the beautiful Liv Tyler sounds weak in context, cause the fragility of the roadmap. Hulk was portrayed as a monster, in bad sense! The protagonist tries to get rid of it as a terminal cancer. Where is your charisma?

The United States Military, lead by General Ross (William Hurt) swoops in on him with no mercy and so it begins a desperate chase back to America to evade capture. But aside from rekindling with old flame Betty (Liv Tyler) Banner faces a newer, more deadly adversary in the shape of Blonsky (Tim Roth) a Russian soldier who has been injected with his own serum, which turns him into The Abomination, The Hulk's deadliest foe.<br/><br/>While Ang Lee's original adaptation of Hulk was not an awful film, it didn't make enough of an impression on me to make me drool with excitement when the sequel came out. And so it passed me by in cinemas and has only now just caught my eye on DVD. Lee's passed directorial duties on this one to known action director Louis Lettirier...who's produced an even more under-whelming result.<br/><br/>As well as a new director there's a new lead star (there must have been some falling out on the set of the last film) in the shape of Norton, who's maybe a bit too deep for the role, approaching it like it's Hamlet. All of the supporting cast make a bit of an impression, Roth especially, and lets not forget the surprise cameo at the end by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (although hearing Stark Industries mentioned earlier does get the mind wondering) unsubtly opening the door for another sequel. But the story just fails to hold your attention through-out, something not even lifted by the numerous special effects, save for a tasty end showdown between Hulk and The Abomination, as they stampede through the streets, crushing cars, smashing buildings and generally making a lot of mess.<br/><br/>This is really no 'incredible' hulk. Nor a jolly green giant. Not even something in between. **"
"YouSeenThat","5","0","2","26 December 2008"," Mr Green meet Mr. Orange.
","The Incredible Hulk has been touted as a reboot of The Hulk franchise by all involved. Written by Zack Penn (Behind Enemy Lines, X Men 2), and apparently rewritten by Edward Norton in his typical control-freak style, think of this film in the same vein in which 'Batman Begins' rebooted the Batman series - so if you were unfortunate enough to have watched Ang Lee's earlier attempt, you could do a lot worse than forget you had ever seen it. <br/><br/>Since The Incredible Hulk is a reboot of an already well-known tale, don't go into the film expecting any sort of real origin storyline  this isn't Iron Man; you don't get the luxury of spending an hour watching Robert Downey Jr. build a metal suit inside a darkened cave while snorting lines of cocaine off of a hookers ass. Instead, the viewer gets dumped straight into The Hulk's world armed with little more than a clichéd thirty second introduction, comprised primarily of brief Vietnam-style flashbacks and various assembled newspaper-clippings. You know the type headlines: ""Giant Green Yeti Touched My Wife"", ""A Sasquatch Ate My Baby""  just enough exposition for the simpletons in the audience to surmise that the filmmakers are referring to the big green guy that they just spent thirteen bucks to watch. The assumption is that the viewer already knows enough about The Hulk and his origin to make it through the one-hundred and fourteen minute running time, and if they don't, and that's a big 'if', they probably should have bought a ticket to the latest Adam Sandler flick. <br/><br/>With introductions quickly dispensed, The Incredible Hulk picks up in the heart of Brazil, where we find fugitive Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) working a dead-end job in a juice factory, attempting to come to terms with controlling his giant green alter-ego. Living in Brazil? Living in Brazil with hot Brazilian women? Okay, I must have missed the memo to the Office of Big Swinging Dicks. Apparently in the short time period since last months issue of Cleo, and the theatrical window that we call 'ten minutes ago', Banner came to the conclusion that it was somehow undesirable to be hanging out with hot Brazilian poon and watching Portuguese Sesame Street in his jocks like a ghetto pimp. As a symptom of what could only describe as undiagnosed jungle fever, Banner decides that simply controlling his alter-ego isn't enough - he wants a cure. That illusive cure comes in the form of research undertaken by a mysterious US-based scientist working under the codename Mister Blue. The only problem with finding a cure  Mister Blue needs to meet Mister Green in the flesh, which involves Banner travelling back to the good ol' US of A. It doesn't sound that difficult does it? You'd almost be justified in thinking that, well, that is until Bruce Banner's cover is blown via the most weak of plot devices (the only reason to have Banner working in a juice factory). On the run again, Banner must flee from a US Army recovery team aided by an elite Russian-born soldier by the name of Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). <br/><br/>From a cast standpoint, The Incredible Hulk sports a pretty solid line-up: Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, William Hurt as General Ross, and the extremely underrated Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky. Sure, the cast probably won't make your average film buff cream their pants with anticipation, but the cast is definitely decent by any standards. Edward Norton does a competent job of playing Bruce Banner - I just didn't feel that there was any great emotional range to the character. Maybe it is just the way Norton rolls, but as a viewer I didn't feel any tangible growth or journey with Bruce Banner. Direction-wise, Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, Unleashed) takes the helm of this popcorn-fest - an interesting choice given his track record, or more accurately, lack of a track record. Despite my apprehensions, Leterrir does a commendable job with The Incredible Hulk. Although I guess when you have so much invested in special effects, and Edward Norton stealth-editing your final cut behind your back, it's kind of difficult to screw the pooch too badly. Speaking of CGI, I'm reminded as to one major thing that always put me off watching Ang Lee's The Hulk - aside from the lack of interest in the character, I was always turned-off by how cornball the CGI looked. There are some films where you can hide bad CGI, and there are some films where you can't - when your major character is a nine feet tall giant green monster, it's like trying to hide Rosanne Barr's naked carcass somewhere in the pages of a Swimsuit Illustrated calendar. It's going to stick out like the proverbial dogs balls. Fortunately for The Incredible Hulk, the CGI was actually quite well done. Sure, there were points in the film when I thought I was watching cutscenes from Gears of War, or when the action hit the streets of downtown Harlem, Cloverfield, but overall the CGI appeared to be a vast improvement from its predecessor. <br/><br/>Overall, The Incredible Hulk was watchable. However, I did utter the words ""is that it"" after the lights in the cinema came back up  so it's safe to say that I was slightly underwhelmed by the whole experience. Maybe I was expecting a bit too much from a humble popcorn superhero flick, or alternatively, and more likely, maybe it simply wasn't that spectacular. Just average. Not good. Not great. In hindsight, maybe you need to see the Ang Lee version to really be able to appreciate The Incredible Hulk? Either way, if you love the character of The Hulk, love Ed Norton, or just love touching yourself to Liv Tyler in the dark, you could do a lot worse than drop your money on The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>Edit excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com"

The reason why I say that this movie is bland but unique is because its good and bad add up to take it right to the level of mediocrity. <br/><br/>When I saw the movie, ""Iron Man"", I was amazed by how it truly was a unique and un-average superhero pop corn flick, and seeing how the back of its DVD Box spoke of how it was as exhilarating as Iron Man I decided to give it a try. <br/><br/>The Film opens up in Rocinha while Edward Norton is searching for a cure for his strange (green) trouble. By this point in the film it does seem to have some promise, yet by The Battle at The Culver University Campus that hope of uniqueness begins to fade away. <br/><br/>Also, I'd like to take a section of this review to a bothering problem of the film and that is Mr. Blue, aka The Professor. This character is acting as a jumpy old professor but is dressed in a T-Shirt and Jeans, and played by a man in his late Twenties or early Thirties. Therefore, this character is torn apart between to characteristics. <br/><br/>(Spoilers included in Next Paragraph)<br/><br/>Now this movie would have been possibly, and slightly above mediocrity if it wasn't for a disgraceful ending. Now, this ending consists of Robert Downey Jr. as his character in Iron Man speaking of a ""Team"". This ending feels like by the current point of disappointment, they plainly gave up on the fact that the movie as an original might stand up as an original and instead changed the movie to just an unreasonably long trailer for Marvels, ""Avengers"".<br/><br/>This movie does not stand up on its own as an original and will surely not be remembered but instead be replaced by yet another, hopefully more memorable Hulk popcorn flick."

","Comparisons are inevitable with Ang Lee's much-panned 2003 attempt at the story of the big green monster. So for the record, I think they come out about even, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>Lee's Hulk/Bruce Banner combo, as portrayed by Eric Bana, ended up more cartoonish, but ironically more complex. Leterrier's combo starring Ed Norton, on the other hand, is not only better rendered, but Norton just looks as if he was born to play Bruce Banner in 2008. He effortlessly modernises the character, infusing him with new age attributes like hoodies, back-packs and Brazilian martial arts, while retaining the quintessential intensity that transforms into rage just as Banner transforms into the Hulk.<br/><br/>I favoured Jennifer Connelly over Liv Tyler for the Betty Ross character, but William Hurt does make a great Thunderbolt Ross.<br/><br/>I can't really remember the villain in Ang Lee's version - something about ""daddy issues"", so Tim Roth's excellent descent into Abomination is a bona fide Marvel villain.<br/><br/>Stan Lee must be very happy (if not very wealthy) for two reasons: 1)because the Incredible Hulk, as immortalised in this movie, continues to be one of the most adored stalwarts of the Marvel universe, and 2) because even though ""The Dark Knight"" recently beat down ""Spiderman"" as king of the box office, there is no doubt that it's the Marvel universe and not the D.C. one, that's filling out very nicely at a theatre near you."
