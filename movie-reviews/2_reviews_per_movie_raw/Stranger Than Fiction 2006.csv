"DonFishies","9","301","357","10 November 2006"," Helm's great screenplay and Ferrell's astonishing acting make for an excellent film
","I liked the idea of Stranger than Fiction from the start. And I still like the idea after having seen the film. I was not a big fan of all the huge press first-time screenwriter Zach Helm was getting, but in comparison to the ballooning publicity with Sascha Baron Cohen and Borat!, it was not too bad. I continually looked forward to seeing the film, and am glad that the great trailer did not reveal everything like I had originally assumed.<br/><br/>The film involves Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent who lives his life by a very strict routine. One day, he wakes up, and begins to hear a woman narrating all of his actions. Suspicious, Crick continues attempting to live his life out, but after an inexplicable comment in regards to his ""immenent death"", he goes on the hunt for the voice. Randomly spliced into Crick's search is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). She is writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick, and is unknowingly the voice Crick keeps hearing. She is battling a case of writer's block, and spends much of the film attempting to come up with the finale for the character.<br/><br/>Unlike many other existential comedies, Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Yes, the main focus of the film is pretty grim, but the life-altering questions that keep going around during the film do not become anywhere near as depressing and bizarre as those found in the likes of the work of Charlie Kaufman. In a way, Fiction feels a lot like a Kaufman-written film, but lacking in the means of being totally ""out there""; almost like being a decaf as opposed to a regular. As a result, while being an excellent film (albeit slightly predictable), it cannot break past the mold already set by the likes of the absolutely brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It just feels like it is missing that spark that could have sprung it right into the brilliance that all films like this strive for.<br/><br/>Going along with the story itself, it feels a little ill-paced in some few instances, but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. It has many comedic elements, and has some great dramatic sequences as well. They all play well, and while I still would not give him a ton of credit, I was very impressed by Helm's first-time effort. His writing feels vibrant and fresh, and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought, it is just great that movies like this slip through and get green-lighted. Every piece of dialogue and background feels well expressed, and just play out astonishingly well. On the topic of Crick however, I liked the idea of how neurotic and obsessive Crick was over numbers, but I thought it was a bit of an overkill to include special effect shots showing the numbers being counted within his head. It felt silly in The Da Vinci Code, so why did Sony feel the need to add it here too? <br/><br/>On that note, much like my being impressed by Adam Sandler from time to time, Ferrell really pulls through here, and does give the best performance of his short career. The psychological trauma that his character goes through is evident in his facial and body emotions, and the way he conveys it on screen is nowhere near what I would have expected. He brings an amazing sense of what this character is really about, and gives him a poignancy that makes him so life-like that it becomes almost too great to explain. This is a pathetically sad man who you cannot help but pull for as the film goes on. And for all the right reason too. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie, but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Thankfully this means that he stays serious for the most part throughout the film, and does not let any Ricky Bobby or Ron Bergundy slip out. He could have easily blown it, but thankfully, manages to stay in check.<br/><br/>Thompson is another particular standout, especially in contrast to Ferrell. She is broken and weak, searching for the perfect ending. The pain and sorrow that goes through her face as she writes and thinks has a poetic excellence to it, and she only continues to prove how good of an actor she is. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah work well in supporting roles, supporting Ferrell and Thompson respectively as the film progresses on. Hoffman has always had great comedic timing, and he does not let it go to waste here. He plays right off of Ferrell in grand ways, and just feels totally at home in the role. Latifah, while not in the film so much, is very good in her bit parts. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here, and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future.<br/><br/>For its small problems, Fiction still is able to prove its worth, and is clearly one of the best films of the year. It will be able to stand proud among the other entries in the existential comedy genre, or just stand proud on its own. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. And sure beats some of the crap that's been released over the past few weeks.<br/><br/>9/10."
"WriterDave","8","216","259","19 November 2006"," Detailed, Astute, Eclectic, and Entertaining Pseudo-Comedy
","""Stranger than Fiction"" is the complex tale of a simple IRS man named Harold Crick (an appealing Will Ferrel) who one day awakes to his own voice-over narration only to find he is the unwitting main character in the new tragic novel from acclaimed author Karen Eiffel (an excellent return to form for Emma Thompson). Imagine a Charlie Kaufman penned film where all the cynicism and nihilism is replaced with an endearing and heartfelt melancholy that creates a surprising amount of emotional involvement in characters who would've otherwise been over-reaching literacy devices, and you'll get a feel for the sincere type of entertainment Marc Forster's film provides.<br/><br/>Forster, with his keen eye and eclectic visual sense, populates the film the sharp and contrasting visual angles, camera tricks, and in-frame oddities (like the play with numbers) constantly keeping the viewer engaged and on their toes. Fun supporting turns from Dustin Hoffman as a literary theorist employed by Krick to help find out if the story he is in is a comedy or tragedy, and Queen Latifah as Eiffel's no-nonsense publishing assistant help guide the viewers through imaginative stretches that are occasionally too clever by half. Ferrel gets to show some nice range here, and much like Robin Williams did with ""The World According to Garp"" and Jim Carrey did with ""The Truman Show,"" graduates with honors into more high-minded quasi-serious roles. His co-lead Thompson is subtly method and well studied as the reclusive sociopathic author who just can't help killing her characters.<br/><br/>What really seals the deal is Maggie Gyllenhal as Farrell's love interest, the anti-establishment baker he is assigned to audit. She literally lights up the screen. There's one expertly framed and perfectly lit shot of her standing outside her townhouse inviting Farrel in for the night where the light from street lamp off screen is filtered in through the shadows of tree branches and hits her face in such a way that in that brief flickering frame you become insanely happy to be watching such a pleasant marriage of literary concepts inside a visual medium. At this point you don't care how the film ends. You're just grateful to experience that giddy moment of pure movie entertainment."

","This movie was such a great surprise! I saw this at an advanced screening just days after suffering through Marie Antoinette. What a pleasant escape! The cast did an outstanding job. Who doesn't love Will Ferrell, but to see him in this role gives me a whole new level of respect for him as an actor. He simply shines on screen! Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight. Emma Thompson is brilliant as always. Simply wonderful! The writing was terrific. It was so nice to see a movie that could make you laugh and think (not too hard) at the same time. Direction was well done as well - it was even visually appropriate.<br/><br/>Go see it and take a friend. You will laugh and be happy for a change after leaving a movie."
"Chris_Docker","8","109","138","9 December 2006"," Clever intellectual wizardry
","What if you only realised the importance of your life only days before you lost it? Even knowing when or how you will die (not such a fatuous idea with the completion of the Genome Project) raises difficult questions about how much we really want to know about ourselves.<br/><br/>Such a theme is usually simplified and subsumed into religious-based tales such as It's a Wonderful Life, but taken as an idea in its own right it has considerable intellectual weight. Harold Crick finds himself the main character in a story as it unfolds, but his annoyance quickly shifts gear as he is aware of the author saying, ""Little did he know . . . it would lead to his imminent death.""<br/><br/>Not the mindless comedy that the trailer suggests, Stranger Than Fiction is a precise and fairly cerebral story where the laughs stem more from individually appreciating certain aspects of its cleverness rather than any contrived humour. <br/><br/>The surface story is of a man who lives a humdrum if 'successful' life and is awakened to a more three dimensional existence by falling in love. The additional elements will either delight or annoy. IRS auditor Crick (Will Ferrell) starts hearing a voice in his head. It is that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a famous author. She describes exactly what he is doing but with a rather better vocabulary than he possesses. When she announces his imminent death, he takes drastic steps to meet her and persuade her to change the ending of her novel.<br/><br/>The characterisation, casting and acting is spot-on. Thompson is at her most refreshingly deranged as the harassed and reclusive author. With a literary equivalence of method acting, Eiffel balances on the edge of her desk trying to imagine the thoughts of someone about to make a suicide jump. She sits in the freezing drizzle watching cars cross a bridge to imagine an accident. Her rants at her 'editorial assistant' (who uses more traditional methods of accessing imagination) give a convincing insight into the creative process. While the voice in Crick's head is stereotypical Thompson, the fuller, isolated character, when we meet her, is a minor revelation. ""I don't need a nicotine patch,"" she declaims angrily to her assistant. ""I smoke cigarettes.""<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal, as law drop-out turned baker Ana Pascal, sparkles, glows and is sexily alluring and radiant with passionate love of life - and she manages to light up the screen faster than, say, even Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. Dustin Hoffman has the least challenging of the main parts, but he endows his character (an eminent professor of literature) with the gravitas needed to take ideas of literary interconnectedness seriously. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable break-out performance in a straight role, reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. He is superbly suited to the part as audiences expect him to be a shallow comedy character and here he is trying the find the substantial person inside himself. Most of the audience are concentrating so much on the film's intricate hypothesis and how it is worked out, that only afterwards do we realise what a range of emotions Ferrell has to portray with complete seriousness.<br/><br/>Novelist Kay Eiffel (Thompson) anthropomorphises things like Crick's watch (similarly the official website says, in real time, ""As the cursor waited anxiously for the site to load, it couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of elation."") We sense a life-imbuing process that might even be likened to what an actor does with his character; but the film goes a stage further by drawing a similarity with the essentially lifeless, clockwork existence of the IRS auditor whose only escape is discovering love with Pascal. His quest is aided by fictional plot analysis from Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) and of course begs the question, what is fiction?<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster showed consummate skill in portraying the positive escapism of JM Barrie's creative Peter-Pan-writing in Finding Neverland. With Stranger Than Fiction, he has teamed up with brilliant new dramatist Zach Helm. Helm is fascinated with the writing process in what he calls a larger Post-Modern movement. ""From Pirandello, to Brecht, to Wilder, to Stoppard, to Woody Allen to Wes Anderson, we can see the progression of a contemporary, self-aware, reality-bending and audience-involving wave in dramatic literature,"" he says. ""I love to see Homer Simpson reacting to his creator, Matt Groenig, or the cast of 'Urinetown' complaining from the stage about their own title.""<br/><br/>Even the street names, business names, and the characters' last names of Stranger Than Fiction are significant  Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians who focused on the innate order of things. The invitation is to ask what is beyond the symmetry of things. <br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction meets even its most formidable challenge - making the ending nail-biting and moving after such surreal content. But the ultimate message of the film seems a little trite if it is supposedly coming from a groundbreaking author. Like the glimpses of Eiffel's book, we are given impressive mountains of style but little substance. As the film doesn't press the strengths forcefully by admitting in so many words what it is getting at, there is a chance you may not bother with the subtleties - in which case it adds up to very little.<br/><br/>A superb testament to inventiveness and worthy of awards in many different categories, Stranger Than Fiction somehow falls short of being a masterpiece."
"grissomsbutterfly1013","10","246","324","10 September 2006"," TIFF Screening
","Saw it at The Toronto International Film Festival and it was well done. Original storyline, fantastic performance from Ferrel, Thompson and Hoffman. The most moving performance from Will Ferrel I have ever seen is within this film. The storyline some may believe to be too far fetched at first to take seriously, but in the end it does work. What makes the film work the most are the brilliant performances from Ferrel and Thompson. Without these two- the film couldn't have been pulled off! I recommend this flick to anyone looking to laugh and cry and then laugh again. It was a truly brilliant film. 10/10 (Hoffman and Ferrel were too kind to shake hands and greet the fans inside the screening as well.)"

","Fantasy movie, a la ""Groundhog Day"" where a man, Harold Crick in this case, finds he has no control over his life....which leads to him really appreciate his life. Although the premise is clearly fantasy, the concept is intriguing and compelling.<br/><br/>Cast is terrific; those who usually over-act, e.g. Dustin Hoffman and Will Ferrell, play it lower-keyed and believable. Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Maggie Gyllenhall (and Tom Hulce, almost unrecognizable in a single scene)round out the excellent cast . <br/><br/>A feel-good movie, mostly comedy but with some tragic undertones.<br/><br/>Close to two hours but you won't be looking at your watch very often."
"imagineer99","7","123","163","9 November 2006"," Strangely Addicting
","With his unassuming eyes and sheepish, ""awe shucks!"" demeanor, Will Ferrell is quite simply the guy you root forthe eternal boy trapped in a gangly 6'3"" frame. Just a single look can make you giggle and smile so effortlessly that you're often unaware that you're actually doing it. It is with this notion that Stranger than FictionFerrell's first major foray into a theatrical world outside the realm of in-your-face frat boy sillinessjust makes sense. By surrounding Ferrell's charisma with a subdued, darkly comic script and a talented supporting cast, we get a film that is both fresh and heartfelt. <br/><br/>Directed by Marc Forster and penned by Zach Helm, Stranger than Fiction is an odd mix-mash, combining a standard comedy with existentialist ideas. Number crunching IRS agent and genuine loser, Harold Crick (Ferrell) one day wakes up to find his life being narrated word for word by burnt out writer Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Odd thing is, Eiffel is writing an actual book where Crick just happens to be the main character. To make matters worse, she plans on killing him off as soon as she can make it through a particularly arduous stretch of writer's block.<br/><br/>Originality is one thing that is absent from a majority of contemporary Hollywood pictures, so Fiction immediately gets points for simply trying something different. I suppose it's icing on the cake that the film is genuinely good. Crick, knowing that is death is imminent, begins to break out of his cloistered shell and to experience the fruits of his life. And, in the process he forms a bond with a tax breaking baker (Gyllenhal) and seeks advice from a literature professor, played by a particularly charming Dustin Hoffman <br/><br/>However, even though it is well intentioned, the execution isn't flawless. The romance that develops between Gyllenhal's outcast baker and Ferrell's strait-laced Crick doesn't feel entirely organic. We admire the relationship and smile at its sugar coated sweetness, but we don't necessarily believe their connection. It may taste good, but it doesn't exactly wash down smoothly. Neither, does the film's over reliance on reinforcing generic, ""Carpe Diem"" philosophies. Towards the second act, things do get sappy. Luckily, by the conclusion, the plot has bounced back to a wonderful limbo of both oddly comic and genuinely heartwarming moments.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, Stranger than Fiction, works. Like a good novel, Forster has fashioned something that is strange, stylistic, and unexpectedly inspiring. And, despite the chinks in its existentialist armor, that's surely something worth writing home about."
"alexander-se10","8","86","112","9 August 2006"," Choice against fate when fiction collides with reality.
","Stranger Than Fiction is a quirky black comedy about Harold Crick, an average man with a fascination and preoccupation for numbers, who discovers that he is apparently little more than a character in someone else's story and that the course of his life appears to have been scripted. Everything he does and thinks is narrated as he does and thinks it, so after the realisation that he's not actually going mad he tries to find out what is really going on.<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot - it had elements of similarly themed films where fictional worlds intersect and influence the real world and vice versa, such as The Hours and The Purple Rose Of Cairo. Yet it takes this concept in a new direction and touches on the philosophies of choice and fate - if the story of our lives is already written, can we change the script? Does knowing what the future holds influence our lives or are we just following a predestined course whatever we do? As you might expect Marc Foster gives good and capable direction and there are lots of elements of the film that were really very enjoyable. Some scenes are maybe drawn out too long, but for the most part he manages to keep the film flowing smoothly. The 'mathematical images' which beautifully illustrate the clockwork mind of Harold Crick are a great idea and reminiscent of the Ikea scene from Fight Club.<br/><br/>The acting on the whole was of an excellent standard. Will Ferrell's dry delivery was absolutely perfect for the role of a man with his fate in the hands of a seemingly unknown force. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah all give very respectable performances as does the relatively unknown Tony Hale. Yet I felt that the gem in this film had to be Emma Thompson's performance as the neurotic and fidgety author Kay Eiffel who seems to become increasingly unstrung as the film progresses.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to get to see a test screening of this film tonight. I was expecting a generic Hollywood romantic comedy yet the storyline was sufficiently quirky and engaging, and performances were superb, giving it a rightful place alongside other great modern black comedies."
"ElMaruecan82","9","12","13","24 March 2016"," Never underestimate the genuine appeal of reality
","What an imaginative and touching story! Marc Forster's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", written by Zach Snyder, is a movie that could have failed in so many aspects despite its creative premise, yet the story confidently moved forward, punctuated by clever, poignant and thought-stirring twists.<br/><br/>And Will Ferrell's performance is integral to the film's success because he plays a nuanced and extremely restrained character who contradicts the very comical premise of the film, as soon as we think this is going to be a fantasy-farce. This is even more pleasantly surprising as Ferrell is like the Bill Murray of his generation, a SNL alumni used to madcap comedies where he plays eccentric and one-liners-throwing characters. Here, he is Harold Crick, a meek and discreet IRS agent who lives under a steady routine guided by an electronic wristwatch.<br/><br/>The opening voice-over narration insists that nothing special ever happened to Harold Crick... for the simple reason that he's the one controlling his life and saw no reason whatsoever to make this change. He's no Truman Burbank or ""Fight Club"" Narrator; he likes the minimalist scope he gave to his life for twelve years (from his Spartan house to his by-the-book ethics). But who said we've got to make our own existential crisis? One day, a voice starts narrating Crick's thought as he's brushing his teeth, there's something literary in the disembodied (female) voice he hears, Cricks stops brushing his teeth, starts again, and then the voice describes his feeling at that point. We get it, it's the story of a character who hears the narrator, and this premise is exciting enough.<br/><br/>But there are reasons I mentioned Bill Murray or Jim Carrey in this review, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels like one of these clever concept movies (""Groundhog Day"" or ""The Truman Show"") but Ferrell plays the protagonist differently than Bill Murray as Phil Connors, and even Jim Carrey managed to be comical at times like giving a wink to the audience who needed at least one funny grin. Ferrell doesn't surrender to comedy no matter how comedic his situation gets, he plays his character as if something serious, like an illness, was happening. And this is a revelation, a proof that any actor, given the right story and direction, can go beyond the preconceived limits of his acting range. Adam Sandler gave me a similar impression in ""Click"" but the film wasn't as consistently good.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" never takes its originality for granted. The narration is only the starting point, we only hear it during crucial times, and it starts being a problem when the narrator is revealed to be omniscient, and explains that a simple act Crick just committed will lead to his imminent death. It is not the word 'death' that provokes a sudden outburst of angst, but 'imminent', tragedy material. When a voice that knows everything about you or your most hidden thoughts tells you that you're going to die, well, even the most Cartesian and sensible man will be likely to believe it.<br/><br/>Crick goes to a psychiatrist played by Linda Hunt, she diagnoses a case of schizophrenia but suggests him to ask a literature professor. Within the twisted premise of the story, this is implacably logical, so Crick goes to Pr. Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman. Detached and rational, Hilbert gives him homework. Crick must determine whether he is a comedic or tragic character, one that is governed by the continuity of life or the inevitability of death. Crick must test whether he controls his storyline (or not, like a tragic character) and then tries to do whatever he wants, if his death is so inevitable. At that point, we already forgot about the narrator, and the film gets closer in themes and tone to Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's masterpieces.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" made me realize why self-referential movies are so fascinating, they have something inherently human behind entertaining plots. And the core of the story is the sweet romance between Crick and a free-spirited tattooed tax-rebel baker played by Maggie Gylenhall. When he starts auditing her, you feel the attraction, but he can't reach her heart because he's stuck up to his job, and it takes time for him to finally allow her to reach him. The chemistry feels real as there's something authentic in their performances, Ana loves what she does, and Harold, governed by the necessity to give a meaning to his seemingly meaningless life, starts doing what he loves: playing guitar, developing friendship, pleasing himself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Ana falls in love with him and Crick thinks he might be in a comedy, until he finally sees the face behind the voice, it's author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who seems to be the one pulling the strings. The trick is that she always kills off her lead characters, and the trickiest part is that Crick's life is only depending on whether she decides to kill him off or not. She shares her mental block with her editor's employee (Queen Latifah) wondering about the perfect way to kill Crick, until she realizes that he exists. The film escalates to the level of mind-bending genius (a word that has been so overused for the likes of ""Inception"") when she gives Crick the manuscript. Hilbert reads it and considers it a masterpiece with his death being part of that greatness. And Crick reads it and agrees.<br/><br/>It all comes down to a simple question: should one die just because it makes a terrific ending? This is one of the greatest narrative tricks ever pulled on screen and an existential lesson. Crick gave his meaningless life a meaning (wasn't he laughing at ""The Meaning of Life"" in the theater?). Maybe life can be less flashy than its dramatized version, yet as 'disappointing' as the ending was story-wise, it was deeply moving and touching in the way we connected it to our reality and a little bit to fiction."

","I saw this film at the Chicago Film Festival opening last night. I went not knowing a thing about it in advance, and was pleasantly surprised. I'd suggest that people DON'T read specifics about this film before seeing it.<br/><br/>The story/script is fantastic - I'd be surprised if it didn't get nominated for the big original screenplay awards. It's interesting, funny, poignant, and quite charming, actually.<br/><br/>The casting in general is wonderful... As someone else said, Hoffman is perfectly understated... I'd never seen Maggie Gyllenhaal before, but I'm a fan after seeing this one. And Emma Thompson could see a best supporting actress nod for this film.<br/><br/>Sadly, I thought the film's weakest point was the casting of Will Ferrell in the lead. He's not bad by any means, but he just doesn't work at the same level as the rest of the cast. Kudos to him for what he DOES accomplish in this film, but it would've had plenty of starpower without him, and the role could've been used to showcase someone else's talent.<br/><br/>All in all, thumbs up.<br/><br/>Just my two cents."
"dtb","9","80","113","25 November 2006"," Helm and Forster: The New Kaufman and Jonze?
","I saw STRANGER THAN FICTION (STF) on its opening weekend, and I think it's one of the most engaging, funny, poignant movies about writing, the creative process, and human nature I've seen since ADAPTATION. While Will Ferrell is a fave in our household, I must admit this is the first time I've seen him in a movie and thought of him as the character he's playing, not as Will Ferrell. Toning down his screechy/crazy qualities without losing his ability to make audiences laugh, Ferrell stars as unassuming IRS agent Harold Crick, who loves his job, so you know his life needs an overhaul! :-) Even Harold's curly-topped sidewall haircut seems to hint that his well-ordered life is about to dissolve into craziness. One morning, it does, amid FIGHT CLUB-style captions and the plummy, ironic tones of a British female narrator accompanying Harold's thoughts and actions in the opening scene -- narration that Harold can hear along with those of us in the audience. Our increasingly puzzled, alarmed hero soon realizes he's the protagonist in a novelist's new book-in-progress -- not just any novelist, but the reclusive Karen ""Kay"" Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who's been suffering from writer's block for 10 years and whose novels always end with her protagonists dying! As Kay's publisher sends compassionate but no-nonsense troubleshooter Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to help unblock her, Harold seeks help from literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on the problematic author's favorite phrase ""Little did he know..."" It might be a subject especially dear to a writer's heart (especially in gags like Hilbert questioning Harold on standard literary devices to see if he's the hero of a comedy or a tragedy: ""Have you been invited to a country house and had to solve a murder?...To find out what story you're in, I have to find out what stories you're *not* in...""), but I found STF funny, touching, and playfully surreal as director Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm prove to be the new Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, only with a touch of sweetness. In addition to the excellent Ferrell, Hoffman, Thompson, and Queen Latifah, the great cast includes Linda Hunt and an all-but-unrecognizable Tom Hulce as well-meaning but unhelpful psychiatrists, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana, an anti-establishment baker who refuses to pay taxes on munitions (The Clash's ""Death or Glory"" plays in the background when Harold visits her bakery to audit her, only to be booed and heckled by Ana and her customers. Later, Harold wins Ana over by bringing her flours -- that's right, flours, not flowers! :-). There's nice location shooting in Chicago, too. STF is well worth heading out to a theater to see, and when it inevitably comes out on home video, it'll definitely be in the Writers' Movies section of my DVD collection alongside ADAPTATION, THE SINGING DETECTIVE, and the underrated ALEX AND EMMA!"
"Pavel-8","6","25","35","9 December 2006"," A missed opportunity for greatness.
","As the cinematic writing debut of Zach Helm, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" may very well have the most creative storyline of the year. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a nondescript IRS agent who awakes one day to hear a woman narrating much of his life. Unbeknownst to him at the time, the voice belongs to a well-known author who routinely kills her main characters in her novels. No big deal, except for the fact that he soon learns of his fate. That of course horrifies him, and he spends the majority of the film coping with that inevitability.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the lofty possibilities raised by such a fantastically original idea are never fully explored. ""Stranger"" doesn't take the time to delve into the life-and-death complexities that could arise from a man searching for the why and who behind his future demise. Nor does it address most of the unique moral questions and obligations that would arise. Instead the script settles for clichés like a typically rushed cinematic romance, premises that aren't all that bad, but are more suited to be side stories, not main arcs. These shortcomings glaringly keep Stranger from reaching the Oscar-winning level of something like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or other Charlie Kaufman work. In fact this movie might be best described as Diet Charlie Kaufman, a pop psychological movie, a thinking movie for those who don't really want to think.<br/><br/>As Adam Sandler did for ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Will Ferrell will no doubt receive heaps of praise for his portrayal of IRS agent Harold Crick. Make no mistake, Ferrell is fine, but don't let anyone convince you this is an Oscar-worthy turn. The simple fact that he plays it straight, without getting nearly naked or over-reacting doesn't automatically create a great performance. The reality is that while he has his moments, Ferrell is the straight man in this picture, a tepid character who contrasts well with Maggie Gyllenhaal's anarchist baker Anna, Dustin Hoffman's Yoda of literature professor, and Emma Thompson's work as author Kay Eiffel, which results in the best performance in the film. She lends the part a wackiness that seems genuinely fresh, in odd, unteachable ways like how she touches both sides of a door frame when passing. She acts crazy enough but not so crazy that you sense the acting as she neurotically haggles over how she can kill off her protagonist.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is like Anna's cookies. They both taste good at the time, as the movie does have its humorous and entertaining moments, but their long term value is limited due to their lack of nutrition. Nothing here is going to linger, but if you're interested, you won't be sorry you saw it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A missed opportunity, but still worth a rental or cheap theater ticket. 6 of 10."

I kind of look at Will Ferrell in this movie the way I looked at Adam Sandler after ""Punch Drunk Love"". You're not sure how to react to Ferrell/Sandler's on-screen persona's, as up to this point, you've always thought of them as the funny men, who couldn't (or wouldn't) attempt a more dramatic role. For Ferrell, who's probably at the height of his popularity, this was a good move for him, as well as an ideal role.<br/><br/>All in all, I really liked this movie, and I would definitely recommend it to friends/family."

Yes, the title to this movie is 100 percent accurate: ""Stranger Than Fiction really describes this bizarre tale of a man whose life is being lived out as a writer of fiction stories types it up.

Also, she narrates the story to the lead character, who is the only one who can actually hear her voice. Slowly, as the story unravels, her latest subject, a ""Harold Crick"" (Farrell) discovers what is going on and tries to get her to change the ending! Along the way, in a secondary part of the film (the romance angle), ""Crick"" becomes involved with the unlikeliest of women: ""Asa Pascal"" (Maggie Gyllenhall).<br/><br/>Crick also makes a new friend who is an expert on authors. He seeks him out because that guy, ""Professor Jules Hilbert,"" (Dustin Hoffman) is the one who helps him discover whom the author is, the person who plans to kill him off. (It's not easy to explain all of this in a handful of sentences, written off the cuff. Sorry.)<br/><br/>This all may sound like a suspenseful thriller but it isn't. It's a human-interest story which could have many interpretations. I read a few long reviews (not here) on this movie afterward and got two very diverse viewpoints: one with religious overtones and other totally secular. I didn't read anything into this except it being an interesting and original screenplay and well- acted.<br/><br/>Ferrell was outstanding in his performance. I'm not really a fan of his irreverent comedies but I was very impressed with him in this movie. The only unlikable character was Thompson's but she comes around with a nice touch near the end.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something different, and something to get your brain working a little bit, this is recommended. For those expecting the normal Will Ferrell wackiness, stay away: it's hardly that. I hate to use the cliché phrase ""thought-provoking,"" but I think it applies here."

","This is something of a failed project because the last two of the three acts are stunted.<br/><br/>The first act concerns our hero discovering that in addition to being 'real,"" he is a fictional character of a writer in the same reality.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, someone decided that this should be lengthened and exaggerated because of the comedic benefit. I am sure the project did not start out this way.<br/><br/>The second act is the most powerful in terms of the folding. Here we learn of the beauty of his independence, but that the book with his death is ""so beautiful"" that he really should die to preserve the beauty of the work. The laborious introduction of Hoffman's character in the first act is so that he can render this judgment. Its pretty powerful stuff, and after reading the book with his own death, our hero agrees.<br/><br/>The third act is a sort of resolution based on the realities of big movie requirements for a happy ending, with the guy getting the magnificently appealing girl. But its rushed and something of a mess. Its obviously grafted on. The narrative connections are broken; the rhythm is all wrong. While Emma's book is declared ""not very good,"" the movie is pulled the same way in an ultimate folding.<br/><br/>Well, I guess we should celebrate any sort of overt folding in films, even second-rate ones. <br/><br/>I have to remark that Hoffman is the best I have seen him since ""Rosencrantz.""

"seaview1","8","23","38","6 November 2006"," STRANGER THAN FICTION Life as Narrative
","Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland. In Stranger Than Fiction, he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality. It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars, Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. <br/><br/>IRS civil servant Harold Crick (Ferrell) leads a regimented, mundane existence, which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch. His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move. His daily rituals are altered and, when he audits a baker, a free spirited activist named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), he meets stiff resistance and hostility. Compelled to find the answers to the mysterious voice, he first consults the company shrink (Tom Hulce in a welcome, yet short performance), a therapist (Linda Hunt in too brief a role), and finally a literary professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman in bravura support). It is with Dr. Hilbert that Harold finds hope and a methodology to solve the puzzle of the narrative voice. <br/><br/>At the same time, famed author, Kay Eiffel, is trying to finish her latest novel about a taxman who is hearing voices. When she struggles to find a suitable end for her character (all her principal characters are killed off in her books), a publisher's assistant arrives in the name of Penny Escher (Queen Latifah wasted in a pedestrian part). Harold visits Ana for a followup audit and becomes smitten and attracted by her perky charm. As he audits her maze of disorganized tax documents, Ana begins to feel bad for the poor soul and gives him a sort of peace offering of homemade cookies, and thus their relationship grows. His visits with Dr. Hilbert begin to narrow the possible sources of his affliction until one day he stumbles on the answer and in doing so, he realizes that his life is predestined. His life out of kilter, Harold begins to break out of his quiet shell and experience life's interesting aspects. Kay's mental block soon gives way and when she finishes her novel and is ready to type the manuscript, Harold tracks her down using some creative ingenuity. She too has realized some incredible connection between her story and his real life. When Dr. Hilbert reads the final manuscript, his conclusions are a stunner to Harold. How Harold and Kay respond to this is what winds the film to a tense conclusion. <br/><br/>The dialogue is funny at times and always interesting. There are traces of other films like Groundhog Day, Field of Dreams or an episode of The X Files that will come to mind. The movie touches on the concepts of fate and destiny without being too obvious-perhaps it should have been more obvious come to think of it. Do we control our lives or are we part of some other plan or manuscript (like The Matrix)? The concept of 'cause and effect' and of randomness figures heavily in the overall theme of the film. <br/><br/>Harold is a sort of distant cousin to Forrest Gump complete with an innocent perspective on life. His character works because his persona changes throughout the film and when he faces his fears and desires head on, his life begins to move forward in ways he never imagined. He is starting to live life. And when he finds out his fate, he makes a big decision that brings his character full circle. <br/><br/>Harold's watch becomes a kind of supporting character, as it serves as a catalyst for him and Ana to bond, but it is used too sparingly at times. There is a slight feeling that the filmmakers did not have enough confidence in the fantasy part to match the reality which is well done. Too bad, as the film steadily progresses in its story and etches some interesting characters. It also gets a bit confusing as to why a couple of characters pop in and out briefly, and you know it's for some reason that becomes more evident by the climax.<br/><br/>The movie is at its best when Harold warms up to Ana, and the two begin a courtship that is affecting and genuine. In this, Gyllenhaal and Ferrell shine. Will Ferrell has always been a dependable comic from his Saturday Night Live years, but here, he successfully portrays a shy, passive man complete with blank expressions and awkward body language. Hoffman has his most significant role in years since his brief but memorable turn in Foster's previous Finding Neverland. And Gyllenhaal proves adept as a romantic lead.<br/><br/>Forster is becoming a modern day teller of fables. In Stranger Than Fiction he spins a simple tale (written by Zach Helm) of love, life, and fate with a moral that is redemptive and refreshing. Not everyone will connect with this film; I suspect that the romantics out there will."
"Janky_Wank","10","16","25","7 January 2007"," One of the best films I have seen in a long time
","This movie is billed as a comedy in trailers and it's choice of cast supports this idea. The fact is this movie is one of the most tear jerking movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie starts out with a humorous tone similar to READING ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gallaxy"" and slowly you start to feel for the main characters and understand how sad they are. Unlike a great deal of movies that are sad this one does not deliver a punch at the end to get the viewers crying. It starts much earlier.<br/><br/>I spent most of my time fighting off tears while watching this movie but I could not tear myself away. It took me a bit to recover after the end and all I could say is ""Wow.""<br/><br/>The casting for this movie could not have been any better. Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson all delivered some of the best acting seen for years. Will Ferrell in particular has followed many comedy actors like Robin Williams and proves that he is more than a slapstick joker.<br/><br/>This movie needs some awards, big time. I personally would give this Best actor - Will Ferrel and Best Screenplay."
"carlo_simone18","7","3","3","7 May 2018"," Solid if unspectacular
","Overall, this was a fairly enjoyable effort from director Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm. The most satisfying aspect of it was Will Ferrell's grounded and restrained performance as Harold Crick which seems like a breath of fresh air compared to his usual over-the-top antics in certain comedies. The acting across the board was pretty strong with Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal as the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The theme of appreciating life and living it to the fullest is one I felt was explored with the correct amount of nuance, whilst seeing Crick descend into a nervous breakdown due to his life being narrated as part of author Karen Eiffel's story is quite interesting. <br/><br/>However, I do have some problems with the film, mainly due to how the moral implications of Eiffel potentially having killed real people with her writing are not really explored, and the philosophical side of the narrative that could have emerged is not brought up really. Also the romance that builds between Crick and Ana Pascal doesn't grow organically for me.<br/><br/>In the end this was a fairly enjoyable comedy-drama that I would recommend."
"GreyHunter","6","5","6","6 October 2019"," It's an enjoyable if not brilliant movie
","While I enjoyed this movie, a couple reservations held me back:<br/><br/>1) The ""writing"" we're exposed to via V.O. is distinctly average. If I'm feeling even moderately unkind, I'd call it mediocre. To me, this is not something to overlook when the entire plot revolves around the supposed brilliance of the author, including the fact that her novel was apparently so important to literary canon that it is worth a human (however he might have come into being) life. Which brings me to point two...<br/><br/>2) The professor is a psychopath. The assistant, Penny, isn't much better. The professor not only makes the argument that Crick has to die for literature (notice he isn't arguing that the boy needs to be saved, and even if he did, there's no inexorable or inarguable reason the story has to put the boy in danger in order for Harold to die) but he actively tries to convince Harold that his life is worthless compared to the ending of some novel (that, as I noted above, wasn't particularly well-written.) Hilbert demonstrates absolutely no sympathy toward Harold's situation at the end. He doesn't even pretend to care about Harold's desire to live. Penny, while not as vociferously psychopathic as Hilbert, also demonstrates a certain amount of lack of sympathy. Her only concern is that the book be finished and that her bosses at the publishers be pleased. And Harold himself gives up far too easily. Sure, he sees it as saving the boy, but is he really too stupid to explore alternatives that don't require an either/or self-sacrifice?<br/><br/>Eiffel is the only one in that group that acts like a normal, sane human being. She understands the full potential horror and the awful implications that the news of Harold's existence raises. She agonizes not only over Harold's death, but over the possibility that she might have already killed at least 8 other living, self-aware and decent human beings. That, to me, was the most compelling aspect of this movie. I mean, yeah, Harold and Ana made a nice couple and I could get behind that. But the mental trial of Karen Eiffel were by far the most fascinating plot thread.<br/><br/>All in all, though, if you don't think too deeply, it's a mild, unoffensive movie to kill a couple hours. Just try your best to keep your mind in autopilot, because once you start paying close attention, it's hard to ignore the unexplained processes for how the narrator/character dynamic works, and the borderline psychopathic moral of the story toward the end."
"kaethe","5","21","36","11 November 2006"," Brilliant concept, disappointing execution
","The premise for this film excited me; at first glance, I even thought it might have been a Charlie Kaufman screenplay. (No, turns out it's by a first-time screenwriter. Inspired by Charlie Kaufman, perhaps?) The trailer reassured me that there was hope for an original story and an enjoyable movie experience. I commented that the trap to avoid here would be the ""hero discovers how meaningless his life is and undergoes a transformation into a new, more interesting person"" cliché; if the filmmakers could avoid that and give us some original character development, we might just have a great film.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed to report that they did not avoid that trap. True, the transformation wasn't quite as over-the-top as it is in some films, but it did rely heavily on ever-greater interaction with the love interest, a more casual wardrobe, a hip song performance, and a handful of other overused vehicles that scream ""Look at me! I'm a character with an ARC!"" Beyond that, the characters lacked the kind of likability it usually takes to rally the audience behind their development anyway. When the success of a story hinges on the audience caring about whether the hero lives or dies, the audience had better want him to live. Instead, I felt resigned to the idea that he might die and idly interested in what might happen next. In other words, the filmmakers never really reached me.<br/><br/>The dryness of the humor, the attempts at stylish special effects, the offbeat nature of the story, the pacing of it all -- these are all hallmarks of films I love and should have been an easy ""in"" for the filmmakers with a viewer like me. Instead, I found myself bored by the cloying attempts to merely imitate great films rather than to invent something truly new and original.<br/><br/>For example, the side plot involving Emma Thompson as the novelist and Queen Latifah as her seen-it-all assistant sent by the publisher was as tired as it was tiresome. Emma Thompson was, as usual, more than competent in her role, but to what end? Even she couldn't elevate the quality of this effort.<br/><br/>And however refreshing it should have been to see Will Ferrell take on a role with more substance than he had to work with in, say, Anchorman or Bewitched, the material here too often gave him miserably little to work with. The audience is left watching Ferrell brush his teeth while we have the nagging sense it's supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>It should be noted that I saw this film in a theater that must have been full of forgiving Ferrell fans, because there were titters at many of these awkward, un-funny, mundane scenes. If you're a die-hard Ferrell fan, maybe it's worth the price of admission to laugh at Ferrell as he ties his necktie and brushes his teeth. If you're a more casual fan of Ferrell's, you might want to wait and rent this one. And if you're Ferrell-ambivalent, give this a miss."
"brefane","5","16","27","23 November 2006"," Less than meets the eye
","Essentially trite whimsy. Ferrel is appropriate enough, the rest of the cast is appealing and the film is amusing and quirky: It's all those words reviewers love to use... but, after the first hour I began to wonder where it's all going. The premise is interesting, if unoriginal, and the set design etc... all cleverly done (the bakery shop's window is designed like a watch) but, the film ultimately doesn't deliver and unravels at the point it should come together. A build up to something that doesn't come off and a descent into a feel good bit of whimsy:the film equivalent of cookies and milk. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for a new generation.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is one of those movies people say has to be seen twice to fully understand and/or appreciate, unfortunately, I don't think the film is worth a second look. However, if you're a fan of the actors involved and/or films like PROVIDENCE,THE TRUMAN SHOW, ADAPTATION,...it's worth a look. Individual scenes work nicely but, ultimately, the film disappoints, and evaporates in the memory. As a puzzle it has too many pieces and it's not worth putting together."

","Marc Forster, a man whose work we have admired before, has scored a major triumph with ""Stranger Than Fiction"". It helps he decided to tackle the amazing screen play that Zach Helm wrote for this project. Both men show to compliment one another in a winning film that unfortunately suffered at the box office. It's hard to imagine how the movie didn't attract more people because it deserves a viewing from anyone that considers to be a cinema fan. Part of the blame seems to be the perception that the lead actor, Will Farrell, was expected to deliver a character that was funny like most of the ones he had given in other vehicles.<br/><br/>Harold Crick is a man so meticulous he even counts the brush strokes he applies to his teeth every time he cleans them. He seems to be the right person for an IRS inspector. He is a joyless man whose life is numbers and audits. He has an incredible mind for multiplication, and yet, why is his life the mess it is? When Harold begins hearing the voice that seems to be narrating his life, he unravels. Harold decides to consult experts to try to help him getting to the bottom of what he is experiencing. Alas, the professionals he consults, never can give him an answer. It's only when he stumbles into a university professor who, upon hearing a phrase Harold has heard in his mind, to interest Prof. Hilbert to come to aid him.<br/><br/>It is at this time that one gets to realize that Harold Crick is a character out of the fiction of a reclusive writer, Karen Eiffel, a woman whose distinction is the ability to kill all her main characters in the novels she writes. The problem is that Karen is suffering from an acute problem of writer's block. In fact, she doesn't know how to kill this Harold Crick, who becomes her obsession. Karen Eiffel's life is a mess. Not even when Penny Escher comes to help her get out of her rut can she get out of her funk.<br/><br/>Harold, who finds himself losing the control he has always possessed, is rendered helpless when he goes to do an audit on Ana Pacal, a young woman who owes the IRS and refuses to file a return. Little by little, Harold comes to depend on his meetings with Ana, who in turn, sees all the goodness in the man she started hating. It's when Harold discovers he has found love that he decides to fight for his life and decides to confront the woman who seems to be pulling the strings that make him be who he is.<br/><br/>Will Farrell makes a wonderful contribution to the film. Like other comic actors, Mr. Farrell has to play against type in order to show his talent. This versatile actor should play more serious roles and break out of the mold his career was up to this point. Emma Thompson's Karen Eiffel is one of her best creations. She captured the world in which the author she portrays inhabits. Dustin Hoffman adds another layer of texture to the film with his Professor Hilbert. Maggie Gylenhaal seems to be a natural for the sunny Ana Pascal. Queen Latifah plays Penny Escher effortlessly. She's a marvelous addition in any film. Others seen in minor roles are Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce who do wonders with their small contributions.<br/><br/>Roberto Schaefer's cinematography offers a wonderful view of the Chicago where the film is supposed to take place. Ultimately it's Marc Forster for bringing all the elements together in this sunny and positive film."

","I found myself staring at the screen in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and waiting for something imaginative to happen. And it never did. I found myself daydreaming about how hysterical the outtakes must have been between such strong performers as Ferrell, Hoffman, Latifah, Thompson, and Gyllenthaal. But I sensed no magic. Now there are those who have praised this film as a mind bending experience akin to ""The Truman Show"", or ""Adaptation"". Whatever. Those were films that delighted their audience while challenging concepts of movie watching. It is not too smart, come on. Did the bakery anarchist need to drop out of HARVARD LAW SCHOOL for us to respect her? Amateurish. And Director Marc Forster paints his images in sepia dreary browns and rainy days. The professor MUST be a PROFESSOR because he drinks lots of coffee and has lots of books. The writer must be a WRITER because she chain smokes and thinks of DEATH. And poor Queen Latifah must have been standing around holding her umbrella wondering how she got in this boring movie in role that has her playing a modernized mammy. I blame a wasted two hours of my Saturday night on Marc Forster who did great work in the past, but here strived for something that didn't happen. Who hires Will Ferrell, puts min in a surreal comedy and asks him to act dull and boring the entire time? I hope others don't go see this film looking for a Will Ferrell comedy in a Charlie Kaufman script because they will be sadly disappointed."

","I never thought I'd see Emma Thompson in a role that made me dislike her, but this film did it. She plays a rude, neurotic novelist who seems compelled to treat people badly without reason. Dustin Hoffman is similarly irritating as a lordly literary don who, despite Ferrell's request for help, seems bored and too busy to really give a damn about whether the troubled IRS auditor lives or dies. An added irritant: Hoffman doesn't make a move without a coffee cup or coffee pot in his hand (coffee swilling has become the successor to the compulsory cigarette smoking of the older movies).<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal is fetching as the love interest, but I liked her a lot more in the first half - when she was giving Ferrell a hard time - than later when she falls for him and turns into a fawning teen-ager. <br/><br/>If the novelist did indeed have the power to determine the fate of Ferrell, she surely chose a cruel and painful alternative to actually killing him off. <br/><br/>This film tried to be clever, inventive and message-laden, but to me it pretty much failed."

","Nobody likes Harold Crick.<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent who is a genius at math. If someone shoots two numbers at them, he will multiply them instantly with the correct answer. He has a wristwatch that he depends on everything for. He wakes up, gets on the bus to go to work, and falls asleep all at precise times down to the second that if he misses, his day will be forever messed up. His schedule repeats every single day of his life. Oh yeah, and Harold hears voices too. It's almost as like someone is narrating his dull life...not telling him what will happen, but what already happened. This voice comes and goes at seemingly random times. One day Harold is re-setting his wristwatch after it randomly shut off while waiting for the bus when the voice says ""Little did he know, this simply seeming innocent act would result in his imminent death."" When Harold hears this, he begins to fear his death obsessively. But he is not sure what to do.<br/><br/>It turns out the voice is real. It is the voice of author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who has a bad case of writer's block and a heavy addiction to smoking. She is writing a new novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick who is very good with numbers. Little did SHE know, Harold Crick was a real person, and just by writing the book, she was controlling his life. Oh yeah, and she wanted to kill off Harold in the book at the end. Fortunately, her writer's block makes the voices Harold hear go away temporarily, and he lives his life in his control. This drives her to hire the expert writer's assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish the book and kill Harold Crick.<br/><br/>Harold sees a psychiatrist who recommends him to the acclaimed English literature expert Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to find out if this voice--who they don't know is a real author writing a real book about Harold--is trying to write a comedy, or a tragedy. So Harold begins to keep track of issues in his life to find out. In the meantime, Harold falls helplessly in love with a young woman who works at a bakery (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he just happens to be auditing. As you can probably guess, issues revolving around that ended up around the ""tragedy"" column.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is by far one of the best films of 2006, and I think Will Ferrell's best film yet. The acting is phenomenal: Will Ferrell is in his best role EVER. Emma Thompson is spectacular and soars above many of her other roles in her incredibly realistic portrayal of an author with writer's block. Maggie Gyllenhaal and legend Dustin Hoffman do a fantastic job as well.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction has one of the most unique stories I've ever seen, if not THE most unique. I was SHOCKED after watching this to know this was completely ignored by the Academy, including a Best Original Screenplay award that would've totally locked sabers with Little Miss Sunshine. Hell, this is one of the most original screenplays I've ever had the pleasure of watching. You won't believe your eyes and ears that someone can actually write a movie like this. I'd say underrated with a capital U.<br/><br/>There's not much more I can say except RENT THIS MOVIE NOW. A film like this simply cannot be missed out on. You will not be disappointed."
"mattster5","8","8","13","24 November 2006"," Theological Symbolism?
","Did anyone else see strong theological symbolism in this? I admit I see theological symbolism in most things because I'm a theology student, but it seems a little too clear in this case to be accidental. The author is a pretty clear God character - omnipotent (at least in relation to Crick), unreachable/reclusive, etc. <br/><br/>Hoffman's character is a sort of loose Schleiermacherian Jesus figure, who is merely human himself but can direct Ferrell to ""God."" Still, it is a step that Ferrell actually takes himself. It is also interesting that Hoffman does not actually know the God figure, yet is respectful. His role as a lifeguard is also interesting, but perhaps most interesting is that in the end he is rooting for Crick to die. This may make him more of a bodhisattva figure, and there is other evidence for this, but this view also would not be inconsistent with a typical Hollywood portrayal of the Jesus figure.<br/><br/>Finally, Crick's conversion, which seems to me to be the point of the movie, is also fascinating. It bears some marks of Buddhist self denial, yet his conversion doesn't result in peaceful release but a new zest and appreciation for ""banal"" existence, it is a transformation rather than a release. There is also the imagery of the apple, which seems like a fairly strong reference to the Garden of Eden. His life before he meets the God figure is just preparation to die, but it becomes meaningful (even retroactively meaningful) after he submits to ""God's"" plan (which is objectively good) and ""God"" mercifully saves him. It is interesting, however, that he comes to ""God,"" rather than the other way around. Partly because of this, Crick also makes a sort of Jesus figure himself, especially in his sacrifice, which causes ""God"" to relent (she even changes to a gentler appearance). This sacrifice also notably spares another human being. If you look at it this way, Hoffman then becomes a kind of Holy Spirit figure.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a fascinating and enjoyable look at life, death, and fate. I think the structure primarily relies on Christian imagery, but you could make a case for Buddhism as well. I will definitely watch it again. I still haven't entirely figured out the role of the watch."
"MalcolmJTaylor","7","8","13","21 November 2006"," Dramatic success eludes Charlie Kaufman clone
","In spite of ""Stranger Than Fiction's"" several charming scenes, especially those between Maggie Gyllenhaal and Will Ferrell, it ultimately underwhelms with its own insignificance.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" does not leave the viewer with any lasting impression. It feels like a Wal-Mart version of a Charlie Kaufman film, metaphysics for the masses if you will. Kaufman's masterworks: ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are arguably as influential to modern film-making as ""Pulp Fiction"". And they are all light-years ahead of this film. Which is simply derivative without delivering anything new to audiences.<br/><br/>This Kaufman-lite for the faint of heart who don't want to watch anything too psychologically revealing has the potential to be much more than what it is: a light hearted stroll through the unconscious mind, with little more than a blue bird on its shoulder. Unfortunately for film-lovers, it never goes beyond its goal of converting audiences into happy movie-goers.<br/><br/>Although Ferrell is entertaining through out, it is Gyllenhaal who resonates in this film with a magnetic performance as a counter-culture baker. Dustin Hoffman also seems lost here in the role of a cutesy professor adding bits of schtick, as if it were left to him to pick up the comedic slack left by Ferrell. Emma Thompson's writer's blocked author suits the role well, but is the character most clipped by a gutless script. The appearance of Queen Latifa as her strict, corporate ""unblocker"" is bland and out-of-place in this film.<br/><br/>In terms of leading dramatic performances by a comic actor, the hat is tipped to Jim Carrey's work in ""...Spotless mind"". His performance in that film is a full-blown dramatic characterization. Whereas Ferrell's dead pan attempt at ""serious"" acting is just that. It always feels like a comedian playing straight, rather than an actor realizing a character."
"jessup-86446","10","2","2","12 April 2020"," This movie is a balm for the pessimistic.
","As the years have gone on I have come to realize that this, not the original Star Wars, is my favorite movie. And, having just re-watched it for the umpteenth time, I decided it was high time I left a review somewhere.
I am a cynical person, I don't believe in a lot, I don't believe in love at first sight, or the power of the human spirit, or in humanity in general really.
My brother tells me that makes me a misanthrope, and I don't disagree.
If I sit down to watch Star Wars for example, I can't help but loudly and frequently pick apart its many flaws: the hammy acting from the extras, the dated special effects, the story as a whole, yadda yadda.
But every. single. time. I sit down to watch Stranger than Fiction I find it akin to slipping my aching body into a warm bath after a looong day, my jaded personality submerging beneath the gentle and comforting weight of the familiar story.
Will Farrell is a clown most days, making such masterpieces as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby (that was sarcasm), but in this movie he stands shoulder to shoulder with cinematic giants like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and he SHINES as Harold Crick, his performance subtle and low key, but poignant and introspective.
This of course stands in contrast to Maggie Gyllenhaal's 'Miss Pascal': so vibrant and full of life, with a kind and warm personality that is undiminished by an occasionally fiery temper. Whenever she comes on screen with her passion and femininity I can't help but empathize with Harold, because with each touch and sigh from Maggie I inevitably want her as badly as he does.
The two of them coming together is like that bath we talked about, or a hug from someone you love after far too long apart. But setting aside the love interest, the story itself is so much fun to experience: that of a character who is not supposed to know about his impending demise, yet does, and how that knowledge spurs him to embrace his life, however long it shall be.
Sentimental? Absolutely. So what?
10 Stars. People more cynical then myself will throw shade at this film, and I strongly urge them to go and eat a cookie."

","The wonderful and disarmingly tender ""Stranger Than Fiction"" marries an inspired concept and a wisely goofball-avoidant script with some of the better actors this or any modern dramedy could hope to assemble.<br/><br/>As Harold Crick, Will Ferrell inhabits his best role since ""Elf."" Crick is a poster child for OCD introversion, fixated on observing rigid routines and numerical drivers as a means by which to structure his own life -- he counts the strokes when brushing his teeth, and as an IRS employee, his mind is populated by large mathematical formulas he then leverages in his chronic over-arrangement. True to life, his obsession with regimentation comes at the expense of meaningful relationships with other humans. But the catalytic story driver to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" arrives with the revelation that Harold is in fact a book character; a development he only learns of once his head starts hearing the play-by-play narration of his daily life as provided by the book's author, Kay Eiffel (the great Emma Thompson). It's a curveball concept seemingly all-too-ripe for wacky, exploitative comedy, particularly with generationally magnificent comedic actor Ferrell as its hood ornament. But the creative team smartly steers clear of that easiness, directing the film instead in its pursuit of the truly touching: We're enthralled with Harold's resilience when he seeks counsel from a literary professor (wonderfully embodied by Dustin Hoffman) in an attempt to sort out whether his life's through-line is destined for the tragic or comedic. In a terrific plot twist, Harold's existential stumbling leads him to truly meaningful love, found in the warm-heartedness of a baker (the great Maggie Gyllenhaal at the height of her powers).<br/><br/>Of the many strengths of ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" its fantastical plot constructs smoothed for a mass audience is its arguable shining star. This is a highly intelligent film, and in so many ways, a refreshing and reinvigorating one. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)"

","I went and saw this against my better judgement. I had not yet seen a movie where Will Ferrell was the lead that I actually liked. I like him well enough in supporting roles, but I do not find his comedic style to be one with which I jive. Regardless of this, I found this movie to be well above par.
This is the story of Harold Crick, who while going about his life starts to hear someone narrating what he is doing. Determined to show that he is not going crazy, Harold does his best to figure out who is narrating his life, and why. Do not think that this movie is long on laughs, it is not. This is a more serious film, with a touch of romance thrown in. Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both great in their roles. This is a very well done movie with some very big name actors relegated to supporting roles."

"merri-3","3","20","42","1 March 2007"," A nearly perfect movie when it ended the first time, but...
","STRANGER THAN FICTION angered me so much, I signed up on IMDb just to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking movie until the very end. Once you suspend multiple lapses of logic (why didn't Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book? ""The phone rang. The phone rang again."" How could she not know it's him calling? etc.), the movie challenges one's thoughts about mortality, fate, and sacrifice.<br/><br/>The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, even though Will Ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul. Her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith.<br/><br/>Ah, but the ending. Until the very end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie. The movie as a metaphor for life's journey, as a tribute to the notion of 'writing true,' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's fate. And no matter how endearing a character he may have become, we know full well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen goes white, the credits roll. A profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film. An end that would have been debated for weeks.<br/><br/>NO!!!!!!!!!! No credits rolled. Say it isn't so. Say Hollywood didn't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie. Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said, ""It's no longer a masterpiece; it's OK."" An apt review of the movie. Except to me, it wasn't even OK. I was so offended about the betrayal of 'writing true,' about the decision to pander the film that I actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie. I don't often cry. I could care less about most movies, but I am still angry about this one.<br/><br/>My questions for Zack Helm, the writer, are this: did the original movie end when the screen went white? And were you forced by the vapid movie powers-that-be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie? Or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself? I've read you're brilliant. I hope your original script ended the movie the first time.<br/><br/>I know Zack Helm will never see this review, and I've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself. But, please, movie-goers, am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me seeing this movie: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now."

"Superunknovvn","8","6","10","10 February 2007"," Original, well-balanced mix of comedy and drama
","""Stranger Than Fiction"" isn't as hysterically funny as the trailers have made it out to be, but that comes as a pleasant surprise. What might have been another slapstick, fantasy movie with cheap laughs à la ""Bruce Almighty"" or ""Click"" turns out to be a really clever and touching dramedy in the tradition of ""Rushmore"" or ""The Truman Show"".<br/><br/>This is the story of Harold, a guy who's starting to hear a voice-over to his life. He realizes he's a character in a novel that is about to be killed off. There's probably a million traps this story could have fallen into along the way, but writer Zach Helm gracefully avoids all of them. Both comedy and tragedy are restricted and well-balanced. The focus is never on the question why Harold's character actually hears the author's voice or why he exists in real life at all. What's more important is the thought: what if an artist could meet his own creation? What if a character would suddenly realize that his whole life is merely the creation of somebody else's mind? These are some very philosophical questions and parts of the movie serve as a great analogy for art, religion and the meaning of life.<br/><br/>All of the characters are remarkably well-crafted, particularly the literature expert (Dustin Hoffman) who helps Harold find out if he's just crazy or really part of a novel. This character serves as a commentator on the writing process and leads Harold and the audience through the ongoings of the story.<br/><br/>Not only are the characters written very well, they are also embodied convincingly by the actors. Will Ferrell finally gets a chance to really shine without any lowbrow comedy. Jim Carrey might have played the part as well, but Ferrell is actually much better suited for it. He nails it.<br/><br/>If there's anything not entirely satisfying about this movie it's the ending. I'm still not sure if it wasn't a little cop out. It did feel a little tacked on, as if the writer didn't dare to consequently take the story to the ending that was meant for it. Besides, many questions are left open and, although it's not necessarily a bad thing if not everything is spelled out, some answers would have been nice."
"come2whereimfrom","5","6","10","1 December 2006"," worse than a good film
","Pitching itself alongside the films of Charlie Kaufman and low-fi indie hits such as 'Thumbsucker' this film doesn't have the charms of 'Eternal Sunshine' or the central performance of say 'The Truman show'. Where as Jim Carey brought a certain lovable quality to both his roles in said films, Will Ferrell just brings dumb. The film starts well with quirky graphics overlaid on the action as Emma Thompson narrates the life of Ferrell's Harold Crick, a stuck up taxman who doesn't live but exists. The whole premise of the film is that Emma Thompson who is writing the story is trying to kill off Harold but as he gets wind of it and starts to live his life he doesn't want this to happen so sets out to change his own destiny. Enlisting the help of Dustin Hoffman who is basically revisiting the character he played in 'I heart huckabees' the films few highlights come from the two of them trying to figure out what kind of book Harold is in, in a series of bizarre literary conversations. But what starts as a promising philosophical dark comedy fast turns into a slushy 'Love Actually' type live for the day because you don't know how long you've got melodrama. At no point in the film do you believe that free-thinking radical none tax paying tattooed young beauty played by Maggie Gyllenhaal would ever fall for the old grey boring Ferrell, let alone start to turn his life around, even though they do say opposites attract. OK it makes you think a bit, it may even make you laugh, but it lacks the style it pretends to have and by the end just falls flat on its (head so far up it's own) arse."
"MacacoBanditi","8","5","8","2 February 2012"," It could have worked
","But it didn't. Will Ferrell delivers the performance of his lifetime though, and that's probably the only thing that can keep you going all the way till the end titles.<br/><br/>The greatest merit of this movie is supposed to be its quirky, non-linear narrative and yet there's a misplaced feel-good tone and a nauseatingly clichéd Hollywood happy ending.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: the most grey, dull, mechanical, efficient, obsessive, lonely, soulless IRS employee in the whole history of the universe (Ferrell) discovers a voice in OFF that narrates his life. He sets out to discover what the heck is going on and ends up consulting with Dustin Hoffman, an annoying, overacted literature professor who sips his coffee in a way that is known to drive some people into a homicidal frenzy.<br/><br/>They discover that Ferrell's life is actually being created on-the-go by a famous writer, overplayed by Emma Thompson. She inexplicably has Queen Latifah as an 'assistant'(?) to finish the novel on Ferrell's life, although at no point is it shown in what capacity she helps on that, unless sarcasm and smug get books finished.<br/><br/>In the process of all that quirkiness happening, Ferrell goes through a metamorphosis and reveals a tender soul where dwells a funny, creative, flirtatious guy who scores with a hot anarchist hippie (who hates to pay taxes), by playing a lousy song on a guitar.<br/><br/>If you haven't been nauseated away at this point you discover that Emma Thompson (who is the best writer alive) kills off all of her characters in her books, so Ferrell's life is in clear and present danger. Sound stupid enough? Yes, the best writer in the whole planet ALWAYS kills her main characters. So the whole story revolves around what to do next, leave Ferrell alive for a mediocre story or wipe him out and score a 'masterpiece'. This is a great plot device to introduce at least a pinch of thoughfulness, introspection, questions about life and death, free will, fate, art and... well, no, forget it. The whole knot is undone with a romantic comedy twist that makes you feel cheated, and cloyed as if you had had 20 mars bars in one sitting.<br/><br/>In summary, a promising first 15 minutes with a clever premise, but nothing to write home about when the end titles start rolling. What a shame. Watch ""Adaptation"" and you'll see what this movie wanted to be but couldn't."

"MartinHafer","8","3","4","18 April 2008"," Very good and very unexpected
","I have been very surprised recently that I have actually enjoyed several Will Ferrell movies. Why surprised? Well, to put it bluntly, most films made by ex-Saturday Night Live performers have been pretty wretched (though there are some exceptions) and I usually avoid them like the plague. With films like DR. DETROIT, NEIGHBORS, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, FUNNY FARM, BEST DEFENSE, HERE'S PAT, etc., it's easy to understand my misgivings. However, despite my strong bias, I must admit I really enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS as well as STRANGER THAN FICTION--though they are both very, very different movies.<br/><br/>While TALLADEGA NIGHTS is extremely silly and a great parody, STRANGER THAN FICTION is not exactly a comedy, though it has some nice comedic moments. Instead, it's a fantasy, comedy and romance all rolled into one and it was nice to see Ferrell finally underplay a role. His character was extremely obsessive-compulsive and emotionally constricted--yet this was NOT played for laughs--an excellent decision.<br/><br/>The film initially seems a lot like the old skits on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" which featured a writer typing a story and you saw actors playing it out as if they were real. However, the simple story idea was drawn out but didn't seem padded and offered some lovely insights into deeper philosophical issues. It was NOT a film for dopey teens or an undemanding audience, but a thoughtful and intelligently constructed film that caught my interest.<br/><br/>If you are looking for screwball comedy or lots of laughs, then you will no doubt be disappointed. However, if you watch the film with few preconceptions and expectations and have an open mind, I am sure you'll enjoy the film. It's nice to see that I was wrong about the film and the ""SNL curse"" did not seem to apply."

"Galina_movie_fan","9","4","6","11 December 2006"," Watching 'Stranger than Fiction' (2006) in an empty theater...
","...was one of the best movie-going experiences I ever had. My husband and I went to see it last Saturday on the 14:15 (2:15 PM) show and we had the small, comfortable, stadium-like theater all to ourselves. I was delighted but my husband gave me a suspicious look before the movie began and asked if I was sure that was the movie I wanted to see. I was sure - I've seen the trailer several times and I loved the idea the movie was based on: an IRS employee, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell has proved admirably to be able to play serious roles) leads the ordered, quite boring full of numbers and digits life only one morning to realize that he is somehow happened to be a main character in a new novel from famous, neurotic, reclusive, chain smoking author Karen Eiffel (great, great Emma Thompson) who always murders her main characters on the last page of her books. He begins hearing a voice in his head that narrates over his life and tells exactly what just happened to him. Where would you go first? To a psychiatrist, of course. What would he (in this movie, she, Linda Hunt, memorable in a tiny cameo) say? ""You have to be medicated"" but she also advises Harold to seek assistance from the literature expert. Enters Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, always reliable, always delight to watch) who would help Harold to determine whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy and whether he would be able to avoid an inevitable tragic end of the book. While figuring out if he is in a comedy or a tragedy, Harold meets a free spirited baker with the Harward Law background named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal lights up the screen in her every scene) who did not pay a portion of her taxes in purpose and now is a subject for auditing. Harold's life changes, he is not ready to go but the voice sounds in his head and his only chance to avoid the book's final is to meet with Karen and to beg her to reconsider. There is a problem, you see - Karen is impossible to find - she never meets with the readers or replies to the phone calls or letters...<br/><br/>Little did I know how much I would like the movie and how much I would care about its characters. The movie makers are the brave and creative people not only because they chose as the subject the exploration of Author and his character relationship. It's been done before and not only by Charley Kauffman whose name has been mentioned by many commenters. The subject of Creator and his creature, the writer and the heroes of his books, the man and his shadow that one day would refuse to follow its master would go as far as the ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea. No, I admire the filmmakers because they were brave enough to make their main character an IRS guy and to make him sympathetic and compelling. Believe it or not, the movie made me smile and cry at the same time and there were the moments that I could not figure out where it would go and I liked the feeling. I don't know if ""Stranger than Fiction"" is the best movie of this year but it is certainly the best I've seen so far and I wish it all the best when the awards season comes.<br/><br/>...As much as I enjoyed being in the theater with my husband only, I truly wish more viewers see ""Stranger than Fiction"" because it is a clever, funny yet moving picture - they don't come like that very often.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Like Alexander from London, England I too saw a test screening of Stranger than Fiction and wont go over the same stuff as him as he has done a good job of summarising it, but instead I shall give my own rendition of what I thought. It is a cult film with Will Farrell being at his absolute brilliance at what he does in a quirky but funny way. The film is a cross between Big Fish and The Truman Show with an amazing cast.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson narrated the beginning of the film, which led it to a slow start and I was wondering whether or not I was enjoying the film because it was free or because the mathematical images reminded me of the Ikea scene from Fight Club, however my initial views were so wrong. The narrating stopped and the film moved along at a steady pace. Queen Latifah's role was a low in the film and rather disappointing to previous roles she has played but I guess that's down to her character and scripting.<br/><br/>I was not interested at all in the themes of life which obviously this film was concluding to but thought this would be a much talked about film, thought provoking and should receive several film awards for its shear brilliance.

","STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time. How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'Stay', 'Everything Put Together') is a director of vision, a man unafraid to tackle testy topics, and a genius at pacing a film with a keen collaborative eye with his cinematographer, his editor, his set designer, his casting director, and his actors. Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Will Ferrell - finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co-existence with his wrist watch!)...until one day he hears a voice narrating his life, the female voice of loopy and blocked writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is writing a story that has a 'Harold Crick' as her main character. Only our boring IRS agent can hear her voice: his loony office friend Dave (Tony Hale) empathizes but can do little else to help him. When the narrator begins to talk about ending 'Harold's' life, Harold freaks and seeks guidance from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his most subtle and refined roles of his career) who knows Eiffel's work and aids Harold in understanding novels, be they comedy or tragedy. Harold also seeks the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Mittag-Leffler (the always superb Linda Hunt) who is of little help, and Dr. Cayly (Tom Hulce) who repairs all upsets with hugs.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in his work of auditing citizens he encounters anti-government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues. And all this time novelist Kay Eiffel is struggling with how to 'kill Harold' so that she can complete her novel. Her publisher sends in 'assistant' Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to ground her and guide her to her novel's completion by helping her observe hospital disasters, vantages, and steadying her grip on life.<br/><br/>The manner in which the novel is finished which involves the ultimate fate of Harold and the changes the narration of the novel have had on his life makes up the resolution of the story. And a cleverly written conclusion it is. Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well-informed writer who knows how to balance comedy and tragedy, crises of life with the little things that count, and can mold conversations so subtle that they beg to be rewound to enjoy the words repeatedly. Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.<br/><br/>Some people (this viewer being one) avoided this film in the theaters because of the fear that it may be just another Will Ferrell bit of foolishness: over the top slapstick physical comedy that grows stale after about five minutes. But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act! The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit. Added to the DVD is about an hour's worth of featurettes that are, for once, brilliantly informative and well worth viewing to enhance the film just experienced. Bravo to the entire cast and crew of this little masterwork! Grady Harp"

Precisely hitting all the notes in making an ensemble cast work, everything just seemed so carefully thought out without feeling contrivedthere is simply nothing to dislike about this film.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell very successfully transitions from his usual screwball comedic acts to sincere, sensitive and likable everyday IRS agent Harold Crick, who falls in love with his auditee, government-hater and bohemian baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who just marvelously disappeared into the role). Dustin Hoffman flawlessly plays literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, whom Crick runs to for help to find out how to stop his life from ending as intimated to him by the voice in his head, while Queen Latifah was able to stand on her own as assistant Penny to Emma Thompson's eccentric tragic novelist Kay Eiffel, who is struggling with writer's block, trying to find out the best way to kill her lead character Crick.<br/><br/>Forster makes everything so easy to love: his recurring themes of contrast and interconnectivity blend smoothly with the refreshingly original story, the immensely talented actors that quietly dissolve into their characters (usually very difficult to suspend disbelief with a stellar cast), thoughtful set design (all calm neutrals in modernist designs) and a breathtaking indie-rock soundtrack (said to be this year's answer to Garden State's OST). <br/><br/>Here are a few of the incredibly killer lines:<br/><br/>Penny Escher: (looks at a pile of smoked cigarettes on Kay's desk) Did you smoke all of these? Kay Eiffel: No, they came pre-smoked.<br/><br/>Ana Pascal: Did you like the cookies? Harold Crick: Yes.

Not a very original story: a cold, structured businessman meets a fun-loving, carefree young woman who gives him something to live for. When he discovers he is just a character in a story that ends with him dying in the near future, he searches for the author to ask her to keep him alive. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how this film got such high marks because I saw so many things in it that bothered me.

I'm sure some may think I'm being nit-picky, but if this film addressed these questions instead of trying to be a pretentious, hackneyed film about a man finding more substance in his life, it would've been a lot more interesting."
"PunchB","5","8","17","5 November 2006"," Entertaining if you can ignore its insistence that it's profound
","This movie tries hard to be like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but it doesn't succeed. The main problem is that the characters are very underdeveloped and don't really have personalities except for ""freak-ish rebel-ish cute girl"", ""stuffy, obsessive, boring-but-not-really guy"" etc. (the other characters have even less of a personality).<br/><br/>It's apparent in the performances too that the actors didn't have that much to work with. The actors aren't really investing much, it's pretty light and superficial stuff - which would be good if this was a straight comedy, but it isn't. The movie really wants to say something meaningful (it screams ""MEANINGFUL"" from the very first scene - a shot of the earth, then zooming closer and closer and into the protagonist's bedroom), and it also wants to be sad and for you to root for the main guy and all those things. You know, it wants to be realistic, it wants you to suspend disbelief. It halfway succeeds at that, because it's very competently made and briskly edited, and filled with jokes and funny situations, half of which semi-work or more. (The other half have already been done better in an average Seinfeld-episode.) The other problem (except for the flat characters and the fact that it isn't nearly as funny as it tries to be), is, as others have mentioned, the cringe-worthy plot contrivances. The clichéd and cringe-worthy scenes have to do with the same thing as the problematic characters, weak and unimaginative writing. What you think will happen between the two leads, happens, and in the most well-used way.<br/><br/>Lastly there's the absurd plot developments. The whole premise is absurd of course, like it was in Eternal Sunshine too. But the characters in Eternal Sunshine reacted to the absurd situations in a way consistent with their personalities and the world they occupied. The world in Stranger Than Fiction is neither-nor. Mostly it's clear that the movie attempts to convey a certain realism. I could give lots of examples of this but won't bore or spoil you. But then a character like Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman) suddenly accepts Harold Crick's (Ferrell) explanation without asking HOW or WHY this would happen, the same does Crick himself and two other characters. Suddenly we've entered fairytale-land. That Crick so readily accepts his final outcome (and the reason he does so) is also hard to buy, and not consistent at all with his character as presented. So the movie ends up being neither this nor that.<br/><br/>""Luckily"" most of these revelations and plot developments don't happen before later in the movie, and we can't be sure where the whole thing is gonna go (metaphysically) before that. By then I'd already started to somewhat enjoy and be entertained by the movie (when I wasn't annoyed or cringing).<br/><br/>The actors are OK but nothing more, as I said they don't really convey a lot of emotional truth - Maggie Gyllenhaal being the possible exception. Emma Thompson is mugging too much, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman (nothing wrong with that), and... there's nothing to say about Queen Latifah or Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>In summation, a slight, but entertaining movie that tries to make you think it's very profound."

","Possible, albeit mild, spoilers in the third paragraph so just skip right down to them so you can follow my post. Actually no, I kid. They're spoilers, you shouldn't read them. Because they'll spoil the movie.<br/><br/>So, I've been on a Will Ferrell binge the last couple of days, doing a bit of catching up on the stuff I didn't glory in in my drunken and depraved college days (namely this and his two films from last year - Step Brothers is one of the best comedies of the decade, SEE it). Anyone who's had a passing knowledge of my person knows I'm a crusader against all things quirky, but Will Ferrell is one of my heroes (he stole my heart as Frank the Tank and neither of us ever looked back), so I figured I ought to soldier on through this in the name of completism.<br/><br/>One hour in and I'm thinking that a good movie might be squeezed out of another high concept dramedy and that the quirky tone is palatable because Will Ferrell walks through it. He doesn't yell, which is a bit like like Van Damme not round-kicking people in the mouth, but he does timid and introverted near as good as he does boisterous and narcissist. And he's lucky to have Maggie Gylenhaal next to him, for whom I never quite felt so much in lust as in her role as tattooed anarchist baker. It's all a bit predictable (loner needs to break his routine to love life) but not half-bad.<br/><br/>And then it throws everything away in the last 20-30 minutes. Why movie?? It took some effort on my part to come to terms with Harold's resignation to his death for a book (I mean, it's a goddamn book!), but okay, death may be a small price to pay to be immortalized. But Dustin Hoffman promised a 'one of the most meaningful and poetic endings', so it might be worth the hassle anyway. And then it comes: one big clusterf-ck of pseudo faith-reaffirming schmaltz shot like a UNICEF ad. At that point I wanted to punish the movie real bad, to inflict bodily harm on it. Not only because, being a meta- riff on writing, it violates every writing code of honor with its gut-wrenching didacticsm, but more because it squandered every good will I had to like it up until that point."

I could hardly keep my self awake. There is rarely any good comedy. It is kinda serious.

Except the main character, the others have no depth ! <br/><br/>The only redeeming quality is that the story is very different.

The first 20 minutes of the film were conceptually and especially visually so cool that I constantly thought about to whom out of all my friends I might recommend this film afterwards. But then it all changed and seeing it to the end was something between embarrassing pain and hope it still might ""get the curve"", as we say in German, meaning I still hoped for a clever and UNPREDICTABLE or at least CONSEQUENT ending.

For Teenagers, this is not the movie to see on a Friday night ""outing"" but i can see how this movie would amaze older adults. However: I'm not recommending this movie. We all know Will Farrell as a comedy genius but no matter the effort, it was simply unhumorous. I can see where the idea might have come from however it was presented poorly. I think with a better plot and more humor, this movie would have been something to rant and rave about, but I can't say it was."
"zetes","5","5","11","18 December 2006"," Good concept! Now if they had just come up with a coherent and natural script to go along with it.
","One of the bigger disappointments of the year. The concept is interesting, and the cast is more than promising. Will Ferrell, in a slightly more serious role than usual, plays an IRS agent who begins to hear a British woman (Emma Thompson) narrating his humdrum life. It's merely an annoyance until he hears that his death is imminent. He attempts to discover where this story is going, through the help of an English professor (Dustin Hoffman), but eventually he just decides to live life to its fullest, which includes getting a girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) to like him finally. The general problem is that it feels like the screenwriter (Zach Helm) came up with a great concept, but never really figured out where to go with it. Also, he never even comes close to figuring out how to reconcile the fantastic premise with the real world, in which the rest of the film firmly takes place. After the concept has been established, you can really feel Helm uncomfortably forcing the story along. Gyllenhaal's character is one of the best examples. She's made completely two dimensional, a supposed über-liberal hippie chick who despises Ferrell (who is auditing her) at first sight, but who later sleeps with him just because he plays her what we assume to be her favorite punk song (we assume because we're given pretty much no information, except that there's a Clash song playing in her bakery earlier, though the song he plays isn't a Clash song). It's one of the worst roles I've seen in 2006, and Gyllenhaal is at a loss, giving what is easily her worst performance ever. Even worse is the character written for Queen Latifah, who is given absolutely nothing to do. One has to wonder why any producer would shell out the money for a name actress when the role requires nothing. The story gets even worse after Ferrell finally finds Emma Thompson and attempts to stop her from finishing his story. He can't bring himself to read the ending (it's in outline format, so it hasn't happened yet), so he gives it to Hoffman. Hoffman declares that the novel is too good (though from what the audience heard of the book, it sucks) for Ferrell to live. At that point, I was totally lost. Luckily it ended quickly enough that I wasn't at the point of despising it yet (a couple of movies this year, namely Little Miss Sunshine, weren't so lucky). Some decent performances and some decent laughs, but it's a pretty big failure."

","I rewatched this again tonight for the first time since it came out, and remembered nothing at all about it going in but the premise, along with the lingering impression that it was a fairly likeable mainstream Hollywood attempt at fabricating some of that elusive Charlie Kaufman ""Being John Malkovich"" magic and acclaim.<br/><br/>And the thing is, it's such a lovely premise - a man becomes aware he is a character in a book and due to be killed off - but the film has no way of satisfactorily ending it. It aspires to have as grand a finale as Emma Thompson's character's novel within the film, but likewise chickens out and so ends up a puzzling and pointless mediocrity, which no amount of swelling music, uplifting montages and platitudes can obscure.<br/><br/>I enjoyed my time spent with the characters, and indeed, there's a lot to like about every one of them, and every actor playing them.

"generationofswine","10","2","3","14 July 2019"," AN Honest Review
","I am one of those people that normally hate Will Ferrell, especially in a leading role. I find him obnoxious, and over-the-top to the point where he is pandering for laughs form the LCD than actually attempting to be funny.<br/><br/>However, there is always an exception to the rule. Usually that exception comes in the form of a supporting role... as in Old School... but here it comes in the form of a leading role.<br/><br/>It seems like Marc Forster really reigned him in on the one and the pay off was AMAZING. It's seriously a funny and quirky film. It's hysterical and kind of plays to an audience that wonders if writer's creations can come to life.<br/><br/>It's an imaginative script and plays to the people that feel, maybe, a little guilty for leaving a book over night when the characters are left in a bad position just in case they are real and might get stuck there. It appeals to anyone that has ever wrote fiction, and felt like a God because of the control they had over their characters... and it does so in the most ridiculous way possible."
"serafinogm","10","2","3","9 October 2015"," Lovely movie with a lovely ending!
","Let me first reveal that I am a huge Will Ferrell fan even of his absurdist work but this movie was anything but absurd. Not sure how to interpret what occurred with Will's character (but's it not Illuminati trickery, didn't see anything to suggest that and one would have to be super paranoid to arrive at that interpretation from this vehicle)! Will's character was forced into an unwinnable situation (or so it appeared), he had to consciously choose between self-sacrifice and doing the right thing in the process (saving a child) or walking away from the situation and remaining in his most unsatisfactory life! Well he made the right choice and although getting hit by a bus is or should be a death sentence, the same fates that put him in that situation ensure he survives and he's rewarded with the delicious Maggie Gyllenhaal. Not bad huh? Wonderful movie that kept me engaged throughout!"
"visakhnair96","10","2","3","23 August 2015"," Hard to believe I hadn't heard of this film before.
","Think Will Ferell, and the first thought that comes to your mind is a goof-ball comedy. He's known for playing funny characters and he definitely doesn't have a problem not taking himself too seriously. But this film is so very different. I would say this is Ferrells best dramatic performance (perhaps his only real ""dramatic"" performance?). The film is heartfelt and it's about this guy named Harold Crick (played by Ferrell), whose life is the subject of a certain authors book. His life story is literally being written by someone else. As he goes about his life, he can actually hear the narration in his head and the description of the events going on in his life. I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you. But its definitely entertaining and a genuine feel-good film you should definitely watch. At least for me, Ferrell's performance surprised me. And he's backed up by a great bunch of actors (think Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Emma Thompson and the gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal!). And there's even room for ""Buster"" from ""Arrested Development!"
"rtp4242","9","2","3","25 September 2013"," Stranger Than Fiction. It's a fact, this is a great film.
","Harold Crick (Will Farrell) is an I.R.S. agent with a very regimented life. He brushes his teeth with a certain amount of brush strokes, he walks the same distance to the bus stop every day, he takes the same amount of time for lunch every day. He eats alone, he sleeps alone and the next day the regimen starts all over again. Except now he hears a voice in his head, narrating the day. The narrator (Emma Thompson) narrates his whole day, from morning to night.<br/><br/>While hearing the voice in his head, Harold is also auditing a quirky bakery shop owner, named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who despises Harold, because he represents the establishment. But from the moment Harold sees Ana's tattooed body, he knows he wants her, lust soon turns to love, and Harold decides not to live such a regimented life. He takes up the guitar, and starts wearing sweaters instead of a suit and tie with a single Windsor knot. Just then, the narrator tells Harold of his impending death. Harold decides to ask a literary professor, Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman) not a psychiatrist to help identify the voice in his head. Who is this narrator? How does she know Harold is going to die? Can Professor Hibbert help Harold identify the voice of the narrator? I love Stranger Than Fiction. It's got such an interesting concept and the concept is almost fully realized. All the comedy, all the sadness of a everyman facing his own mortality is wrung out of this beautifully written script. It's an acerbic satire of writers, most people think of writers as detached, genteel, well-educated, omnipotent people. This movie turns that impression on its head, according to this movie, writers are chain-smoking neurotic, verbose, egomaniacs with a God complex. This movie is more than a scathing satire of writers, it's an existential comedy, if there is such a thing. The questions brought to mind are, who created us and why. What if that creator decided to snuff out our lives, just as we were starting to enjoy ourselves? Could we talk to our creator, as Job did in the Bible? What would happen after such an intervention? I'm sure the writer wasn't thinking of Job, but that's what this movie made me think of. I said the concept was almost fully realized because the writer, Zack Helm, wrote an ending that I hated for this movie, and that made an otherwise flawless movie have a big flaw.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully acted movie. Will Ferrell gives up his usual oafish buffoonery, for a quiet understated, performance. Not that I don't enjoy his occasional buffoonery like Frank the Tank or Ron Burgundy, but this movie and Elf show he's capable of so much more. He's capable of playing, sweet, gentle, vulnerable characters, and this movie shows that side of him. Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely irresistible as a perky, sassy, sensual, goddess of the counterculture. Emma Thompson absolutely steals the movie as the narrator, yes there is voice over narration, but it's used to hilarious effect. Dustin Hoffman is wonderful, trying to figure out the ridiculous situation he's presented with, his humor is at its driest. And Queen Latifah, when given a good script shines, with superb comic timing, even with the rapid-fire dialog she is given. Everybody is at their best here.<br/><br/>For more fact-based reviews of great and not-so great movies, visit my blog, reviewswithatude@wordpress.com."

","Stranger Than Fiction is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast that balance comedy and drama nicely. It is a very off the cuff film that is unlike any other, as we follow a man gradually discovering that he is actually a character in a novel and his creator is struggling to conclude his journey. It reminded me of the Looney Tunes cartoon Duck Amuck, as Harold Crick interacts and struggles to discover the force that is Karen, and we get taken in to a topsy turvy world that will leave us both entertained and confused. <br/><br/>It did bother me that the film left me with more questions than answers, there are a lot of head scratching moments that leave me quite baffled, such as Harold being able to visit Karen's office, it is never made entirely clear how this world actually works. As well as that, the mix of comedy and drama makes the film a little underwhelming, as it is never too funny, nor ever too dramatic, since it is trying to do two things, it never does either very effectively. <br/><br/>The cast is all around tremendous, Will Ferrell delivers a role completely unlike any of his previous work, playing a character that is funny, but not in his typical eccentric way, and his characterisation in the part is immensely enjoyable. He is also joined by the marvellous Emma Thompson, who plays a very complicated role, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has great, pure chemistry with Ferrell, and Dustin Hoffman, who brings in subtlety and laughter. <br/><br/>Entertaining while it lasts. Stranger Than Fiction is not as incredibly unique as it may think it is, but it is great fun that I would recommend to anybody looking for a good comedy drama. <br/><br/>
Average man Harold Crick learns that he may soon meet his destiny when he begins hearing a woman narrate his life. <br/><br/>

","The first remark that comes to mind when thinking of this film is it's good from the very start...to the end ! So many in fact a vast, vast majority of Hollywood mainstream films that do well at being engaging at first will only throw out an entertaining idea to be entertained by its audience for a while, before that idea is exhausted and the experience wears very thin. Here, it holds up til the end, and the conclusion isn't a rushed potato salad that contrasts hard in quality with the earlier developments and hopes of the movie.<br/><br/>Some have saluted Ferrel's ""excellent acting"", while others have condemned it saying this role was stripping him of his natural charm that people watch him for in the first place. You must agree at least a bit with the first view. He does superbly well at being a hybrid, a lead character torn between being a mere fictional hero of some narrated story and an actual individual with feelings and opinions and emotions. He conveys that very well.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson pretty good also.<br/><br/>There are lots of symbols in this film, about the daily life... about just life. The importance of it. It gives an interesting perspective on it. And it does really well to be ambiguous with the two levels it works on but coherent all the same and manage to actually come up with a strong resolve out of that awkward mingling.<br/><br/>One of the rare films of its kind to deliver from A to Z. Well done. Certainly more than a mere amusing Hollywood comedy."

It's kinda a mediocre Kaufman screenplay, but hey, a mediocre Kaufman is still better than 99% of modern day screenplays.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell shakes his usual (not trying to sound pretentious here) simpler comedies to do what previously Jim Carrey did in Eternal Sunshine (a Kaufman you must definitely watch) and Adam Sandler in PTA's Punch Drunk Love to give a serious role full of emotion and masterful acting. I was blown away by how good his performance was. He hit all the emotional strings, his delivery was impeccable and you can't help but love him.<br/><br/>I think I particularly relate to Will Ferrell's Harold. He use to be obsessed with number and statistics (I spent time memorising Pi in the 100s of decimal places) but through a girl, a realisation and dreams, all me as well, (He listens to punk rock music as well!!) he comes to terms with death to live his life the way he wants and spread a bit of good in the world, which of course is the direction I want to take. Maybe the narration bit wasn't exactly me but oh well. \_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>The performances by Hoffman, Thomson and Gyllenhaal are all also great. No faults or complaints here.<br/><br/>The film hits the marks on all points in direction, storytelling, acting and emotional elevation, already making it better than most comedies and even films in America's recent cinematic history. So why not 5 stars? Well as aforementioned it's a mediocre Kaufman so not quite the level of perfection to earn it full stars, but I felt the third act was a minor (very minor) letdown compared to the first two. Don't get me wrong I still love it. It's still full of the cynicism, optimism, humour and care the first two had, but for a third act it didn't have quite the impact I expected given the build up. A minor and tiny nitpick but enough to cost it full marks.<br/><br/>Definitely check it out, it's worth it 100%. Expect laughs, good acting and clever and thought provoking ideas and messages given through 2 hours of emotion and great imagery."

","Unfortunately I can't say too much here without spoiling everything, but what I can say is that there is more to this movie than meets the eye. Beyond the awkward story of Harold's life being narrated by a pessimistic writer there is a underlying subtext you can find if you dig deep enough. On the surface this looks just like another rom-com with a twist. Like Bruce All Mighty, Yes Man, or even the animal, but this film actual has a strong undercurrent that raises it beyond the rest. I'd only recommend this film to the particularly artsy individuals out there who want something different. If nothing else the bleak sarcastic humor is charming and everyone preforms there roles exceptionally.

Stranger Than Fiction is a fantastic comedy from start to finish, and from the story to the characters. The idea of the movie alone is interesting and Forster and this cast pull it off well. One of my favorite parts of this movie is of course Emma Thompson being the writer unknowingly deciding his fate and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as Ferrell's love interest. Ferrell is actually directed brilliantly by Forster who keeps him tamed and used effectively.<br/><br/>All in all if your a fan of will ferret I recommend this movie."

This movie made me consider about my living. In this movie, the main character decides to follow the story. But I wonder what he would do, if he chose to be alive. I think the last scene is good. I think, if he didn't do that, the story may have become more interesting. As the story goes on, I felt he became a more human person. At first I thought he was a strict person. I think changes of our lives may make our lives better or richer even if we can't adjust to it easily."

","This movie is very interesting. The movie had the courage to engage something different and to reject the classic Hollywood form. This is a strange mix of a little bit darker and more subtle comedy with dramatic moments that revolve around existential ideas. The acting is on a high quality, especially Will Farrell. Will give's a partially serious performance in order to gain a more dramatic and cynical role. Something like Jim Carrey in ""The_Truman_Show"". Just like the theme around which the movie revolves; this movie is like a good novel. Excellent, stylish, strange and unexpectedly inspiring. In addition to all of its dark and existential moments, the movie manages to be funny and likable. I recommend the movie to everyone. Its an appreciated masterpiece."

","I am not a fan of Will Ferrell to be quite honest. He often reprises his same roles throughout his career, however this is something different. It might be because of the incredibly strong performances from his different co-stars. The strength of performance by Maggie Gyllenhal is great and really makes you fall in love with her character and her as an actress. It is also a very real performance by Emma Thompson, and also with some great Dustin Hoffman tidbits.

","When I first started watching the film, everything was believable and had a slightly ironic humor- based element to it, which soon introduced mystery, a tinge of action and it confused me a little. With the main character slightly daft at times, the interactions and conversations were natural albeit a little frustrating given that by the mid-film things were starting to make complete sense (without headache). However in retrospect the story writing and flow was on the spot, and never did I feel a sense of lack nor did I come out feeling empty handed. Emma Thompson stole the show however, her character was the most thought provoking, with her extremely well-portrayed character. Because of her, the others fell slightly short. It was back to back story telling, and this is a great recommendation for those who need a little brain juice, not for the sleepy or people looking for a great action horror film."
"nycritic","9","1","1","16 June 2007"," The Moebius Strip
","Metafiction, since the arrival of Charlie Kaufmann, has become the driving force in cinematic storytelling. Consider that ADAPTATION and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND ar the types of stories which evolve within themselves and turn logic inside-out by breaking the thin layer of fantasy and bringing it into reality. Not that this was groundbreaking, Luis Bunuel was there first, happily deconstructing the art of plotting from BELLE DE JOUR to THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE.<br/><br/>However STRANGER THAN FICTION is less a surreal experience than a blend of what is happening as opposed to what is not, and even what might be implied. Harold Crick has started to hear a voice within his head. It's a voice we hear, too: a woman's voice -- the Narrator. He wonders if there is any meaning to this voice who tracks his every move and peppers it with bon mots. It begins to get intrusive and frankly, he gets fed up with it: what does this woman want? Can anyone outside of him hear her narrate his life? Is he on some perverse reality show? At the same time, Karen Eiffel is experiencing writer's block. She fantasizes constantly about death -- then again, death is ever present in her novels, and the protagonists (regular folk, good people as she later calls them) die senselessly. But, in their death, beautifully written by her hand in narration, they achieve a certain immortality that becomes a work of art in itself. Her public, her success, her reputation depends on their death.<br/><br/>How director Marc Forster blends both the life of Harold Crick with the writing of Karen Eiffel is really what's at stake here and this is the kind of movie where a review about it would destroy any expectations a viewer would have of the revelation that is STRANGER THAN FICTION. Adding to this, its mismarketing as a comedy actually makes it the better picture: the trailer teeters only on Harold's apparent crack-up as he yells and goes berserk at the voice that he keeps hearing but it leaves out the meat, which is a wise move. Harold is much more than a Will Ferrell comedy-sketch: he becomes fully realized as a man caught in a completely surreal experience. STRANGER THAN FICTION has some excellent acting from its entire cast which is of the likes of Dustin Hoffmann, Emma Thompson (in a rather darkly funny role as Karen Eiffel), Maggie Gylenhaal, and Queen Latifah in a role that seems to have been conceived as larger but got lost in the scissors that is the cutting room floor."

With all the great talent present in this movie i expected it to be a well put together and maybe thought provoking film but the plot was undeveloped and very slow. I don't usually have particularly bad feelings about a movie but it almost seemed to mock issues such as death and it isn't until the end when the literary specialist says ' death comes to us all in time' that the theme of death takes on any kind of real ideas. Also there are points in the story that seemed to come from no where like the scene where Harold and Anna make out for the first time. there was no foreshadowing to even suggest some of the plot's outbursts and they are very unexpected. i walked away feeling unsatisfied and just with a not so good feeling in my stomach.

"cinemart","8","15","49","8 September 2006"," Will Ferrell's best performance (except for maybe Starsky & Hutch)
","Definitely cut from that ""out there"" cloth of Charley Kauffman (ADAPTATION, BEING JOHN MALCOVICH), STRANGER THAN FICTION is a more accessible film. Harold Crick (an understated Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent living a bland life of quiet desperation that's narrated by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Little does he know that he's the main character in Eiffel's latest novel. Luckily, this isn't one of those ""writer makes fictional character do dumb things"" films a la Rob Reiner's ALEX & EMMA but a fun mix of narrative fiction and schizophrenia.<br/><br/>When a psychologist (Linda Hunt) can't help him, Harold goes to a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman, also thankfully understated) who tries to determine what genre Harold is living. There's also a romance along the way with a baker that Harold is auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal) that feels a little undercooked. Queen Latifah is also along for the ride in kind of a wasted role and apparently Tom Hulce is somewhere in this film but I just can't remember seeing him in it.<br/><br/>I'm not usually one for Will Ferrell films but was glad to see him playing it relatively straight here. There were very few yelling fits or broad physical comedy. It's actual more of a ""serio-comic"" performance and, as long as he doesn't go around moping if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, he could teach Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to easily pass from comedy to dramedy without delving into crap like THE TRUMAN SHOW or MAN IN THE MOON.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, don't watch the preview for this one, though, as it gives away quite a few of the film's finer moments."

To put it mildly..I beg to disagree. Stranger than Fivction may have been the most boring movie of all time. There was absolutely nothing in it to keep my girlfriend and I awake for more than half of it. No humor, no suspense, no cursing, no use of the ""n"" word, no frontal nudity, not even rear end nudity, no sex at all, no car chases, no drive-by shootings, no screaming or yelling..just NOTHING to keep a person awake for 2 hours. I don't care how perfect Will Farrell and Dustin Hoffman were for their roles, they were totally monotone and robotic and seemed to sleepwalk through their scenes. They were better than Ambian for putting the two of us right into dreamland. So if you want a movie that's a perfect cure for insomniacs, Stranger than Fiction is your medicine."

","To sum it up, the premise of the movie is interesting, but the execution... not so much.<br/><br/>They could have done some hilarious things with the narration, put him in some wacky situations, but instead it just plays out in the most dull and uncreative way imaginable. The way Ferrel's character reacts to it is stilted and unrealistic, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Besides the life-narration thing, the story is the typical boring salary-man lives boring life, and we're SOMEHOW supposed to feel sorry for him and accept him as representative of a mediocre life when in an actuality he is quite privileged as a tall, fit, healthy man with a good job, and no responsibilities such as a wife or kids. Come to think of it, why and how could a great novelist write a full novel about such a boring life anyway? <br/><br/>Anyway, one day he meets manic pixie dream girl. They skipped the essential part though where their relationship has any actual ups-and-downs. The way they get together is pretty unconvincing too. I am puzzled that either one likes the other. His overtures towards her get downright cringe-worthy and creepy in its overly-earnestness, reminiscent of Anakin and Padme in Episode II.<br/><br/>I'm probably missing something, I don't understand what theme they were going for, or what the significance of the ending is. The movie overall seems pretentious and self-important. The movie sputters along boringly until the end when it tells us (but doesn't actually show us) it is dramatic and profound."

","Wow! Now this is one of the most original movies that I have seen in a long time! Normally I really do not like watching Will Farrell in any movie (except for Mugatu in Zoolander), but he really impressed me in ""Stranger Than Fiction""! The acting was first rate in this movie, with supporting characters like Robert DeNiro, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah. Will Farrell surprisingly held his own against these heavyweights and together, they carried out the very clever and suspenseful script to perfection. This film really threw me off as it is a very witty comedy, as well as a powerful drama and a potential tragedy (I won't spoil the ending). At points I wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh at the scene, and that is something that very few movies have been able to do to people. The script was very poetically written, considering it is mainly about a famous author's description of an every day guy.<br/><br/>Thus, with all these great aspects of the film coming together (acting, script, directing, humor), it made for an exceedingly impressive movie in which I may consider giving a 10 upon a 2nd viewing in the future.

Even Queen Latifah's part was unmemorable, which I would have thought to be nearly impossible for her since she always has such strong characters. There are very few times I say this but it needed another storyline running through it. On the other hand maybe the previews and reviews just gave too much of the movie away for me.

","A horribly pointless and, worse, boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way. <br/><br/>Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and substitutes his usual shouting routine (admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. <br/><br/>Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating (that some reviews I've read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable) whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy. Please. That she ended up falling for Ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous.<br/><br/>Marc Forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with.<br/><br/>I had the choice of either going to watch The Prestige for the third time or seeing this.

""Mist"" is the most significant fiction of this Basque writer. The book addresses the insecurity of modern man who cares about his fate and his death, a theme par excellence Unamunian. ""Mist"" was written in 1907 and published in 1914. ""Stranger than fiction"" plagiarized an idea that is 100 years old. Another striking episode is the reference to cookie dipped in milk that causes a strong déjà vu of the ""cupcakes dipped in tea"" from the novel ""In Search of Lost Time"" written by Marcel Proust, coincidentally, at the beginning of the twentieth century.

","I am so angered at having sat through this movie that i have registered an account with IMDb just so i can write this review and spare someone else the torment i have just been subjected to.<br/><br/>I enjoy a Will Ferrell movie to sit back,laugh and relax into, finding comfort in his recognizable comedy style. However I was aware that the mere concept behind Stranger than Fiction would not lend well to the Ferrell i had become accustomed to but his usual humor still shone through. Add such greats as Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and i was expecting something memorable with a certain originality. Unfortunately i was subjected to the opposite.<br/><br/>After a very short time into the film i started to draw obvious comparisons to the Truman Show; although not exactly the same situation, the main character does begin to find that his life is being orchestrated by another person and seeks a way to find out his apparent destiny. Ferrell does this by speaking to a professor of literature played fantastically by Dustin Hoffman. He then finds the narrator to his life to be a writer played by Emma Thompson. So far a very basic and quick to establish scenario for the story.<br/><br/>Now this is where the film follows the well trodden track of clichés and predictive plot. Stop me if you have heard this before.. a boring character who suddenly becomes inspired to be a more interesting person, apparently seizing the day after discovering love where he thought he had none (in this case a slowly warming female played by Maggie Gyllenhaal). The now evolving hero blossoms into this glowing hero of a man, inspiring us, the viewer, to look into our own lives and draw an uplifting sense of optimism that we too could better ourselves and get more from life! PLEASE! Don't treat us like children. Don't patronise us with the same stale fell-good story. Don't ruin my opinions of Ferrell, Hoffman and Thompson who have all agreed to take part in this banality. <br/><br/>The next major problem i have with this film is how it knowingly pokes fun at itself. A writer with the inability to make a masterpiece she has become so well known for. A writers block which is causing her novel to drag on and on without closure. This is how the film makes me feel! Please end and release me from this nightmare. Then Hoffman references the fact that there exists only Seven basic plots and eliminates in front of our very eyes all but five of them explaining to Ferrell that his destiny can therefore only follow one of the remaining two. Is this really necessary, again please don't treat us like idiots! Then the narrator with writers block has issues with concluding Ferrell's destiny following one of these two plots. Does the film have to become so narrow that i have a 50% chance of knowing how the film ends?! I should have guessed by now anyway by the mushy feel good crap that is being spoon fed to me and now half way through the film i am angry that i have sat this far through it. I am now to be dragged reluctantly to the anti-climatic ending which leaves me with a ""oh no - please don't let this pathetic moral of an ending be the closing of what is a wasted opportunity of a film idea!"" <br/><br/>It saddens me to realise that yes, there are only seven basic plots that a work of fiction can take and yes, this film, like the life of Ferrell's character, can only follow one of these seven paths but do i need this excuse to be forced upon me to accept that this film may not live up to my expectations. I have seen many films which have been subjected to the same restrictions in plot direction but they have left me with good memories and not an bitter aftertaste. Unfortunately Stranger than Fiction is one of the nastiest aftertastes i have had the misfortune to experience."

It could have been brought into a totally surreal level between writer's block and perhaps a diabolical controlling influence of the protagonist, along with an older female author falling in love perhaps with her younger hero. None of this transpired. Instead we get everybody just about woefully miscast. Linda Hunt wasted. Dustin Hoffman completely miscast as a literature professor and part-time life guard for the faculty (huh?).

Yeah, he's a compulsive counter, we get that from the on-screen graphics. But the knuckle-dragging audience needs at least eight planks on the head to alert them to this.

That it also is that old, over-used statement- the parts more entertaining than the whole- is maybe in part attributable to an inherent structural flaw in the script. After I left the movie I did think about how a person's will may be dictated or not, or what really carries that man to do what he decides to do, or if he tries to do nothing at all (which Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell, does to no avail). Because the story itself is about contrivance, their is an ever-looming air of contrivance in the script too. <br/><br/>It's hard to explain exactly, and Helm was wise to avoid certain pit-falls, such as really giving a 'logical' explanation to how the narrator's writing sticks into Crick's head in the first place, or that it might not just collapse once writer and 'character' meet. But there's still some things that I found a little troublesome- for example, does the narrator dictate the little things that Crick does, or would Crick just do them anyway? What I mean is, how much is determined by what is written or not. There is also the air of questioning where these characters are outside of their set spots in the screenplay- and Crick, albeit not without some interest is not really the kind of character I would think would make for a great subject for a book by a presumably well-renown, recluse author (played in the best way possible in the one-note terms by Emma Thompson).<br/><br/>For the sake of Crick's central change from being very calculated, precisely so, early on, to becoming a man much more based on how he wants to live his life not based rigidly on structure- even in the structure of 'little did he know', which is kind of amusing as a writer myself- there is that sort of contrivance anyway. Yet at the same time, individual scenes are very well written though, and given fresh life by the cast. <br/><br/>Ferrell here, of course, is showing much more of his talents than usual, at doing much more of a grounded, every-day kind of guy who has the extraordinary happen to him. He's always convincing in the part, even in scenes that are awkward or made to really pull up more of his talents than usual. That I would still have a very slight preference for his comedy roles and skills as a satirist/performer may be just subjective, though this- plus his underrated turn in Melinda & Melinda- goes to relay how he can play genuine just as well as silly and fearlessly stupid. Hoffman, as the literature professor who helps out Crick through his crisis at points, is also very good, and their scenes together were some of my favorite in the film. Gyllenhaal works well too as the romantic side for Crick's change in self.<br/><br/>So really, it's a worthwhile trip into what was appropriately called by one critic as 'Charlie Kaufman-lite', as it goes to lengths to be an original work, but at the same time one can't help but know how things will turn out in the end, if only from the immense heap of circumstance given clairvoyance, or vice versa, and that it is, in the end, a work out of Hollywood. Marc Foster's direction does go for little odd touches to add to Helm's writing, such as numbers and lines and such on screen in fast fashion to show Crick's mind working in the form of his life early on. <br/><br/>And the watch means probably as much as the gold watch did in Pulp Fiction in the sense of what it will lead to for the character. That it doesn't feel though completely satisfying in its sort of original send-up is understandable, but partly forgivable; it's the kind of work that gives talented actors some fun and variety, and there are at least a few truly laugh-out-loud funny moments."
"fertilecelluloid","8","3","7","5 November 2006"," Fresh, original piece of Twilight Zone-ish fantasy
","A fresh, original piece in the ""Being John Malkovich"" mode. An IRS auditor (Will Ferrell) becomes aware that his life is being narrated by a writer (Emma Thompson) suffering writer's block (or so we're told). Of course, if she is really blocked, Ferrell would be inert. Anyway, Ferrell is a character in the writer's latest novel who she is determined to kill off. His mission is to find the writer and convince her to stall his demise. Although this is the basic plot, the film explores many issues including identity, conformity and destiny. Directorially, the film has a clarity that is refreshing and an acute sense of invention. The use of a beautiful piece of Vangelis music from another film is inspired. Call it ""Twilight Zone""-lite, but ""Stranger Than Fiction"" deftly balances the fantastique elements with the human aspects. The film's love story, between Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal, is surprisingly subtle and unforced."
"MrPink08","1","6","19","31 May 2008"," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","I sat through Son of the Mask. I survived Spider Man 3. And I barely made through The Ring. But Stranger Than Fiction is the worst film I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but really, Will, what the heck were you thinking when you accepted this? It sounds promising: a comedy starring Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllanhall and Emma Thompson? I'm in! But it the end, the film is a big steaming pile of...y'know.<br/><br/>The plot is promising too. Ferrell plays a depressed IRS agent who has his life narrated by a suicidal author (Thompson) who plans to kill him. While we could've had an Anchorman-esquire comedy with that, we are instead put through visions of Thompson trying to kill herself, Ferrell acting lonely and depressed, and Gyllanhall just being plain annoying. Latifah is given next to nothing to do but roll her eyes at Thompson, and Hoffman does nothing but mumble his few words. I didn't laugh at one scene, unless you count a small chuckle during one of the previews.<br/><br/>I know people praise Ferrell for his performance in this, but I personally hated it. Ferrell sulks on the screen, looking like he wants to chuck himself off a bridge half the time. I like seeing Will Ferrell prancing in an elf outfit, not sulking around Chicago getting into half hearted arguments with a tattooed baker. Overall, a huge disappointment in the career of Will Ferrell. I can only he will recover from it."
"SnoopyStyle","6","2","4","26 April 2014"," Pleasant but unremarkable
","Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a routine driven IRS auditor. The movie starts with a narrator (Emma Thompson) but then he starts hearing her voice one day while brushing his teeth. He is distressed by the voice and breaks him out of his routine. He breaks out of his lonely isolated life when he audits wild angry baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who refuses to pay the part of her taxes for national defense. It turns out that the voice belongs to writer Karen Eiffel. The publisher hired Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) as her assistant. She's blocked trying to figure out how to write Harold Crick's death. Harold is sent to literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) for help.<br/><br/>This feels like a Charlie Kaufman movie except he would have done something more than simple quirky. Director Marc Forster makes a pleasant if somewhat unremarkable movie. It's well made visually simplified film. The sterile feel leaves the movie without the required warmth. Will Ferrell is playing the everyman. This is more quirky than funny. It has a couple of chuckles but nothing too outstanding."
"garydiamond","8","2","4","22 June 2008"," Excellent work all round, plus Will Ferrell's strongest performance to date.
","Stranger Than Fiction a premise that only occasionally crops up in film-making; what if the boundaries between what we perceive as real and our imaginations became inextricably linked? As this is such a hard question to base an entire narrative around, it is a pleasant surprise to see that the film succeeds admirably, mostly due to excellent characterisation and a lean script that doesn't waste a word.<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent who, for most of his adult life, has just been going through the motions without any feelings or attachments to anyone. He comes across as unresponsive and cold; a man so obsessed with numbers that he counts his footsteps and how many strokes he uses while brushing his teeth, and doesn't really come alive until he starts hearing a voice in his head. Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllanhaal) is a free-thinking, fiery local baker who resents paying income tax whom Harold must audit. Jules Hilbert is a literary professor whom Harold asks for advice when he begins to hear a voice in his mind, dictating parts of his life. Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is a frail but acclaimed author with a severe case of writers block, and only through her narrative does the film take shape and intertwine the characters in a way that skillfully explores the concept of 'breaking the fourth wall'.<br/><br/>To say too much about the plot would ruin some of the comedic value and suspense. It is something of a black comedy which is played as dryly as possible for maximum effect. What I can discuss is the performances of the lead characters, which are uniformly excellent. Dustin Hoffman shows how much skill a veteran actor can inject into every nuance seemingly without effort and provides many of the films best lines and physical comedy. Emma Thompson, with assistance from Queen Latifah as her assistant, is convincing as an author trying to wring one last great novel from herself by any means possible.<br/><br/>Of particular note is Will Ferrell, who shows us a skill for drama and monologuing that I would never have expected given his previous 'Frat Pack' output. Instead of using hammy techniques and going for the easy and obvious, his understated subtlety works well as Harold grows into his own life and takes control in a way that had once eluded him. It is a completely straight performance played without irony and works all the better for it.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the script is completely airtight. I can find no flaws, small or large. It is not necessarily the most quotable piece of work found in a film but it doesn't need to be. The pacing backs up the strong writing: never going too fast and cramming in ideas but never going too slowly to drag and bore the viewer. This makes it appealing as it avoids the currently popular choice where 'fast cuts' are used to artificially inflate the sense of tension.<br/><br/>Other points to note. The incidental music is fantastic; whether it is a score or a piece of pop music, the motifs used give the various moments of the film a pleasing cohesion. The titles and subtle use of graphical overlays (mostly in the first act as Harold Crick's methodical life is explained) are very noteworthy, too. Again, small details that add crowning touches to an already impressive motion picture.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is an excellent piece of film-making, proving yet again that big budget special effects and melodramatic performances are not what makes a movie so enjoyable, especially upon repeat viewings. What does matter is characterisation, something that is in abundance here. All the characters have little quirks and tics that make them more tangible and all seem to change and be enriched by the depicted events at the conclusion, finding hidden strengths they weren't aware of and answering all the major questions posed.<br/><br/>It is nice to know that pictures like this are still being made, in between the botched remakes of old classics and excessive cartoon-to-celluloid superhero adaptations. A beautiful piece of work."

","Harold Crick is a symbol of so many lost people out there. Emma Thompson plays a woman who I know I certainly relate to and I'm sure a lot of people would, and Dustin Hoffman who has yet to give a bad performance in my opinion plays the lovable quirky professor to perfection. I adore Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Will Ferell and I went into the movie theatre excited but wasn't expecting the masterpiece of brilliant direction, fantastic script writing and all round excellent acting ( it is arguable that Queen Latifah was miss cast) and if you like to think about life, and humanity then this movie sums it up in a nutshell. It explores the truth in all of us. If you have a scientific mind and can only relate to numbers and sense this movie is for you- if you have a creative artistic mind who can only relate to things of a sensitive and often painful feel then this movie is also for you.

"neil-476","7","2","4","24 August 2007"," Didn't quite do it for me
","First of all, I'm delighted that a film like this got made at all. It doesn't comfortably sit in any mainstream genre - it's downright quirky, and you don't often see the cash forthcoming for a movie without a defined audience. I liked this story.<br/><br/>Second, I'm beginning to think that Will Ferrell is an actor with an astonishing range. I've tended not to like much of what he's done in the past, but I'm coming to understand that this is because I have intensely disliked the characters he's played, and he's played them very well. His character here is much more sympathetic and has an interesting development curve: starting as a cypher (as his written character is, of course, at the start) he fleshes out nicely throughout the film. There is scope for a great deal of subtlety in his performance, and Ferrell delivers.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an attractive performance in a slightly underwritten role, and Dustin Hoffman delivers an OK performance in a very underwritten role. Queen Latifah does well in a role which is hardly there at all.<br/><br/>I don't know if Emma Thompson's performance was what was written, what the director specified, or what she judged was needed - it may be exactly what was intended but, if so, what was intended (and whoever intended it), it was awful. Twitchy, neurotic, depressed - not a character it was easy to feel any sympathy with. And I didn't.<br/><br/>My main problem is that I never fully engaged with the story because I never really felt that it did as much with the concept as I wanted it to. From the charming quirky start, by the final act I felt it had moved into the mainstream and become not so much predictable as conventional. The originality of plot and delivery at the start wasn't sustained through the film's full length.<br/><br/>For all that, I spent most of the running time with a smile on my face, and for all the right reasons."
"daveygandthekeyboard","9","2","4","7 July 2007"," An existential dilemma? A plea to live life to the fullest? Who cares, it's great!
","Stranger Than Fiction, starring Will Ferrell, is about an IRS auditor, Harold Crick, who suddenly realizes his life is being narrated as the main character in a novel that will end in his death. Sudden knowledge of his imminent death results in the inevitable ""Carpe Diem"" approach as he breaks away from his number-oriented, regimented nature to finally live the life he always wanted, learning to play the guitar, and fall in love with the woman from the bake shop whom he is auditing, Ana, played Maggie Gyllenhaal. There are some genuinely heart-warming scenes, notably the ""cookie eating"" scene between Ana and Harold, and the scene with Harold playing the guitar for Ana as a slow-building romance comes to a climax. The idea of this movie is so fascinating to me, as we see the writer (played by Emma Thompson) stressing over how she will ultimately kill her hero, and seeing her hero trying to figure out if he is in a comedy or a tragedy (even at one point keeping score in a book as he initially fails at trying to land Ana). There is not a creative person in the world who hasn't experienced a form of ""creative blockage"" at one point or another. I think seeing Emma Thompson's insanity, constantly envisioning ways to kill her hero, smoking cigarettes that she puts out mid-way, really drives home the frustration, and then the fear that you will ""get it wrong"" as a writer. I enjoyed Dustin Hoffman (one of my all-time favorite actors) as the literary expert Crick consults to help him understand his predicament, who helps him bridge the gap between author and character. His constant coffee swilling and his chemistry with Will Farrell really worked for me. I just really kept hoping that the film would have a satisfying resolution, because it really kept a great premise going. I thought Will Ferrell was great--understated, not over-the-top. The film reminded me of Punch Drunk Love crossed with Being John Malkovich only I enjoyed this much more. An existential dilemma? A plea to live life to the fullest? A goof on the voice-over as narrative convention? I just really liked it: Something quasi-tragic, sweet, that makes people laugh--a great mix."
"Strayer","10","2","4","23 June 2007"," Timeless...
","Just finished this film after I rented it after excruciatingly waiting to rent it for quite some time. Since I first saw the trailer, I was immediately pulled in, as the premise intrigued me: What would we do if our life was narrated to us? Now feeling much better after watching this film, as it finally arrived on DVD in Australia, I feel content, inspired and with several thoughts lingering throughout my mind. This is how a film, in my own personal opinion, should make you feel. It should create a certain emotion, it should make you think and most importantly, it should inspire you in some shape or form.<br/><br/>Everything about the film I enjoyed immensely: The acting was superb, with no real irks or problems that I can see initially. Will Ferrel astounded me as I never would've have though that ""Ron Burgundy"" himself could pull off this role. With his monotonous and dull lifestyle as an IRS Agent setting the stage at the beginning of the film, his slow emergence from his old, drab shell makes the audience connect with Harold Crick, without making the film too sappy. Ferrel's Golden Globe nomination was well-deserved, I think.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal was also quite good, as she always is from what work of hers I've seen. Playing a snide and cynical, yet good-intentioned and warm-hearting Harvard-dropout turned baker, I thought Gyllenhaal pulled off this role nicely.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman...well, it's Dustin Hoffman. I have always admired Mr. Hoffman as a man and a professional, his work pleasing me whenever I watch a film. As the non-nonchalantly, analytical and quick-witted speaking literature professor, Hoffman was everything I hoped for, and more. An example of how well he fit into this role was when he began in one of his first scenes, his character already knowing Crick's habit in the film of always counting things; such as steps and bathroom tiles, just by watching him for a few minutes. Another example is how he shuts down Crick's dubious thoughts on the questions Hoffman poses so quickly with such slick ease.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson was also fantastic, as I've always appreciated how she can play such a quirky and out-of-sync character as if she just slipped on a bath-robe. Her jittery, chain-smoking and frustrated character, drastically compared to her calm and peaceful, yet descriptive narrative tone, just puts a smile on my face.<br/><br/>With these interesting and engaging characters, the story flows seamlessly with no fuss or convoluted mess (I glare at Ocean's Twelve at this point) which creates a very delightful and interesting story which, as I stated before, makes me think. The film deals with the will to face our death head-on, and accept our fate with a smile and a determined glint in our eyes, as Harold Crick by the end finds out that he will die, and why he must.<br/><br/>This brings me to my last point. Near the end of the film, Emma Thompson's character of Karen Eiffel realizes that the character she has been writing about for quite some time, and who she was desperate to kill off, is a real man with a real life. In the end, she has a choice of choosing her original ending, resulting in Harold sacrificing himself and his newfound sense of hope to save a boy from being hit by a bus. Harold knows this will happen after reading the first draft, and is willing to give his life for a poetic and meaningful death, so that a boy can live and a great piece of literature can be published.<br/><br/>Eiffel's other choice, however, is the ending which results in Harold barely surviving the bus collision, with his ever-dutiful wristwatch, who seems to have a ""silent"" personality of its own, sacrificing itself, with a shard of its casing lodging into one of Crick's arteries, blocking the blood flow, causing Harold to live another day. She chooses this ending.<br/><br/>I think the film was also referring to itself in these final moments, as the director chose an ""OK"", yet happy ending (as Hoffman's character puts it) in favor of the more ""great"" and dramatic, yet meaningful conclusion. The plus side is, that the ""OK"" ending says something about life, and how the few second chances it gives you should not be wasted, and that a sacrifice to save someone else, whether it be someone's life or the perfect ending, is always worth it. The ending also has me chuckling, as it ends with a simple, yet well thought out two words:<br/><br/>The End."

","Altought it's a little late to comment about this film, I couldn't avoid to print my small point of view. I saw this movie a couple weeks ago. It really stuck out, I hadn't seen all the good comments about it, that's why I hadn't write something. Let me say that this script is quite sensational, throughout the flick I was eager for discovering what happened in every shot. A original Will Ferrell's performance, it's nice to see different characters of a guy that has a particular line of acting.

","Let me repeat: Do not read this review if you have seen the film. It will spoil an amazing experience. Go see this film. It is incredible. OK, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel that I have to write down some thoughts about this movie. I loved it. It was a really beautiful film. Every aspect of it was executed wonderfully. Marc Forster has proved again that he simply refuses to adhere to convention. He has yet to make two films that even come close to falling into the same category as the others. And in my opinion he gets remarkably better with every passing work. This is, with the exception of Dustin Hoffman, the high point of the careers of everyone involved. Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick as the perfect straight man. This is definitely not Ricky Bobby. The script is amazing. Laugh out loud funny very often, and it damn near made me cry when he got hit by the bus. I'm sure the ending has caused a great deal of irritation among many viewers, and generally I enjoy a good hero's death. But I think his survival was the perfect end to this film. His reaction to the book after he read it was a truly moving moment when he spoke to the author and told her to kill him. It brings up the question of weather its good to die for something or for nothing. That something can be as simple as dieing for a novel or as significant as dieing for a young boys life. What is worth dieing for? When Harold chose to die he chose to die not for the author or for the book, but to make the world a better place. Her book was something special, something that would be important and meaningful to possibly millions of people. And Harold is a man with no significant connections to anyone. In the grand scheme, his life has no meaning except to cause pain to those he audits. His sacrifice for the greater good would make the world a better and happier place. But as his author points out, a man like that should live. I truly enjoyed this film, and it is a shame it missed out on the awards last season. I hope I didn't ruin the movie for you."
"Scotty_Cantwell","9","2","4","7 March 2007"," Funny and insightful
","Of all the films I've seen with Will Ferrell, I have to say that this is my favorite, so far. He is brilliant as Harold Crick, a highly organized (to the point of obsession)and somewhat forlorn IRS agent, who finds his tightly controlled life start to unravel one day when he begins to hear a voice narrating his life as though he were a character in a novel headed for a tragic end. This sets into motion an hilarious series of events that involve a somewhat bohemian baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a Professor of English Literature (Dustin Hoffman), who together with the eccentric novelist (Emma Thompson) narrating him to his apparent end, bring him around to a fresh perspective on life. Granted there is a strong fantasy element here; the idea that a novelist creates a character that just happens to be real in every detail, and that he can actually hear her as she writes about his life, is of course, really ""out there."" Also, the idea that a bohemian baker can relate at all to a very conservatively minded IRS agent challenges also. But honestly, the film charms you so that you can't help but just go with it. This is no superficial comedy that is only designed to trip the funny bone, but is as entertaining as it is insightful about what it really means to live a happy, meaningful life."

Harold Crick, his character in the film, is an IRS associate that goes through what seems like schizophrenia. he then is called to audit Maggie Gylenhaal who is a Harvard-Law dropout who now works at a self-established bakery.

This was potentially an excellent film, what it lacked for me was a clear identity. Was it tragedy, comedy or tragicomedy? It seems the actors weren't quite sure either.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson playing the writer character Kay Eiffel seemed to be going for the lightweight Richard Curtis type Brit comedy style (side note...Emma Thompson always looks like she is ACTING and I can't look at her without thinking ""Jolly Hockey Sticks""...) while Will Ferrell played friendless tax inspector Harold Crick having a much more sombre and darker take on things. I think Will Ferrell had it about right and was excellent, but I think the tone of the film as a whole should have been darker, especially the feeble ""Hollywood"" ending.<br/><br/>Still, It was well worth watching, and Oh, I forgot to say Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana Pascal was gorgeous throughout."

Will Ferrell gives a performance that is much more in his Woody Allen style: small nuances, and an everyman confusion - even the compulsive disorder is played down: nice. As the movie develops the characters become more and more entwined but - and here is the clever part - every character is given enough time and space to make their delivery count - it really is a pleasure to watch, and like a great meal it is not the fare but the experience that really matters and lingers.<br/><br/>A film about life, death, fate, literature, and yet it is handled with a sense that this is entertainment for the more grown-up without being intellectual stodge.<br/><br/>The viewer is left with a very rounded experience - it really engages both the brain and the heart in a way that's all too rare - definitely one to savor and enjoy."

","If you liked or rather loved films like ""Magnolia"", where drama successfully mixes with comedy as well as a little bit extra added by fantasy, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" works on so many levels, thanks to the excellent, complex and in-depth, very smart script and great direction (I'll watch all of your guys films I haven't seen yet, thank you!), perfectiona in casting and exquisite acting by the cast. I also agree about an outlook that Ferrell in my eyes, used to be so very close to that of Sandler in ""Punch Drunk Love"" by Anderson, who did my favourite - ""Magnolia"", and he (Ferrell) pulls it off absolutely brilliantly, perhaps aided by the script and the director, I don't know, but I have gained a lot of respect for previously nearly completely ignored comedy/slash/slapstick actor. Overall this film would probably compete for the place in top 5 of my movies of all time.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to anyone, really, as long as you have a good command of English or your subtitles are on when it comes to DVD. If the synopsis sounds interesting and to you liking, sell your dog, but watch it. I might be on a little bit enthusiastic side, still feeling excited after watching it a few hours ago, but the best way to watch this film would be to have no pre-conception of what it might be like. I only knew it was drama/fantasy/comedy and a very good writing and acting, JR (UK Jonathan Ross) recommended it highly, but that's all I knew, had no idea about the plot - so I was rewarded. Best if you are reading this AFTER you have watched the movie, hence I am marking it as a spoiler, even though it doesn't give away the plot. So it's best vewed unspoiled, with no expectatrion, even to be bad/good."

","This is a gem of a movie. It has fun with a lot of difficult ideas - free will and authorial responsibility to name just two. And in case you didn't spot the games with logic, almost every named character has the name of a famous mathematician or scientist. The early reference to Italo Calvino is another giveaway. This is lovely, elegant, playful movie-making - compare the overlong and clankingly obvious 'Adaptation'. It is also beautifully acted: Thomson just sufficiently OTT, Hoffmann getting on with the job instead of his usual one-man theatre workshop, Gyllenhaal excellent and Ferrell, perhaps surprisingly, up to the task. Plausibility? Strict logic? It's much more intelligent than that."

","This is a story about a man named Harold Crick, and his wristwatch. Those are the first line you hear Emma Thompson say over the action. The wristwatch actually plays quite a large role in this film- it really determines the ending. And though your first thought might be that this would be a ridiculous film, think again. This film is excellent.<br/><br/>It's a story about a man, Harold(Will Ferell, in one of his best roles), who has lived his entire life in the most ordered and planned way possible- he does the exact same thing everyday. I mean, the man counts his brush strokes every morning while brushing his teeth! Then one day, he begins to hear a voice that is quite hilariously narrating his life. Then, the voice says he will die. Harold freaks, and sets off to try and discover what he can do about this very serious problem, and by doing so he starts a brand new life that will make him do things he never dared to do before. And yes, he stops counting his brush strokes.<br/><br/>Smartly, the film never comes off as heavy-handed or overly-dramatic. It keeps a light and very humorous tone throughout the whole film while still delivering a great story. Will Ferell gives a very sweet performance as Harold, and you can really connect with him as he changes. Dustin Hoffman is also good as the literary expert who Harold seeks out to help him discover who the voice narrating in his head. Queen Latifah does fine in her rather small part, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is enchanting and sweet as the woman Harold falls in love with. The best part of the film, though, is Emma Thompson's captivating performance as the author who is narrating in Harold's head and so desperately trying to kill him off in her latest book. She gives on of the best performances of the year and makes herself the stand-out of the film by far. But, we've come to expect such great performances of Ms. Thompson. She gives one of her best in this film.<br/><br/>This is an over-all fun, original, funny, and very sweet film. I've seen it twice in theaters, and plan to buy it on DVD. The underlying message about living your life for the best it can be, and the overlying sweetness and light-heartedness of the film work together perfectly to create one of the best films of the year. 9/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","I never thought I live to see the day that I would say, Will Ferrel is starring in a smart movie. So now that hell has frozen over (not really, but still) I can not understand why this film did not do better with the awards shows. I mean I saw Little Miss Sunshine because everyone was raving about it but I didn't think this film was particularly clever, or engaging I only thought it was a well constructed film that is ultimately pathetic because of it subject matter; a dysfunctional family who have no redeeming qualities outside of the fact that they stick together. Yet it is Little Miss Sunshine that gets the nod from critics and the academy.<br/><br/>The characters in Stranger than Fiction are normal 9 to 5'ers who go about living their lives as most of us do. There is our star Harold who is the boring IRS agent who needs to loosen up. Ana the baker who who recklessly tries to make the world a better place by not paying the IRS its full amount in taxes, (a hearty cheer from me for her stance on taxes). The Professor who decides to deduce the identity of the voice in the IRS agents head as well as acting as a life coach. And the Narator herself who is a brilliant author who kills off every character in her books. Like all great stories you want to be interested in the people you're devoting two hours to and all these characters have engaging personalities.<br/><br/>The characters all gravitate around the plot of Harold hearing the voice of the Nararator in his head. Through out the movie the film keeps you guessing whether Harrold really exist or is he a figment of the author's imagination and vice versa but it turns out that they both are real and this is a real situation. By the end of the film the story is not about the voice inside of Harrold's head but facing the truth of certain aspects and/or situations in these characters' lives. In the end both Harold and the Narrator both learn to be free of their ruts in life by stepping up and doing what is right and noble. In the end both mild manner Harold and the acclaimed author sacrifice their selves for the greater good and because of it you walk out of that film feeling better than when you left it."
"JoeJames76","8","2","4","24 January 2007"," Stranger and Better than what's out there
","Perhaps the most interesting concept in mainstream film this year, Stranger than Fiction has Ferrell playing the character in Thompson's newest novel, though he just recently has become aware of his status as fictional character. The idea is brilliant, much in the vein of Charlie Kaufman's crazy ""plot within a plot"" films like Adaptation, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the entire cast is up to the task of making the most mileage out of this quirky concept. Ferrell's crazed lunacy works wonders here, as his everyman abilities blend nicely with his penchant to spazz out in full improvisation mode. He equally carries the romantic, psychological, and comedic sub plots with ease, effortlessly engaging with his co-stars.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal deftly handles another May-December romance, adding to her growing resume. She and Ferrell have a bizarre chemistry that you'd think you'd only find in a novel (or a film), further adding to the perplexity of the film's converging plot lines. She is sexy and charming, but believably drawn to Ferrell in way that's hard to explain, without the help of Hoffman's literary professor character.<br/><br/>Hoffman continues his career resurgence, as he is quickly morphing his history of brilliant leading man turns into stellar supporting roles that are upstaging his co-stars. Here he propels the film forward by guiding Ferrell's character arc and bridging the two major plots together. Hoffman demonstrates his comedic prowess in both physical and lyrical delivery, and is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Finally, Thompson, who is normally one of my most hated screen foils for no reason other than she's the type of Brit that irritates me, rather than entices me, is quite charming as the writer of the entire piece. Thankfully, her screen time is limited, though she delivers well, much as she did in Love Actually.<br/><br/>This film has to be seen, possibly multiple times, to be fully appreciated. You will enjoy it on a multitude of levels.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"stevewatson","9","2","4","22 January 2007"," Brilliant, but beware the ending!
","Two strangers, he refusing to engage with life, she grappling with death, find their lives and purposes inverted in this surprising film - one that is remarkably difficult to review without revealing the delicious loops that make it such a pleasure to watch!<br/><br/>Tragedy speaks of the inevitability of death, while comedy rejoices in the continuation of life (to quote)  but good storytelling weaves with both colour threads, and the bittersweet realisation that it's the very brevity of life that makes it precious informs this extraordinary film. Drawing on the toolbox of magic realism, we're made privy to the severely delimited world of Harold Crick, an IRS agent with iron grip on the numbers  the number of steps to his bus stop, the number of strokes it takes to brush his teeth, the numbers on the myriad forms with which he fills his carbon-copy working days. He is obsessive-compulsive disorder made flesh, and living in a minimalist cube decorated with all the wit and style of a concrete bunker, strongly symbolic of his own emotional state. That is, until an implacable voice begins narrating his life and impending death, disrupting the perfectly linear, measured and yet meaningless existence he's constructed. Frantically seeking to shut out the voice, he lets the world in, and finds meaning instead.<br/><br/>Graphically beautiful and unafraid of using both technology and beautifully framed shots filmed with lingering care to take us right into the author's mind, it's a delight to watch. Around Crick, iPod-white lines, forms, words and vectors sprout folding out, back, into and beyond the frame like virtual origami, making visible the boundaries within which he constrains himself, only to be matched and then beaten back by the rich, real colours of an alternative way of life; the moment in which he savours a cookie, perhaps for the first time, drew a collective sigh from row D this past Saturday night. The feel of the movie slips effortlessly from bleeding edge music video chic into scratched 35mm French film, and takes us along, smiling.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal's performances gleam in the firmament, and are outshone only by the incandescence of the twin stars. Emma Thompson delivers a master class, and is matched and even sometimes surpassed by the unexpected leading light of the show, Will Ferrell. Emerging from the long dark night of cult comedy, Ferrell is incredible, and his moment of epiphany is heartbreaking, coming as it does after we've all sweated and squirmed through his clumsy attempts to connect with those around him. It's not full of angst though, and there are brilliantly funny moments  watch out for the present Ferrell takes Gyllenhaal.see if you get the joke, because I didn't until it was (slowly) explained to me! The direction, by Marc Forster, is superb, and clearly Ferrell and Forster found a unity of purpose that shines through. As the show toboggans down the slope of inevitability, we all know how it should end, but just as life always surprises us, so does the movie. You may find the ending ironic or disappointing depending on your mood. Despite thinking that someone somewhere caved in to a test audience poll, I still liked it. <br/><br/>This is a must-see."
"akesson-lale","9","2","4","22 January 2007"," An unexpected but appreciated result of my visit at the movie theater.
","The other day, my friends and I decided that we wanted to go see the new Scorsese movie; The Departed. As we are not the kind of people who plan our lives to the fullest extent, we had made no reservations and had no idea whether it was playing during day time or not. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, The Departed was not on for another couple of hours, and watching any movie weighed over waiting for 6 hours to see the departed, and so we decided to see the new Will Ferrell movie; Stranger than Fiction.<br/><br/>None of us had even heard the title of the movie and it's safe to say that we all expected a somewhat silly, but oh-so terribly amusing, classic Will Ferrell comedy. How wrong we were. This was a movie to completely change my perception of Will Ferrell, and I appreciate him even more after having seen him in this drastically more serious role. He has proved himself a versatile, highly skillful actor in my book. Hoffman and the rest of the cast also play very well in the movie and the script is amazing. The movie offers much excitement and triggers many emotions. Good job!"
"KUAlum26","10","2","4","20 January 2007"," Too many thoughts to put into one summary line
","Stuff like ""Critics of Will Ferrell need see this movie and reconsider"" or ""Charlie Kaufmann and Spike JOnze could've wrote this!"" were some of the ideas that came to mind to sum the way I felt about this movie,but they really couldn't do this justice. THere's plenty of themes being played with in this off-beat,gentle and existential comedy,and I'm gonna TRY to cover all of them in this comment/review.<br/><br/>FBI auditor HArold Crick(Will Ferrell,as docile and somber as he's EVER been in film to this point)lives the highly ordered,lonely lifestyle of someone who would be considered a nearly hermit-like control freak. Numbers,stats and equations are very much the gatekeepers of order in his world,and he approaches his job,just like everything else,with a sense of professionalism and efficiency. He has few friends,no discernible family,and has no great ambitions and goals in life.<br/><br/>Somewhere through the order of work and life4,two things create a disruption:the interest he's feeling stir in him over a pretty,bakery manager he's about to audit(Maggie Gyllenhaal,whose large,pretty facial features and warm,sexy body language are as enticing as I've witnessed of any female lead in a comedy) and the small matter of a narrator's voice that has been correctly and acutely describing Harold's life that he(And only he)can hear. When he discovers that the voice is not only accurately describing every element of his life,but is hinting at his imminent demise,he starts to slowly realize that while he may be the center of his own narrative world,he is most certainly not in control of it.<br/><br/>While this happens,dyspeptic author and recluse KAren ""KAy"" Eiffel(Emma Thompson,who looks like she's been on a steady diet of black coffee,cigs and little-or-no sleep for weeks)wrestles with writer's block over her next novel,which has been on hold for over a decade. Sent to her is a no-nonsense editor's assistant(Queen Latifah,who is showing that she can dial it up as well as down with equal amounts of effectiveness) there to help tighten her finishing of the novel she's trying in great frustration to finish. The book Kay is trying to finish involves the mundane life and appropriate-yet-somewhat ironic demise of one very unremarkable character,one by the name of HArold Crick.<br/><br/>As HArold tries to track the source of his distress,through shrinks and anyone who'll listen,he instinctively goes for the counsel of a English professor and literary expert named Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman,paternal,droll and patient;not qualities ordinarily admired in a performance for films,but very necessary here,and as such,very well done!),who tries to infuse guidelines for whether or not Harold's life falls into two basic literary constructs:comedy or tragedy. While HArold's quest to find a clear difference between the two elements seems to yield mixed results,it starts to clear things gradually to the IRS auditor that his life needs a narrative direction,and he may or may not have much time to figure that out.<br/><br/>Directed by untraceable auteur Marc Forrester(unless YOU can link MOnster's Ball and Finding Neverland to this type of film) and written by relative new-by scribe Zack Helm,this movie would be oh SO easy to pigeonhole as an existential comedy or light drama,but it feels like more than that. It's kind of a knowing Dramady,a film and story that understands the constructs of narrative creation,and has the ingenuity to parallel that across the type of mundane,unextraordinary lives that ordinary people live. Ferrell shows great restraint in the role as Crick,but really everyone here seems to fit their roles with ease. Even minor parts such as the one friend Crick considers from work(Tony Hale)or the two shrinks who seem helpless in finding the root of his dilemma(Linda HUnt and a hirsute,heavy and unrecognizable Tom Hulce) are added with the right measure. This is a film that may test the patience of more direct,linear film-goers,and the ending(and this as close a spoiler I'm giving)seems to be somewhat of an awkward fit for the way this film builds, but this is arguably a very memorable movie and it somewhat defies an easy description. See it for yourself,and see if you don't agree."

","This was a great movie with one exception. When I go to see a movie that costs millions to make and contains big name stars, I expect for the editors to be able to remove the microphones that kept dangling over Will Ferrel's head and some of the co-stars. It was very annoying and distracted me from the conversations important to the plot. Not just once, about 15 times. Not just a little microphone, the entire microphone. Luckily, it started happening just over halfway into the movie. Unluckily, it was during the ""epiphany"" and most important part of the film.<br/><br/>Other than that, Will Ferrel was the perfect fit for this movie. I went into the theater expecting another goofy, silly performance. What I got was real, or as real as a movie with this plot can get. A genuine performance!<br/><br/>Very rarely will Will Ferrel be comically outdone in a film, and especially not by Dustin Hoffman.

But the script was an insult to the average moviegoers IQ. The story within the story really could not have been as exciting as we're forced to believe. Then there was only one vaguely memorable joke (the ""flowers"") which, as with most other lines in this movie, was repeated a few times as if we're incapable of hearing it the first time. Then the end - without spoiling it - was just not believable. There was so much more that could've been done with the idea, but unfortunately Stranger than Fiction comes across as a contrived, forgettable first draft at what should've been brilliant."
"Mxzplk","Null","2","4","12 January 2007"," A Taste to Acquire: In Stranger than Fiction, Will Ferrell after all shows what he came for
","In 1995, in his first season in Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrel was voted by the public the worst comedian of the history of the show. Seven years later, when he left the post, was elected by popular vote as the best name of all that has passed through the series, taking off the race competitors like John Belushi and Steve Martin. There is two possible explanations for this discrepancy, and one doesn't exclude the other: Ferrel is a taste you acquire; and he is capable of adapting, improving and learning. In Stranger than Fiction, the validity of the second hypothesis is specially evident. For the first time, Ferrel shows himself less as a comic and more as an actor. In the film directed by Marc Forster, of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland, he interprets Harold Crick, a blank tax inspector that, in the lack of any clearer meaning in life, replaces it by numbers and method. Harold brushes his teeth 36 times on the vertical, and others 36 times on the horizontal. Chronometers by the seconds the time he has to be at the bus stop, and makes on his tie a simple Windsor knot, because the double knot would consume a whole other minute of his day. The reason that his habits becomes so transparent to him and for the audience is that, in a certain moment, Harold starts to hear a voice inside his head - a woman's voice, British, that narrates every one of his gestures with style, and better choice of words, that he would not be capable of using.<br/><br/>With the help of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman), Harold discovers that he became the character of a romance that is being written by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). In serious existential and creative crisis, the novelist fight to finish her work the way she is known of - by killing the protagonist. Harold, naturally, wants to convince Kay to change the ending. And the movie, written with considerable astuteness and sweetness by scriptwriter Zach Helm, has to show why she should, or not, change her masterpiece to hinder the premature ending of a so insignificant man. The way out of this dead end is above all in the performance of Ferrell, that gives to his usual persona, of the fool who does not know that he is fool (his imitation of George W. Bush is quite famous), a whole new dramatic sense: of even the people which you're used to disdain can hold unsupicious moves of greatness. What goes for the character, and also for his actor."

POSSIBLE SPOILER: I was tearing up at several points in the movie, particularly when he handed the ms. back to Kay Eiffel and said ""I loved it."" <br/><br/>I'd like to comment on Emma Thompson's portrayal of an author. I know a lot of fiction authors (it's my line of work and, well, it makes for good parties :D ) and I could see some of them in her characterization. It ~felt~ real. The self-absorption was certainly fun. :) <br/><br/>The rest of the primary characters were very good, too. Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job as an English Lit. professor. Maggie Gyllenhaal was delicious, bubbly, and the perfect yin to play off Will Ferrel's yang and, as always, I would follow Queen Latifah anywhere. Hell, even the ~sound track~ was good! I'm going to go buy a CD in January if I don't find one in my stocking next week. :) <br/><br/>I would love to see more of Will Farrell like this. Sure, I may be one of the few people who enjoyed ""Bewitched""--though that was for Nicole Kidman as much as anything--but I think that the fluffier stuff he's been doing has been... well, fluffy.

"pyrocitor","7","2","4","8 December 2006"," Magic Realism
","After seeing your average movie, the audience departs with a fairly cut and dry, black and white sense of whether the movie was good or bad, and can point out exactly the high points, and what needed fixing up. And then every once in a while, along comes a movie like Stranger than Fiction, which provides no such easy answers. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical loud, obnoxious Will Ferrell comedy  it isn't. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical Hollywood story about change and redemption  it isn't that either. Don't even walk in expecting the most standard genre of Charlie Kaufman style ""weird for the sake of weird"", because although this may be a closer fit than the other subheadings, it still fails to encompass everything Stranger than Fiction is.<br/><br/>While it's true Stranger than Fiction does have a premise similar to the time worn story of progressive change and redemption complete with happy ending, the film is far too clever to fall into such trappings. Or is it? It becomes difficult to tell when director Marc Foster, who has proved himself immensely capable with such past hits as Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland and screenwriter Zach Helm are making intelligent social comment or self reflection and when it seems like they've lost control of their movie entirely and have little idea of what it is turning into. What should have turned out to be a quirky masterpiece ultimately ends up as less than such. There are moments of inspired genius, yes, but there are also unquestionably weak and uninteresting periods, which do serve to drive the message of isolation home, but in the end, a social comment on a boring life still comes across as well boring.<br/><br/>However, the film also may succeed more as a philosophical message than black comedy, with musings on the concepts such as pre-determination and fatalism (the philosophical banter between Dustin Hoffman's literary professor character and the nonplussed Ferrell are among the film's high points) which also come across as frustratingly underdeveloped ideas, since the concepts hinted at are fascinating. Such is the case for many aspects of the film  they are simply hinted at, when a more in depth look might have proved far more intriguing. But once again, all the way through, the viewer is given a sense that Foster knows exactly what he is doing, and there is a reason for the frustratingly sparse nature of such concepts. Or not. The film does indeed provoke many such questions and will without doubt raise heated discussions, but it's not the kind of powerful piece of work which changes lives  simply a quirky, charmingly unconventional and frequently frustrating self-reflection piece.<br/><br/>With a less talented cast, the idea never would have come into fruition properly, but with the ensemble of charismatic actors Foster has assembled, what might have been a very shaky film comes across as less shaky. Ferrell is refreshingly subdued as the solitary IRS agent, managing to infuse his performance with just enough sparkle for him to not come across as just as uninteresting as the character he is portraying. Maggie Gyllenhaal's character does become frustratingly predictable at parts, but she gives such a luminous performance we forgive her in our minds. But it's in the quirky supporting characters the film really draws its strength from, especially the always reliable Dustin Hoffman, perfectly understated as a literary professor examining Ferrell's predicament, and the scene-stealing Emma Thompson's delightfully quirky take on the struggling author persona.<br/><br/>Is Stranger than Fiction a masterpiece, sure to make viewers re-consider their lives? No. But is it an interesting and quirky watch, with a great cast giving charming and eccentric performances and moments of creative brilliance that carry the film through its weaker and more frustrating aspects? Yes. Should it be considered recommended? Yes, but be advised that seeing the movie having heard as little about it as possible would be a wise idea, as most everyone is likely to have a different take on such an oddball movie, and you'll want to keep an open mind.<br/><br/>-7/10"

The premise I thought was a little silly and artificial although I enjoy fantasy or allegory in general. <br/><br/>Also, this had to be one of the strangest set design philosophies I have ever seen in a film. Whether residential, commercial, or institutional settings were portrayed, there was no carpeting and stark, bare, minimalist sets lacking furnishings to a bizarre degree.

","As a writer, I do not see how the ending could be poetic. American Beauty is a far more poetic movie than this. I feel a similar movie is ""Hero"", which starred Dustin Hoffman. A very ordinary man becomes a hero. One knows the ending is going to involve saving the child on the bicycle, which is foreshadowed in the accident the author character Kay imagines sitting across from a bridge. I still hoped that the ending would be poetic, especially after Kay sees the apple rolling in the street along the sidewalk, but I was sadly mistaken.

It's like a symphony of several fine-tuned instruments building to a crescendo, only to go out with a wheeze. <br/><br/>So much more could have been done with the relationship between the assistant and the author (Queen Latifah is sorely under-used). And why, when we've set up the tragedy of the author's life, does she not get to confront her own personal tragedy? Surely, she has suicide on the mind. And why does Harold blithely accept his fate when his life is finally looking up and, as he so freely admits, ""I know nothing about literature""? He's a lamb to the slaughter when he should be an angry son of a bitch (see Adam Sandler in the much-better ""Punch Drunk Love""). Why does the literary psychologist gloss over his own personal failures to insist that Harold accept his fate? Shouldn't such a moment resonate with the failed-writer-now-professor/lifeguard? And why does the baker/love interest have NOTHING to do except look cute and seduce Harold? <br/><br/>I loved the absurdity of it all -- the odd questions posed by Hoffman (""Are you king of anything? You know, a bowling alley? The trolls?""). I also loved the concept of Harold trying to figure out if his life is a tragedy or a comedy based on how often his girlfriend screams at him. ""Stranger that Fiction"" certainly succeeds in creating a much more humane story than the sometimes-obtuse ""I Heart Huckabees."" But, still, this is a work of fiction in which every character is sacrificed in the name of a high-minded concept -- a concept which may leave you smiling in the end, but not after you've scratched your head and wondered where all the characters went."

","For whatever reason, I was highly anticipating this movie. Maybe it was because of the plot, or the all-star cast, or maybe just because the trailer for this movie looked cool. I can't say I was disappointed with this movie, but it wasn't what I had expected. The acting was great, Will Ferrell playing a loner named Harold Crick, and Emma Thompson playing the moody and slightly depressed author Kay Eiffel. The plot was fun; the thought of a woman's voice following a man around had always amused me. But the problem is I don't think the movie lived up to its name. It seemed to branch off, with the narrating going away, 30 minutes into the film and predictable love hook=ups emerged that EVERYBODY saw coming even though it didn't seem possible. Although this movie is described as a comedy, I didn't laugh once the whole film, it was a bit more of a love story, which disappointed me. Because of the fact that the movie had a good plot and the acting was great, it could've been a lot better, therefore getting 3 out of a possible 5 stars.<br/><br/>Final Words: Unsatisfying."

","The character in the movie is able to hear the narrator and eventually realizes his life is actually written by an author.

","What distinguishes literature from cinema? Among other things, one distinction (as with theatre) is the necessity of performance. What is written must be enacted. It is for this reason that a narrative like ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is best realized in a theatrical or cinematic context.<br/><br/>Arguably, the meta-narrative in a cinematic context would have been better served if the author (played by Emma Thompson) had been a screenwriter (at the risk of eliciting unwanted comparisons with ""Adaptation"")."

","Funnily enough, 'Stranger Than Fiction (2006)' is, well, strange. I mean, it's an amalgam of so many genres and ideas that it's difficult to ultimately describe. It moves from being a fantasy-based, quirky comedy to a more straightforward romantic comedy and then decides to bring the fantasy elements back (in a much more oblique way) to craft a schmaltzy ending chock full of anti-routine, generically 'life is good' messaging. Seriously, there's a good chunk where the most major hook of the movie just sort of disappears. Even when it returns, it's never really explained or fully explored. There are also some tonal inconsistencies and moments which are played so seriously they actually come full circle and are funny. It's a weird mix, for sure. Thankfully, the majority of the piece is pact and enjoyable, with good, likeable performances and a chuckle-worthy script. It's far more unique than this sort of stuff usually is, too. It's pretty consistently entertaining, even if it doesn't always feel entirely cohesive. 7/10"

","You will know exactly what the title of this review means when you choose to see this movie. My review title is THE climax of the movie. The absolute point of no return. And it has all to do with simple writer's block. Now you still dont know anything and that's the way it should be, because this story deserves to be discovered without knowing exactly what is going to happpen. It enhances the fun a lot. I have seen it over 10 times now and I still enjoy it to the fullest. Never understood why little children want to hear the same fairytale stories again and again, till I noticed myself that some movies just enchant me that much that I just can't get enough of them.<br/><br/>This movie is really heartwarming. But it is slow. I love that, but some dont. And this gem is heavily relying on dialogue and plot. Those who like reading books might be especially interested. Those who are more interested in the intelligent arthouse films will probably adore this gem as well. But those longing for a simple straight comedy might not understand the subtle humor and find it boring. <br/><br/>I cant guarantee you will like this movie, but I can guarantee you that this movie is special because of it's story. Really special. This story is clever, yet simple and heartwarming simultaneously. I had never seen anything like it. When I will tell you that it is about a man called Harold Crick whose destiny is totally controlled by a writer, it might sound awfully silly. It is silly, but portrayed magnificently by Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. You just gotta see it to believe it. <br/><br/>The story is about Will Ferrel who is playing a hilariously boring tax editor. Suddenly he starts hearing a woman's voice in his head. He fears he is losing his mind. But after some research he finds out he is a character in Emma Thompsons new novel. And everything she writes, starts happening to him. Sounds bizarre. Might seem childish. But it is honestly the best script I have seen in years. And brilliantly directed by director Marc Foster, known from World War Z (Brad Pitt), Quantum Solace (James Bond), Finding Neverland (Johnny Depp), Monsters Ball (Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry) and The Kite Runner. This director has made the most varied choices in movie styles amongst all the directors I know. He can make action, comedy, drama or everything in between. The man has got the talent to create any world for any audience with total credibility and wonderful imagination. Remember that name! Marc Foster.<br/><br/>Acting is always paramount. However good a story might be, without good acting the story wont be credible. Fortunately it is because of a tremendous cast: Will Ferrel as well as Emma Thompson play one of the best roles of their carreers. They are just to die for. Will Ferrell usually is associated with blunt teen comedies, being dressed up as an elf or something. Now he is acting seriously. Well on the edge of serious and funny. Emma Thompson is almost unrecognizable as an writer in despair, bordering on psychosis. Supporting roles by Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman, how much better can it get?<br/><br/>I love this movie. I truly love it. It stimulates my thinking, it caresses my solitude, it lifts me up when I am down. I just feel wonderful after seeing it again and again..."

","This was an original, very creative script. Yes, it is based on the most common of all Hollywood themes that one should not sleepwalk through life with a mind numbing job, etc. with Hollywood's required antidote being passion which is usually given as quick sex rather than a rich romance. However, the novel approach was fresh and thoroughly engaging. If you're a ""film-aholic"" like me and seen thousands of films, this is a major blessing. It was a somewhat complex concept yet there seemed to be no loose ends or inconsistencies. It was all the better with strong performances by all. Will Ferrel is great and funny, but don't expect a typical Will Ferrell movie with lots of slapstick and physical comedy - through most of the movie Will is actually at the other end of the spectrum playing a ""sleepwalking"" IRS agent. Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman both gave fantastic performances which added to the enjoyment. Queen Latifah and Maggie Gyllenhaal also gave strong performances."

","Stranger Than Fiction is totally worth watching. It starts with a clever twist with hearing a narrator voice which draws in right away. The acting is good enough for me. Will Ferrell was perfectly cast for his lead role. His comically dramatic performance was spectacular. The dialogues were decent, no more no less. I have mixed feelings about the plot. It was really good up till the end when the narrator is found. I feel like the story became cheesy at that point. The way the professor explains that this story is her masterpiece and the way that Harold gets over it and says it's OK to kill him... OH COME ON! And I didn't understand what was his watch all about. One piece of magic wasn't enough? Other than that it's a good heartwarming film, definitely recommended."

","I would want to let people know that the movie is very optimistic and how to be open minded even for simple stuff. I felt about the movie was very interesting and it seems like as if you wanted to write it as a book. I've learned that not everyone can live forever as you want and that it's like being a pet you're alive for a certain time then you're gone but your spirits never go away. <br/><br/>People are different and that you live it the way you want it to. If everyone in the world did the same thing all the time then it wouldn't be different. I am writing this for the people that haven't seen the show before and to explore what's out there in life. Books have a similar story than the movie because maybe you want the movie a little more interesting than the book and to make the story more understandable then you think. <br/><br/>First he wanted to see more into people then the met outside then they continued at her place and it ended at the hospital. I know by watching the movie and putting it in my own words of what I think of it. Other people might think of the same thing of what you think. Yea the whole paragraph is going to be different than what it says on the back of the movie cover. The reader needs and wants to know how the story went in the movie.<br/><br/>I love the movie because of how the whole story plays out and the background of the scenes. I don't like Will Farrell's hair that makes her look a lot older. My favorite line is ""If you have someone who willingly, knowingly, goes to his death, well. Isn't that the kind of person you want to keep alive?"" I like Professor Jules Hilbert the way he gives the meaning of life and explaining it. I like the scene when Harold sings his song that he made. <br/><br/>This is a Summary about Harold Crick and his wristwatch. Harold Crick is an obsessively neat IRS agent, which infuriates his watch. Soon after the watch incident, Harold starts hearing a woman's voice narrating his life, which also predicts his ""imminent"" death.<br/><br/>Psychiatrists attribute it to schizophrenia, so he asks a literary professor named Jules Hilbert to help him. Meanwhile, he has to audit Ana Pascal, a baker who refuses to pay the part of her taxes that go to corporate sponsorship. <br/><br/>Ana quickly decides that she hates Harold, but Harold has developed a crush on her. The author, Karen Eiffel, is having writer's block, trying to figure out what Harold's imminent death is. Professor Hilbert gets Harold to try a number of experiments to determine whether his story is a comedy or tragedy, and Harold eventually determines that it's a comedy because of a romantic encounter he has with Ana. Hilbert, however, thinks that in order for it to be a comedy, Harold should pursue his dream, so Harold goes out and buys an old used Fender Stratocaster.<br/><br/>Karen, meanwhile, stumbles across the perfect ending to her book. At around the same time, Harold and Ana sleep together, and Harold finds out through an old tax return that Karen Eiffel is the author, so he calls her. She's distraught when she meets Harold, and is worried that all the other characters she's killed in her other books might have been real, too. <br/><br/>Karen gives Harold an early draft of the book, including the ending where he dies. He's too afraid to read it, so he gets Hilbert to read it, who thinks it's one of the greatest endings ever written and that Harold has to die. Harold reads it, and feels the same way. The next day, because of his wristwatch's error, Harold, normally on time, is 3 minutes early for the bus. Since he read ahead, he knows his death is closing in but he saved a little kid and so his watch was destroyed from the bus."

","The movie Stranger than Fiction was a very weird movie Harold, the main character had the same routine everyday for a very long time. One day he just randomly started to hear a voice of a women, and she was basically narrating his life. Harold was getting aggravated and annoyed hearing the same voice in his head all the time. He thought he was going insane, so he decided to go see someone to talk to. Because the voice in his head said he was going to die. At first the guy thought he was completely insane, but he came to realize Harold was telling the truth. Harold did not understand why this was happening to him, he was scared out of his mind, because he did not want to die. It seemed like everything bad was happening to him all at once.<br/><br/>All in all the movie was good!It had me laughing at some parts.

The idea of the story was intriguing right from the beginning, I don't remember looking away from the screen throughout the whole film. The acting from the whole cast was excellent but you have to hand it to Will Farrell, take a comedian and give him a serious part because he'll blow it out of the water. His emotion throughout the whole film was still realistic yet powerful as he slowly and progressively retrieves his mind from the brink of dropping it completely. Of course the ""ANSWER ME"" scene is my example. He's agitated by a 'voice' only to hear the term 'imminent death'. He arrives home demanding to hear the once unwelcome voice for an explanation. I felt myself getting pretty increasingly stressed when he kicked the lamp and rampaged through his mini closet for a trigger for the voice, ending his fit screaming ""ANSWER ME"" into the mirror, and it's at this point that he fully displays the stress of being overwhelmed, pushed to the brink and feeling as if you've been hijacked. Even while typing it my eyes are dampening and my breath is becoming needy and uneven. The only other movie where I've seen a character force their feelings upon the viewer was Si the photo guy in One Hour Photo. This is the only serious role I've seen Will take, it was also the only role I've seen Emma Thompson perform and I was instantly a fan. I'm not a sucker for the 'quirky one', I actually thought her role was terrific through her portrayal.<br/><br/>Since I alerted spoilers I have no advise for seeing the movie, so just go watch it again"

","There's a reason I largely pass on films featuring Saturday Night Live alumni. They usually capitalize on obnoxious behavior that passes for humor while appealing to the lowest common denominator. One such example would be Will Ferrell as a business executive showing up at a board meeting wearing nothing but his underwear. I don't consider myself a prude, but I have better things to do at midnight on a Saturday.<br/><br/>This was something a bit different. Ferrell wasn't behaving badly, in fact for a good part of the picture, his character Harold Crick was pretty much boring. But the larger story seemed compelling enough to hold one's attention, knowing that somehow, some way, Harold Crick couldn't die, and it would take the sheer will of author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) to make it happen, or not happen, or, well you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Apart from their more than obvious age disparity, the romantic angle between Ferrell's character and the bakery lady (Maggie Gyllenhaal) generally worked well enough to carry the story forward. The cookie routine was kind of sweet, and played well to the date movie crowd that this seemed to be aimed at. The larger theme of making the life you've always wanted gets kind of lost in pictures like this, but there was a semblance of it here if you were willing to look for it. On a grander scale, the hero may die so the story can live forever, but come on, this is a Will Ferrell movie so it can only get so deep.<br/><br/>Say, did anyone else notice that Dustin Hoffman was barefoot when he counseled Will Ferrell?"

","The first time I heard about this movie, I thought it was going be a slapstick comedy. The movie is much more dramatic, but still funny in a few spots. The plot is about an IRS agent who lives his entire life alone and everything he does-figuratively and literally-is controlled by his stop watch. A weird thing happens one day when he starts hearing an author narrating his life. The author is in control of his plans, his love interest and (possibly) his death. The story is very interesting and creative. The acting was great, too. I recommend that you should see this movie if you enjoy books, movies or if you just want to kill time. My Rating: ***/****"

"brighambartol","9","0","0","20 May 2012"," An amazingly thoughtful comedy
","It is rare that a comedy of such great originality and thoughtfulness graces the screens. On the immediate level, this is a delightful and sometimes touching movie about a man caught in absurd and hilarious circumstances. It is populated by quirky characters who are brilliantly portrayed - Will Ferrell as the neurotic workaday man with the mundane life; Dustin Hoffman as the eccentric and oddly forthright professor; and Emma Thomson as the author, an equally eccentric but also gravely cynical and isolated character. The absurd scenario of a man discovering that a voice is narrating his life allows these colourful characters to bounce off each other, and the results are brilliant.<br/><br/>Yet this movie is so much more than just that. One could write pages upon pages about the subject matter brought up by this brilliant plot - questions of fate, identity, and love. Harold must face the very real fact that his fate is not in his own hands - and yet, simultaneously, he begins to slowly change himself in the wake of his changing life. And what happens when someone discovers one's creator, and opens up the very real possibility of that creator discovering their creation?<br/><br/>Whether you want to be delighted by a quirky comedy with an endearing love story, or you want to share endless conversations about the messages and implications of such a wonderful story, Stranger Than Fiction will prove a very enjoyable film."

","Stranger Than Fiction is a different sort of movie. It's a comedy/drama/romance that questions the lines of fiction and non-fiction, without using the cliché ""fourth wall"" tactics. It answers a question many writers have often wondered, ""what if my characters where real?"" <br/><br/>Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is a struggling author who is working on a new book chronicling the life of a man called Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). Harold is a rather boring IRS agent who lives a very strict, regimented life without much recreation or friends. Eiffel believes that Harold is her own creation, but he is in fact a real person—who has begun hearing her narrating his life! Believing he is losing his mind, Harold seeks out help from a literature professor Dr. Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) in hopes he will tell him what book he is in. Meanwhile, with the help of her witty assistant Penny (Queen Latifah) Eiffel is trying to figure out how to end her book with Harold's death . Harold tries to live as normally as he can, but Karen has other plans for him, as he suddenly finds himself falling for anarchist baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he was sent to audit. Dr. Hilbert discovers Eiffel is the author of Harold's story and breaks the bad news to him that she is a tragedy writer, and all of her protagonists die. Harold then tries to find the author and convince her to let him live.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that manages laughs and a warm fuzzy feeling without feeling sappy. The characters are different and quite memorable. This is one of the only movies, if not THE only movie I enjoy Will Ferrell's acting. In Stranger Than Fiction he is not shouting for no reason or engaging in immature slapstick. This film has more intellectual, dry humor. The romance is sweet and flows well, and the conflict for Harold's life will keep the audience wondering and hoping. I also liked the chemistry and funny interactions between Karen and her assistant Penny. It's a good story that talks about what the real meaningful things in life are. A great film."

","Stranger than fiction is a movie drama about a guy who was living a kind of normal life as a tax collector for IRS when he hears voices in his head and wonders what they meant. Will Farrell plays the Harold character and Emma Thompson the novelist writer who was using him for her new book, like channeling him and now the literary critique played by Dustin Hoffman is telling him that what is happening to him might be real and someone not knowing him is writing a story about his life, so he must pay attention and try to find out who is this mysterious writer, now they find her and talk to her and she accepts to change the story with a happy ending because she said when she found out that the main character is accepts to die, there was no tension and no drama and she considered no longer an interesting ending. Anyway the movie is good and intellectual in his approach, and it's a kind of a drama with comedy situations."

","From director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace), I saw a trailer for this film and thought it looked a clever comedy film, but I was glad to see there was more to it than just what I assumed. Basically everybody in the world has a life story, even the seemingly tedious, dull and repeating routine IRS (Internal Revenue Service) auditor agent Harold Crick (Golden Globe nominated Will Ferrell), who has an awkward attraction for baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). One day his life changes when he all of the sudden starts hearing the voice of female narrator voicing his every movement and thought with extraordinary accuracy, and it seems he is only one who can hear her voice. The voice narrating his life is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who coincidentally sees Harold's psychological adviser Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), she is having writer's block and is unaware she is writing his life on paper for her book. It is when Karen writes about Harold being unaware that he is going to die that he panics hearing this in his head, and he is desperate to find who is writing this stuff, and he is amazed to see her on TV. He wants her to change her ending for her leading character, and ultimately not kill him in real life as well, but apparently all of Karen Eiffel's books have a character, most often the lead, die in the end. Harold does eventually get into contact with his narrator and he does convince her he really does exist, and now knowing that a real life is in her hands she is uncertain what to do with her story that she has worked hard on, she voices her concerns to publishing assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah). Certain that he is going to die, Harold decides the only thing he can do with the supposed amount he has left is turn whatever life he has around, including confessing his feelings for Ana, but in the end, after nearly sacrificing himself, it turns out a life he relied on himself, his wristwatch, is what dies. Also starring Amadeus's Tom Hulce as Dr. Cayly, Linda Hunt as Dr. Mittag-Leffler, Andrew Rothenberg as Doctor Mercator and RV: Runaway Vacation's Kristin Chenoweth as Book Channel Host. Ferrell gives both a funny and moving performance of the leading character, Thompson is likable as the real life narrator, and Hoffman, Gyllenhaal and Latifah get their good moments on screen as well, it is a charming story with good laughs, large and small, but it also has good dramatic thoughts and heart with its ideas of destiny and making a difference, a most interesting fantasy comedy drama. Very good!"

","A lonely tax officer, Harold Crick, starts hearing a female voice that tells in a literary way what he is thinking and going to do. Trying to give himself a rational explanation, he visits a psychiatrist and then a professor in Literature What is happening to him and who is writing, literally, his life? Stranger than fiction is a modern fable about predestination and free will, about life as a our personal creation, and a reflection on the process of artistic creation. It is a retake a la reverse on Pirandello's ""Six characters in search of an author"", but using just one character. The film is directed by Swiss golden boy Marc Foster and written by the screenwriter and film director Zach Helm.<br/><br/>The movie has a terrific script and dialogs, characters very well drawn, and great acting. Will Ferrell will surprise you as Harold; we are used to his crazy over-the-top performances, but here he offers a very controlled and sensitive performance and completely transforms himself into Harold. The always believable Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as the lawyer turned into anarchist baker Ana Pascal. Emma Thompson is great as the neurotic insecure and perfectionist writer Karen Eiffel. Dustin Hoffman is also terrific as Professor of Literature Jules Hilber, who intrigued by Harold turns into a Literary detective and Harold's counselor. Queen Latifah is correct as Eiffel's PA Penny Escher; I found her character a bit unnecessary, but she does plays well what she is asked for.<br/><br/>The movie is not only entertaining, but it is embedded with multiple ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions, that turn the mystery and the romance into something else. Some of the questions that came to my mind were: If your life was written like in a novel, and therefore you knew that you were predestined, would you still try to fight this? And if you did, would that make your life better and more meaningful? If it was in your hand, what would you prefer, dying young but having a memorable death or dying old but nobody knowing that you ever existed? Would knowing that your death is poetic, give more meaning to it? Would you rather know when you are going die or how? The look of the movie, is very clean, minimalist and stylish. The superimposing graphics and vectorial images help to make clear to the viewer what is happening in Harold's head and the sort of analytical and mathematical mind and approach to reality he has. They are terrific, very stylish, explicative and not invasive at all, just at the service of the story.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled, this is not the sort of gag comedy you watch to have a big laugh. Is a witty comedy, not a LOL one.<br/><br/>A terrific film, entertaining and thought-provoking."

","I first saw Stranger Than Fiction because it had a concept that I was really intrigued by. But I was intrepid too in approaching it, as apart from the odd decent, funny movie like Elf I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. But what a surprise since Stranger Than Fiction does work wonderfully.<br/><br/>I needn't have worried about Ferrell either, as he abandons the somewhat tired shtick that spoilt movies like The Other Guys and goes for the more understated approach. The result is a both funny and moving performance and perhaps his best role in his best movie. He is very well supported by an alluring Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffmann who here is more tick-riddled in an enjoyable way than ever before.<br/><br/>Not only that, Stranger than Fiction works as both a comedy and a drama. The comedic elements are genuinely funny and the dramatic elements are poignant and affecting without falling into mawkish over-sentimentality. The premise is very inspired and loopy, following in the footsteps of Being John Malkovich and I Heart Huckabees, and avoids falling into forced intellectual whimsy, and it is well-rounded off.<br/><br/>The production values are beautiful and striking and captured lovingly by the tight editing. The soundtrack is very beguiling with faithful instrumental versions and inspired song choices that don't spoil the mood of the film. The script is just great, and succeeds in being funny and poignant, and Marc Forster's understated direction makes it one of his better and more focused directorial efforts.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction could have been shorter perhaps by about 7 or so minutes, but overall it is a wonderful film but several aspects made it work when I wasn't expecting them to. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","Everyone knows Will Ferrell for his funny, goofball laugh out loud comedy roles like Elf, Blades of Glory, and Talladega Nights. However, he has a different kind of comedy he has proved he can do with Stranger Than Fiction.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction stars Ferrell as Harold Crick, a lonely IRS Agent whose life is just boring. For the past twelve years, he has been living the same life doing the same routine of waking up, brushing his teeth, riding the bus to work, and so on. His life is changed when he starts hearing a voice narrating what he is doing as he is doing it, such as counting brush strokes. Ferrell is just an absolute wonder in this role. He shows many emotions throughout the film and proves that he can do more than be the goofball that he usually is.<br/><br/>As he continues to hear this voice, he finds new meanings to his life. One of the bigger changes occurs when he and another co-worker receive new audits. One of the ones Harold takes on is a local baker named Anna played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal is also great at showing a range of emotions as she starts showing anger and hostility toward Harold, later revealing sweetness and love toward him.<br/><br/>While Harold is going through the craziness of hearing the voice, he consults the help of Professor Jules Hilbert, played by the very talented Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is great at being laid back and acting like a friend toward Harold. At the same time, he is very knowledgeable about the literature and being able to help Harold.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is also a treat as Karen Eiffel, who is writing the book that Harold is in. She is great at expressing her sarcasm and is very believable as someone who has writer's block and cannot figure out how to finish her book.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster is great at mixing the performances of these actors, and does an excellent job in telling the story, making it both a comedy and a drama. Forster's work shows brilliance in blending the two, making this a great film.<br/><br/>What is the strongest element of Stranger Than Fiction is the writing of screenwriter Zach Helm. Helm is great at introducing Harold to the audience and making great character development on him as we get to know Harold, from our own view and from Karen's view. Helm is also great at making this script a great showcase for a character to find life again. Helm's screenplay shows many funny and serious situations that showcase a great story that is told excellently on film."

He played the role with emotion and really understood the character he was playing.

Dustin Hoddman, Maggie Gyllenhaal were good as well (apart from when Hoffman used the F word once) so the acting was really good. The whole film had a very simple look, even the look of Harolds apartment, his job, his personality, the colouring of the film was very basic....but thats all the film needed as we could understand the character of Harold and build upon it through character development.

For example, Harold re-setting his watch would ""result in his imminent death."" It does offer parts where it does make the audience think. For example, Dustin Hoffman's character telling Harold he can ""do anything with his life."" This affects the audience by making them think about what they can do with their lives.

But suppose someone else was writing your story and plotting your imminent demise, what would you do then? This is the dilemma facing bored and boring tax auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell in a refreshingly nuanced performance).<br/><br/>The person writing his life is, he discovers, successful English novelist Karen Eiffel (the always excellent Emma Thompson) who is struggling to work out quite how he should die, assisted in her writer's block by a no-nonsense aide called Penny Escher (played by Queen Latifah). Harold is helped to find his way by Ana Pascal (a cute Maggie Gyllenhaal) who runs a cookie café and is withholding tax and by Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who is something of an expert in the ""Little did he know"" literary genre.<br/><br/>This is not an easy film to categorise. It is a kind of romantic comedy but more understated and thought-provoking than your usual rom-com. It is a quiet work with some charm that is ultimately made by the succession of fine performances from its leading actors."

","Stranger than Fiction is a 2006 dramedy film directed by Marc Forster, also known for directing films such as Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, and the upcoming Quantum of Solace. It is written by Zach Helm. It stars the extra-ordinary talent of Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah.<br/><br/>As the narrative states early on in the film, Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick, is all about numbers; and this story, is about him and his wristwatch. The weird intervenes when Harold starts hearing the voice of the narrator in his head, narrating his every move. All this, unknown to the narrator herself. The concept is taken from Miguel de Unamuno's Spanish novel, Niebla. However, Zach Helm's screenplay is extremely well written, perhaps worthy of much more praise than it got. There are numerous double-meaning references in the film which one would probably miss at first viewing. Stranger than Fiction is a film which demands numerous viewings to spot out any flaws. The film is so perfectly made than one could often find oneself looking for flaws in it, which aren't there at all.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell has never been better. His role as the suddenly frustrated man who many think has gone nuts because of the intervention of that voice in his head, is brilliant. Then there are Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, who seem to have been miscast, but a few seconds into their roles, the roles seem made for them. They own their characters. Like I said before, everything in this film seems too perfect, and also, too simple. There is also a very cute, nice chemistry between Ferrell and co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal. Every one of the characters seem to share a beautiful chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction lies in the league of films like The Truman Show, Fincher's Zodiac; all amazing in their own way, but simply not for everyone. Hence their underrated-ness. This, remember, is a story about a man named Harold Crick, and his wristwatch.<br/><br/>8.5/10. Loved it."

","This film does more than expected. The main character Harold Crick is played by the well-known Will Ferrell. This movie is not simply another impromptu classic from the wonderful mind of Will Ferrell. While Ferrell still has a number of funny lines, the humor is much more sophisticated than usual for him. Also, the movie shows the acting ability that Ferrell truly has. In this film, Ferrell captures the hearts of those watching his character by pulling them so deep into the movie, that before the watcher knows it, the movie suddenly transforms from a comedy to a heart-wringing drama. At the beginning, the air about the movie is extremely light. The film seems as it will be nothing more than average comedy that does well in the box office because of the big name actors. But as the movie progresses, so too does the light air. The movie becomes more serious bit by bit, until at last, it turns into an unforgettable tear jerker. This is a must-see for all people, especially for those who think Will Ferrell is only capable of making movies that have such stupid jokes that you actually begin to laugh at something that is really simply ridiculous."

That's precisely why I love movies like Stranger than Fiction; it makes you think. <br/><br/>The film is centered around Harold Crick, a lonely man who works for the IRS. Through a series of events, he finds that his life may be more interesting then he thought; he seems to be the subject of someone's book. Throughout the entirety of the story, we feel for Harold in many ways, ranging from cynical humor to sadness, and we really feel like we know exactly how Harold himself feels. The casting in the movie is very well done. We are shown that Will Ferrel is a very good actor. I'm used to seeing him in silly comedy shows and movies, but I must say, his performance in Stranger than Fiction is his best I've ever seen. <br/><br/>If you're in the mood for something different, or for something that you walk away from with a satisfied feeling, then give Stranger than Fiction a try.

"sychonic","Null","0","0","12 November 2008"," Writing About Writing (Spoilers! -- Caution)
","Spoilers -- really, this is an odd movie; and to write about it with any sort of precision or detail (of even the most vague sort) is impossible.<br/><br/>There is something about writing, for a writer, that draw him (or her of course) to the very act of writing. Meaning writing about writing.<br/><br/>Problem is, again of course, that writing isn't that interesting. It's actually kind of boring. Don't know who said it, only know that Oscar Madison in the TV Series the Odd Couple said (when trying to write a book): ""I hate writing, but I love having written."" In this story (and I knew nothing of it before seeing it late at night on a cable channel, I think the best way to do so, so really, anyone who wants to watch it should avoid spoilers as best they can), the main character is an anal sort, meticulous in every way, mathematically a savant, an idiot in other ways -- mainly socially.<br/><br/>And the voice over, a woman describing his actions as he goes to work, does his daily routing, an incredibly boring individual, in every way.<br/><br/>Then it comes to pass that he is a character in a book being written by an author who is stricken by the mother of all writer's block.<br/><br/>It doesn't really all work, though it really is sort of interesting. Will Ferrell, when he starts his realization that he can hear the narrative of his life, is shocked to hear this. Later he comes to the realization that his life is being narrated. But as the narration continues, it sort of comes in an out of consciousness. He hears it sometimes, and then it sometimes seems he doesn't. That's distracting.<br/><br/>The movie is heavily plot driven, meaning, as viewers, I'd suggest, we're all waiting for the next development. An example: Harold Crick (sp?), the lead character, in guidance from a literature teacher (Dustin Hoffman, in a great coffee swilling performance) decides to do nothing. Just sit around and watch TV so the plot can't go forward.<br/><br/>What happens? A crane comes bashing into his apartment, by mistake, to move the plot along. Of course that doesn't really make too much sense since the author is blocked, so the character's inertia isn't too much of a stretch. Then again, the writer's block really stems from her guilt about killing off her characters, and she really kind of likes Harold Crick, and can't manage to find a way to destroy his life.<br/><br/>There's sort of a love story involved between the IRS auditor Harold C. and a tax scofflaw who refuses to pay her taxes (usual silly nonsense about defense and bank bailouts and such). It's probably just me, but the character and the actor (Ferrell) does not a love story make, just not great raw material for romance.<br/><br/>Plus the narration, and nice as it is, as the plot progresses, becomes less and less relevant, and more and more silly and incongruous if one takes the previous story line at all seriously -- who knows, maybe that's the point, stretching the willing suspension of disbelief can only be, well, stretched so far.<br/><br/>There are elements here and there that contribute to the plot, a little kid on his bike, the guy at the office that sort of passes at a friend, the weird boss, and the assistant to the author played by Queen Latifah, mercifully employing less than her usually annoying sass.<br/><br/>To conclude, writing about writing is boring. Writing about writing about writing hopefully isn't quite so much. This movie about writing about writing about writing (and then this review is writing about that). All so self referential.<br/><br/>I suppose the only thing that's left to say (or write), is that the story about Harold Crick actually isn't that interesting. It's all the story and plot that surrounds him that makes the movie interesting. Lots of philosophy here, how one treats death, how one deal with life, the things about what makes life wonderful. All that.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and a bit of bakery too, I don't, but who else doesn't like sugar cookies?"
"nturner","8","0","0","7 November 2008"," Not a Silly Comedy
","I have my niece to thank for my enjoyment of this film. I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. The previews I saw of this film on television made it look as though it was another of his comedies in the Will Ferrell style, so I had dismissed it and never considered seeing it. At a dinner, my niece told me that she and her husband had greatly enjoyed the film and assured me that it was not a typical Will Ferrell vehicle. Boy was she right! This is an excellent movie, and it has caused me to look at Ferrell in an entirely different way.<br/><br/>It is the story of Harold Crick, a man stuck in the rut of all ruts as far as his life is concerned. He is an IRS agent who quietly goes through each day according to a regular schedule and never deviates from that schedule. One day he hears a voice in his head that is narrating his entire life. He, at first, dismisses the phenomenon, but when it starts to exactly describe events, he becomes concerned and seeks professional help.<br/><br/>Supporting Ferrell's excellent, understated performance is a slew of superior supporting actors.<br/><br/>An unrecognizable rotund and bearded Tom Hulce is the company shrink who is Harold's first stop. Hulce is perfect in portraying the square peg in IRS's round hole. He is a delight.<br/><br/>Linda Hunt charms as the somewhat bemused psychiatrist who keeps insisting that if Harold is hearing a voice, he is schizophrenic. Harold insists that the voice is not telling him to do things but merely narrating. In a beautifully delivered line, Hunt states that his problem in not based in psychiatry and suggests that Harold consult an expert in literature.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman shines as the literature professor who, at first, rejects Harold's appeal but then becomes intrigued. In his acting, Hoffman sometimes has the tendency to go a little over the top when playing somewhat quirky characters, but here his acting is restrained and perfect.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal is the woman who astounds Harold with her beauty, intelligence, and passion for life. His desire to know her better - along with the comments from the narrator - cause him to examine and change his life. Gyllenhaal deftly gives us a sexy, desirable woman filled with an independent spirit.<br/><br/>The neurotic author with writer's block and her down-to-earth assistant sent in by the publisher to help get the book finished are played by Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah. What a combination! They are so good together. Thompson's character is a total mess dressed in rumpled clothing, twisting tissues to shreds, and staring vacantly with red, wild eyes. Latifah's character is always perfectly dressed and coiffed and is a picture of firm, yet compassionate, control.<br/><br/>In the special features on the DVD, the actors laud the director for his low-keyed guidance. It is clear that viewers can thank Marc Forster for creating a film that might have been a mess and total farce, but is, instead, a witty, thoughtful examination of life.<br/><br/>Also on the DVD, the creators explain about the GUI (graphics user interface) used in the film. For me and all you other non-geeks reading this review, look up at the top of your screen. All those buttons, etc. are GUI In the film GUI is imposed upon the screen to show how Harold deals with the outside world. He is obsessed with numbers and order and the GUI is perfect in showing his computer-like thinking patterns.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film or had dismissed it as a silly comedy, I urge you to take the advice of my niece and see it. You won't be disappointed."

","Stranger than Fiction Film Review Stranger than Fiction is extremely well thought out and clever how it connects the life of Harold Crick to the life of Emma Thompson (who narrates Harold Crick's life), and also how it all comes together in the end. His wristwatch and numbers dictate Harold's life. He has to do everything the same way as he did it the day before for the same amount of time. He gets out of bed at 7:15 every morning, he brushes his teeth exactly 76 times, and he always JUST gets to the bus in time. Harold goes about his usual business, making calculations and constantly glancing at his watch, when one day, a woman's voice sounds in his head, narrating him. His extremely organized life suddenly falls apart. He forgets to brush his teeth exactly 76 times, he misses his bus, and he meets a beautiful baker who he is auditing. This, little does he know, is because his narrator has overcome her writers' block. Emma Thompson is a psychologically troubled writer, who smokes and drinks way too much for her own good. She writes tragedies. All of her main characters die, and all of them die tragically. She has hit a brick wall on how to kill Harold Crick, so her publishers send her a secretary to get her moving. As Emma Writes, Harold lives. If she writes that Harold gets with the baker, Harold gets with the baker and so on. As Harold learns to accept the voice in his head, and starts to fall for the baker, his watch goes ballistic, so he turns it off, resets his time, and then the voice narrates ""little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death."" This simple sentence gets Harold working. He goes to a psychologist, but that is a dead end, so he then goes to an English teacher. This all leads up to the climax. When in the English teachers office, he recognizes the woman's voice on the television. This is where is all gets weird. I, along with most of my classmates, believed that Harold crick lived in a fictional world, controlled by Emma Thompson, but Harold finds Emma in real life, and pleads with her not to make him die. She reconsiders her intentions of drastically killing Harold, shocked and disgusted at herself that she has killed so many people in all of her books, and instead writes that he sacrifices his wellbeing to save a little boy on a bike from being hit by a bus, and gets put into hospital. A small compromise. All in all I give this movie an 8/10"

This film is much more leftfield and original than you'd expect from watching the trailer and would definitely be one the films that I've most enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>I like ""Anchorman"" Will Ferrel, but in this he's in another league altogether. Bouncing off the rest of the cast - Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are on particularly fine form and perfect foils for the main character - he climbs to a new level as an actor.<br/><br/>As a production it is pretty much spot on. The use of Wreckless Eric in the soundtrack was genius. I'm not a fan of either slush or explicit sex in films, aesthetically, but in this the play between Ferrel and Maggie Gyllenhaal really made me smile. It is slick, but feels a little bit indie, as if there were a lot of people who had a passion to make this movie.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""Being John Malkovitch"" then I really recommend you check this title out. It's suitable for a wide range of viewers and has baking and guitars, so great for guys and chicks too!

When I saw that he would be working with Dustin Hoffman as well I knew I had to see this, because that pair looked extremely well on paper. I have to say that I am not much of a drama genre guy, but this was a decent one at that. The whole romance thing didn't really catch me because that is not my thing but Ferrell being out of his element caught me by surprise in this one. He normally acts like such a goof in his movies that it was surprising to see him act like a normal man dealing with a dilemma.

","There is certain type of movies that I tend to call misanthropic movies, or Gibsonian, since those are typical in opus of Mel Gibson. In fact, directors who make this kind of movies, usually make no other kind (von Trier, Iñárritu) but Gibson is just most famous among them all. These directors, I can't escape the feel, have the characters in their movies just so that they could play god in somebody's, anybodies, life. Characters often get killed, or simply wish to be dead. For some reason, these are considered to be art. Or ""difficult"" movies, and whenever I state my dislike for them, I'm being told ""it's not for everyone"" or ""that's life!"". I beg to differ. I personally love difficult movies. One of my favorite would be ""Magdalene Sisters"". But these, these are just plain dumb. People are not all ugly on the inside, stupid, arrogant and conceited, there is bound to be someone, every now and then that shines, and who ever is not able to see this, not only isn't an artist, but is the disgusting character of his own lame work. This movie seams to share my view on the subject, as it forces one of those miserable authors to face their own heroes, and their personal insignificance. Nothing we hear of the novel is really all that good, but is nevertheless regarded as such. Characters are often so enchanted by this novel, that a lot tend to think it's all right for a real person to die in order that this (obviously lame) book could be finished. As for movie it self, it works perfectly. The visual style is there to entertain you while plot starts kicking in, and as you get more involved, there is less and less of the GUI to distract you. Actors are mostly good, especially Thompson who just sitting in empty white room by typewriter shaking, trembling, going insane, makes you feel more for dying man, then dying man himself. Characters are all well developed, and all seam very much at ease (i.e. mostly if you see their feet, they are not wearing shoes nor socks) making it more apparent how main character is stiff and in need of change. The real story however is the one ironical, cause all of the sudden, all the details which seamed excessive at start (most notably an Apple and the watch) find their place in universe and give true ironic twist to the story."

","1st watched 10/14/2008 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Marc Forster): Well executed comedy-drama about a man who's life is really just a character in a book that is currently being written. Will Farrell brilliantly underplays the main character as he goes thru his mundane life as an IRS agent, but then suddenly starts hearing a voice narrating his every move. He first goes to a shrink that thinks he's schizophrenic and suggests pills but then suggests visiting a literary teacher played by Dustin Hoffman. The teacher tries to help him figure out what kind of story he's involved in. Hoffman plays the role brilliantly like most of the cast. The only downspot in the casting is Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant. She doesn't do well underplaying, and just doesn't bring much to her role. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the voice in Will's head who eventually meets up with the character. The music and pacing is very well done and the movie even makes you think as well as being comedic. A storyline like this is bound to have a few flaws, but overall the execution makes up for it and the experience of viewing the movie was fun and thought-provoking with even a little romance added in to spice things up. I am definitely looking forward to this director's next movie and it also showed the acting ability of Will Ferrell when given good material."

","This fantasy begins as a blend of ""The Truman Show"" with a soupçon of ""The Accidental Tourist"" and I expected a tricky commercial property designed in the course of some overnight caffeine binge to bring in as many shekels as possible. It's better than that, and I wound up waiting rather tensely to see how the thing would turn out.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is an obsessive-compulsive IRS auditor who lives a heavily regimented life, dictated by the reminders on his multiple-function wrist watch, joyless and humorless. He's as boring as they come. We just KNOW some hot babe or something is going to turn his life upside down, and it does.<br/><br/>He begins to hear a woman's voice inside his head. The voice describes what he's doing and what he has done, down to the smallest detail, using the third person or his actual name -- Harold Crick. Something is going on but Ferrell doesn't know what. The voice at first puzzles him, then irritates him. He shouts out demands that it stop, but the only things that stop are other pedestrians who stare at him. Actually, this being New York, I think he could stand in the street and shout all he likes without any interference.<br/><br/>I don't want to spell out all the plot developments because the story is a little complicated. Ferrell sees a shrink, Linda Hunt, who refers him to a professor of literature, Dustin Hoffman, who may be able to figure out what kind of narrative he's listening to -- and living. It's a tragedy, as it turns out, and Ferrell had better find out whose writing it before he's killed off. The writer turns out to be real enough, a blocked novelist, Emma Thompson, and Ferrell tracks her down and they work things out, so to speak. There's the inevitable spirit-of-life woman too, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who introduces him to love, milk and cookies, and Tiffany lamps. With this kind of narrative it's only natural to ask if the ""writer"" stands for Somebody Else. I mean, here is someone laying out the course of a human life. Is Thompson God? Can God be a woman who has writer's block and smokes too much? Nahh. Woman, yes. Writer's block and smoking, no. <br/><br/>The best performances are from Emma Thompson, Byllenhall, and Dustin Hoffman. Will Ferrell looks and acts the part of a man whose favorite word is ""integer"" but he does so uninterestingly. On the other hand, it's a tough part. Maybe Bill Murray would have handled it.<br/><br/>In a plot as tricky as this there are bound to be lacunae in the logic. For instance, he's trying to track down the genuine source of the voice in his head. He discovers the voice seems to belong to a real writer. But the voice has used some strange locutions. I'd have started my investigation by Googling the word ""unmitigatable."" See who's used it before. There couldn't be that many.<br/><br/>And then too, Ferrell finally finds and confronts the author of his life, Emma Thompson, takes the almost-finished manuscript to Dustin Hoffman, and it is agreed by all concerned that the story must end tragically with Ferrell's death. Nonsense. Why couldn't Thompson have written the thing as a tragedy then added a single, final sentence -- ""And he woke up to find it had all been a dream""? It worked in Fritz Lang's ""Woman in the Window."" And as for literature, ""Finnegans Wake"" is ALL dream.<br/><br/>Plaudits to the writer though. There's some clever stuff going on here, which overcomes occasional distractions in the direction. It's too bad that Ferrell is as unengaging as he is. He's even uninteresting when he wises up and begins to stretch out. There seems to be a big hole in the screen when he appears, and he's the central figure.<br/><br/>The movie may be a little too charmed by its own premise. Still -- overall -- it's a more thoughtful film than you might anticipate, not as gimmicky as it sounds. Would have made a good novel."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","0","9 August 2008"," A good combination of comedy, drama, fantasy, and romance, with a surprising performance from Will Ferrell
","I first saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"" in an independent theatre in December 2006. I had heard about the premise, and knew that Will Ferrell was in the starring role, though this sounded like a different kind of movie for him. I guess I was in for some surprises, which wasn't a bad thing, as it turned out to be a memorable experience. A few months ago, I watched ""Old School"", an earlier film featuring Ferrell, for the third time, and didn't care much for it anymore. The other week, I watched ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" for the second time. I wasn't too impressed with that one in the first place, and it didn't change much the second time. So, I felt it was a good time to revisit this film after those two, and it worked out well.<br/><br/>Harold Crick is a lonely IRS agent who lives a very repetitive lifestyle, which includes counting the brush strokes each morning when he brushes his teeth, and always just making it to the bus for work by the skin of his teeth. One day, he begins to hear a mysterious voice, narrating his life, a voice it turns out nobody else can hear, and it seems whoever this is can read his mind! This may sound like a symptom of schizophrenia, but in his case, it's not! He doesn't know this, but the voice he is hearing is the voice of an author named Karen Eiffel, who is writing a novel where Harold is the main character! She is unaware of the fact that Harold Crick exists in real life, and she is writing out the events in his life as they happen! Worse for Harold, this author tends to have her main characters killed in her books, and in her ignorance, she works with her assistant, Penny Escher, looking for a way to kill her main character, unaware that she will probably kill a real person if she does it! <br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" is not perfect. It has some fairly tedious parts, such as the scene where Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) and Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) first meet, and the one in the bake shop, where tax resister Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) insists Harold tries one of the cookies she has baked, and they get into a conversation, learning about each other. The script may also be a problem at times, but not usually. For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. There's a reasonable number of laughs, some small ones, some big ones. The first big laugh I found was the scene where Harold first hears the author's voice as he's brushing his teeth. The story is often suspenseful or emotional, especially towards the end, as we get to the climax.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most about the movie was Will Ferrell's performance as Harold Crick, seeing that he could play a role that's not 100% comedy! I think I prefer Jack Black as a comedian, but the remake of ""King Kong"" showed that he doesn't belong in straight roles, whereas this movie shows that's not quite the case with Ferrell! Ferrell is a polarizing comedian, some people find him amusing, while others hate him with a passion and look at his fans as inferior beings. Personally, before I saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"", I thought he was a reasonable entertainer in the comedy business, certainly not one of the best comedians of all time, but he sure could make me laugh. However, I never thought he could ever play a straight role, so this movie showed that even I underestimated his talents! You certainly shouldn't expect this movie to be another juvenile comedy, featuring the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian playing a total maniac, but in my opinion, it's a pretty good combination of comedy, drama, fantasy, and romance, and if you hate Ferrell, you just MIGHT gain respect for him as a performer after seeing this!"
"scrybe314","8","0","0","7 August 2008"," Will Ferrell Beyond SNL and Talladega Nights
","I'd wanted to see this film for quite some time primarily because I'm an English major and any movie having to do with writers or writing automatically scores high in my book (""Throw Momma From the Train"" is still one of my favorite movies and I'll demolish with words anyone who tries to disagree with me) but also because the overall premise, from what the trailers let on, was original and quirky: Harold Crick, a boring everyman who works for the IRS, counts more things than should be counted, and lives a life defined only by the number of people he's audited, wakes up one day to find that his life is being narrated, and rather well at that, by a mysterious voice speaking in third-person omniscient that informs Harold indirectly that he's going to die soon. I didn't see it sooner because the friends who did see it said that it was a mediocre film, touting it with a stream of ""Yeah, it was okay""s. Well, my friends, who probably expected typical Ferrell fare, were horrendously wrong, because this movie goes above and beyond the call.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" does everything right in a movie; the story is creative, with a no-one being haunted by a faceless narrator, and this movie unlike oh-so-many does NOT take an original premise and cock it all up by selling out to mainstream expectations. Cough cough, Hancock, cough cough. There's a love story involved, but it's well played out and realistic with a minimum of saccharine-drenched sappiness involved. In fact, the story is downright engrossing, because Will Ferrell takes the character of Harold Crick and makes him downright likable; the audience identifies immediately with him and grows to like him more as the character evolves. There's another thing this film has going for it; character arcs. The characters are all well-drawn people that we feel we know, from the gorgeous anarchist baker played to a tee by<br/><br/>actress Maggie Gyllenhall to the eccentric-bordering-on-bonkers lit professor portrayed perfectly by Dustin Hoffman, to Crick himself. There's a lot to be said about Ferrell's performance here; it's not by any means his usual fare of frat-boy antics and over-the-top humor, which is why so many were disappointed. This is genuine acting, the portrayal of a real person in a real (if tossing weird) situation, with real, honest-to-god emotions, and it's here that W.F. shines as the brilliant actor that he is. The laughs arise from the characters naturally in sync with what's going on, and so do the tears.<br/><br/>The story is impossible to describe with any kind of justice; it takes turns and brings in new depth, but we're there with it every step of the way. Every character plays a part in developing things; no one is present just for a joke. For those expecting an outright comedy, you're at the wrong door. For people expecting a quirky, cute comedy-romance, first of all, most of those films aren't really that good, and secondly this isn't one of those films. It's a rare treat; a Hollywood work with a stellar cast that's truly original, beautifully crafted, and almost flawlessly executed. Keep your eye out for the little things that make this film work, from Harold's blueprint-like heads-up display to repetitive appearances of certain characters to the expressions on the actors' faces when they come to a final crossroad with a lovable IRS agent's life in the balance. Eight out of ten stars, each one proudly earned."

","Of course everyone knows that Will Ferrell is funny; that is pretty much embedded on the DNA of every new born that comes into the world. What many may not know but will by seeing this movie is that Ferrell can act and play a straight role quite well. Here he plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent who has is complete daily routine down to a science. Everything from counting brush strokes while brushing teeth to timing his lunch break is completely and meticulously counted out and planned. Then, he begins to hear a voice from Emma Thompson who he finds out is narrating his life. With the help of a literary theory professor played by the iconic Dustin Hoffman, he discovers he is a character in her new book and that she is known for killing off the characters in all her books.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest with you, this is one of the stranger movies ever made but it is made so well and with such heart it doesn't feel as strange as it is. Unique is a word that comes to mind when thinking of the story and the script from first-timer Zach Helm is simple and straight and keeps the suspense all the while giving us insight into Harold's life and his rigorous schedule. As the story progresses, Harold's life begins to unwind and it is important to note that at the beginning his life feels less like a novel idea but at the end it is a great idea. Of course, none of this would be possible without tremendous acting and Ferrell holds it all together with perhaps his best performance yet. Hoffman and Thompson are two old pros here who know what they're doing and Maggie Gyllenhaal is so cute and likable here that it made me want to go look for her and her bakery. She gives what may be the film's best performance as Harold's love interest that has brains and spunk and rubs a little spice onto Harold's bland dish.<br/><br/>She this if you can. It is rare to find a movie so unique and clever, yet with the feel of a typical audience-winner."
"pc95","7","0","0","2 August 2008"," Novel Idea but Will Ferrell out of Place
","I liked Stranger than Fiction for it's novel approach and quirky plot. It carries itself almost like watching some bizarre dream that you yourself are making up as you go along or are following. Likewise the music helped as off-beat and odd. It has strong acting and interesting camera work. However Will Ferrell, though decent enough in this film, doesn't seem like a good choice to lead the movie. His yelling and ranting are funny enough on Saturday Night Live or his other comedies but get a little excessive when ranging into dramatic comedies - so there's kind of a disconnect when he gets into his yelling 5-yr old persona. It disturbs the pensiveness of the rest of the movie. Other than that, the movie is pretty engaging with narration and high energy supporting characters. Worth a look for it's central novel approach."

","I am not a literary genius hence I cannot explain in a lot of words what made me think this movie was excellent.Also if I seem high to the reader of the review then bear in mind that I am writing this immediately after watching the movie as I believe that the best time to write a review is in the first 10 minutes cause after that I am out of the zone. The ending of the movie moves you. It moves you in no way you could imagine. Its about tragedy and comedy and love and life. Its about the relationship between the writer and her assistant,between the hero and the teacher, between the the character and the writer and the love between the hero and the cookie maker. Each is portrayed with impeccable brilliance. My favorite part I have to say was the last 5 minutes of the movie. When the author gives the reasoning for the ending she chose. I believe each person should watch this movie. Its fiction that is more real than fact."

","It is amazing how life's simple lessons can be narrated in so many imaginative ways. If you rip Stranger Than Fiction to its core, you would find it is not just a story. It is a parable with an age old truism being its moral. Harold Crick (Ferrell) needs a life altering event to break out of his meaningless lifestyle and that event arrives in the most unreal form. The movie is another one of quite a few Hollywood movies that fantasy in the storyline for make the message more realistic. The name of Michel Gondry definitely comes to mind. In fact, the movie has Gondry/Charlie Kaufman feel to it in that there is no attempt made to rationalize the fanciful. The movie remains completely accessible at all stages and uses intelligent screenplay to keep the audience engage as the story starts to unravel itself. Some scenes, including the ones depicting Ferrel's meticulousness, are hilarious and lay a very solid base for the move. Even though, the story assumes a more serious nature in the second half, there is always an element of humor attached in the scenes. In being subtle in its humor while not becoming completely melodramatic, the film manages to achieve a consistent tempo in storytelling throughout. The performances are top-notch and Will Ferell's efforts to underplay Harold is as fine as Jin Carey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Overall, the movie weaves a simple story around some very imaginative writing and tight screenplay to make for a memorable watch."

","Marc Forster's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", released in 2007, tells the story of an obsessive compulsive IRS agent Harold Crick (played by Will Ferrel). Harold leads a very straight forward and organized life. He counts his brush strokes while brushing his teeth, counts the steps he takes to the bus and goes to bed at precisely 11:13 PM every night. That was, until one faithful Wednesday, Harold's life. On that Wednesday, Harold awakens to begin his average day but notices something different. He can hear a woman narrating his life. This voice eventually says that it will lead to Harold's Imminent death, causing Harold to desperately find out what is going on with the help of a literature teacher named Professor Jules Hilbert (Played by Dustin Hoffman).<br/><br/>In my own opinion, this is a fantastic movie. It is very subtle in the way that it captures the viewer with a strange but somehow believable story line, few jokes that are funny in their subtle way and, especially from Will Ferrel whom i didn't care for until this movie, spectacular acting. Another thing that makes this movie so captivating and likable is the chemistry between Harold and a baker Harold must audit (evaluation of an organization) named Ana Pascal (Played by Maggie Gyllenhaal). Ana starts off hating Harold simply because she disagrees with the tax laws he is trying to force on her but eventually becomes to like him in a turn of events. Both actors play their part very well and will no doubt have the viewer smiling many times throughout this awesome film.<br/><br/>The film was very successful and even nominated for a golden globe award. I believe, this film was successful for it's believable acting, quirky storyline and the director's ability to let the viewer experience different emotions throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Wonderful film that should be viewed by anyone who appreciates a good movie 8/10."

I actually enjoyed Will Ferrell's acting. The movie wasn't perfect, but the acting was excellent, it kept me guessing, it was amusing and even the cynic in me was touched by his gift. In all it was interesting and amusing and worth a watch.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the scenes where the literary professor tried to figure out the story (as the audience was).

"bob the moo","Null","0","0","28 May 2008"," Restrained and creative film even if it doesn't totally capture or convince in the emotional core
","Harold Crick is a simple man who is very much a creature of habit. He brushes his teeth the same way each day, hurries to the bus and always narrowly catches it on his way to his job as an auditor for the IRS. This morning is different though because Harold appears to be hearing voices  or rather one voice  narrating what he is doing as he does it. Unsure whether he is crazy or not, he is in no doubt the more it goes on and the use of a certain phrase in relation to his impending death causes Harold to urgently get to the bottom of it while all the time life carries on around him.<br/><br/>When this film was released I didn't bother with it because it did seem like ""one of those clever-clever"" films that are all very clever but perhaps not that great when you strip away the cleverness to the main plot. Certainly the one line summary (man finds his life being narrated by unseen author) did suggest that there would be a lot of the gimmick in this. When it arrived on television recently I did think that I should at least not assume things about it and instead let it tell me what it is like. What I found was a film that was slightly too clever for its own good but does have a heart in there somewhere as well as several other commendable aspects.<br/><br/>The ""gimmick"" (or device I guess) does create a solid character plot and I was drawn in by this initially and throughout. This side of it does work right up to the end. Beyond this we do have a story of Harold discovering more to his life than he had been living and also some things about the nature of living, creating and dying. Unfortunately it is this part of the film that is not totally successful because it doesn't come over as sure of itself and while it has its moments it doesn't flow thematically as well as I wanted. What this meant was that I didn't end up as emotionally involved in Harold or the story as I felt I should have been; the cleverness of it was never in doubt but this never slipped into the background to reveal a real strong heart  even if it did have heart. The ""cleverness"" of the script should not be ignored though (unless of course, you are the Academy Awards, then by all means just ignore it) and I did find delight in the creative idea and delivery. The dialogue is charming and engaging and it is picked up well by the cast.<br/><br/>Ferrell appears to be happy just doing sports spoof after sports spoof at the moment (the ABA being the most recent target) and perhaps this is because he feels he has proved he can act with this film. Certainly his performance is very strong here and he does it by being completely restrained throughout, bringing out much with small changes and actions. He is not good enough to ""make"" the film in the emotional sense but he is quietly impressive. Gyllenhaal is colourful even if she does easily get a bit sappy without totally convincing me later on. Thompson is nicely eccentric and she works her limited scenes well while Queen Latifah at very least deserves mention for not being a screaming cliché like she normally is and is happy in a minor role. Hoffman is also a good find and rounds out a starry cast, all of whom are content to do quiet, good work on the edges while Ferrell does the same in the lead. Forster's direction is mostly very good with plenty of good shots and composure but I'm not sure why the film had animation on some scenes showing numbers etc  it seemed to be half done and stuck out as such, like they didn't have the confidence to totally do what they wanted but still wanted to have it in there.<br/><br/>Overall though, the film is clever, creative and engaging. It doesn't totally manage to deliver on the emotional aspect of the story and characters but it does an OK job anyway. The performances are roundly strong, with Ferrell showing a restraint and subtlety that I wish he could find projects for more often. The ""clever-clever"" aspect is also restrained and controlled to prevent it ever disappearing up itself in the way some of these things do, although it is worth keeping in mind that if this type of film annoys you then you should probably check out now."
"elshikh4","2","0","0","7 May 2008"," Sillier Than Fiction !
","At first, it was the relationship between the writer and her written character; namely something that original, marvelous, and rich. Especially from the written character point of view as a creature who doesn't understand his own tortures, and tries to understand them with his self, life, fate. But what we saw was farther away anything good which you could've had from that.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the worst treatment to this ambitious idea. Or maybe it's, with its own defects, a less ambitious than the idea. For instance, how this writer got this supernatural capacity to control one's life or fate?, and how this written character in specific managed to communicate with this kind of goddess who controls all his life and death but not his will? So without any explanations, the movie's plot owns its rank as one of the most childish plots ever talked about such a relationship between a creator and the creator's creation, since Pygmalion!<br/><br/>Moreover, I hated that contact between the 2 lines which broke the symbolic case to reach a limit where (Will Ferrell)'s character was asked to die just to make one novel as good and successful?? And the weirder, or the sillier, that he agrees! Honestly, (Dustin Hoffman) and (Will Ferrell) looked so unbelievably idiotic at that scene: ""You must die, so the novel can be whole and perfect!"", and when (Ferrell) incomprehensibly surrenders, the novelist just saves him, and why? Because ""The one who knows that he's going to die, and goes,.. deserves life""!! Surly that's the utmost degree of naivety I've ever seen dramatically and intellectually. Because the one who goes to die plainly like that is the one who deserves death indeed. But the one who ""believes"" in his fate - or the very one that the whole film is grounded on boosting him - is the one who really has faith in God, the ultimate power, not by any chance some depressed writer who loves to kill her characters just to empty her sadness. Otherwise, this is a really odious blasphemy. So as you see, it's bad both ways!<br/><br/>It's in this very brittle plot (particularly when you think did the writer's previous characters actually die before or not?!), and in that lousy basis in the first place (a writer's pen draws factual destinies of real people!). Therefore, the brilliant idea melted in the middle of this immature manipulation, and the story's good meanings become eventually incompatible: You must cherish your life which you'll live freely by your will. To activate your true selections, you must believe in fate that can select you in a higher will. You have to believe in higher will also to achieve its superior wisdom, and live for yourself and others (the lead saved his love from prison, then saved the boy from the bus). All of those meanings were so mixed up in so mixed up plot; hence the story's originality and sweetness were destroyed, especially with that fabricated happy ending too. It could be a perfect case of having a symbolic story where the symbol was bigger than its story, which lessened the persuasion and the amusement.<br/><br/>Despite the astonishing performance of (Will Ferrell), and some good points, it's a project of a different and well-meaning film that ended up weak and absurd."

","First of all, I am entirely fed up with Hollywood doing such a crap job of advertising. This film was marketed as another typical Will Ferrell comedy. However, it isn't for that type of audience. The humor is quite dry, there isn't any gag-comedy and the tone borders on morbid. That being said: I loved it.<br/><br/>Harold Crick is not a likable man, nor is he a hate-able man. He's just there: one of the million boring people you pass on the street. One of the million you would not notice if you never saw them again, or care. But something happens: he begins to see his life from a different perspective, namely that of a best-selling author. And facing the probability of having spent his entire life without actually living for a second of it, he sets on a mission: to pursue his dreams, to love, to make an impact, and most importantly- to figure out how to stop the author from killing him.<br/><br/>Everyone did a bang-up job in the acting department. I prefer Will Ferrell here over any of his other films. His character has substance, he grows from someone you couldn't care less about to someone you can't stand to let die. I was impressed: this is very much Ferrell's Truman Show. I love Emma Thompson and thought she was brilliant especially at the end. Her scene explaining to Dustin Hoffman her choices on the subject of Harold Crick resonated with me.<br/><br/>Adding the calculations that go though Harold's head on screen was very cool. I have only seen the film on Internet streaming, so I cannot wait to go back and catch the nuances in better quality. The film was funny, by all means, but it didn't hit you over the head with a ""laugh here"" sign at every corner.<br/><br/>Overall: great film. I just hope the marketing campaign didn't drive away people who would really like it, as it almost did me."

","Comics becoming dramatic actors? Is it possible? After watching ""Stranger than Fiction"", I am convinced that Will Ferrell has the potential in his talent to expand his dramatic presence in movie making. I think if someone were to look at many of Robin Williams or Tom Hanks early works, there would have been considerable doubts that either of those actors could break the barrier placed against comedians becoming considered for serious or more dramatic roles. Will Ferrell proves in ""Stranger than Fiction"" that he has a much wider range than his characters in many other roles he has played would indicate. Will is generally believable and is able to hold his own against Oscar winners Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. He presents a warm genuine persona that makes his character very believable and likable. While Will Ferrell is known for characters that are over the top and outlandish, he proves that with a proper script, he is just as capable of playing a normal person in a dramatic situation as some of Hollywoods heavyweights like Mr. Williams or Tom Hanks, both actors got their start in comedic roles and stand up. Kudos to Mr. Ferrells agent who convinced him to take this role, and even more Kudos to Mr. Ferrell for making the right choice and play this character.

","STRANGER THAN FICTION is an offbeat and imaginative fantasy that is as intriguing a journey for the film-goer as it is a welcome change of pace for its star, Will Ferrell. Ferrell is cast dramatically against type as Harold Crick, a lonely and brilliant IRS agent who wakes up one day and hears a female voice narrating his life, which the pragmatic and completely practical Crick finds unsettling at first but learns to accept it to a point, until the day the narrator announces that he is going to die. We then learn that the narrator is actually a mentally-shredded, chain-smoking novelist named Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) with writer's block and that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's latest book. It is revealed that Eiffel always kills off her main characters but is stuck on how to do away with Harold. Meanwhile, Harold seeks the help of an eccentric college professor (Dustin Hoffman) in learning who this narrator is while tentatively pursuing a relationship with a free-spirited baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he is auditing. The story reaches a fever pitch for the viewer as we become completely engulfed in this cat and mouse game of Harold trying to prevent his death before Eiffel can write it, but then the story veers in an unexpected direction that makes this challenging race for Harold's life even more riveting. The film features an intelligent screenplay and crisp direction and Will Ferrell is an absolute revelation here, creating a character like nothing he has done before. His Harold Crick has a mind like an Excel spreadsheet, but is also socially inept, hypersensitive, and full of suppressed dreams. For those who have hated Ferrell's work prior to this, I challenge you to give this film a try. Ferrell actually delivers a performance of depth and vulnerability that might surprise you. Gyllenhaal has never been more appealing on screen and Hoffman is quietly masterful as the know it all professor trying to figure out who the narrator is by learning who it isn't first. Thompson tended to grate on my nerves as Eiffel and Queen Latifah was miscast in the pointless role of her assistant, but it is the deft story and the surprisingly effective performance from Will Ferrell playing a normal human being that made this film a winner."

Great acting by Will Ferrell in a role that is unlike any other he has had and allows him to play the perfect part, both serious and funny within one character who grows on you. He plays a man who learns that he is literally a character in an author's book and can hear her narrating his life as he lives it. As the plot unfolds he realizes that she is planning his death and his only hope is to let her know that he knows about her, and to let her know he is real.<br/><br/>It is a rare film where the writing is so clean and crisp that it keeps you going forward through some twists and turns that might otherwise lose you and is a joy to see unfold.<br/><br/>There are a few stumbles along the way through the middle where you're not sure you want things to go where they go, and in the ending when you realize that the writer's writer has written the perfect ending and it's a letdown when that gets changed...then you realize that you did have both! It all seems ""preposterous"", but then you realize that the whole premise is preposterous! And that the only reason you are shocked is that the writing thus far has been so great that you've actually come to believe the impossible.<br/><br/>All in all it is a wonderful film that is well worth watching, especially for anyone who has ever been or ever aspired to be a writer, for such great lines as the sound of files brushing against each other sounding like the sound of waves on sand.<br/><br/>Watch and enjoy and take away the message (a bit preachy at the end) that your life is a blank book waiting for you to write on it with the footprints of your dancing through it with joy even at the most mundane moments."

","""Monster's Ball"" director Marc Foster's ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is for its star Will Ferrell what director Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"" was for its star Jim Carrey. In each film, these talented comedians play things ostensibly straight without a hint of humor. Indeed, Ferrell proves that he can hold his own without relying on wit and slapstick. Although ""Stranger Than Fiction"" ends up more lightweight than ""The Truman Show,"" the protagonists in both of these existential, post-modern pictures live in a world that essentially doesn't exist. On the other hand, the Ferrell flick is more dramatic, because his character is destined to die from the outset while the Carrey character in ""The Truman Show"" is never in jeopardy. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" qualifies as a much smaller version of Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello's classic 1925 play ""Six Characters in Search of an Author,"" only freshman scenarist Zack Helm's original screenplay could be called 'one character in search of its author.' Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, and Emma Thompson co-star with Ferrell in this imaginative fable about life, romance, responsibility, and what constitutes great art. Interestingly, at one point, Harold watches the Monty Python movie ""The Meaning of Life.""<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Will Ferrell of ""Talladega Nights"") is the epitome of the company man. As a senior IRS tax auditor in Chicago, Crick dresses impeccably, lives a model life without a mate, does everything by the book, and maintains a regimented lifestyle from which he never deviates one iota. Quite simply, he is the kind of employee that any employer would die for. He wears a special wristwatch that keeps his life on time right down to a four minute coffee break and a half-hour lunch break. He counts his steps to work and wears his tie a particular way because it shortens the length of time he needs to dress. He is the ultimate creature of habit and his life seems flawless until one day he hears somebody narrating his life and he doesn't know what to do. Naturally, nobody else hears the mellifluous British voice that utters what he does. Eventually, poor Harold learns that he is the creation of a withdrawn, neurotic, chain-smoking author, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson of ""Sense and Sensibility""), who is wrestling with a bad case of writers block. There is little to like about Kay and the novels that she pens always end with her protagonists dying. Since she cannot finish her latest novel, which is about Harold, her publisher calls in an expert, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah of ""Mad Money""), who has established a solid track record for helping writers complete their books. Karen is obsessed about death and she calls her novel-in-progress, 'Death and Taxes', deriving the title from Benjamin Franklin's assertion that 'in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes'.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, troubled Harold visits a psychiatrist, Dr. Mittag-Leffler (Linda Hunt of ""Silverado"") and explains his incredibly weird predicament. She informs him that he is a schizophrenic. Harold disagrees with Mittag-Leffler's diagnosis. He believes that he is a character in a novel, so she refers him to literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman of ""Midnight Cowboy"") who is as puzzled as he is intrigued by Harold. Hilbert puts his literary knowledge to work and tries to figure out what genre of fiction Harold belongs to: is he in a tragedy or a comedy. Eventually advises Harold to live life on his own terms. While he is struggling with his own lifestyle, Harold is in the process of auditing the tattooed owner of a bohemian-style bakery shop called 'The Uprising.' Ana Pascal (cute Maggie Gyllenhaal of ""Donnie Darko"") hasn't been paying all of her taxes; she explains to Harold that she refuses to pay for the military part of her taxes because she considers it immoral. Initially, neither of them likes each other, but predictably over time, their attitudes change over time.<br/><br/>Again, this is not the typical Will Ferrell movie. In fact, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is the kind of movie that you could watch several times and come away each time with something new. All the actors and actresses are at the top of their game. The wacky ending is about the only thing predictable in this interesting epic."

","This was quite a change of pace for Will Ferrell. While he will always be remembered mostly as a comic actor, this film proves he can handle a dramatic role as well. The story was certainly unique-a man all of a sudden hears a voice narrating his life and every action and soon finds that it is a writer putting together a book about it. He soon learns that she is going to do something drastic and tries to prevent it. I found underlying themes in the film such as appreciating life, not taking anything for granted, and being aware of your surroundings. In that sense it was a little bit like the Queen Latifah film ""Last Holiday."" Coincidentally, she is also in this movie. Will Ferrell was excellent in the film. It had a good cast, which worked really well together. Not just Ferrell and Queen Latifah, but Dustin Hoffman, Linda Hunt, and Emma Thompson. Everything in the movie was good. I really liked it, and I guarantee you will too.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of ****"
"iamsonotsober","10","0","0","18 February 2008"," Will Ferrell in something different and exciting.
","Wow! This film speaks volumes to me. I write this after my second viewing and I don't know why I haven't seen 'Stranger Than Fiction' sooner but maybe it makes it more special when you wait. I think I first heard of this film on IMDb while searching for films Will Ferrell is in. I love his comedies; the stupidity portrayed in films such as Anchorman, Old School, Elf and Zoolander (my favourites) are a joy to watch as they always put a smile on my face. I read an overview that Ferrell was playing it straight and had to take a look for myself.<br/><br/>The film is funny but in a different way to Ferrell's previous encounters on-screen. The film is not full of memorable one-liners; instead the humour for me is derived from the situations Ferrell's character (Harold Crick) is placed in. Crick has a serious, deadpan personality and I think Ferrell nails it with a terrific performance. Ferrell is supported by an outstanding cast; Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman, who all have fantastic and memorable supporting characters. Extra credit must go to Emma Thompson, who does a brilliant job in depicting her character, and a lot of the humour stems from her character's relationship with Queen Latifah's portrayal.<br/><br/>Praise to Zach Helm for writing such a great script, I will be watching closely for any new projects he is involved in. Marc Forster is a superb director; Finding Neverland is well worth a viewing and I can't wait for the new Bond film to arrive. Again I will mention Will Ferrell, for those who already know of his talents, I'm sure you'll appreciate it and for the few who don't think he can portray a serious character, I implore you to hold judgement and watch.<br/><br/>Going back to my first remark...After the credits, I am left with a feeling of inspiration. I feel that I can achieve goals and conquer fears that stop me from doing things with my life that I know deep down, are what I should be doing. I think the themes portrayed in this film resonate with many people and I welcome everyone to spend under 2 hours of their life, rediscovering themselves. It is definitely a rewarding experience. This is what Films and Art in general are here for."

","First of all, don't go expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy of the typical Will Ferrell fashion. If you see this film with an open and perceptive mind, you will get to enjoy incredibly clever script and some terrific performances by all involved. Will is at his best here, as he plays Harold Crick with such nuanced sincerity it really makes the film. Without creating a complex and ultimately genuine character, the film would have not succeeded, and Ferrell deserves much recognition for that. In fact, not a single ounce of Ferrell's trademark shtick ever appears in this film, and it's surprising. And refreshing.<br/><br/>Zach Helm, the writer, also needs to be commended for crafting a screenplay that gives viewers the experience of reading a novel, and yet also somehow manages to be self-aware. There are loads of little details in the film that it will probably take multiple viewings to appreciate them all. Of course, the director expertly ties it all together and is able to even add a great visual style with creative angles and effects to add another layer to an already solid film. It's just a shame that the DVD transfer is terribly sub-par."

"Ddey65","Null","0","0","26 January 2008"," Not exactly a copy of The Truman Show, which is part of the reason it was so good.
","Despite the fact that I liked this much better than ""The Truman Show,"" I'm not 100% sure that comparison is accurate. For one thing in The Truman Show there's a mass audience that knows who Jim Carrey's character is, and everybody knows that he's on television except for him. Nobody knows Will Ferrell's character, except for his co-workers, and one writer who doesn't even know he's a real person. There's another reason, but I forgot what it was.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS Agent who lives a lonely, ultra-mechanical life. He counts every step to the bus stop, every stroke of his toothbrush, etcetera. He's also a math whiz, so he's certainly capable of such anal-retentive behavior. Plus he has a fancy electronic wristwatch which is almost like a living creature. It tends to act like Rufus from ""Kim Possible"" and similar characters that pre-date that Disney cartoon, most of which tend to be animal companions. The guy would be living a pretty hum-drum life if it weren't for the fact that he has a voice in his head following him around and narrating the details of his every actions. And who is this mysterious British woman that narrates his life? Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson), a chain-smoking woman with a severe case of writer's block who has a habit of killing off main characters in every book she writes, and may be a bit suicidal herself. Needless to say, Harold Crick is in deep doo-doo.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal is Ana Pascal, a 1990's-style self-proclaimed anarchist who runs a coffee shop, and deliberately leaves behind a portion of her taxes so we can't defend the country against our enemies. This refusal to pay her taxes is what brings her to Crick's attention. Luckily, she makes these incredible cookies, and as you can expect from a movie like this, the two fall in love simply because they're opposites.<br/><br/>A lot of people have complained about Queen Latifah as the publishing company secretary Penny Escher, but I think she was important. She was a straight-woman to Eiffel's melancholia, and was sent by the company to rush Eiffel into finishing her book. Little do they know how much of a fatal mistake they'd be making if she succeeds.<br/><br/>While taking some time off on the request of his boss(Tom Hulce), and seeing a psychiatrist about his trouble, the shrink(played by Linda Hunt) recommends that Crick sees a literary professor named Jules Hilbert, as an alternative to psychotropic medication. Dustin Hoffman plays that literary professor, whom Crick seeks help in order to escape the wrath of Ms. Eifell. It's during one of those meetings that Crick finds out just who the woman controlling his destiny is, as the Professor leaves his TV running, showing an old interview on a show similar to C-Span's Book-TV. Puzzled as to why anybody would write about Crick, Hilbert suggests Crick staying at home and doing nothing. This fails miserably when construction workers tear his apartment down.<br/><br/>The movie takes a much more drastic turn when Ms. Eiffel discover's there really is a Harold Crick, who discovers that she's not the all-powerful, sinister puppet-master he thought she was. It makes me wonder how I'd react if I found any of my unpublished characters coming to life before my very eyes. It also makes me wonder if any of the other characters she created were real people. Of course, something else altogether different makes Eiffel decide the fate of Mr. Crick, and I really would rather let you find out what that is for yourself.<br/><br/>As other IMDb users have mentioned, this movie shows that Will Ferrell can get away with playing in other kinds of movies besides sophomoric comedies like ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights,"" both of which had the same pacing, and the latter of which I liked much better. On the DVD there are a pair of extended scenes of some of the Book-TV type interviews used in the background in Professor Hilbert's office. Darlene Sunshine(Kirsten Chentworth) was attractive, but utterly annoying and stupid. In spite of that I still say it's worth picking up."
"pannellas","10","0","0","19 January 2008"," This is a very good, enjoyable and thought-provoking movie which reveals that Will Ferrell can act beyond a strictly comedic role.
","I really liked the movie. Will F. and Maggie G. were outstanding, and actually had chemistry between them. The movie flowed well and the script was well-written. My only ""neutral"" comment (""negative"" would be too harsh) is that Dustin Hoffman did the best he could in regard to an explanation or two in the plot which could have been more succinctly defined and explained. It is certainly a ""feel good"" movie, but with more substance. The talent of character actors featured is most impressive. I do not remember the initial release of ""Stranger Than Fiction"". I hope the movie was promoted well; ""Stranger Than Fiction"" would have deserved it."
"Steve G-2","10","0","0","16 January 2008"," Read it again.
","I truly loved this film. I went in with uncertainty, because of the relatively lightweight parts Will Ferrell has had before, and left feeling very good about the world. It blends fiction and the love of fiction better than any other film I can think of.<br/><br/>The basic concept of the film is obvious in the previews: the main character who discovers that he is a character in someone else's book. OK, clever, maybe promising, but could be silly. It wasn't, not for a moment. What is remarkable is how unflinchingly and at the same time tenderly the writing, directing, and acting pursue the ramifications of this simple premise. The elements of love story, the comedy, and the tragedy are not separate aspects of the film; they all relate in important and often subtle ways to this central premise.<br/><br/>One remarkable aspect is the literary quality. Movies about books are rarely satisfactory to people who love books, and here, the relationship was crucial. The narrative from Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson's) book in the works, her own personality, and Professor Hilbert's commentary thoroughly coincide. I have never before seen literature, as such, handled in a movie so convincingly. I could easily believe in Eiffel as a serious, intelligent, introspective author, a master of literary craft; I could fully understand Professor Hilbert's (Dustin Hoffman's) reaction after reading it; I could easily believe that I'd want to read more of her books. <br/><br/>The weakest part (in my subjective view) was the very last scene: not so much the ending plot, but the narrative. For me, that took a bit of the edge off the literary merit. On the other hand, the scene in which Crick and Eiffel finally make contact with each other could so easily have fallen flat; instead it was one of the most perfectly crafted moments I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Note added 2014: After six years this is still one of my favorites ever; every little aspect is just right, and it occurs to me to mention that the relative weakness of the ending is completely appropriate to the story. Those who have seen it will understand why."

","Who thought that the ideas to confront fiction with reality were already over, is a lot wrong. Stranger Than Fiction is one of those movies that ""fiction"" is just a word to qualify its style because, actually, it's a lot real. Have you ever imagined life as a book already written? A life where you're just someone's doll? If you're one of those people that never imagined that, after watching this movie I'm sure you will.<br/><br/>This movie is almost a modern masterpiece. The direction is fantastic and the performance of the actors is outstanding. Will Farrel gives to the character the pathetic and sad tone in a realistic and brilliant way to a point that it's impossible to not sympathize with his character. Although she exaggerates a little in the caricature of her character, Emma Thompson gets the audience's attention effectively. But the audience here is another very interesting thing, because it's a lot more like an observer than a simple audience, it's like some kind of Truman Show experience by another point of view.<br/><br/>The subtlety and the dexterity to balance the tragic from the comic and the constant alternation between the comedy and the tragedy are the highlights of entire movie. Maybe that's the point that Woody Allen tried to catch with Melinda & Melinda, but Forster's results are much more expressive than Woody's.<br/><br/>Other very important point of the movie, a special attractive and also an important material for the context of entire movie is the GUI (Graphic Usuary Interface) especial effects, a brilliant idea that came out after lot of researches and tries, becoming something simple and at the same time essential to comprehend the character's manners, being more than just an especial effect, but a living part of the character.<br/><br/>Marc Forster is showing to be one of the most current versatile and interesting directors and Zach Helm a very promising writer."

","Marc Forster it's a versatile guy. After the drama ""Monster's Ball"", Forster directed the beautiful ""Finding Neverland"" and the inconceivable ""Stay"". But Forster improve yourself in ""Stranger Than Fiction"". Will Ferrell is great like Harold Crick, common and methodic man that starts to listen a stranger voice narrating his life (the most original idea of the decade). Helped by a literature teacher (Dustin Hoffman), he discover that her ""authoress"" is Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson, fantastic), that is having a creative blockade (problem that is resolved by the ""secretary"" Queen Latifah) and always kill your main characters in the end. But Harold doesn't want to die now, because he finds the woman of his life (Maggie Gyllenhaal, great as always). What we see next is a screenplay lesson from master Zach Helm, and a directing lesson from Marc Forster. The philosophical end is just wonderful and all this results in a movie nothing less than perfect."

"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","0","26 December 2007"," An enjoyable, inventive sort-of-comedy
","You'd be forgiven for mistaking this film as a Charlie Kaufman creation because screenwriter Zach Helm seems to have pulled a page right out of Kaufman's book of quirky ideas. Needless to say, if you enjoy Kaufman's inventions then you will probably enjoy this film as well.<br/><br/>The story concerns an IRS auditor (Will Ferrell) who suddenly finds that his life is being narrated by an unknown voice that only he can hear. The premise is simple but the treatment shows surprising depth. The film freely plays with conventions and manages to make some pretty dry concepts somewhat palatable.<br/><br/>The cast is well-assembled, with Will Ferrell taking the spotlight and holding his own alongside major talents like Dustin Hoffman & Emma Thompson. Also worthy of note is the ever-enchanting Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>My main regret is that the movie wasn't quite as good as I thought it could have been. There were some very funny moments early on but comedy soon took a back seat to more 'serious' matters. I think that a more outright comedic slant would have benefited the picture. Not to the exclusion of the 'serious' side but hand in hand with it.<br/><br/>When you get down to it, though, I'm just glad to see that there are still a few movies coming out of Hollywood that can't be pigeonholed into an easy classification."

","""Stranger Than Fiction"" (2006) fits into the tiny sub-genre of recent ""the tax-man needs love too"" films, which includes ""Exotica"" (1994) and ""Off the Map"" (2003). And since nothing of real consequence happens in this moral tale of a film, you could make a case for it being like Eric Rohmer's ""My Night With Maude"" (insert sequences of serio-comic triviality here). Although I can see why some people compare it to ""The Hours"" (2002) it is really a variation on ""Adaptation"" (2002) and its various allegorical elements. <br/><br/>As in ""Adaptation"" you have a stalled character going to a literary professional for advice. Instead of troubled screenwriter Charlie Kaufman seeking advice from adaptation guru Robert McKee, you have IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) contacting literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Which serves as an excuse to utilize a vast store of insider jokes about screen writing/fiction writing. <br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal was in both films. In ""Stranger Than Fiction"" she plays Harold love interest, Ana Pascal, the irreverent owner of a bakery. This is one of the all-time best film romances and it owes a lot Director Marc Forster's casting of these two actors. It's a quirky and sideways path to romance and is sold by Ferrell's trademark lack of guile and Gyllenhaal's way of teasing a role. <br/><br/>As in ""Adaptation"" the wrapped too tight hero might be schizophrenic; but instead of a fast living unpretentious twin brother, Harold hears a woman author's narration in his head; and she is narrating a highly accurate account of Harold's day-to-day existence. The voice is actually that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a slightly suicidal author struggling with writer's block. Her prior books have all ended with the death of her main character (insert ""The Hours"" here) and she is struggling with just how to dispatch Harold in the book she is currently writing. Harold is clued to his ultimate fate when her narration uses the phrase ""little did he know"". Both Ana and Jules nicely display the dichotomy between the passion of their creativity and the reserve of their analysis and critique. <br/><br/>Once he knows his fate Harold begins making positive changes in his life style, which culminates in his romance with Ana. So you get the standard ""stop and smell the roses"" theme, a bit of a ""free will vs destiny"" theme, and finally the principal question: If the novel Kay is writing would be a masterpiece only if it ends in Harold's death, what right does he have continue his life? And the secondary question once Kay understands the implications of a tragic ending: Can she assume the responsibility of sacrificing another life as the necessary cost of producing a masterpiece? <br/><br/>The production design in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is nothing to get excited about but it does not distract from the story. There is some distraction by the effects people who periodically overlay cute little graphics to illustrate Harold compulsive need to count things and set things in order. But it is all in the service of character development. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Every good movie necessarily has a good script. Great acting can overcome some weak scripts (ensemble in Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl - Johnny Depp/Geoffrey Rush were great so were Orlando Bloom and Keira Nightly - overcame what can be considered a weak script). <br/><br/>However a great script can shine with competent actors. Christopher Nolan 'made his bones' this way (see the Following and Momento), and so did Charlie Kaufman (Human Nature, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).<br/><br/>This movie may not be backed by a script quite that (Nolan/Kaufman) good, but the script shines through nonetheless. In the above paragraph, I am not referring to quality of acting in this picture. The cast was excellent so was the casting. Although all the actors have been in better form in other pictures (Will Farrell in Talladega Nights/Anchorman though some may say the comparison is apples and oranges considering this was a dramatic role for him, Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Queen Latifa in Chicago and Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary, I have not seen the too much of Emma Thompson, but she was fine form too), but they gave the SCRIPT the justice it rightly deserved.<br/><br/>The picture was funny, witty (especially with Dave, Harold's friend from work), sad, introspective sweet, and rocking in turns and while being each it was paramountly very very engaging.<br/><br/>A strong solid 8.5/10."

","Charlie Kaufman is a name that is sure to come up whenever anybody discusses 'Stranger than Fiction (2006).' The screenwriter had absolutely nothing to do with this film, but the plot is so reminiscent of 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' and 'Adaptation (2002)' that either his works were an influence on writer Zach Helm, or the two received their inspiration from a common source. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an auditor with the IRS, a position that doesn't afford him the luxury of having many friends. He spends his life immersed in numbers, mathematics, routine and regulations. However, one morning Harold begins to hear a woman's voice inside his head, narrating his every thought and action. Though the people around him attribute the voice to schizophrenia, Harold comes to suspect that he is actually a fictional character, his future dictated by the omniscient author inside his head, and so he seeks the advice of a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). <br/><br/>'Stranger than Fiction' is one of those rare examples of a fresh and original movie idea that redeems your faith in Hollywood's ability to think up something new. Whatever his influences, first-time screenwriter Zach Helm has penned a fun, thoughtful and meaningful script that plays about with a complex abstract idea in a way that is easily followed by the viewer. Director Marc Forster seems to have dabbled in a selection of different genres in the past {he followed 'Monster's Ball (2001)' with 'Finding Neverland (2004)'}, and here he brings together a variety of different emotions, creating a comfortable balance of comedy, romance and tragedy. 'Stranger than Fiction' also has a pleasant visual style, and computer graphics are used cleverly to demonstrate Harold's tendency to count everything he sees, as well as his lifestyle's dependence upon clockwork timing in everything he does.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy work, and nobody can match his talent for throwing a hissy fit. However, here he gives a remarkably restrained performance, playing Harold Crick as quiet, shy and sensitive, quite apart from anything else I've ever seen him do. It goes without saying that Dustin Hoffman is one of the acting greats of his generation, and, though his role in this film is rather low-key, there's no denying his flawless comedic timing, as well as that perfectly gutting moment when Hilbert bluntly informs Harold: ""you have to die; it's a masterpiece."" Emma Thompson is also excellent as Karen Eiffel, a famous tragedy author and, incidentally, Harold's narrator, well-known for killing off her ""fictional"" protagonists in unique and poetic ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also notable as Ana Pascal, a tax-evading baker who falls in love with Harold and helps show him the joy of life.<br/><br/>All great stories must possess a similarly great ending, and unfortunately this is the one facet of 'Stranger than Fiction' that I am in two minds about. The film undoubtedly chose to take the more crowd-pleasing route, betraying the film as a comedy rather than a tragedy, with author Karen Eiffel deciding that a selfless man's life is too much price to pay for a literary masterpiece. One can admire her sentiment, and the positive message that the film is trying to make, but there's no denying that the finale loses much of its potency once the happy ending comes into play. Even more bafflingly, the filmmakers seem well aware that this is the case, with Hoffman's character declaring that Eiffel's revised ending is ""OK"" rather than the flawlessness that he had read earlier. Perhaps it's just the film-lover in me, but I was devastated that the perfect ending had gone begging, and would gladly have accepted it in exchange for Harold Crick's life. But, then again, what if Harold Crick had been a real person?"

","This movie has an innovative plot line and it kept me engaged until the end. I wouldn't exactly call the movie funny; I'd say the word ""endearing"" is more appropriate.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about a quiet, reserved man who comes to realize something very unusual is happening to him: he is hearing a voice in his head. Not just any voice though - a voice that describes what is happening to him in rich, literary detail. It sounds very much like narration ...<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the movie is definitely its unusual plot. How it unfolds and what happens is what keeps the movie interesting. The innocent tone gives the movie a heartfelt atmosphere. Ferrel seems perfectly cast as a mild-mannered character and Thompson seems right for the role of a neurotic writer.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for some light entertainment, this is a great choice."

","I haven't seen this creative of a film where there were no animated characters. It is inventive (although, done before with different slants). Without giving anything away, let's just say that life is too short to NOT live the way you want, fulfill your dreams, and be free to be your true self. I know that sounds probably ""hippie-corny"", but it's what I got out of seeing this. This film has comedy, albeit dark at times, sadness and depression, and true joy and happiness. The realization that sometimes, you need a bit of a curve ball thrown your way to shake you up enough to learn that you are not really and truly living your life. Harold Krick (if I remember correctly), the main character, has routine down perfectly, too much so. People rely on him to be a certain way and display a certain demeanor. And just like touching one dangling piece of a baby's mobile, once a part of him has been ""touched"" by a very unusual event, the rest of his ""routinely perfect"" life shakes out to be nothing routine at all. At the same time (again without giving anything away), an author struggles with how and why she usually ends her books, a.k.a., her own routine."

Of course, the first one is just an ability, but Harold is really good with number and the second is not a superpower, or at least not for Harold, who is so lonely and unnoticed that he considers himself invisible.<br/><br/>That scene of Marc Forster's ""Stranger than fiction"" is really beautiful, but it doesn't contain a touching moment; it's beautiful once you're inside the movie's world and you start appreciating its vocabulary. Essentially, Zach Helm's script is about Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an ordinary guy who one day realizes a writer (a fantastic Emma Thompson, narrating brilliantly) might be creating a novel about his own life, and everything she says occurs to him; or everything he does she explainsNow you tell me if that's not a poetic connection.<br/><br/>What's funny is that Harold is indeed like a character you would find in a book: he counts the times he brushes his teeth, the steps to the bus stop and the numeric details of every place he sets foot in; he has a very special watch with a life of its own and he's not so good with women. He meets one, however (a baker played superbly by Maggie Gyllenhaal), and they develop a relationship so honest that culminates in a phrase that never sounded more beautiful in film: ""I brought you flours""You'll understand.<br/><br/>It's a great screenplay, Zach Helm's work here; and I'll tell you why: it's not faking it. It's not a script that tries to make something real of its characters; it's just pure literature and it respects that quality. But this doesn't occur only in regular conversations, it also takes place during talks about literature. There's a clear literary knowledge in the way Professor Hilbert (a perfect Dustin Hoffman) says things and refers to life; and I'm not even mentioning the obvious references to writers and genres.<br/><br/>Now that I mention genres, I would have loved to classify ""Stranger than fiction"" as a 'beautiful tragedy', but sadly I couldn't; there's a moment where the story kind of betrays itself. It's still a great story though, and Forster's direction generates the perfect climate; and Roberto Schaefer's photography is as beautiful as in ""Finding Neverland"", with special light connections with the story I think I noticed; and Britt Daniel and Brian Reitzell's score is a perfect partner for the film's atmosphere.<br/><br/>And Ferrell is the best leading man. Even if he tried really hard, he couldn't keep us from laughing, but his Harold is so well constructed that we learn to love him with his clumsiness. ""We want him"", like when he walks decisively towards Maggie Gyllenhaal and tells her: ""I want you""."

","Harold Crick is an IRS auditor who leads a very measured, predictable and precise kind of life--so precise that he does things on the dot and counts trivial details like the number of his brushstrokes (36 up and downs, 36 side by sides). He lives in a pleasant cycle until one day he realizes something is wrong--he starts hearing the voice of the narrator dictating almost every step he makes. Little did he know that he is merely a character in someone's novel.<br/><br/>Marc Foster's metafictional story about the interconnection of a character exhibiting a classic case of a contemporary corporate desensitization and a novelist experiencing a writer's block works on the same plane as Sam Mendes's American Beauty--it's a story about someone being reawakened, realizing that he hasn't lived his life the way he wanted it to be. The moment that Harold Crick hears his narrator explicitly telling him that his death is imminent, he freaks out and takes a vacation from his monotonous life.<br/><br/>And he did make everything different. Will Ferrell's acting is surprisingly subtle--considering how wacky he can get in his other films. His tandem with Maggie Gyllenhaal's character Ana Pascal, an intelligent/radical baker who chose to bake cookies and breads (to make the world a better place), is surprisingly effective and at times, though embarrassing to admit, giggle/kilig-inducing. <br/><br/>And there is also this issue whether the narrator Kay Eiffel is writing Harold's story as a tragedy or a comedy. When Harold realizes that he's being driven to make his life better and fall in love with Ana, he thinks that he's definitely in a comedy. But while seeking the help of the character played by Dustin Hoffman, Dr. Jules Hilbert, a literature professor who helps Harold get his way out of this strange literary labyrinth, he tells Harold that the narrator of his story Kay Eiffel, whom HIlbert has taught a class on, is notorious for killing her novels' main characters.<br/><br/>As he continues to understand his role in the story, Harold Crick's wrist watch continues to click and tick to his climactic death. And so there goes the million dollar question: will Harold Crick be able to stop his narrator from killing him?"
"super16","5","0","0","15 July 2007"," A Good Story and Promising Script Ruined by One Significantly Poor Choice
","This review is based on the DVD so I reference some of the bonus features. <br/><br/>The story is an excellent one; while some seemed to feel it should have been more like The Truman Show or Adaptation, I enjoyed the fact the script took some chances, and did so in imaginative ways, while still moving the story forward which is, after all, what any good movie should accomplish. Many of the performances were very strong, particularly Thompson and Hoffman. What is unfortunate is that so many other talented people were, essentially, wasted in what sometimes were pointless cameo's (for example, Tom Hulce, Kristen Chenowith, and Linda Hunt). Queen Latifah (particularly) and Maggie Gyllenhaal's role could also have been played more appropriately by other actors; in Gyllenhaal's case, a different choice would have made the pairing work better. <br/><br/>However, the really bad choice that really ruined the movie was the casting of Ferrell as the lead. While there is nothing intensely wrong with his performance, he is not a very good dramatic actor and does not have the range for this type of role. In the case of Hoffman and Thompson, you got to watch their performances and enjoy the characters without thinking about the acting. With Ferrell, it just felt like you were watching him read the dialogue - competently, at times, I would admit - but this is not a script that called for competence.<br/><br/>When you see the disk and hear the main producer and director (and particularly the screen writer) fawn over Ferrell as the best choice and a good lead, you have to wonder whether this was a choice partially (if not wholly) forced upon by the studio or some of the money men, in the hopes of making the movie more commercial, but unfortunately, in had the effect of making a potentially interesting and really enjoyable movie into a mundane, if at least proficient one."

As I watched this, I kept thinking, what an incredibly fantastic thing that would be. How would one react to such a phenomenon? Could you get anyone to believe you? <br/><br/>Will Ferrell is actually one of my LEAST favorite actors, but he does a wonderful job here. Emma Thompson, is perfect as always. Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Dustin Hoffman are also excellent in their roles. Queen Latifah plays low key and and balances Thompson's twitchy character with her almost droll one liners.

I'm sure most of you know Ferrell from movies like Old School ,Anchorman and many other comedies as his periodic apparition in Wedding Crashers and you have categorized him as a cheap comedy actor but please watch this movie and change your opinion because he gives an awesome performance in Stranger Than Fiction,in the same way that Jim Carrey has proved his acting skills in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,proving he can do an awesome job in drama and not only in comedies Ferrell proved his in Stranger Than Fiction(i predict and Oscar or at least a nominalization for Ferrell in an year or two if he keeps this up).

","First of all, Will Ferrell is amazing as Harold Crick. I highly doubt that anyone expected his performance to be as good as it was. I, myself was surprised at his ability..<br/><br/>His performance was almost immaculate, though he could have been funnier. I'm not gonna lie; I thought it was gonna be the typical Ferrell comedy with a clever twist and actual plot line, so needless to say I thought he'd be a screwball. Surprisingly though, he was rather serious about it, so his performance lacked that wild.. spontaneity(maybe?) that usually comes with the Ferrell package, (meaning he didn't fully lose himself in the role until mid-film, as opposed to his performance in Elf and Talladega Nights, where he was screwball from beginning to end.) Also, I wasn't fully convinced nor did I cheer him on until mid-film.<br/><br/>The film itself is a pearl in an oyster, meaning it looks decent, but the true brilliance doesn't show until the fourth wall is broken and opened. I think this is due to the fact that Ferrell's character doesn't become interesting until he realizes that he's being commented on by some random woman with an English accent. Kind of makes you wonder what you would do if you were him...<br/><br/>The cast is amazing, and aside from the plot, the cast makes the movie. Who's a better supporting cast than Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal? Honestly! On that note, I bid you adu.<br/><br/>~the amazing frances."

","A very odd film, on a Sunday afternoon i hadn't much to do so I decided to watch this one and I was really curious, I heard a lot about this movie and it's strange story. It starts of as a comedy with Will Ferrel as a simple IRS agent who goes to work everyday, missing not a single moment time. He uses his watch for everything, set the time, counting footsteps..He brushes his teeth every morning exactly 80 times and had no friends in life besides a co-nerd from work. But on a regular Wednesday he hears a woman's voice giving voice over on everything what he's doing. He goes on a search to where this voice is coming from and finds out its from a novel writer. Throughout the movie he is figuring out if he's in a comedy or in a tragedy and wants to be in a comedy and tries everything to make it comedy with a little help of a cookie baking girl. Overall it's a good film, funny story, never a dull moment and that with a a lot of conversations, good job. Later on the movie the comedy turns into a bit of a romance which isn't bad at all. It's a movie for everybody, fun, drama, romance, just watch it!"

Stranger than fiction is the antidote to all of the mindless pap pumped out by the slasher and stupid, pointless, fake ""comedy"" machine of Hollywood.

"MadWatch","9","0","0","31 May 2007"," Stranger than real life
","**Some Spoilers** Harold Crick is an IRS agent who comes to the realization, by hearing a narrator's voice in his head, that he is a character in a novel. He then finds out that he is going to be killed in the story. He tries to find the author and urge them to change the story.<br/><br/>The movie is a combination of drama and comedy, with a touch of ""rubber reality"" (examples: Vanilla Sky, Jacobs Ladder) thrown in. I do not like traditional Will Ferrell movies because he always seems to play a buffoon and his comedies seem to appeal to the lowest common denominator in our society. However, Stranger Than Fiction appealed to me and seeing the movie, paid off. Will Ferrell is great in this movie. He plays a straight-forward character who has a very ordered life that he finds is suddenly turned upside down. So completely different from the buffoon characters from other movies, Will Ferrell manages to be serious and genuinely funny, but without going over the top. By the end of the movie, I felt sympathetic and empathic towards the character of Harold Click.<br/><br/>Supporting characters/actors were great as well and really hit the mark. Dustin Hoffman was great as the literary professor that tries to help Harold understand the issue of finding oneself a character in an, as yet, uncompleted novel. Emma Thompson is great as the writer-blocked author that has trouble deciding how to complete the book. Queen Latifah (another actress whom I do not like most of the movies she is in), does a great job as the assistant hired to help the author. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as Anna. However, Anna is a somewhat a clichéd character: She is a wanted-to-be lawyer that instead opened a bakery store thinking she could help others better that way. How many movies have female characters (especially love interests) that are ""good natured, loving people"", simply because they are female? A lot.<br/><br/>It is difficult to point out the main *good* aspect of this movie without spoiling something. Therefore, I would urge a review reader to just go and see the movie. If you want more insight, but this may spoil the end, keep reading.<br/><br/>During the course of the movie, it is difficult to determine where it is heading (I mean this in a good way!). As the character Harold tries to determine about his own life, it is difficult to determine if the movie will continue/end as a tragedy (hero dies) or comedy. Without giving everything away, I will say this: The movie ends in a touching, feel-good type of way that made me feel emotional *long* after the movie ended. :) The movie ends in such a way that when the movie ends, you will look around and think, ""Hey! Maybe life really isn't that bad.""<br/><br/>I rated this movie 9 out of 10."

The director's use of architecture in this film is stunning, painting an emotional portrait of a sometimes-cold, modern world of urban existence.<br/><br/>Characters are brilliantly portrayed, and I felt an emotional attachment to their development on-screen, which is difficult for someone with little emotion. Note the psychological profile of each of the characters, and you are almost sure to notice a different psychosis, OCD habit or other mental shortcoming that only adds to the characters' development throughout the film.<br/><br/>This film truly is a piece of ART... the way movies ( I mean FILMS ) were meant to be.

","This film is one of the greatest of 2006. Certainly Will Ferrell's best since ELF. He stars as tax auditor Harold Crick, a dull man who does everything being obsessed about numbers, doing equations in his his head, etc. He is constantly and silently critiqued by his wristwatch who is as human as Harold is not. Then one morning, while brushing his 32 teeth 72 times (once up and down, second side to side) he begins to hear a woman's voice narrating his life driving him to the point of depressing insanity. One day, he hears her mention that just by resetting his watch would send him to his untimely . He is terrified until he meets a literary expert named Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who helps him sort through stories he might be in or stories he's not in after he learns that she began her prophecy with the third-person omniscient phrase, ""Little did he know..."" The woman narrating is Karen ""Kay"" Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric and isolated author with writer's block, who spends every spare moment contemplating her in various situations (jumping off a building, crashing her car through a bridge and careening off and drowning) who receives an unwanted assistant named Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish her book % and Taxes"" by quietly and gladly off a fictional character named...Harold Crick.<br/><br/>Beneath all this is a romantic subplot between shy, inner-self Harold and a rebellious baker he's auditing, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who she hates and does anything to ridicule and embarrass, even forcing him to sort through a box full of receipts and making him eat an unwanted cookie.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant, making you think. Dustin Hoffman's character and Emma Thompson's characters are remarkably the same. Will Ferrell is clever, convincing audiences that he really is hearing a narrator. Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance of Ana is a bit far-fetched and expected but well worth it.<br/><br/>As it is said in the movie by Prof. Hilbert, ""The thing to determine conclusively is whether you're in a comedy or a tragedy. Have you met anyone who simply loathes the very core of you?"" Harold responds dead-pan, ""Prof. Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent. Everyone hates me."" Hilbert responds, ""Well, that sounds like a comedy."""

","These days, Hollywood movies like to sell drama in the form of reactionary deception, violence, and hopelessness. It's easy for the film industry to continue playing the strings of guilt, fear, and despondency. Stranger Than Fiction is a more rare find. It explores human choice and some of life's tough questions with a kindness, a humaneness that is neither contrived nor sarcastic. The film paints the characters with natural abilities to think philosophically -- which brings a sense of joy and optimism to the intelligent audience. I find it easier to engage in a movie that doesn't clobber the audience over the head with ostentatious political or corporate propagandas. The movie is also a gem in terms of its sincerity in celebrating the subtle acts of human kindness. This film's minimalist approach to human drama is one of the neat gifts that come in small packages.<br/><br/>Will Farrell gave a surprisingly good performance. This movie maybe the springboard out of type-cast roles."

I forgot Mr. Hilarious and zoned into the character he was playing. The man I was watching the movie with got bored 10 minutes in and did not give the movie a chance. I feel that it was necessary to have such a dragging beginning to truly fill the concept. The screen play was delightful! I can't rave enough about how surprised I was. It is amazing to me that one person can think of such an amazing movie. I feel that Maggie did wonderful as well in playing her political (or should i say non-political) role. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as always, in bringing the comedy in such a simple and humorous way. It was somewhat refreshing to see Ferrell be the complete opposite. I am not usually one to comment on a movie I have seen. This movie brings up questions that come through everyones mind. Is all our lives becoming too routine?

I love the fact that the screenwriter gave Will Ferrel the part of an IRS agent, someone who hates his job almost as much as we do. Dustin Hoffman fit so perfectly into his character and I thought that Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely perfect for her role. At times, the plot seemed a little esoteric, but all films have that to a certain degree. The ending was a little weak, but not all films are perfect.

","It's easy to get disappointed when one has too much expectation. Fortunately, the trailer didn't give me false hope. I was far beyond not disappointed. I was happy and thrilled after watching it.<br/><br/>It's really easy-watching because the main character, an ordinary single man who lived a routine life, is just as easy for most of us to relate to. Though the plot is a little bit tight and weird, the film itself was shot in a simple, comfy and inspiring way. The witty narration and conversations were very exciting and informative. As Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson were all bring forward amazing performances, the college professor role played by Dustin Hoffman was the most surprising. Contrary to his always serious facial expression, his method to help Harold figure out the voice was just so ridiculously funny, but I had to admit it was reasonable...Their performances to me were all award-worthy. Anyway, who cares the awards --- as long as they are worthy.<br/><br/>It's a film about choice, fate, and most of all, loving your life for every subtle thing, which is especially good for a tired heart. Who doesn't get tired? So go and watch it. Highly recommend! <br/><br/>If there was something not quite right about this film, **(spoiler)it had to be the accident in the ending. I thought his death could have been more dramatic. At least I didn't think a bus which was stopping along a stop could hurt Harold as hard as that.** Anyway, it was probably their intention to give us an ordinary ending, thus more convincing and inspiring."

We assume that, as Kay speaks, she is typing as well. All gets worse when Kay lets slip that she is looking for a way to kill off Harold Crick in the novel. Harold hears this and is now more than worried. Who wouldn't be? <br/><br/>Little did I know that I would ever be praising a Will Ferrell movie, but that is exactly what I am doing. Finally, he is doing what he should be doing and that is acting in a dramatic role (selling cars was my second choice for him). His performance is perfect. There I said it.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman, as a literary analyst, is always good in his dead-pan way. Emma Thompson shines as the author, who constantly searches for a way to end her novel and the life of (gulp!) Harold Crick; and Queen Latifah, does a good, but understated, job as a literary enforcer trying to get Kay to finish the novel for the publisher. But, we fell in love with a baker: Maggie Gyllenhaal almost at first sight and Harold falls for her too and doesn't want to die. We just hope her tattoo's are washable.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some laughs in here - very subtle ones - but nothing memorable to write about.

"commandercool88","8","0","0","30 March 2007"," Delightful Comedy
","A quirky but thoroughly charming little film, 'Stranger than Fiction' finds humor in the mundane and celebrates individuality. This unusually sentimental story finds Will Ferrell at the top of his game, while the film's supporting cast lights up the screen wonderfully. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, and it'll win you over in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Harold Crick lives a simple life. He lives and works with numbers, and never sways from his precise and calculated schedule. All this will change, however, the day he begins hearing a voice. A voice that will narrate all that he does... and informs Harold of his imminent death. Little does he know, this is actually the voice of Karen Eiffel, an author whose writing block is preventing her from killing the main character in her new book. The character? Harold Crick. The real Harold is now in a race against time to understand what's happening to him, and along the way, he will meet new faces who help him learn a thing or two about life, love, and his own mortality.<br/><br/>Like Harold Crick, 'Stranger than Fiction' is a simple film. All it asks of you and me is to suspend our disbelief for a couple hours and open our minds, however illogical the film's premise may be. Other than that, the film's charm will do the rest. It's such a heartfelt and well-meaning film, it's easy to get pulled in and caught up. It's fast-paced with an intelligent script which packs on the quick and witty dialogue that underlines many of the movie's fantastic performances. Almost everything 'Fiction' does is spot-on. From its dry humor to eloquent narration to its theme about mortality and life. And though it's a movie, it's as poetic as a book as it unfolds right in front of us. A very good book at that.<br/><br/>The key to such a character driven film such as 'Fiction' depends overwhelmingly on the workings of its cast. And for the record, the talent that assembled to work together on this project couldn't have been better. It's difficult to see a physical comic like Will Ferrell in such a subdued role, when he's usually so... in the moment. He's a great actor, and his role here is definitely among his best. But for some reason, I think I like him better when he's being his outrageous usual self. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers another fine performance as always, and yes, even after the year she had in 2006, she remains criminally underrated. Go figure. Queen Latifah is delightful as ever, her presence as an actress continues to be striking and impressive. But I believe many will agree when I say that the highlight of the film comes from veteran actors Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Both find themselves at the top of their game with their respective roles, they're so delightfully funny and happen to be the perfect touch to top off this tender film.<br/><br/>One of 2006's most pleasant surprises, 'Stranger than Fiction' is a winning offbeat dramedy. Its message of living life to the fullest is one we've heard time and again, but it's presented in an original and effective way this time, handsomely wrapped as a little fable of a comedy. A film like this is worth seeing for its phenomenal character actors, who bring this film to life in great fashion."

","Harold Crick lives his life the same day after day until he begins to the hear the voice of the narrator, telling him everything he's doing and is about to do. This is when he becomes aware of his impending doom, and seeks out the narrator, hoping she will not tell the end of her story.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell (playing Harold Crick) takes a nice change of acting here. While this is still a ""comedy"" in a general sense, it's not the kind where you laugh a lot or expect stupid behavior. It's a more mature, refined comedy. And I think Ferrell really proved something to us all when he took this turn.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman provides the best character in the film (which is even better because it's played by Dustin Hoffman). A literature professor who tries to find Harold's author based on his life events and the use of the phrase ""little did he know"". This is where the existential aspect really comes in -- life as literature, a deep philosophic tradition (I won't get into it here).<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal: Great actress, beautiful... and love the anarchist baker character (at a bakery called The Uprising). Wonderful.<br/><br/>Is the narrator/author Nicholas Sparks? She's known for killing off all her main characters. It would be like as if in the middle of ""A Walk to Remember"" that Mandy Moore realized that Sparks was writing her. ""Oh crap,"" she's say. ""Any hope of surviving this film has just been completely shot."" This will be the first time I ever wrote a ""spoiler"" but I have to, because the only part of this movie really worth discussing is the very end. Harold is supposed to die, he is written to die, and we see him dying. To me (and most people I talked to) this was the perfect ending -- end it here and fade to black. But instead they make him survive the impossible and the ending is changed. Which was horrible.<br/><br/>The only part that makes this new ending redeeming is Dustin Hoffman, who has seen both endings and informs the narrator that the original ending was vastly superior. The fact the movie actually admits it would be better to do what they chose not to gives them some credit... though I still wish he had died."

","Pretty slight and sometimes awkward comedy/drama, propelled only by a great cast and interesting visuals. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, which is fine, but it's not even clever or witty for much of it, and many times the joke attempts just fall flat. The drama portions are heavy-handed and melodramatic, and the romance feels rushed and, as a result, becomes unbelievable. The acting is terrific, though - Will Ferrell is great playing against type, Dustin Hoffman is quietly funny, and Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are both solid. But Maggie Gyllenhaal steals the show, coming across as both funny and sad. I liked the writing and diagrams on screen to represent Crick's thought process, and the look of the film is adequately quirky, but the story just leads up to nothing. Somewhat disappointing."

The added special effects at the beginning of the film, like the numbers of times he brushes his teeth, and how the kitchen is outlined by white lines, adds a comedic and contemporary feel to the film.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Emma Thompson plays the nervous writer who has a writer's block, and she portrays the nervous self very well. Will Ferrell plays a lost man trying to delay his death, and I am very glad that he finally appears in film without pulling any silly faces.<br/><br/>It is worth a watch, but the film can be slow at times. If there was tighter editing, the film would be more enjoyable."

","After I picked this up in the mail, I didn't expect to find anything out of the ordinary for a normal Will Farrell. I expect some slapstick here and there, no real emotions, and just absolute nonsense throughout two hours, with a couple of laughs here and there. What I got really surprised me. ""Stranger than Fiction"" is about Harold Crick, a man who wakes up one morning to find that his life is being narrated. After many of these annoyances, he finally gives in to find a shrink. The shrink recommends that he find someone who knows more about literature. There he meets Dustin Hoffman's character, where they elaborate on what to do next. Meanwhile, the narrator, and the author of an upcoming, but incomplete, book about her main character Harold Crick. Just one problem: Whatever she creates for the character Harold Crick happens to the real Harold Crick. ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a very fun movie, with a very impressive script, great performances, fine directing and nice cinematography. The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect score is that the ending really didn't live up to the rest of the movie and the message intended for the viewer wasn't displayed properly; but still, ""Stranger than Fiction"" was a fine film."

His turned out to have been good advice as I found it to be quirky, delightful, intelligent and original; somewhat in the vein of ADAPTATION (2002) but with a more optimistic outlook.<br/><br/>I had never watched any of Will Ferrell's star vehicles before, but he really nailed every facet of his character here (and was thus a deserving Golden Globe nominee); similar care has been applied to the supporting cast: a charming Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman (who had also appeared in FINDING NEVERLAND), a slightly overstated Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah (who, surprisingly, keeps a reasonably low profile throughout).<br/><br/>Ultimately, though somewhat overlong, I feel that STRANGER THAN FICTION was perhaps more deserving of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay than LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006)except that it wasn't even nominated!  but, at least, the quality of Zach Helm's work has been recognized by being one of the 5 finalists for the WGA (Writers' Guild of America) award, while the National Board Of Review deemed it the year's best."

","Not having heard much about this film made it more enjoyable. I will therefore withhold spoiler comments. Suffice to say that the script was clever and consistent; the characterizations by the actors likewise. Will Ferrell gave a great performance as the protagonist, much restrained in comparison to previous roles (in Zoolander, Bewitched, Elf, etc.--pick one). Reminiscent of a younger William H. Macy, Ferrell brings through his character's existential dilemma loud and clear. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a fluid and believable performance as the love interest whose quirky, rebellious, and intelligent manner make her sexy. <br/><br/>Veterans Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson deliver as one would expect, entirely at one with their roles. Emma Thompson is enjoyable to watch doing practically anything, and this role gave her a lot to play with. Last but not least, the supporting cast (most notably Queen Latifah) was solid and held the film together. The story was clever, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and moved along well. The production and direction were stylish and engaging. This film is a great date movie, and is certainly worth the cost of a rental."
"Polaris_DiB","8","0","0","28 February 2007"," Actually quite superb
","I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but was unsure if I wanted to see it as I haven't liked anything done by Will Ferrell so far (and yes, I've seen parts of ""Elf""). Deciding to let that X-factor slide, I went ahead and checked it out based on some of the reviews I heard.<br/><br/>Turns out Will Ferrell wasn't only good, he was brilliant and perfect for the role. His usual sarcastic-saturated loudness was replaced by a reserve and quietness that created a Harold Click absolutely perfectly around the narration.<br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction is a movie about a boring, lifeless IRS auditor who one day gets distracted from his daily routine of counting brush strokes on his teeth by a woman narrating his life. This oddity eventually turns out to be only one of his problems as his life suddenly starts changing one-by-one: he meets a woman he falls almost instantly for, his watch starts making fits, and the professor of literature he goes to see for advice can't seem to decide if he's in a comedy or a tragedy. Not only that, but the narrator told him he is going to die soon.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious and pretty well written (minus perhaps the cliché Stiff-Neck-Falls-In-Love-With-Free-Spirited-Woman subplot and the underdevelopment of Queen Latifah's character, who is surprisingly good in her role as well), which is probably one of the reasons why everyone does so well in it. Amazing what a good script and some decent directing will do to turn an annoying comedian into an actor.<br/><br/>I was slightly curious about the ending. I actually secretly hoped he'd die just to see if the filmmakers would be gutsy enough to kill him. However, the ending it has is actually very appropriate and perfect.<br/><br/>This movie does pose an interesting questions, and NOT the ""if you knew you had a short time to live"" one. As a writer or storyteller, are you responsible for your characters' deaths? How important is a great work of literature over somebody's life? How close can you really get to your characters before you can't bear to see them go? --PolarisDiB"

I was so unsubmerged in the plot, in fact, that even more shocking scenes of attempted suicide or dramatic apartment reconstruction left me in a near comatose state.

"rwcornner","9","2","5","11 November 2006"," Who is in charge of my life?
","Who is in charge of my life? Who is telling my story? What makes my life worth living? Who determines whether my life is worthy of continuing or ending? Stranger Than Fiction seems to ask these questions as it tells the story of an author, Kay Eiffel, whose neurotic and tortured life always produces death for her main character at the end of her novels.<br/><br/>After 10 years of frustration and failure, Eiffel is on the verge of completing another such novel. All she is missing is the manner in which her character, Crick, will die. Why is death the only fitting ending for her characters? I would suggest that our world culture is built upon such a premise of someone having to die for the story to make sense to us. We are accustomed to such endings.<br/><br/>What we see in this simple, but powerful film is a portrait of the ancient god and laws that have shaped us and our cultures. The logic of this god and commandments is simple: someone must be ""voted off the island"" through death or exclusion for the good of the story or culture. In this case, she is an author who can not write without having death as the ending of her stories. Her novels always follow this pattern. Her success is based upon her slavish obedience to the commandments by which she writes and lives. At some point I began to wonder if the commandments actually restricted her to one course of action. Was god bound by laws and robotically following out a script? Crick seems like a simple fool who goes through life robotically. He, too is following a set of commandments. I almost wondered if Crick were not already technically dead through his slavish following of the rules of his job and his internal need for order. It is only when he discovers that his death is imminent that he starts to move outside of his robotic behavior.<br/><br/>Crick's work as an IRS agent and his relationship with someone he is auditing reminded me of Jesus' relationship with the tax collectors of his day. Crick was reviled by the woman he is required to audit. But this relationship is transformative. The author allows Crick the vulnerability to be touched with desire for this woman. Prior to this moment, Crick did not operate based upon greed, but upon following the ""rules of life,"" which included auditing people whose objections to the tax were passionate and life-affirming. Perhaps this is what rekindled the passion in Crick.<br/><br/>Crick's fear of losing life, had cost him his life. Passion and desire to be LIFE, saved his life. Life is willing to lay down life for the good of another. The death that he was living was an unconscious participation in a system that denies such human freedom and uses fear to enforce it. In the end, was the author of Crick's story transformed as well? Perhaps we are all being challenged to look at our lives. Are we following the commandments of LIFE or of death? I will leave these questions to those who will see this creative and passionate tale."
"mgoldhamer","6","2","5","10 November 2006"," Stranger Than Fiction: Apples To Apple Sauce
","Harold Crick's life is so orderly that whatever he does has white over-lays like blue prints that only the audience and he can see. He also says he hears a woman's voice telling him what to do with his life! What is so strange about a man hearing voices? What is most peculiar is having a Timex wrist watch that thinks for itself and it's owner! Unfortunately the wrist watch never gets enough personality to gain status as a main character. Rene' Magritte's paintings of the black suited men with Granny Smith Apples for faces and Black Derby hats would fit well as the character portrayed by Will Farrrell. Mr. Farrell is seen many times walking the streets of the 'Windy City' holding a large Granny Smith Apple between his teeth and accomplishing little else. Throughout the film the reference between Harold Crick and the apple becomes very apparent. The voice in his head are the written words of the novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is trying to slay her main character, Mr. Crick, but at the moment has an unfortunate case of writer's block. Toward the close of the film Ms. Eiffel who is a life observer instead of using a muse, watches a stray Granny Smith Apple roll off a fruit display onto the street and this is the vision for the end of Harold Crick. Ms. Eiffel completes her novel but has a change of heart because Harold has had a total life transmogrification.

"srfn","8","2","6","7 November 2006"," Stranger than Fiction
","""This is the story of Harold Crick"" So begins what may well be a career altering move for the notorious Will Ferrell. At least we all can hope. Stranger than Fiction is the story of an IRS agent who suddenly begins to hear the voice of a woman he has never met narrating his life and predicting his death. What he will soon find out is that he is the central character of a novel-in-progress that will forever change his life.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Betwitched) plays Harold Crick. This is a character quite possibly unlike anything he has done before. Everyone has become very much accustomed to the utterly ridiculous and more often than not simply obnoxious people he has played in the past. Whether by some divine intervention or other benevolent force, that character has been thrown out the window. With any luck, gone will be the days of Elf and cameos like his appearance in Wedding Crashers. Of course these comedic turns can be fun but in all honesty the true word, as a friend so aptly put it, is ""gratuitous"" and for the most part just unnecessary. This new version of the Will Ferrell, with his smart but not over-the-top or high-horse ""ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances"" face lift, is vastly preferable to his insultingly in-your-face style of previous roles.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also well worth the price of admission. The always brilliant Emma Thompson (Love Actually, Sense and Sensibility) plays the slightly unhinged, as all great authors seem to be, Karen Eiffel, who has not published a book in 10 years. Thompson once again devotes herself whole-heartedly to the role, very believably outfitted as the plagued creative genius. Dustin Hoffman (Meet the Fockers, Rain Man), as literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, brings a decidedly quirky yet cleverly realistic element to the film. His character is perceptive and practical, although at times very fatalistic, but Hoffman pulls off this contradiction without a hitch. Even the love interest played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (World Trade Center, Mona Lisa Smile), bakery owner Ana Pascal, finds that happy medium between just plain weird and approaching normal. She is accepted because she reflects the reality of how an individual can be made up of so many different parts yet still find happiness within their own highs and lows.<br/><br/>The film channels I <3 Huckabees and Punch Drunk Love, but even if those two films seemed way too out there to follow, this one is not. It shares the ideas and messages from those films but makes them easier to understand without diluting them or drying them out. It is fun but smart, laugh-out-loud but thought-provoking. Essentially, the tight script and flawless casting are what make the film. The characters deliver their one-liners and soliloquies with finesse. Timing, both on the side of the writers and the actors, really draws the viewer in and keeps them there for the duration. The awkward small talk of the socially inept, the connection made at the recognition of a shared favorite song or the different ways of dealing with the notion of destiny; these are what make the film amusing, touching and revealing. It is interesting that at one point the discussion of literature that Harold hopes will reveal the truth behind his situation turns to whether he is the hero of a comedy or a tragedy, because that categorization can be applied to more than just the written word, and this film catches that, both hilariously and movingly."

","Stranger than Fiction proved to be an enjoyable ride with twists and turns I couldn't have predicted. It's always nice to watch a film and genuinely not know how it's going to end. The film employs a unique technique of self-awareness of the script itself; utilizing age-old storytelling tools found in Aristotle's Poetics to not only present the in-context narrative of Harold's journey, but as a form of social commentary by literally presenting a character that knows he's in a story. It's a unique concept and fun premise that sounds promising from the start. The danger comes into play when one considers the film's overall theme and purpose.<br/><br/>Right off the back, I will say this is one of Will Ferrell's most impressive performances. The scene when his inevitable death becomes apparent with Dustin Hoffman's literary teacher character is one that felt emotionally truthful and raw. All in all, Will Ferrell gives a surprisingly subdued performance that feels remarkably held back for what it could be. I was also impressed (but not surprised) by Emma Thompson's performance. I felt her portrayal as a self-destructive and haunted writer. Her performance felt truthful and honest.<br/><br/>When it comes to the script, some of the film's most memorable moments come from the human moments imbedded in the screenplay's strongest moments of dramatic tension. The confrontation between Harold and Karen presents a layered dilemma with more at stake than just what's presented on the surface. The sequences portraying Harold and Ana's gradually changing relationship develop their character's journeys well and demonstrate excellent understanding of sequence construction and composition and understanding of momentum throughout the story so the narrative is constantly moving forward.
With all the strengths however, the script's issues can be readily seen through the various plot holes and unclear narrative world/rules in the construct of the story.<br/><br/>The story opens with a narrator that narrates Harold's life. When he finally becomes aware of this narrator's voice and commentary, it's unclear at first exactly what he's confused by. When we're introduced to Emma Thompson's character, it's very unclear who she is and what her purpose is since it's apparent she's the narrator. Starting off with a seemingly fantasy sequence of her imagining jumping off a building to her death made me think she was some kind of supernatural worker whose job it was to kill certain characters via useless narration. The entrance of her new assistant didn't help this unclear and confusing set up to a character that left me wondering when I would finally know who this character was.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the reveal of her being the author of a book of Harold's story (along with the reveal to him) was immensely satisfying. With that reveal however, more questions presented themselves like ""When and how did her influence begin to control Harold's life?"" ""Has she influenced his entire life?"" ""Who is really in control of his life?"" ""At what points are his life out of her control or knowledge and why?"" These questions kept pressing in the back of my mind throughout the picture and made it difficult to be completely invested in the world of the story. In a fantasy(ish)-style story like this, it's important to set up the rules of the fantasy clearly so we understand and can make the distinction between reality and fantasy. Having a clear understanding of the world of dreams in Inception help us get invested in the characters because we understand exactly what is at stake. Even if the reveal is throughout the design of the story, we understand the rules appropriate to that phase of the story. In this film, the inner-physics and mechanics of the story was unclear at several times that knowing would have enhanced the film's impact.<br/><br/>Due to a disorganized view of the story's rules, I had a hard time understanding what the movie was ultimately trying to convey. Perhaps a rough view of life's meaning and purpose. Perhaps the character arc of Harold learning to live life to the fullest (which is not what he was doing) in the beginning of the film. If that was the goal, for the protagonist to learn to live life in the most human way he can, perhaps another character/external force determining his fate is a contradictory narrative move. Perhaps a collaboration with the slightly anti-social writer and the character whose goal it was to become the master of his own destiny life would've helped bring each character's arc to a satisfying close and drive home the purpose stronger.<br/><br/>Still, I had a good time with the movie and it was enjoyable. There's a lot to love about the movie and does a great job and including the audience in the journey of the character while demonstrating excellent sequence ordering and momentum that help drive the film forward. It's very entertaining and while there are issues, it's hard to imagine anyone actually hating this movie. It's appeal feels universal and it's balance of drama and comedy are expert."

","Stranger Than Fiction starring Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson and directed by Marc Forster is a film that kind of slipped under the radar for a lot of people. I hadn't heard of it until I saw the trailer for it on a DVD. What first drew me to it was the movie's concept. I was expecting an interesting enough, Will Ferrell comedy, but what I luckily got was a deeply intimate, thought provoking, emotional and humorous tale, that might just be the greatest dramedy ever in my opinion.
The film about a reserved and lonely man named Harold Crick who wakes up to find a women narrating his life within his mind. We find out the narration is a famous author writing a book, and plans to kill him in the end of the novel...
The concept itself it greatly original and it pretty much sucks you in from the very start. I love Stranger Than Fiction because of the way it builds on its already great concept to truly make a statement on control, love, life, fate, and responsibility. The movie could've had Will Ferrell ending up in insane comedic situations, but instead it makes us look at our own lives through the lens of a man who feels real. Harold Crick is maybe a extension of our own fears and desires. He's what we would be if we didn't take risk. Even though his real fate is set it by the author writing the book, he had already pre-decided his fate by the life that he was living. This makes us question what kind of life we're living. The movie offers inspiration through a fantasy concept and conveys it really beautifully.
However, the movie is also very humorous. The comedy in the movie is very clever and you will find yourself both in thought and wearing a big smile during this movie.
The reason I think it is the greatest dramedy ever is because one of the themes of the movie is tragedy vs comedy. While it is humorous, it never compromises its emotion and honesty.
If I had to find a flaw within this movie, it might be the ending as I feel like they could've gone a less safe way as they did, but the ending still is very sweet for what it is.
Stranger Than Fiction is one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. It has a great plot, great screenplay, directing, and is just a great film. It's sad to see that is not talked about as much. Will Ferrell gives by far his best performance in his career showing he can really play a character with weight. This is one of my favorite movies and I hope you decide to hop into the both humorous and dramatic mediation that is Stranger Than Fiction.
10/10."

","There was a lot going on in this film that I did like. I enjoyed the vfx in the beginning that added to the narration. There were also a lot of interesting shot choices towards the beginning but also at the end especially one shot as it approaches the bed in the end, with the pink lighting was amazing. The film was also enjoyably meta and somehow set not quite in modern times which was enjoyable too.<br/><br/>As other reviewers pointed out, it could have been quite philosophical in nature and/or explore a deeper love story that would have strayed from the usual boy meets girl. This part seems like an edit that was forced by the studio execs rather than what the writer would have wanted. Is the message really supposed to be that love trumps all? Being so prevalent in movies it gets lost in the bucket of cliches that we all have grown to hate.<br/><br/>The flirting with Anna was really organic and some of the dialogue in the movie was really well written. I had to think of the old parable "" if you met mr right, he would run away"" and it was satisfying that neither of the characters initially liked each other but grew warmer, culminating in a night of love with flours (good pun) and guitar ballads (a nice tying of the guitar plotline).<br/><br/>What lacked was finally that it was set up in such a way that led you to believe that the watch (which was a great character btw) caused Harold to save the kids life, when it should have been the change in personality through the hero journey. The way the movie is set up however, it is not clear that at the start of the movie the character would have acted differently and there is no real connection of his action of saving the child, to anything he had learnt during the story.<br/><br/>If youre expecting a comedy, you shouldnt be, watch it for a nice rom(com(but not really)) and somewhat drama."

","Stranger Than Fiction (2006): Dir: Marc Forster / Cast: Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah: One of the most original films of the year with a grand view of living life to the fullest. Emma Thompson plays an author struggling with writer's block. Her novels are tragedies often ending in death. Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick who suddenly hears her narration because he is a character in her latest book. He seeks help in dealing with this narration and learns that she is planning to kill the character, meaning himself, off. Director Marc Forster deserves credit for mastering such brilliant material. Ferrell is superb as the tax auditor whose life is routine until he is faced to embrace life and opportunities. Thompson demonstrates the frustration of an author trying to place ideas to paper and then facing the reality of life and death. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a baker whom crick is auditing and whom he gains affection for. She has a passion for cooking and people yet fights mindless taxes. Dustin Hoffman plays a literary professor assisting Crick in placing his situation as to whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy. Queen Latifah has a nice role as someone assigned to assist Thompson with her book to please the publisher. Result is a meaningful clever comedy presenting a fantastic portrait of life presented more delicately than fiction. Score: 10 / 10"

","I was pleasantly surprised. All of the acting was spot on and Will Farrell did a great job. I has seen a lot of his work and this one is obviously a more serious role. Sure he is a great comedian and always makes me laugh which he also did in this movie at time. But he was also able to be dramatic when he needed too.<br/><br/>The story and the script were well written. I enjoyed a few twists and turns here and their, without giving anything up. You should see this move and realize how important life is when we know the end is coming. Perhaps more people should live life and enjoy life instead of being caught up in the same mundane rat race simply looking to accumulate money, and consumer goods.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the message and I will definitely watch this movie again in the near future. You should too."
"jax_lady2002","10","1","2","25 December 2014"," Love this movie, one of my favs
","I really enjoy seeing Will Farrell in a dramatic role, not comedic. It's interesting how his life's routine are told in a story like way, but the main character (Will) can hear her and it's driving him crazy he's got to figure it out. She's writing a book, yet its his life. However mundane and boring it may be. Dustin Hoffman is an interesting as a psychology professor. Will meets the Maggie Gyllenhall character and she's so much fun and such a free spirit, quite his opposite. Yet he lets loose a little and is attracted to her. She's so free and open minded she gives him a chance. I love this movie and it's such an unusual method of story telling. One of my all time favorites. Such a great message."
"moviemattb","10","1","2","31 July 2014"," A Wonderfully and Visually Experience
","Will Ferrell can always make audiences laugh, but can he make audiences feel sad and be more sympathetic for whatever role he takes? The answer is without a doubt: Yes. Will Ferrell is absolutely fantastic in his role as IRS Agent Harold Crick; he can not only be funny, but also can be serious. This is in my opinion my absolute favorite Will Ferrell movie. If you like him doing comedies, then you'll love him doing drama. He really does steal the show. The idea of a man whose life is always distracted by a narrator is actually a pretty clever concept, and I thought it was well executed. I do get the sense of the movie as it was taken place in Chicago because the city itself does play a character, you usually do get a sense of the environment and see how these people do with their lives (EX: kid riding on a bike, an African-American woman doing her job, etc.). The direction by Marc Forster is outstanding, and he really does tell a good story and knows where to point the camera at. The rest of the cast Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Queen Latifah all do their jobs well. The story; the pacing; the cinematography; the editing; the direction; and the music all come together pretty well. This is also one of my favorite movies, and my favorite Marc Forster movie. I do enjoy his direction alright in a James Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace,"" but I love his work on this one the best. The movie does add into a lot of context, which it is hard to explain but I can't help it on how much I really love this movie. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is both a wonderfully and visually experience. I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

Well framed, and composed. The colors are so telling, and they change throughout the film to match the situation, and this simply adds to the experience. <br/><br/>As for the performances, simply amazing. Will Ferrell steps out of his cliché over-the-top r-rated comedy role to play a very sensitive and late blooming character. He handles it perfectly, and it truly shows that Will Ferrel has the ability and can more that handle different roles. Alongside him on screen are Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gylenhaal. All of these characters propel the film and brings the whole piece together. Great casting."

But that isn't the point of this film.

","There isn't much to add in another review of this movie as there are already over 500!<br/><br/>But I can say, for anyone seeking a finely told story, that this is a good choice! If you are concerned about Will Ferrell as the lead actor and this being one of his goof ball comedies, you are wrong. He's not a comedic actor I enjoy but his dramatic acting is spot on and he does a fine job here.<br/><br/>The movie is also visually pleasing with sets reflective of the characters and rich with colors. There is a scene in the movie with Harold Crick sitting on a bus - and it's one of those double buses with the accordion like flexible middles. Crick is sitting at the accordion part - the movement outside the bus as it turns and travels is reflective of what is about to happen to Crick. In other words his life is about to become very confusing and unbalanced."
"Lorizon9","7","1","2","26 March 2013"," Worth seeing
","The film tells the story of an IRS agent who starts to hear a voice in his head narrating his life, without knowing where it comes from, or whether he's losing his mind. This voice is that of the character played by Emma Thompson, an agoraphobic, depressed writer desperately trying to finish her last novel, unknowingly using the life of a real person as her inspiration.<br/><br/>The film, though primarily a comedy, is much more than that, and it doesn't hesitate to give us a few great emotional and dramatic scenes, culminating in the second half of the movie when the character hears the voice predicting his death. It also explores the theme of control. The main character first feels he is controlled by the voice who knows even before him what he's going to do, but he soon discovers that if he is controlled, it's by his neurotic tendencies.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel, the main actor, does a tremendous job in this difficult role. A lot of his scenes involve close-ups of him reacting to this mysterious voice he hears, and he conveys his confusion and panic beautifully. His reactions range from hilarious at first to heart-breaking when he's on the brink of losing hope, and it feels genuine every time.<br/><br/>This film tells us the journey of this character, seemingly living a small, insignificant life, realizing that maybe he aspires to more when it is retold to him in excruciating details by the voice. But at the same time, it shows that every life has its worth, even the most mundane.<br/><br/>The end is a little predicable, but offers an interesting conclusion for the characters. If you like atypical movies you should like this one."

","Will Ferrell is an IRS auditor living a life that is ""Stranger than Fiction"" -- in fact, it is fiction -- in this 2006 film also starring Emma Thompson,Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah.<br/><br/>Ferrell is Harold Crick, a smart auditor who lives his life on a strict schedule and leads a sterile life. One day he starts hearing a voice narrating what he's doing. He appears to be the only one hearing it. It upsets and annoys him, so he sees a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who sends him to a literary professor (Hoffman). The professor says the first thing to decide is if he's in a comedy or a tragedy. Crick is sent to audit a bakery owner, Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), and the two end up falling for one another.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, a well-known author (Thompson) is sent an assistant (Latifah) by her publisher because she needs help finishing her book. Her character, Harold Crick, needs to be killed off, and she can't figure out how to do it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the narrator in Harold's head reveals that he's going to die, and Crick recognizes the narrator's voice on a TV interview. Learning the name of the author, he sets out to find her to ask her to change her book.<br/><br/>Wonderful story of a man learning to live just at the point he's going to be killed off, and it's filled with humor, sweet moments, and poignancy. Author's characters coming to life is not a new plot, but the way ""Stranger than Fiction"" is handled is very fresh.<br/><br/>A terrific cast doesn't hurt -- Will Ferrell isn't always fabulous, but he pulls off Harold Crick very well. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the defiant baker who doesn't mind paying taxes but won't pay any taxes toward defense, is wonderful - hostile and later caring and sweet. Thompson is one of the finest actresses around. As a woman in the midst of artistic crisis, tortured by trying to bring her book to a close, she gives a strong performance. Her best scene is in the hospital -- she's there because she needs to be in touch with death for her book -- and she asks a nurse where the people who are going to die are. ""These people are injured,"" she complains with a straight face, ""and they'll be okay after you help them. Where do you keep the people who are going to die?"" Hoffman and Latifah in supporting roles are excellent, both bringing humor to the situation.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing with a fine script by Zach Helm and good direction by Mark Forster."
"aaditya-swaroop","6","1","2","20 September 2012"," Could have been much more
","This movie could have been so much moremore funny by putting in comical situations, more romantic (I could feel the romance brewing between Harold & Ana), more thrilling (Harold's search for the author could have been more dramatic, with probably some quintessential twists in the plot). But no...the spark of brilliance was missing. It could have kick-started this movie into fifth gear...I kept waiting for it. There were some scenes in the middle which posed supposedly life altering questions - what would you do if you knew you were about to die? But the screenplay just didn't push me to think or feel the desperation which Harold was experiencing. Maybe Mr.Helm should have decided before starting the movie whether he wanted fiction, a comedy or serious drama. Guess we'll never know. Overall, its better than a lot of worthless cinema out there. I really think Jim Carrey would have been a better choice than Will Ferrell to play Harold's character...and yes, I mean comedy!"

","This one is certainly on my top 10. I was pleasantly surprised to come across such a creative story line. I had no idea what the movie was about beforehand, and I advise you see it the same way since in my opinion it is such a subjective movie. There is a huge amount of symbolism and often in a mocking sense. The cupcakes, the guitar, the IRS office. My favorite part of course is the Monkeys song.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed a successful narration and the narration in this movie is absolutely brilliant. It makes you want to learn more about Harold, and I can't imagine anyone failing to feel for the main character.<br/><br/>So the story is a story of what at first feels like a typical overachiever. As the movie goes on however Harold's desperation and a lack of direction is portrayed in bits. That in itself is incredibly familiar to all our struggles to make something of ourselves in this life. There is an incredible balance between tragedy and comedy. It's not the type of comedy one is used to from Ferrell. Every time you laugh in this movie there is a sense of melancholy. <br/><br/>Some have suggested the movie makes a claim that only happy endings matter. I personally perceived the message as exactly the opposite. What's important is the story itself and it totally triumphs the ending.<br/><br/>I have to note that Maggie Gyllenhaal playing Ana Pascal is absolutely brilliant (and adorable too). She is the trigger for the plot and a development Harold would never ever thought would happen to him. Being so out of the ordinary, she is all that Harold needs to appreciate himself. Dustin Hoffman is incredibly funny and I thought he is a great fit for the quirky literature professor.<br/><br/>What makes this movie however is the story itself. This movie will make you think, think about challenging moral questions. This movie will make you laugh. This movie may make you cry. And most importantly, this movie will stick with you and i assure you, everyone can take something valuable out of it."

Stranger than fiction is a creative idea treated with a good amount of craft from the filmmakers. The performances are also well-done especially Thompson and Ferell in the unique serious role. Yet the film loses its appeal when it starts telling us how to think about the negative aspects of storytelling. It begins to tell us bad endings are for the birds and that good endings are the only endings that count. If you agree with the message and do not have any tolerance for negativity, than you will be flattered by it. Yet many artistic types will be turned off by its insistence for happy stories."

","After making some fine movie like 'Monster's Ball', 'Finding Neverland' and 'Stay', director Marc Forster makes the splendid 'Stranger Than Fiction'. Zach Helm's innovative screenplay makes this a unique movie. It's difficult to categorize this film even though the consensus seems to root for existential comedy. The dry humour works delightfully. Even though the film does address some grim themes, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is a comedy at heart.<br/><br/>I liked how the story involves 'two worlds' (the writer's point of view and the character's point of view) and at the same time, they're one and the same. Forster designs the film with subtlety, whether it's with the score, the sets, the art direction, the lights or the cinematography. The Will Ferrell - Maggie Gyllenhaal romance is beautifully toned down.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell handles subtle comedy effortlessly. He's definitely a versatile actor where comedy is concerned and even in the more intense sequences he is terrific. An outstanding Emma Thompson fits her part like the right-sized glove. She just makes it look like a piece of cake. Ditto for Maggie Gyllenhaal who is superb as Ana. Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman provide excellent support especially with their remarkable comic timing. Linda Hunt, Kristin Chenoweth and Tony Hale shine in their brief screen time.<br/><br/>'Stranger Than Fiction' may have a predictable (somewhat Hollywood ending) but at the same time it's well done and symbolic rather than just formulaic.<br/><br/>With a unique story, a wonderful cast and brilliant direction, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is not to be missed."

""stranger than Fiction"" had an interesting plot that contained lots of twists that all come together at the end and kept me watching. It is centered around a New York city auditor, Harlod Crick, who begins to think that he is insane when he starts to hear a female voice in his head that is narrating everything that he does in his life. It turns out that it is an author's voice as she writes her novel. The problem is that in order for her book to be as phenomenal as it can, Harold has to die.

","Stranger than Fiction is labelled a comedy but is really more a drama. Though there were some parts that may be considered comedic. I can't really say I was disappointed with this movie, but it wasn't what I had expected. The plot was pretty fun and seemed original; the thought of a woman's voice following a man around had always amused me. But the problem is I don't think the movie lived up to its name. Although this movie is described as a comedy, I didn't laugh once the whole film, it was a bit more of a love story and drama, which disappointed me. And many parts seemed to drag on a little, and they felt boring at times. The ending of the film was pretty good though predictable. It was obvious that Harold wouldn't die and that Karen Eiffel felt some sympathy towards him after meeting him in person. It was also kind of odd that she was able to meet him. I first though that she was living in another fantasy world which Harold and Karen never meet. From the meeting with one another the film seemed quite predictable that he wouldn't die. Because of the fact that the movie had a good plot and the acting was great, it could've been a lot better. Though maybe it just wasn't my type of film. ==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (03/30/17'), this film is more understood than on my initial first watching. The acting by Will Ferrell is very solid as he takes quite a different dramatic take here. The supporting characters of Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Dustin Hoffman do their part in helping carrying the film along. The film is quite more dramatic than comedic and unique in its own right, though can feel quite slow and predictable at times."

To be honest when I first heard about the film s plot I was amazed by it, but I was even more amazed when i heard that Will Ferrell is starring in it, so I said to myself ""Will Ferrell in a drama!!!!! Dude I got to watch it."" In the beginning I was a bit sceptical about the film, but when I started to watch it, it held me from the beginning to the end,not just only the well developed and well executed plot, and surprisingly immaculate acting by Will Ferrell, but what impressed me the most was the amazing portrait of an everyday average guy who is a lone wolf but due to certain events he find his peace and meaning in his life.

She didn't know how Harold Crick's life was going to end.<br/><br/>Once Harold figured that his whole life is being narrated he decided to go out of normal day routine. He stopped wearing a tie everyday to go to work, he didn't brush his teeth 36 times, and he walked to the bus instead of jogging. He also fell in love with Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) that he first was going to audit, but then he feel in love with her. Ms. Pascal owned a bakery that she would work at most of her life. When Harold got used to his new life, with this girlfriend, and not going to work all the time, and just living a normal life; then he found out that Ms. Eiffel was going to end his life.<br/><br/>Ms. Eiffel finally came up with the ending to her book, and that's when Harold Crick got the signal from Ms. Eiffel's voice that he had to find away to stay alive. Harold found away to contact to Ms. Eiffel and he actually got to talk to her face to face and he told her that he is real, and since he read the first draft of her book, Harold didn't want to spoil Ms. Eiffel success, he told Ms. Eiffel to continue the book and to go ahead and kill him. If she didn't her story wouldn't be popular, because in all of Ms. Eiffel's books someone dies. She started finishing the ending and Harold was at the bus stop waiting to go to work, until a boy road his bicycle in front of the bus and Harold pushed him out of the way and got hit by the bus. Ms. Eiffel's last sentence was that ""Harold Crick was d"".<br/><br/>Turns out that Harold Crick survived the crash all because of his watch. Parts of his watch went through his skin and help keep blood from rupturing. Which also means Ms. Eiffel's story didn't go the way it was planned but her book was still a big hit. Harold on the other hand will always have a piece of his watch with him in his body and now he'll know how he lived."

","Imagine your life being narrated to you. Your every thought and action narrated out to you and you have no idea who is telling this or how they even know. So what happens when the voice tells you that you are going to die and you have no idea how or when. Now what do you do?<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end with simple twists and hilarious extras that make it a movie worth watching. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is just a normal man until this unfamiliar voice begins to narrate his every thought and move. What Harold doesn't know is that writer Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is trying to finish her new novel and Harold is the leading character. Harold goes nuts trying to figure out where this voice is coming from and why it is narrating his life. Along the way, he audits and falls in love with the baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and meets Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to figure out what kind of story Harold is in. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is one of a kind. The normally over the top Will Ferrell is perfect for this role. His crazy and spunky personality on the set proves a good fit for the character of Harold Crick. The gorgeous Emma Thompson portrays an amazing and crazy writer in the midst of a writers block and Maggie Gyllenhaal could not have been a better suit for the sarcastic and fun loving baker. The structure of the story is not something that you see every day in Hollywood and is very original and creative. Not often will you find a mans life being told by an unfamiliar voice of a writer trying to finish her story or an IRS worker falling in love with the girl he audits. This creative ideas give this movie an edge that many others never find.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction receives a four out of five stars. It has the concepts of both a humor and love story mixed in with even a little tragedy. There is something in this movie for every member of the family to enjoy and I can guarantee that everyone will."
"Diego_rjc","8","1","2","24 January 2010"," A pleasant surprise.
","'Stranger than Fiction' was on Cable TV last night and, by having nothing better to do, I decided to watch it, but I wasn't really expecting much, since the main part here is Will Ferrel's and features Queen Latifah, so I though it was one more lame comedy. But when I saw the rest of cast, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, and the director, I got cheered up a little. Marc Foster had directed 'Finding Neverland', a great picture. And by giving this one a chance, what a pleasant surprise I had.<br/><br/>'Stranger than Fiction' is a original screenplay by USA-born writer Zach Helm. It tells the story of a methodic IRS agent who wakes up in one morning and starts to hear a voice on his head narrating everything he does. At first, he thinks he is crazy, but when he goes get help he finds out that the voice is of a writer who's writing a novel about him, even though he doesn't know her. He is just a character for her. Although the plot seems weirs, and it really is, the script is very well-written and keeps you interested on what's going to happen with those characters. There lots of intelligent dialogs, and the funny parts aren't forced or out-of-place - it's all exactly were it should be. There also a few memorable lines.<br/><br/>The cast here has famous names, featuring also Maggie Gyllenhaal aside from the already quoted names - Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah. And it was really nice to see Will Ferrel different from what he is used to. After this movie, I'm going to see him as a real actor, he just have to choose better projects. Queen Latifah was also a surprise - she was great as the writer's assistant. Maggie Gyllenhaal is lovely as the main character's love interest, and Dustin Hoffman is always great, but the member of the cast that really drew my attention was Emma Thompson. I always particularly liked her, and she is absolutely marvelous on the role of Karen Eiffel, the writer.<br/><br/>Marc Foster's direction isn't bad, with some interesting camera-work and the intelligent use of special effects, one thing really rare on today's movies. And talking about those, they were really great, even for today's standards. The editing is also well-made, so is the cinematography. The soundtrack really fits in - another thing that you don't see much on today's movies.<br/><br/>Overral, this is a little and funny comedy movie that really makes you feel good. An interesting plot, a great casting ensemble and the efficient directing by Marc Foster are worth the ticket. A few flaws and holes on the script don't ruin the pleasant surprise I had watching this.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Lejink","4","1","2","5 January 2009"," Taxing rom-com...
","Tricksy, would-be cutesy rom-com with a ""Truman Show""/""Sliding Doors"" type twist as blue-collar IRS nobody Will Ferrell finds his mundane life manipulated by a mysterious omnipotent ""narrator"" towards an ultimately tragic conclusion (at least for him). Problem for me here is the ""com"" part as my funny bone steadfastly refused to let itself be tickled by on-screen events and with the extra-dimensional plot having, as indicated, been done before to more credible effect elsewhere, I found the movie ultimately an exercise in futility. Ferrell really needs a Jimmy Stewart or even Bill Murray-type languor to carry off his Average-Guy part while Maggie Gylenhaal is equally unconvincing as a tattooed baker, behind with her taxes (seriously!). You don't get any sense that this unlikely duo could ever get attracted to one another except in a kooky Hollywood movie, then throw in Dustin Hoffman in a by-numbers part as Ferrell's shrink, Emma Thomson as the befuddled author/narrator and Queen Latifah as her P.A. so that it's difficult to highlight whose character is the more useless. In addition, quite why the director sees fit to soundtrack early 80's UK new-wave songs from the likes of The Jam, Clash and the great Wreckless Eric (whose little-known classic ""Whole Wide World"" takes centre stage as Ferrell's song to his particular siren), is ultimately as confusing and meaningless as the rest of this slight and unsatisfactory confection. By the end I'm sure I was meant to have a little Capra-type glow and some expansive thoughts on the old free-will versus fate discussion, but honestly, I'd have been more entertained evaluating all this in the dustiest of text-books..."

","Of all the things I hold dear. Stranger Than Fiction may be different from my normal intake of high octane thrillers and intellectual opii, but it is no less glorious than an evening sunset with a voluptuous lover. Breaking from the normal ""romantic comedy/drama"" mold, it uses subtle irony and a huge left-hook plot twist at the end to create what is possibly one of the best films of 2006, truly a stunning accomplishment considering how many other noteworthy films came out around then.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is a pure ""feel good"" film, making anyone who's capable of smiling break into a big, wide grin by the rolling credits, with side-splitting laughs and silly nuances around every corner, and yet it never slips into cheapness or slapstick. There is much more here than a simple comedy. Stranger Than Fiction is intricately layered with dramatic tones and a few rose-tinted romantic scenes, and the whole thing is a boiling cauldron pot of influences, creating a positively shimmering mixture that will never grow old or stagnant, a story that will keep your mind entertained and your heart warmed and softened. And the irony I mentioned? Brilliantly executed, all the way through. It is a story within a story, and even when you already know what's going to happen next, the film will keep you all smiles. How can anyone say no to that glorious ending? Stranger Than Fiction rises above such paltry number ratings, so heed no attention to the perfect score - just check it out now."

","IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and GROUNDHOG DAY have heirs. That's nice. Some concepts are not milked enough (see WHAT WOMEN WANT), some are. This is the case with STRANGER THAN FICTION. The problem, once more, is the ending. Harold Crick should have died. The literary expert played by Dustin Hoffman and Harold Crick himself agreed on that. He should die because that makes the novel a masterpiece. The problem is Hollywood is scared. Scared of losing spectators. Scared of killing a star. So they devised some crappy excuse not to kill Will Ferrell/Harold Crick. Not only the novel is not a masterpiece anymore but this is also true of the film itself. Cowards !

"wricketts","6","1","2","10 March 2008"," Intriguing but coopted by H'wood romanticism
","For me, the big surprise of this film was that Will Ferrell was actually watchable, exhibiting very little of the ""Ick"" factor that he usually exudes as one of the most unattractive and pathetically unfunny performers in cinema and television. I'd be delighted if his role in this film convinced him that comedy has been a big, big error in his life. Emma Thompson was fantastic; Hoffman more or less lent the film one of his second-hand performances that he wasn't using anymore and was just cluttering up one of the closets at home. The premise is extremely intriguing, but didn't end up in the most intellectually stimulating place, devolving instead, in the film's last 15 minutes, into a sort of sappy, predictable Hollywood romance. ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** There's a sort of logical hole in the premise (if Karen Eiffel ""knows"" everything, because she's writing it, she knows that Crick is going to phone and visit her, she knows that Prof. Hilbert knows who she is because she's ""written"" the scenes in which Crick talks to Hilbert, etc.), but the interesting part of the plot SHOULD have been  and here is where the comment on the way literature ""enters"" into our lives and we ""enter"" into literature could have been truly incisive  is two-fold: (a) not everything in Crick's life, obviously, is ""controlled"" by Eiffel, which only makes sense, otherwise ""reality"" becomes a hall of mirrors (Eiffel is writing Eiffel writing Crick); and (b) the difference between fictional characters and ""real"" life is that characters in novels and stories can never do anything differently but ""real"" people can. The film kind of mudges over this philosophical point in order to ""save"" Crick."

"luke-346","8","1","2","6 December 2007"," Fun, quirky, clever!
","This is a fun, quirky, clever little film and it's an off-the-wall character study that'll let you appreciate cinema that tiny bit more and will almost certainly go down as a cult favourite among selective film fans. Directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland) and written by Zach Helm (currently making his Writer/Director debut with Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium) Stranger Than Fiction makes its presence felt from the outset with various cinematic conventions and rules being toyed and played to help create the films own individualistic style. The film tells of a companionless tax man (Will Ferrell) who one day becomes aware of his imminent death via the narrator (Emma Thomson) in his head, he seeks literacy advice from a professor (Dustin Hoffman) who advises him to discover if he's in a comedy or a tragedy to which he does by attempting romance with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), once this is established it then becomes his sole purpose to discover his fate and ultimately contact the narrator to prevent it.<br/><br/>Charlie Kaufman (Writer. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich) was my primary thought at who could have written such a film as it is very Kaufman-like, but unfortunately Stranger Than Fiction does lack some of the more punchier/out there moments experienced in his films. Where Stranger Than Fiction does supersede his work, despite its arguably depressing storyline, is in its ability to remove any feelings of a nihilistic nature and replace them with a warmer, more endearing, optimistic and emotional attachment.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all put in brilliant performances and to be honest these are the sorts of performances I would like to being seeing more of, especially Ferrell as I feel that this film does for Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind did for Jim Carrey. The two films are very similar and, if push came to shove, the latter being more accomplished one, although that shouldn't detract anyone from Stranger Than Fiction as in its own right it is a very good, engaging film."
"kuperlen","9","1","2","5 December 2007"," Urban and Surprising
","Just watched this movie the other night, having a baby made a serious dent on our movie going schedule, but a Blue Ray rental was almost as good! What a wonderful film! Great screenplay and the acting crew. Two actors who got casted in the most unusual ways are Will Ferrell in a role of protagonist, and Queen Latifah playing in supporting but no less important role of the organizer a.k.a. manager for the Emma Thompson's character. Both delivered surprising level of artistry playing the characters that are very much off their usually comic acting tracks.<br/><br/>Another thing worth mentioning is how wonderfully a site is integrated into the movie. One of the main characters in the film is played by the City of Chicago. Although never mentioned by name, the city is always there, be it in the beautiful architectural detail of the 70's brutish concrete, accidental sky-scraping perspective of a street or in the worming around the intersection trolley.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, also, if you watch it on DVD, try peeking into the Extras."

The whole cast in fact are wonderful to watch as they are aided by a brilliant script that keeps you wondering even after you finish watching it and with superb visuals and soundtrack to boot you will laugh,cry and feel satisfied when the end credits arrive. Im glad to see this sort of film being produced in a Hollywood that doesn't want to think."
"mOVIemAN56","7","1","2","24 October 2007"," Ferrell gives his best performance to date in a thoroughly enjoyable comedy/drama
","For the past 10 years Will Ferrell has been strictly known for his off the wall humor and crazy gags. His famous films include: Anchorman, A Night at the Roxbury and Talladega Nights. All of these films show Ferrell is very gifted at comedy but none show him as a man capable of truly acting in a drama. Up until this point there was little hope Ferrell would ever be more than a comedian who appealed to teenage audiences. Stranger Than Fiction changes all of that and brings out on of the finest performances of 2006.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction revolves around Harold Crick, a dull IRS Auditor who is obsessed with counting and has virtually no life beside his job. One day he begins to hear a voice narrating his own life, a voice only Harold can hear. As he struggles to figure out whether he is crazy or not with the help of a literature professor, he begins to audit the attractive baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he begins to fall in love with. The story is different but it works and heres why.<br/><br/>The story is very different but not so different everyone who watches is saying ""wtf?"" The story is fresh. It strains away from the typical romantic comedies/comedy-dramas and makes its own little story afresh. The story also gives very in depth presentations of the characters. We begin to feel as if we actually no the characters, not just watching them. It is also a well executed story, there isn't too much to understand or any double meanings to everything, the film is straight forward with just a few questions arising every now and again which are suppose to be there to keep us guessing until the end.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Not because it is a drama and usually drama actors have to work harder then comedy actors, no, thats not the case here. Ferrell actually does give his best performance mainly because he isn't constantly screaming and saying obnoxious things. It is the first look into a more sophisticated Will Ferrell, though I don't mind having him in comedy films at all. Ferrell is able to portray the dull Harold Crick perfectly. He feels as if he has been doing the same thing all of his life. He never strays away from the personality he presents and that was the reason the film works so well, Ferrell is constantly in character, on screen.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is not one of my personal favorites for films. I usually find her dull and trying to hard in her roles when I see her in a movie but maybe thats just me. I did liked her in this though. She seemed to be what was needed to make the film move along. I do feel that the relationship that develops between Harold and Ana is a bit far-fetched but nevertheless it still feels sweet as we watch the two interact. Overall Gyllenhaal's job is a job well done in Stranger Than Fiction.<br/><br/>The film will make you laugh, it will make you feel good inside but it will also make you sad. Ferrell is able to put just the right amount of emotion into each scene to make them work and is the glue that holds the movie together. I don't think the movie would have been as good if Farrell had not been in it. I don't think teens will find this as enjoyable as I did. It doesn't have the sick humor and loads of nudity that seems to draw teens to most comedies these days. I think couples and anyone looking for a well acted, well written film would find this film to be a great piece to spend two hours watching.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars"
"Elswet","8","1","2","25 September 2007"," At Last! Will Farrell Has Found His Niche!
","Will Farrell is a talented actor, in my opinion. After a decade of meaningless, inane, and even stupid roles, he has finally found a proper vehicle by which to showcase his talents ... Stranger than Fiction is a beautifully blended, well-adapted chronicle of the life of a hapless victim-cum-quintessential hero.<br/><br/>It has often been said that we all (humans) carry within us the traits to be a hero in times of darkness, via the character Harold Crick, this is demonstrated with a great style and panache. The plot is wonderful and the narration by Emma Thompson is inspired. This will touch your heart without leading you down the smarmy path of melancholy.<br/><br/>It seems Mr. Farrell has gone the way of Steve Martin in that this time he chose the role of the ""straight man"" (to use comedic vernacular) in a rather intelligent romantic comedy, and to let the story carry the comedy rather than his antics, pratfalls, and the like.<br/><br/>While this is not your typical Will Farrell comedy, I sincerely (and without hesitation) hope to see him in more roles such as this one. He came off as thoughtful, intelligent, and sincere in his performance. I always knew Will had talent. I'm just glad the rest of the world got to see it...finally.<br/><br/>All in all?

","I need to tell something, it's kind of a confession. Last week I was looking at my IMDb film history and as I realized that 7 out of ten movies that I been watching were from the US, I decided i would't rent any more American movies from a month. Thank god I didn't keep my promise!. This movie is fantastic in many levels. The scrip is a filled with black humor, drama, romance, full-colored characters. It's an impossible story, and yet it seems as it could happen. The people in it is very real. You get to love this characters, you want them to live a good life. It tells such a complete story that you feel as if you've read the book that's been being written in front of us. What can I say about the actors? Will Ferrel is the main reason why I watched this movie. I was sure he would suck. I'm an idiot. He gave so many interesting things to Harold Crick. he is a totally believable shy guy, not the stupid person that movies usually show us as a shy guy. He lives a boring life, yet he is not boring, he is funny, and sweet and real. Emma Thompson is one of the greater living actress in the world. And I thing this is one of her best works. She is living her book, suffering, trying to kill smartly, and that seems hard. Dustin Hoffman also seems to be Tailor made to play the professor. The scrip provides some of the more real and profound characters I didn't like the previous Marc Foster movie, but hats off, he can tell a bittersweet story in a subtle way, using some original techniques, but all in favor of the story, and not to show the viewer that he is a great director. He prove me wrong, let's hope he keeps the good work American cinema has seen in a long time, and probe me that i have to continue criticizing USA cinema, so that once in a while I get to see one of this gems."

","""Stranger than fiction"" is (To put it simply) a great film.<br/><br/>And now, the reasons behind my statement. First off I believe this to be Will Ferrell's best piece of acting yet, for a man who usually play's over the top and in some cases embarrassing characters, this was defiantly a good turning point for him as an actor and has helped this particular person to appreciate his talent now that I know that he's not always going to be characters like Ron Burgundy (Anchorman) or Jack Wyatt (Bewitched).<br/><br/>I think that ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a film that you should watch with a group of friends or your family since it has some great elements and subtle of both humour and tragedy. As it has plenty of imagery to discuss, and the standard ""Aww"" moments you get from time to time. It also has moments which don't have much meaning when you first watch it but when you think back are actually there to give the story as little ironic quirk such as Harold watching the ""meaning of live"" in the Cinema and the part when Harold Crick is running down the street with an apple in his mouth (reference to ""Son of Man"" by Rene Magritte) and the picture is concluded when he is talking to the doctor at the office and he is sat in front of cloud pattern wallpaper.<br/><br/>As I said before I enjoyed this film a lot and I would recommend it to most people for the structure of and story it and I would recommend it to the rest of the people as a good family and friends film."

I'm a number person myself, and though I would never count things like the number of steps I took to the bus stop, I know the type. The Gyllenhaal character, Ana Pascal, is also familiar, and someone I like spending time with. Even the tax aspects of this story, hardly a focus, make sense.<br/><br/>No, if this doesn't become an instant classic, it won't be for lack of quality on almost every dimension.

This is one of the most surprising movies I've watched in a loooong time. First of all, I wouldn't expect Will Ferrel to be the protagonist of such a fine thing - and I usually think that too many good actors in just one movie (Dustin Hoffman + Emma Thompson + Maggie Gyllenhaal) doesn't really mean a positive thing (could be the sign of weak story, that is). But I just watched it, it's like 8.55 in the morning and I'm actually still listening to the song that plays while the final credits scroll by. It's the very first movie I comment here and I don't feel like getting into the details of the story - that's what the plot outline is there for. Just tell you this: if you feel like watching a movie and having the (strangest) feeling of having just watched a thing well-done, from start to finish, with actors that seemed to be born for their characters, great great soundtrack, and a magnificent, delicious story, then go for this one.

His average appearance makes him perfect for the hero of the story, and it's absolutely brilliant that we've not yet again been forced to watch two absolutely physically perfect human beings couple, but instead see two average people, far more flawless in spirit than simply and only looks, create a strange, yet very romantic and tragicomic bond.<br/><br/>The movie will make you laugh, it will make you think, and in some extreme cases, it might make you weep. The only ""thumbs down"" thing in the whole story is the fact that, were the novel mentioned in the story ever published, I am thoroughly convinced it would.. well.. suck. :) As I've said before, this movie is a complete breath of fresh air in the stench that we're being served nowadays, and I strongly encourage everyone to see it. You'll feel happy after you do, I know I did :) Cheers"

"freedomFrog","Null","1","2","16 July 2007"," Charlie Kaufman lite
","In ""Stranger than fiction"", directed by Marc Foster (""Monsters' ball"", ""Finding neverland""), Harold Crick (a dead serious Will Ferrell, playing against type) is an IRS auditor, living a routine boring life. Everything changes when he starts hearing a voice narrating his life as if he was the main character of a novel. Past the initial shock, this seems to be a good thing as Harold break up with his routine, opening himself to the external world as well as dating a young liberal-minded baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) he has fallen in love with. But then, he realizes the narrator is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a reclusive author who always kills her main character.<br/><br/>Penned by Zach Helm, the script obviously tries to imitate the style of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (""Being John Malkovitch"", ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"") and the whole movie tries actually to ape the subtle mix between comedy, drama, absurdness and attempt at existentialist insight that can be found in a Charlie Kaufman movie. But the premise is a little too much out there: it would OK if ""strangers than fiction"" was a straight comedy but there is too much drama for us to take ""stranger than fiction"" as seriously as it takes itself.<br/><br/>Moreover, even if you buy the premise, the movie ultimately fails. Interestingly, in a strange post-modern twist, the reasons why the movie failed are discussed in the movie itself! Once Karen Eiffel realizes that Harold Crick is not only a character in her latest novel but a real human being, she is faced with a dilemma: either killing Crick and hence writing a masterpiece or letting him live and hence ruining her novel. She chooses the latest option. This is exactly the situation faced by the screenwriter of ""stranger than fiction"": he could have decided to kill Harold Crick, hence maybe not transforming the movie into a masterpiece but at least making it more satisfying that the current version with its saccharine Hollywood happy ending where Crick lives to get the girl.<br/><br/>In those sequences where Eiffel hesitates between the two possible ending for her book, it is if the screenwriter was telling us""Hey, I know the story is better if I kill Crick. But hey, this is Hollywood, this is a business: there is no way this movie can make any profit with a sad ending so I had to go the other way."""

Odd. My fears were realised when I asked if they were closing up. The store is staying but new owners are coming in. I look forward to meeting them tonight when I drop off last night's entertainment.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" is one of those smart comedies that keeps you thinking and trying to work out the plot. The starting point is Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS agent who becomes nervy when it seems someone is narrating his every move. He starts to try to discover what's going on and unlocks some interesting clues with the help off a literary genius (Hoffman, in an excellent role, which almost makes me forgive him for ""Meet The Fockers""). Eventually he works out what's going on and is faced with a big decision.<br/><br/>The movie is different and threw up some challenging thoughts at the end.

"dragonshield","8","1","2","9 May 2007"," An original story, being funny and dramatic at the same time, a celebration of Will Ferrell indeed
","I had seen this movie before, but as it was so good at the first time, I decided to watch it another time to see if it's still that good. Oh yes, it was. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" tells about an IRS agent Harold Crick, whose life is pretty much dependent on his wristwatch. He's precise in everything, from brushing his teeth to his coffee breaks at work, every day is the same and Harold's whole life is repetitive. All of a sudden, he starts to hear a narration of a story in his head, telling about Harold's life, being right in everything he does. Obviously the narration starts to affect his life as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very well written, it's very unique and original, like no other I've seen before. It's so sweet in a way that it just makes you smile. The whole story telling is just marvellous, progressing with comedy and drama mixed up together, it makes you laugh and it makes you sad, so this is not just a comedy. For me, it's more like a drama and though it is actually, quoting the movie title, stranger than fiction it is after all some way so believable, although you know it can't be true. That's why the screenplay's so fantastic, making something fictional to seem like something like it could actually happen. The directing makes the screenplay even better, by being accurate and precise. It's nothing phenomenal, but still deserves a big plus.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell does his best role performance yet to date, by far. The movie's a perfect example of the fact that Ferrell can do drama as well besides the usual comedy. He's also just so fitting for the role itself, he actually looks like Harold Crick, being the character by his substance. A big applause for Mr. Ferrell indeed, just perfect. What comes to other role performances, well, there couldn't be better actors doing them. Dustin Hoffman plays a professor named Jules Hilbert and he's just so incredibly funny in the role as well, being that enjoyable himself he always is. Emma Thompson is the narrator and the author, doing it perfectly. A little bit different role from Thompson which also makes it rather surreal, but oh well, she's one of those actresses who can actually perform any role. Great. Despite the excellent performances of Hoffman and Thompson, the one who takes the cake is Ferrell. We've seen comedians doing dramas in the past and to just name a few excellent ones there's Jim Carrey with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", there's Steve Carrell with ""Little Miss Sunshine and there's Robin Williams who has done it a million times, yet perfectly every time. Will Ferrell belongs to that group of comedians now and he is more than warmly welcome.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a great movie. It's very enjoyable, it's funny and it's surprisingly dramatic, including an excellent scene which actually made me shed a tear. That's what is so surprising in it being so dramatic, there's the hilarious Will Ferrell, who can obviously break hearts as well. This just makes me waiting more of dramatic roles from Ferrell, as he just was so good in this movie. Hopefully he'll be doing more drama, as when it comes to comedy that's guaranteed from Ferrell. Anyways, the movie's great, no matter what your aspect is. Just watch it and most certainly enjoy it. It puts a smile on your face."

The on-screen chemistry between Harold and law-school-drop-out-turned-baker Ana (brilliantly played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) is fun and believable.<br/><br/>Queen Latifah proves once again her uncanny ability to steal scenes like a leading actress while supporting the hell out of Emma Thompson's frustrated, mentally drained Karen Eiffel.<br/><br/>The weak link in the cast, since there has to be one, is Dustin Hoffman. His Dr. Hilbert, who you immediately forget when he's not right in front of you, did not pull off ""deep"" or ""esoteric"" and was just generally annoying.<br/><br/>My favorite moment from the movie was easily when Harold arrives at ""The Uprising"" at closing time to bear his heart (or at least his libido) to Ana. And what does he bring her? Flours. It doesn't get much more perfect than that.<br/><br/>All in all it was clever, fun, and kept me guessing until the last frame which is always a plus. Sure there were lines and scenes that could have been better, leaving my husband to make the astute statement that the film would have been flawless had it been written by Charlie Kaufman, but it was a lovely little movie and it certainly made my weekend.<br/><br/>:)"

","This movie was excellent. It had a little bit of everything. Something for everyone. It was a lighthearted comedy, a romance, a touch of real drama, suspense, and it even contained some clever efx that seriously enriched the shots where they were used.<br/><br/>The most remarkable thing to me about this film was Will Farrell! He was superbly understated. His comedy was not what you're used to from him. His entire performance was played skillfully close to the chest. His expressions and movements and inflections were atypical for a Farrell role. For this fact alone I was delighted with the movie. I love a good SNL skit as much as the next person, but a feature-length film of his typical comic affectations wear thin for me. His acting, actual ACTING, in this movie deserves recognition and I would love to see him receive some awards nominations for this role.<br/><br/>All the other roles (save perhaps that of Queen Latifa) were also expertly executed. I felt that Latifa's role as the assistant for Thompson's author-with-writer's block did add something to the mix, but I didn't feel her acting was as high caliber as the other characters.<br/><br/>I hope you will take the time to watch this movie. It was really wonderful. My husband and I both found ourselves deeply moved by the story. These days we don't often come away from a film saying repeatedly, ""that was a good movie!"" THIS is a GOOD MOVIE.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie a 9/10 for one reason only: there was a significant period of time during the film where the narration that was driving the plot of the story stopped and it was missed."

It's superb.<br/><br/>Stanger then fiction reminded me of another favorite of mine, ""The Truman Show"". This movie though, while being quite serious at times, is not nearly as dark. The storyline works for many reasons. The cast are all great. I've only seen a few of Maggie Gylenhall's movies but it's difficult to think of her being better then she is here. She is absolutely wonderful as the feisty Anna and Emma Thompson is riveting as the author/narrator.<br/><br/>One thing that really makes Stranger Then Fiction so good is that this movie has the ability to combine comedy with some very serious moments and it does both with excellence. The special effects must be mentioned because they are great and very creative. The story itself, while being refreshingly different is also thought provoking and very poignant. The pace of the whole movie is good as well.<br/><br/>The character development is also excellent as these characters are developed slowly and precisely and we, the viewer, get to witness transformations in nearly everyone. One gets really invested in the outcome as well, and out of the quirkiness and imaginative element, combined with the sprinklings of surprisingly effective comedy, and the delicate poignancy of the story, comes a movie that's a pure joy to watch.<br/><br/>Stranger Then Fiction is a movie that deserves to be an instant classic and is so much more then a movie about a guy who finds he's a character in a book. It's about life, love, and letting go. I've racked my brain but can't think of much of anything negative about it at all. I'd strongly recommend it. It's always good to see a movie that both entertains and has such a large amount of emotional depth. 9.5 out of 10."
"ilikepuppies","5","1","2","15 April 2007"," Bunk Rock.
","Will Ferrell's comedic stance is centered around exposing all the uncomfortable little flaws inherent in existing as a human being. All those embarrassing characteristics we all would rather not mention about ourselves are trotted out one after another. That said, a comedic noir seems a perfect fit for him, since noir usually features a helpless main character being toyed with by a higher power of some sort.<br/><br/>So far so good.<br/><br/>The task these film-makers set out to achieve was to take the noir form and extend the narrative in a new direction. One in which our hapless victim actually takes control half-ways through, becoming the God who is doing the capricious toying.<br/><br/>You see, I prefer to believe that it is actually Harold who is the author of this tale, writing about an author who is writing about him (who at one point is writing about her writing about him writing about her!). With help from an actual writing instructor, he is even depicted explicitly writing the very narration that he himself hears. Indeed it is Harold in control of the film at the end, and it is he who changes the outcome.<br/><br/>It's a clever experiment with writing itself and is in fact a movie about its own screenplay. This idea of art about itself is really becoming a part of the very fabric of our culture. It's tricky business, but as demonstrated here, film-makers are finding ways to solve the various problems associated with bringing these notions to the everyday film-goer.<br/><br/>But. What spoils this for me was the purposeless use of music. There seems to be a growing trend in which film-makers selfishly indulge in choosing songs based simply on their own personal tastes in music, regardless of relevance to the film. (Tarantino comes to mind.) This desire to refer to one's own record collection is quite an annoyance, and basically states, ""Look how great is my taste in music!"" Simply put, punk rock (and specifically British punk rock) has no place here. Consider that the song Harold sings to his love interest is one that that particular character would never know at all, much less by heart. It is an esoteric genre piece which typically attracts an opposite personality type to that of Harold, an ultra-square IRS number-head."
"evanston_dad","7","1","2","7 April 2007"," A Creative and New Examination of Old Questions
","Harold Crick lives a boring life of dull routine and never seems to entertain the notion that any other kind of life is a possibility. He quietly gets up every morning, catches the same bus to work, spends his day auditing people who hate him (he's an IRS agent), comes home, goes to bed and repeats everything the next day. His life is carefully synchronized by his trusty wristwatch, possibly and sadly Harold's best friend. His daily comings and goings are narrated to us by the pleasant, British accented voice of God, or at least of Emma Thompson. But one day, a seemingly ordinary Wednesday, Harold begins to hear the same narration that we hear, including a passing mention of his impending death. Harold's the main character in a novel, you see, and Emma Thompson is not an omniscient god, but rather the author of the novel. Though, as the movie hints, perhaps they're the same thing.<br/><br/>I went into ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with significant reservations. The movie belongs to the same genre as films like ""Adaptation,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Truman Show,"" metaphysical musings on subjects like free will, the act of creation and such, all films which I found to be a bit too clever for their own good and which ultimately could not deliver on the promise of their imaginative concepts. But ""Stranger Than Fiction"" handles its topic quite well, and it's a very good movie. Once Harold realizes that his creator intends for him to die, he sets out to change the course of events of his life, not sure whether or not such a thing is even possible. He's helped by the fact that he's found something worth living for, that something being a feisty baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who brings a tremendous amount to the film through her nimble performance and engaging screen presence, and he enlists the help of a university literature professor cum therapist played by Dustin Hoffman, who helps Harold unravel the mystery of who's writing the book about him. Meanwhile, Thompson enters into a crisis of her own. She can't figure out how to kill off Harold Crick, and just as she comes up with a perfect and poetic way for him to die, she discovers that Harold knows who she is and that she's in control, and suddenly the act of killing him off becomes infinitely complicated by the fact that a real human life is in her hands.<br/><br/>There's much about this film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you think about it for too long. For example, if Harold is a fictional character living in a fictional universe created by an author, then why isn't everyone else he interacts with fictional too? Also, the death Thompson devises for Harold isn't that original, so one wonders why exactly she had so much trouble coming up with it in the first place. But the questions about the moral responsibility of creators for their creations, and the reverse questions about the freedom of creations to determine their own fate, though not exactly new, are at least given a fresh coating of paint here, and the slick direction by Marc Forster helps the film and its ideas go down easily. It's not as intellectually ambitious as movies like ""Adaptation"" or ""Being John Malkovich,"" but in spite of that, or maybe because of it, I enjoyed this film more.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

Harold, however, finds trouble when he hears that Karen plans to kill him.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. Will Ferrell is the most surprising, and proves that he can act in something other than a comedy, as Harold Crick. Maggie Gyllenhaal played Harold's love interest, Ana Pascal. Emma Thompson was the narrator named Karen Eiffel. Queen Latifah, who this reviewer is not a fan of, played Karen's assistant named Penny Escher.

Director Marc Forster's ""Stay,"" a more experimental albeit heavy-handed exploration of similar themes, which perhaps, if nothing else, indicated Forster's own personal obsessions.<br/><br/>""Stranger than Fiction"" is about a nondescript IRS man, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell struggling in a dramatic role) who begins to hear the voice of a narrator in his head. He soon realises, as do we, that the voice belongs to an author, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson, makeup-less), in the process of finishing her new book which is actually Crick's life. The film follows Crick's attempts to foil ""his imminent death"" as he joins up with Dustin Hoffman's literature professor. In between Harold Crick finds the time to fall in love with Maggie Gyllenhaal's dizzyingly charming Ana, a baker who decided to quit her law education in Harvard to ""make this world a better place (by baking cookies).""<br/><br/>The union between Ferrell and Gyllenhaal's characters is a bit unbelievable. Gyllenhaal is very sexy and intelligent (the perfect woman?) while Ferrell's Crick is an obnoxious, disenchanted cubicle nerd. But, I guess, it was meant to be, as the author of the book (and Crick's life) willed it. And herein lies this film's problem: although the juxtaposition of literary clichés with real life is witty, ""Stranger than Fiction"" ultimately becomes the victim of its own shrewd veneer: it wants to be both a tragedy and a comedy; a metaphysical fable of simple and powerful truisms. Unwilling to compromise between whimsy and gut-wrenching factualism, ""Stranger than Fiction"" fails at being either.<br/><br/>I illustrate this point, I want to talk about a key scene in the film, but it includes spoilers. Consider yourself warned. The ending has a face-to-face discussion between Dustin Hoffman professor and Emma Thompson's narrator/author. Apparently, she has decided to change the ending; you know, not kill Harold Crick in her story. Being the consummate artiste, disappointed, the professor asks her why.<br/><br/>Author: ""Lots of reasonsbecause I realised I just couldn't do it."" Professor: ""Because he's real?"" Author: ""Because it (the book) is about a man who doesn't know he's about to die, and dies. But if a man does know that he's about to die, and he dies willingly, knowing that he could stop itisn't that the type of man you'd like to keep alive?""<br/><br/>Hoffman's professor notes that by changing the ending  by saving Harold Crick  Karen Eiffel's book will not achieve the greatness it would have otherwise. He tells her that her book will be ""just OK."" To which she responds: ""You know, I think I'm fine with OK.""<br/><br/>We must accept ""Stranger than Fiction"" as OK too."

","I started watching the movie thinking it was about to be a nice, entertaining movie, but I was wrong. 'Stranger Than Fiction' is a masterpiece. While watching the movie, the movie turned out to be very interesting, unique and sometimes even funny. The idea of a character coming to life may not be very original, but the implementation is far beyond great. Most movies(or books, plays etc.), which have such unreal themes, are left with large holes of logical absences, whilst this movie pushes you to forget about the stupid little things and experience exalted pleasure. Perfect.<br/><br/>WARNING: Spoiler Ahead!<br/><br/>I was enjoying the film very much, and then, at the scene in which Harold get hit by the bus, precisely the second it happened, I started crying. And I thought, 'This movie is so perfect: It granted me enjoyment, a bit of laughter, and without letting me notice, made me love the character and be bound to it. Then, although it was definitely expected, made me feel great sorrow about Harold which I was led to love so much.' I think it is a very notable information to say that I never cry in movies."

","Normally, my renting of Will Ferrell DVDs is reduced to one mood: stupid comedy. I assume, now I know wrongly, that Ferrell is pretty much a one-note performer, and most of his movies while occasionally extremely funny are also pretty ordinary.<br/><br/>I was pleased to be wrong with Stranger Than Fiction. Actually, I saw hints of it in Bewitched--somehow, with a good haircut and some designer clothes, they managed to make him (dare I say it?) almost sexy and a leading man. But StF really opened up a different side of Ferrell. In addition to the comedy of the situation, Ferrell brings life and depth to Harold Crick. If anyone ever told me that I'd cry seeing Will Ferrell cry, I'd have thought they were nuts.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of unusual narratives, and I particularly love anything ""bookish,"" or literary, whatever that means. And much of what directs me to movies is my fascination with narrative, which Stranger than Fiction delivers with grace, warmth, and spirit.<br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction is the story of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an ordinary man leading a very lonely life. He's an IRS agent, and fills his days with numbers and order. When he meets a baker, played by the always-adorable Maggie Gyllenhaal, things start to look better for him. But there's a problem: he thinks he's going crazy, because he's hearing a voice, narrating his every move. ""Accurately. And with a better vocabulary,"" he notes to a psychiatrist. As it turns out, he is the main character in a novel by Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a British writer who writes beautiful tragedies, but has run into writer's block.<br/><br/>It's a fine, brainy, sweet piece for any actor, but what surprised me is that Ferrell actually CAN act. Who knew? What makes the movie so likable is the relationships between its central characters, particularly Ferrell with Dustin Hoffmann (a literary professor trying to solve the mystery of who's writing Harold's life), the artsy-cynical Thompson with Queen Latifah (an assistant hired to help the author make her deadline), and Ferrell's scenes with his newfound love, Ana. One heart-melting moment was Ferrell's serenade, after having learned just one song. I also enjoyed Hoffman's witty, understated performance, particularly the scene where he breaks the bad news: for the book to be a success, Harold will have to die. Rounding out the stellar cast are some funny cameos from Kristin Chenoweth as a BookTV interviewer (check the DVD extras), and Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce as a pair of befuddled psychiatrists.<br/><br/>On the down side, I found myself comparing the writing to Charlie Kaufman, which is inevitable. Unfortunately, StF is not quite up to the standards set by either Adaptation or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. As long as you try to forget you ever saw a Kaufman film, Stranger than Fiction sets a high standard--hopefully, we'll get to see more of this Will Ferrell in the midst of the Anchormans and Talladega Nights."

I can only highly recommend this film to anyone and suggest purchasing it to let the makers of this masterpiece know how you feel. The subtle mixture of narration and action are masterfully intertwined in a love story for the modern generation.

","Without being able to nail down precisely why, this movie is just wonderful. It's original and quirky without being too off the wall. It's funny in a dry and clever way (not at all what I expected from Will Ferrell), but also dramatic and romantic. The main characters are all so well cast the actors fit perfectly and work together naturally. Even visually it's ""just right"". As a reader I enjoyed the completely non-specific references to literature that still hit the mark (probably a different mark for every viewer.) It reminds me very strongly of The Shawshank Redemption, not in any specific way, but how both movies just leave you feeling good, glad that you got to see them, appreciative of the work that you never consciously noticed because you were lost in the film. Because of that no one part stood out to generate rave reviews and buzz and all that, which is too bad, but I think, like The Shawshank Redemption, this movie will just stay quietly popular for nearly everyone for years to come."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","28 February 2007"," Harold Crick isn't crazy, he's just written that way
","Emma Thompson's impeccable, blunt narration treads inventively on the poetic excellence of the writing behind ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a Kaufmanesque attempt by Zach Helm. Here is a story about IRS agent Harold Crick, a calculating, lonely man whose favourite word is ""integer"", who for years has led a sedate and ordered life. One day his wristwatch tires of his existence and Harold begins to hear a woman narrating his life, disrupting the mathematical symmetry of the film which propels the film.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" plays along a unique, inventive concept about the fickleness of identity as the author struggles to kill Harold Crick at the end of her novel with all of the morbid obsessions that this task entails. It is fact and fiction merging in a rotating scale of existential questions embedded in tragicomic dilemmas. It truly is a funny film masking as a comedy, but which becomes unexpectedly poignant toward the end, without dwelling too much on its poignancy like most Hollywood films fall prey to.<br/><br/>That is not to say it is an infallible film. Will Ferrell is unmistakably numb, almost as if he is actively struggling to curb his eccentric mannerisms and loud voice. Judging by the plethora of different situational comedy the film hedges around its protagonist, it becomes clear that it expects us to find his mere reactions side-splittingly funny, which is rather lazy writing and ineffective for non-fans of Ferrell. The humour is mostly in-tune in a classic sit-com kind of way  without the canned laughter  but it occasionally falls flat with a thud to the floor.<br/><br/>The characters' last names are undeniably significant  Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians and scientists who devoted themselves to the innate order of things. To support them are a wide array of charismatic actors such as Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman. Gyllenhaal plays a girl who is a militantly non-conformist, free-thinking tattooed girl around the corner whom Harold is set to audit. At times she feels too much of an obnoxious counterculture ploy to ""set the protagonist free"", but gradually she is given layers in the story. Hoffman is a worthy contribution as ever, playing a professor in literature who helps Harold identify the nature of the novel.<br/><br/>""Stranger than Fiction"" should have been more entertaining, but its clever concept alone gets it a long way. Where characters usually struggle with inner demons in internal conflicts, Harold Crick's external conflict is just as important -- his impending death.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"fwomp","8","1","2","26 February 2007"," A ""Wow!"" Moment For Will Ferrell
","Will Ferrell fans now have a very good reason to stand up and cheer. Myself not being much of a Ferrell champion (although I modestly enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS), I came into STRANGER THAN FICTION wondering if he might try some over-the-top antics or just give another mediocre performance. Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.<br/><br/>What gives Stranger Than Fiction its emotional heft, too, is its clever script and fine performances by Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal (SHERRYBABY), Dustin Hoffman, and even Queen Latifah.<br/><br/>Falling partially into the fantasy category (but only slightly so), the story is of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who one day begins hearing a woman's voice narrating the more mundane portions of his life (""Harold brushed his teeth 32 strokes up and down and 72 side to side""). Initially Harold fears he may be having some sort of mental break. He goes to see a shrink who eventually (and reluctantly) refers him to Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman). Some of the most entertaining dialogue is heard here as Hilbert and Crick try to decide whether the voice is narrating his life as a comedy or a tragedy (or maybe some other genre). When Hilbert asks Crick what he does for a living and if there's anyone that might want to hurt him, Crick replies, ""I'm an IRS agent, everyone hates me."" To which Professor Hilbert responds, ""Well that certainly sounds like a comedy to me."" Eventually, Harold discovers who's voice is in his head. It's a novelist named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), and it appears that Harold is simply a fictional creation of her's that has somehow come to life. Harold races to find Ms. Eiffel before she finishes her novel, strictly because he knows that he plans to kill her (she narrates to him this simple fact, much to Harold's dismay). Once they meet, Ms. Eiffel is somewhat freaked out by the prospect that one of her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).<br/><br/>The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma. Can she change her masterpiece of fiction? Can she not kill Harold and still retain the essence of her work (she's killed off her main protagonist in all her other novels)? Ferrell's soft-spoken tax-man performance was something of a marvel. His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before. Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm. But Will Ferrell's performance cannot be denied. He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances. Now let's just hope that he continues on this upward swing."
"oneloveall","6","1","2","26 February 2007"," Well meaning entertainer caves in on it's devices
","Charming construct takes pride in blurring the lines between tragedy and comedy, reality and fiction, tenderness and edginess to entertaining heights, although the mildly cerebral script reads more like an accessible emulation then bona-fide creation. Tweaking omniscient observational prowess, proved masterful in such existential triumphs as Adaptation and The Truman Show, Stranger Than Fiction manages to pack most of it's brainy sentiment in easy-to-digest, bite sized formats that will compel audiences each step up the twisted narrative. The movie gets points for always maintaining a healthy intelligence that's not too heavy or pretentious for less intellectual-minded moviegoers, but in it's conceptual lightheartedness, most meaningful characterization falls prey to the broad and borrowed ideas.<br/><br/>Acting comes and goes in waves of integrity, everyone did well to be in the moment, but some scenes simply work greater then others. By and large Will Ferrell's engagingly meek performance does not penetrate much of an inner reality, which may or may not have been intentional. Nonetheless, his noticeable but eclipsed performance of a sleepwalking taxman gets by with help from the great support, particularly in Emma Thompson's wickedly fun take on a creatively frustrated writer in search of some morbid inspiration.<br/><br/>After much amusement is had at scribe Zach Helm's involving behest, his unbalanced third act does not manage to ground much of the overly conceptual gamble. This leaves a pointed character experiment with many wonderful, fictionally transcendent moments, some creative special effects, but also an undeniable shallowness beneath the inventive posturing."

","Will Ferrell's career took a turn for the better with this engaging little fantasy film about a very ordinary man with an exact daily regiment who suddenly hears a voice describing his every action as if were being documented by someone. He finds out that his life is the work of a writer (Emma Thompson) and that his final destiny lies within the conclusion of her book until he can figure out a way to stop it. With a superb supporting cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah, 'Stranger than Fiction' is part fantasy, part love story, part detective story and an absorbing metaphor that keeps the debate alive about whether or not people are actually in control of their own lives or whether they are victims of destiny."
"ace_m","7","1","2","24 February 2007"," Excellent, very funny; a living ""still-life""
","This movie was absolutely phenomenal. Very original. It reminded a little of ""Being John Malkovich"" with a bit less randomness. I loved the way this film was shot - lots of straight angles, appropriate close-ups, good lighting. I liked how everything looked very clean and picturesque. All players performed admirably - great casting (although Emma Thompson seems to be playing to her typecasting in this one - but she's great nonetheless). I really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal - she's very cute and her voice is really sexy ... oh yeah, and she played her part very believably and naturally. Also, this was really one of Will Ferrel's best roles. I liked how he was much more subtle and subdued in this pic; He under-played Crick nicely, and his simple, blunt speech was well-delivered. This was a nice change of tone from his other roles and indicates a notable progression in the development of his craft as an actor (reminds me of when Robin Williams and Jim Carey began taking on more serious roles).<br/><br/>My main point: It occurred to me near the end that the whole movie seemed like a living, moving still-life painting. There were many shots that looked like they could have been a painting - a slice of real life. Just as I formed that idea, there was a shot with Will Ferrel's character in his kitchen picking up a green apple from a bowl full of them. This really exemplified what I'm talking about here. <br/><br/>Of course, the film has a good message as well. if somewhat clichéd - to live life fully and with passion and you don't know what you're capable of until you try new things and take on new perspectives with openness and deep consideration. Wouldn't it be funny if we all tried walking around for a day with a notepad tracking how many moments of delight and how many sad moments we had? It certainly would make you re-evaluate the way live and react to the life unfolding around you."

Will Ferrell does very well in a part that's more serious than the roles he usually tackles, and Maggie Gyllenhall and Dustin Hoffman clearly enjoy their roles.<br/><br/>A movie that reflects on all sorts of issues--isn't real life almost always stranger than fiction? Why is it that we expect a story to be a comedy or a tragedy? And why is it that people seem to think they can get out of dying someday, whenever or however it happens.

The kids wanted to see it, so when it came around to the local discount theater, we piled up the car and went. I didn't know who the other members of the cast were and I didn't know it would go deeper than a fluff comedy. The silliness that most often accompanies Will Farrell was understated and quite nicely subtle. Maggie Gyllenhaal is fabulous and the other characters have to suffer with the likes of: Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Queen Latifa (that was written to be decidedly tongue in cheek). All three were solid with Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifa also playing their roles (which could have been camped up and over the top) not in any way those things. Emma Thompson gets to put a bit of a screwball twist on her character. I had absolutely no expectations of this movie and found myself very entertained. Two thoughts occurred to me as I watched-one: ""this is why these actors are great"" and two: ""that was a clever turn of a phrase."" A much smarter film than I thought I'd be seeing."
"jilena008","7","1","2","10 January 2007"," Almost Great
","I loved the premise of this movie and the beautiful acting by Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (could she get any sexier? I'm straight, but she makes me question) and Emma Thompson.<br/><br/>Aside a couple of forgivable skips in logic (ex: the academic ""gobbledy-gook"" that so easily convinces the Professor...'cause of course, he's a professor), I was really entranced by this movie which is perhaps why I was left unsatisfied by it's resolution. I liked the choice of ending in it's dilemma between ""tragedy or comedy"", (plot-wise), but I felt it forgot it's theme, or changed it at the end, which is weird. It seemed Promethean at first (destiny vs. free will) then to one of acceptance and finding the joy in life -- they're different.<br/><br/>You have a character who has spent his entire life sacrificing his individuality to society's expectations and therefore subjugating his will for a higher ""order"". Through this movie, we see Harold Crick take baby steps towards his own authentic individuality. I wanted a scene where this path to his own identity was fought for and ultimately achieved -- even for a moment. I wanted to see a character with no back-bone actually get one and say ""no"" (not just start to). And definitely a Promethean ""Fuck you"" to the Professor's pompous authority (putting Harold's matter-of-life-and-death script under his seat which Harold accepts); the same authority which later tells him he must unequivocally accept the written ending and die for the cause of poetry.<br/><br/>More importantly, I wanted to see a Promethean ""NO"" to the writer that is choosing the ""best"", ""most meaningful"" ending FOR HIM. I can swallow Harold's final acceptance of the writer's destiny for him if there was a fight for his identity first: a fight against being merely a cog in someone else's structure (whether it be the IRS, dentist rules or a writer's book). Harold doesn't like ""ending"" at first, but never fights it and so falls short of fulfilling his character growth throughout the movie. In the end, Kay Eiffel ""the Gods"" grants him amnesty from his fate -- our human never truly rose up and claimed a choice."
"abum190","8","1","2","4 January 2007"," Wonderfully unique
","I was never a huge fan of Will Ferrell's. To me, he's just like Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler in that he hasn't outgrown adolescent status when it comes to his sense of humor. However, seeing him in Wedding Crashers, The Producers, and Talladega Nights recently forced me to appreciate the comedic talent that he's been hiding. And now, with Stranger Than Fiction, Will Ferrell has forced me to acknowledge that he can act. And quite well, too, which was a very pleasant surprise. Luckily, the movie was just as good as he was.<br/><br/>Playing Harold Crick, an IRS agent without a social life who counts his toothbrush strokes each and every morning of his life, Will Ferrell is marvelously understated. Some critics have said he underplays Crick to the point of boredom, but I think he leaves enough of himself to keep us entertained. And even with that, the plot and characters around him are so amusing and intriguing it wouldn't have mattered if Crick were dull.<br/><br/>The story kicks off to a start within the first five minutes as we embark on Crick's daily routine, narrated down to the very last carefully counted step on his way to work by Emma Thompson, a suicidal writer who is authoring her next book about Crick and his humdrum way of living. However, Crick hears her voice dictating his every move and is upset by this- naturally. Especially when he hears Thompson predicting his premature death.<br/><br/>Forster deftly balances Harold's impending doom with his discovery of the joys of life, most importantly in Ana Pascal, a baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (wonderful and fiery), who at first hates Crick and his IRS background but then grows to love him. Through Pascal, Harold learns how to enjoy life outside of his job, which he never enjoyed in the first place. The genius of Stranger Than Fiction is that it manages to take matters of life and death very seriously while at the same time finding much light in simple everyday facets of the world such as cookies or a kiss or a good book. I'm not sure how you combine existentialism and compassion in the same movie, but Forster and Ferrel and Co. pulled it off in a very creative way."

","At first glance, there seems to be some similarity between this movie and Luigi Pirandello's ""Six characters in search of an author"", but the similarity is only superficial in the aspect of character(s) searching for author. While ""six characters"" is a clever form of theatre, STF is an entirely different kettle of fish.<br/><br/>Through a very imaginative plot, the audience is treated (this movie indeed a treat) to a story of how tax auditor Harold Crick's (Will Ferrell) clockwork like life is changed by some remarkably unusual events. Cleverest is the establishing scene, how it suck the audience into a reality that is indeed stranger than fiction. Quite innocently, the movie starts with somewhat commonplace voice over describing the daily routine of Crick. But it soon dawns on them that Crick is also hearing this voice over, inside his head. Continuing to unfold is that this voice over is actually the text draft of a book that contemporary novelist (who even lives in the same city as Crick) Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is writing. Just as the audience, through some mental gymnasium, is sorting out this somewhat unusual situation, the master stroke is delivered  Eiffel has a penchant for writing tragic stories, with the hero dying in the end.<br/><br/>Surreal as the plot it, it offers ample opportunist for comedy as well as poignancy, and the movie succeeds on both counts. Wild as he can be as in ""The producer"", Ferrell proves that he is equally at home with the Murray-type minimalism, which is not just doing nothing (which everybody can) but doing something with doing nothing. Maggie Gyllenhaal is lovable as the sweetly defiant bakery owner (having had enough of Harvard law) who deliberately withholds 30% of her tax payable to make a point - her social conscience. A romance that starts with animosity is usually fun to watch. With great acting and great chemistry, Ferrell and Gyllenhaal make this not only fun, but a special treat. Thompson and Dustin Hoffman (a professor that is Crick's court of last appeal to save his life from Eiffel's ruthless pen, or typewriter, to be exact) are two veterans solid as a rock in providing and anchor for this rather bizarre tale. Only Queen Latifah is somewhat wasted, as the soberly practical assistant to the writer, not having any opportunity to display some of her flamboyance as in ""Chicago"".<br/><br/>STF succeeds in providing all at once excellent entertainment and something to think about, by exercising good constraint in the both comedy and the ""philosophy"" aspects. As a result, it comes across being natural and sincere, rather than outrageous and contrived. The reference to literature also puts it in the good company of films such as ""Finding Forrester"" (2000) and ""Freedom writer"" (2007)."

","more than a six out of ten, but I don't feel like it would have done justice to intelligent movies. This is no ""Adaptation"". The dramatizations of the writing process are good, however, this movie takes a great idea and great possibilities and turns it inevitably into a standard Hollywood film that is funny yes, and undeniably creative. Unfortunately, it's also mindless and straightforward The following may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>There were great possibilities in this movie and I had high hopes for it. In the end however, there is not a great deal of reflection on the main character. He is turned into a robot that slowly comes out of his shell. Typical, standard story. However, they even botch this up by making him into an impossible creation, dealing with his life with mockery and disrespect.<br/><br/>What I mean to say is, I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I don't believe a character like that really exists nor do I think that anyone would write about someone like that. He isn't the everydayman. He is the butt of jokes. He lives in a sterile world and there is no explanation. Somehow it's all rosy and comical. How can a man who hasn't been traumatized so contentedly remove himself from the world? How can he be so desireless for so long and then suddenly change? Granted, the movie portrays it as his fear of death. However, things work out so seamlessly without great difficulty.<br/><br/>A woman falling in love with her tax auditor? On top of which, a literary, educated woman who has tattoos and is a baker? That's the potentially interesting character and there is no development.<br/><br/>The romantic element is contrived and unbelievable. I didn't sense any passion there at all.<br/><br/>The movie is funny, and perhaps worth watching as it goes rather quick. I wouldn't go to the theatre to see it though.<br/><br/>In summation, the movie isn't bad. It is just disappointing - how someone can come up with such a fantastic idea and fall so short on everything else. The writing in this fake novel is average to poor. The characters don't work. The acting is bland and uninspiring. I felt anyways.<br/><br/>If you want something literary, go somewhere else. If you want a light hearted comedy that has a great theme although a mediocre execution, this would hit the spot."

","If I were asked to guess who wrote the screenplay of this movie, I would definitely say ""Charlie Kaufman"" because this is exactly the kind of story that could come from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (except in this case, we owe our thanks to Zach Helm). In this stranger-than-fiction tale, our hero, Harold Crick is an IRS agent who lives his life by calculating every step, carefully planing his day, his schedule instead of enjoying the moment. One day something goes wrong with his wrist watch while he is asleep and then he starts to hear his life being narrated by a female voice. It is funny that just as the narrator is introducing us to the character of Harold Crick, the very same character (who is supposed to be merely fictional) also hears the same narration. Soon, the voice becomes quite intrusive and makes him lose his train of thought. Harold goes to a doctor seeking advice about this weird situation. Of course, the first thing that comes to doctor's mind is that Harold is going insane or probably schizophrenic. Considering this may not be the case, Harold ends up seeking help from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to understand what kind of story Harold is in (comedy or tragedy?). In the meantime, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) the voice inside Harold Crick's mind, is actually a real-life author and writing a story about her character...well...Harold Crick. But the bad news is that, at the end of every story, Kay kills her main character - something that puts Harold on the edge. Harold, who is not very good at socializing with others and who is a very lonely man, starts to open up a little and connects with the woman he desires, a young woman named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). But, if the story's ending doesn't change Harold's life will cease to exist. This is a very good movie with an inspirational message about the meaning of life. If we think about it, the author Kay is more like a God figure because she decides who lives and who dies. We can think of ourselves as characters in a book written by God. And if knew the exact time of our death, how would we continue to live our life or could we continue at all? The movie's message is strong and inspirational: live your life without calculating every step, be more spontaneous, stop being so result-focused and indulge yourself in the little details of life, enjoy the moment. After all, these are the things that makes life so precious. This message comes way before the ending but the ending puts a cherry on top of this message. I highly recommend Stranger Than Fiction to anyone who is interested in the meaning of life. I give it a 8 out of 10."

Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a gangly, nerdish bachelor IRS agent who is obsessed with numbers (his favorite word is ""integer""), a math savant who can solve complex arithmetic problems instantly in his head. His most prized possession is a hi-tech wristwatch. Every one of his daily routines involves split-second timing to save up the minutes forwell, nothing in particular, since his life is utterly sterile, devoid of friends and interests.<br/><br/>One day Harold's pristine world is invadedby a voice, a woman's voice, a voice with an English accent that narrates his every move as he makes it. Try as he might, he cannot shake the voice. He consults a shrink (Helen Hunt, in a fine little cameo in which she assures him he has schizophrenia); he takes a vacation, but nothing works. Finally he consults a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), after someone suggests that he may somehow have become a character in a novel being written by the woman whose voice has begun to ordain his conduct. Hilbert asks a bunch of questions to try to discern a pattern that would allow him to accurately peg the identity of such an author.<br/><br/>In fact the notion that he is a character in a novel proves to be true, and the novelist in question is the celebrated Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who has been suffering through an agonizing case of writer's block in pursuing her new manuscript aboutyesHarold Crick, of course, the bachelor IRS nerd. She's stuck trying to find a way to kill him off (the protagonist in every one of her highly successful books dies). The publishers are so concerned as Eiffel falls further and further behind the deadline for completion that they send over their in-house special assistant/baby sitter for blocked authors, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), who tries to soothe the agitated, chain smoking Eiffel and pull her through to success.<br/><br/>The other pivotal character in this crazy yarn is the woman who becomes Harold's unlikely love interest: Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a casual, tattooed, New Agey bakery owner who at first glance seems to be everything Harold is not. He only meets her when her case of underpaid taxes comes up for audit and is assigned to him. They form an intense mutual dislike at first, but all of that gradually changes.<br/><br/>So how is this weird predicament going to be resolved? Where does life leave off and fiction begin? Life emulating art emulating life, and so on. Is Harold inexorably doomed to whatever fate Eiffel has in store for him, assuming she can break through her block to have anything at all in store? I'll leave you with these existential questions to mull over. If you see this film, prepare yourself in advance by repeating at least 100 times: ""I will not suffer trying to make any sense of this story; I will simply yield to its pleasures.""

"MOscarbradley","9","1","2","18 December 2006"," A new breed of rom-com
","The romantic comedy has come in many guises from screwball to sex. Now we have a different aspect of love; the metaphysical rom-com. Actually, it's a genre that's been around for a few years now, through ""Groundhog Day"" and ""The Truman Show"" to, more recently, ""I Heart Huckabees"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Charlie Kaufmann is it's principal progenitor. The films play out like science-fiction but they are anchored in a much more earthly, literary world. The debt these films owe is more to James Joyce than Issac Assimov and it's no accident that in both ""Adaptation"", which made free with the concept of an author and his characters inhabiting the same landscape, and now ""Stranger than Fiction"", one of the principal characters is a writer.<br/><br/>In some respects ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a decidedly old-fashioned film. It's a boy-meets-girl movie where the fate of the boy and girl hinges on the intervention of a third party. (In the thirties and forties this would have been an eccentric millionaire played by Charles Coburn). But now we have moved into the era of the metaphysical romantic comedy and here the third party is a writer and the boy is a character in her novel. He also happens to be real and while he is aware he is a character in a novel, (and none too happy about it), she isn't aware that her character is a living, breathing person. This is smart stuff up to a point but had it just been one-sided the concept would have worn itself out. It's when the character introduces himself to the author that the film really kicks in.<br/><br/>If this all sounds terribly high-brow, esoteric and confusing, don't worry, it isn't. It's smart, clever, funny and genuinely romantic. The character, Harold, is Will Ferrell and he's a stuffed shirt but you know five minutes after meeting him that the starch is going to be taken out of that shirt and when you clasp eyes on Maggie Gyllenhall's kooky pastry chef you know she's the girl to do it. Both players are first-rate. Ferrell develops a real person out of his character and adds a dimension to his playing that he hasn't shown before while Gyllenhall oozes sex appeal. She tries to act tough but never quite makes it. There is a sexy little girl inside and Ferrell knows how to draw her out.<br/><br/>There is also excellent work from Emma Thompson as the eccentric, chain-smoking author with writer's block and from Dustin Hoffman as the literary guru whose advice Ferrell seeks. Hoffman has a marvellous scene when he argues that Ferrell should allow his character to be killed off because that way the book will be 'a masterpiece'. The scene is highly ridiculous but Hoffman plays it with the straightest of straight faces relishing every syllable. The director, Marc Forster, has already shown he can mesh the real with the phantasmagorical in ""Finding Neverland"". Here he handles the twists and turns of Zach Helm's marvellous script with consummate ease. I absolutely loved it."

","I thought this movie was going to be funny from what they showed in the previews. There were funny moments, but it wasn't all laughs...and that's what I loved about it. I was so glad to see Will Ferrell in a serious role. He was great as Harold Crick, the quiet, serious ""tax man."" He lives kind of a boring, uneventful life until one day he starts hearing the voice of a woman narrating his life. Everything the woman says happens so when he hears her speaking of his ""imminent death"" he begins to worry. He has to find out where the voice is coming from and how to stop the events. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful as his love interest, Ana. She is the anti-Harold, everything he is not and they have great chemistry together. Will Ferrell does a very touching acoustic and vocal performance in the movie. I think if you liked The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, you'll like Stranger Than Fiction. The idea is like that, something that couldn't really happen, but makes for an interesting story. Not to forget, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman lend great supporting roles to the film, also. I give it a 10/10."

","I went to see this on a recommendation of a friend and I am so pleased that I saw this film. There were so many excellent elements- for once an unusual idea was actually executed from beginning to end. The script was very tight without insisting on being heavy handed. Every element drove to the conclusion and I didn't find myself wishing anything had been done differently. I wouldn't ordinarily be a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but I thought he was fantastic. He was funny without being over the top, showed vulnerability without big flashing lights saying ""I'm being vulnerable"", and played the part to perfection. Emma Thompson again proved her skill as an actress playing what I thought to be an against type role. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant. I really can't say enough good things about the performances. This is a movie I will definitely add to my DVD collection and would strongly recommend it to everyone!"

","Seeing Will Farrell in a straight role in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is at first puzzling - but it soon leaves as the interest in what the plot is setting up becomes primary. I was taken in - not only as voyeur but really caring what was going to happen to this character. I loved the on-site in Chicago aspect and the detail to the overall look of all the secondary roles and rhythm they evoked to enrich the visuals. Emma Thompson, I think, should be nominated for best actress for her role.

","One of the best films I have seen for a very-very long time. Clever, deep, witty and beautiful. With this film Zach Helm emerges as one of the most promising and talented writers of his generation. The idea is borrowed from Dostoevsky's 'The Double': a hero contesting the authorship of the author, refusing to accept his bleak and dull personality. The movie is about spiritual awakening, the shock of discovering the hidden and forbidden. The movie is full of wonderful and beautiful moments: the watch going crazy at the bus stop is one of the most memorable and beautiful cinematic images I have ever seen. Dostoevsky once admitted that he failed to properly materialize this wonderful idea. The plot of 'Stranger Than Fiction' is brilliantly crafted and the authors of the film should be congratulated with this amazing achievement!"

","Having only seen the movie once with my adult daughter, I was, as is usual for me, completely engrossed with the plot and characters. But in the background I thought I noticed that the settings were various towns and cities across the United States. Was I wrong? There was a jarring note near the beginning of the movie when the mass transit vehicle Crick was riding on was described as the MTA and I was under the impression the scenes were set in SF where the buses are called the Muni. After that I thought the movie was set in NYC (where I swear I saw the MOMA in the background), and Chicago, among others. Only way I'll be able to resolve this puzzle is to see the movie again."

She even has the tattoo that Ana has in the film. Like Ana's character, Krystin dropped out and started her own business doing what she loves. She works in music management which isn't the same as Ana in the film but the real Krystin does cook vegan treats. She doesn't sell her baked goods or have a bakery though. She lives in Chicago which is where this movie was filmed and is based. Here is her Myspace Myspace.com/KrystinKaos<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved this movie.

","A pretty mellow movie, actually kinda strange in parts, but totally original. It was an interesting concept for us, and the portrayal was near life. Despite a personal objection to the fact that the book writer or the book had no reference to the other characters in the movie, I appreciated the overall simplicity of the movie (not only with reference to setting, attire, mood, etc).I like the continuous calculator in our hero's mind. I like the way the charming baker wanted to make a difference to the world. I also liked the way how all of us have a sense of hygiene, when the writer while trying to visualize the jump, wipes her nose and puts it back in her pocket. I was educated by the dealt issue...WRITERS BLOCK......grrrr....i wanted to sympathize with her! In fact, I liked the way the Professor scientifically tried to narrow down to who could be the writer... What i did not like was that it was too slow (probably because of my addiction to action) and almost made me sleep in some parts...totally strange but overall worth it!

","I didn't much care for this movie simply because it isn't the type of movie I care much for. performances were good, concept was interesting, direction was adequate. It is clearly the type of movie which its devotees will spend endless hours discussing ""what it really meant."" My question is this, ""what the heck was the deal with the boom mic?"" In the print I saw, the boom mic hangs down consistently into almost every scene for the first half of the movie; moving from actor to actor. It isn't just a glimpse of the dang thing but the whole microphone, including the boom a couple of times. It is there way to much to be poor editing or an accident. But if it isn't poor editing or an accident, it must be intentional. If it is intentional, it must ""mean"" something.<br/><br/>Had the author been writing a screenplay instead of a novel, it would have made some sense, but since a novel is a narrative form rather than a recorded form, the mic is way out of place and seems to have no context.<br/><br/>I would love to read anyone's thoughts about this. It may mean something to someone, but it was just another distraction in a movie I didn't care much for in the first place."
"Buddy-51","6","1","2","10 December 2006"," interesting idea that feels underdeveloped
","Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""-like bid at legitimacy with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.<br/><br/>Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him. One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life. As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction. Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene. When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.<br/><br/>Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect. There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it. In short, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page. The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his ""life."" Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic. With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation. Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.<br/><br/>There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece. It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale."

","Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is a writer who has writer's block. She is deeply involved in her latest novel, but can't find a way to kill off the main character of the book.<br/><br/>Without knowing it, Karen is writing a real life story about an IRS tax agent named Harold Crick who is a loner in life and at work. He spends all day by himself and has no social interaction except with those he is auditing. If Karen writes that he trips over a curb, the real life Harold trips over a curb. If she writes that he makes a telephone call, the real life Harold makes a telephone call.<br/><br/>Harold (Will Ferrell) hears the voice of the author narrating his life. Harold is becoming frustrated since no one else can hear the voice and simply thinks he's crazy. When standing at a street corner waiting for the bus, Harold hears the narrator say that he had just set in motion events leading to his imminent death.<br/><br/>In an effort to get help, he asks literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dennis Hoffman) to help him figure out who could be writing this story and how he could prevent the grim ending. The professor tells him he needs to figure out whether he is in a comedy or in a tragedy and that they can go from there.<br/><br/>Harold is in the process of auditing a baker named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) when he realizes that the plot of the story is beginning to lead him to fall in love with Ana.<br/><br/>In an effort to figure out which genre Harold is being written in, he starts keeping tally on everything in favor of a comedy and everything in favor of a tragedy, and his relationship with Ana becomes the center of his checklist.<br/><br/>Harold finally is able to come in contact with Karen to inform her that he is real and needs her to write his death out of the ending.<br/><br/>Just like Harold, this movie does not know whether it is a comedy or a tragedy and it suffers greatly for that main reason. The acting is fine and the dialog is interesting and fast paced (Much like an Aaron Sorkin type script) but in the end the movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be and causes for the ending to fall flat.<br/><br/>I thought the ending could have been much better, but the movie overall is decent. It's certainly a movie with a lot of potential, and many may feel like it reaches it fully, but this movie simply didn't end the way it should have...at least not in my opinion."
"luckycharm91","6","1","2","4 December 2006"," My views, flawed film with good performances
","Its taken me some time process this film but now i think my views are s follows:<br/><br/>It was merely 'okay'. I admit i hate Will Farrell, his films are generally senseless and remarkably unfunny however here he was okay . As for Maggie, well she's great as always though i do not buy for a second that the two of them could be a couple. I don't see it at all. She's absurdly out of his league. Then there's the fact that a fictional character exists, i'm sure this is old hat, and has been done before i just can't put my finger quite on where. It's not original at all really, it just made me think about the other characters who appear in the book, like Maggie. Surely Harold would of realized from reading that his girlfriend is also fictional....in this regard i found the love story pretty hollow. The author could of changed it at any minute. I couldn't quite just sit and think 'ok, he's real' because i was struck by so many questions. When did he come into being? When the story started? If the book had no details about his childhood etc surely he'd have massive memory loss? Its just a bit too unbelievable and i apologizes as i know i'm not explaining myself well. It's like the writer had a intelligent idea but only thought about it briefly. As for the question as to if he should of been killed i'm saying yes. As anyone who has seen 'Pan's labyrinth ' will know the hero/death storyline is a must. I thought that really Harold should of died as Virgina Woolf character says in 'The hours' he had to die to make the others respect life more. In other words the characters in Harolds book, their lives, don't seem to mean as much now Harold is still alive.<br/><br/>To conclude, not as clever as it thinks and a story which, upon trying to explain out, makes your mind hurt as by thinking about logic you've already done more thinking than the writer."
"Rick_Bman","8","1","2","2 December 2006"," Wonderful film, that managed to surprise me in many ways.
","I wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie, on one hand it looked to have a very interesting concept and looked as if it might be well made. On the other hand I have never been a big fan of Will Ferrell, so that was the first thing this film was going to have to overcome for me to enjoy it. I also was concerned going in about how they would end this film, it just felt like no matter how good the movie was there would be no way to end it on a strong note.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell (Harold Crick) completely, 100 percent surprised me with this film, he was actually good. I have read some reviews that they say Ferrell should be an Oscar contender for this film, and while he was definitely good I won't go that far. It seems to be that every time an actor that normally does very comedic roles actually shows that he is a competent actor people start talking about Oscars. I thought he was excellent in the film, and I have newfound respect for him as an actor, but I wouldn't go as far as saying his performance was Oscar worthy. However, if he continues to take on challenging roles like this, I can see him blossoming into a wonderful actor.<br/><br/>As for the ending of the film I wasn't sure how they could possibly give the film a good, strong ending that I wouldn't see coming. The way I saw it, there were only two ways to end the film, either Harold Crick dies or he doesn't. If he dies you have an unneeded depressing ending. Not that I am against depressing endings but it would have totally ruined the mood of the film. Then again, the way I saw it before going in, the only way to keep him alive at the end would be through some ridiculous, convoluted series of events that would leave me unsatisfied. However, this is another thing that pleasantly surprised me. The movie actually managed to offer and ending that was not only surprising but actually felt like a genuinely good way to end the film.<br/><br/>The performances in the film were pretty good all around. Dustin Hoffman (Professor Jules Hilbert) was amazing as usual, and I really enjoyed the character that he played. The conversations between Harold Crick and Professor Hilbert were very well done, and led to some of the most wonderful moments in the film. Maggie Gyllenhaal (Ana Pascal) also did a wonderful job, and there was actually some really good chemistry in the film between Gyllenhaal and Ferrell. My absolutely favorite scene in the film is when Harold is playing the guitar and singing for Ana, something about that scene just struck a chord with me, there was just something so moving about it.<br/><br/>Overall it was an absolutely wonderful film, and I really enjoyed seeing it. Will Farrell managed to not annoy me in this film as he does in most of his other roles and not only that he show that he can be a competent actor when he wants to be. This is definitely a film I would recommend to others."

Romance blooms.<br/><br/>The movie is cute, and it is funny.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson reminds us what a woman who is also a movie star can do. Thompson is commanding, riveting, interesting, engaging -- everything the teenage, arm candy, female cupcake of the moment -- you know their names -- could never be.<br/><br/>Queen Latifah, as her assistant, is given the transparent role of secret sharer, the character who exists solely to give Thompson someone to talk out loud to. And Latifah is given exactly NOTHING else to do. This film's waste of Queen Latifah should be a legal offense, requiring the paying of a hefty fine.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman is wonderful to watch; he just gets better and better. One could do worse than resolve to go see Hoffman's performance in any new movie.<br/><br/>The movie is talky, but the director gives his characters funny bits to perform, to entertain the viewer's eyes while characters did little more than talk. Hoffman, for example, is a coffee addict, and this is communicated wonderfully. Thompson is a cigarette addict; her addiction is communicated in more disgusting fashion.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel is a revelation. Gone is the goofball comic prancing in his underwear. He portrays a numbers idiot savant who probably has Asperger's syndrome with complete dedication and never breaks character. He made me laugh in ""Ricky Bobby;"" he made me care in ""Stranger than Fiction."" Maggie Gyllenhall is Maggie Gyllenhall, a flat nosed young woman who thinks she is smarter and more special than she is. You can practically smell her performance as a bratty, pretentious, hippy baker; you can practically taste her armpit hairs that fall into her brownies.<br/><br/>So far so good.<br/><br/>The problem is the movie does very little with its very clever plot device. In fact, it doesn't do much more with it than is done in the film's trailers. And that's too bad."

I find cinematographer Roberto Schaefer's camera style paces like a dialog between angle and subject.

Several they were very very clear. There is a scene they show in the trailer where they are sitting in the rain. In the theater I could see the microphone boom in that scene clear as day - the rain was even dripping off of it. I'm left with thinking that the placement of the booms in the scenes was intentional? Possibly to illustrate how the picture was a narration of Harold's life. I can't imagine that the director left those in there by mistake as they were so apparent. I'm really surprised to see that there were no other mentions of it within the comments. There are a couple of mentions of the booms in the ""goofs"" section however."
"ClaytonDavis","10","1","2","27 November 2006"," Nothing Strange, Completely Familiar
","Stranger than Fiction The comparisons are flying around the net and papers to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but let it be known that Marc Foster's Stranger than Fiction is a remarkable cinematic achievement in its own. It does have that Charlie Kaufman-like feel to it but captures the heart at a vulnerable point in its rising action. The film tells the story of Harold Crick, a thirty-something IRS agent that lives his life one second to the next. From brush strokes to calculating equations, Harold's life has become a very secluded one. Meanwhile, Kay Eiffel is a successful author that hasn't published a book in ten years and is in a serious case of writer's block. Along with her assistant, Penny the two search for inspiration to complete Kay's latest work which ironically is telling Harold's current life. At first it's just talking about things that he is doing, which keeps Harold inside the realm of Kay's narration. But when Kay mentions Harold's ""inevitable death"" Harold's transformation and search begins.<br/><br/>This film is by far the best performance this viewer has seen Will Ferrell. As awkward as he is touching, Ferrell elevates the material and does a transformation that comedians like Jim Carrey have had trouble doing for some time. His Harold is completely alive to the audience and touches the most personal parts of the soul. Not since tales such as Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind have I cared so dearly about a character. If justice were to be served Ferrell would be a serious contender to such a weak category called Best Actor but in all seriousness, is the Academy ready to have him come to the Oscars? Maybe, he is a voter now and the season is just beginning.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson's haunting portrayal of a suicidal author should garner a few raves. Thompson has been popping in and out of good films lately, (Harry Potter, Love Actually, Angels in America) and seems poised for a nice comeback to the Oscars. Again, another weak category could welcome her back and along with Ferrell could train ride the both of them to the Kodak.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is magnificent. Dustin Hoffman is still chewing some of his comedic elements beautifully. Queen Latifah is showing her range despite how small the role is. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year but in Fiction she is the sexiest and authentic I have ever seen her. Foster also has great control of his picture and never loses sight of Helm's message. He drives the film to a wonderful destination of oddity and elusiveness of the narrative.<br/><br/>Aside from the the beautiful screenplay by Zach Helm, the score is probably one of the strongest points adding to an eerie, yet completely volatile moving picture. Consideration if there is going to be any, should focus on the powerful screenplay that carries that ""who thinks of that?"" feeling and Ferrell and Thompson powerhouse performances. If it were up to me however, this would be a definite Best Picture contender for its originality and heartfelt humor. This film could change your complete outlook of your existence.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"

The movie was never dull at any moment for me, it wasn't like any other Will Ferell movie, and that is what made it so great, it gets away from the whole stupid comedy idea, and creates a different comedy. This movie was definitely one of Will Ferrell's best movies, if not the best, and is definitely one to recommend, it was worth the $6.50, and it is definitely worth buying when it comes out on DVD."
"toddbradley","9","1","2","26 November 2006"," great film - impressive screen writing and acting
","Going into this film, I understood the premise pretty well from the trailers I'd seen. And I'd heard someone say this was Will Ferrell's first totally serious role. What I wasn't expecting was what a great screenplay this film has.<br/><br/>Ferrell does have a more serious role than many of his past films, but it's also very comedic. Before seeing it, I imagined this being Farrell's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but it isn't. That said, he does a great job as leading man and makes us really believe in his somewhat fantastic character.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a brilliant collection of stars. After leaving the theater, I was wondering how the filmmakers were able to get Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman to both play supporting roles. Maggie Gyllenhaal does an admirable job as Farrell's character's love interest and life changer, though her role doesn't require the depth that Thompson's does.<br/><br/>Finally, the most delightful part of this film is the awesome writing. Zach Helm's screenplay has just enough circularity - it's a story about a story - to make it intellectually appealing without getting bogged down. I'm not sure the Academy would ever give awards to a film with Will Farrell, but I think ""Stranger Than Fiction"" deserves the Best Screenplay Oscar more than any other film I've seen this year."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","25 November 2006"," Bizaar and unusual and yet endearing and captivating
","Stranger Than Fiction has a very unique concept and at first glance seems very bizarre and perhaps a deliberate attempt to be artistic and strange and yet for this film it works and it pulls off that attempt to the greatest degree. The film frightened me right from square one because of it's main star...Mr. Will Ferrell. I have never been a Ferrell fan and I find his comedy and acting overblown, overacted, and completely foolish so the idea of him carrying what appeared to be at best a dark comedy seemed nearly impossible and the idea of me enjoying it was up there too. But the idea got the better of me and I tried it out and FINALLY Will Ferrell pulled off a decent, believable, and almost emotional performance. On top of that the story is intelligent and intriguing and despite a bit of a tacked on closing to the film it's a very view-worthy film.<br/><br/>As I said Will Ferrell headlines the film as IRS Auditor Harold Crick who is a creature of habit in the worst way, to the point where he is nearly obsessive compulsive without it ever occurring to him. His life and views on life begins to change dramatically when he discovers that his life may be out of his control and spiraling towards demise which leads him on a bit of a self discovering adventure. Ferrell truly does try his utmost to keep the role serious but comedic in a dark subtle way. There a few moments when he seems to almost lose it but he manages to pull it back together and make it work. By the end of the film he has the part down to a science and almost moves you to tears with his performance. I would much rather see Ferrell do this kind of role than his Saturday night skits over and over again for two hours each time. Emma Thompson rounds out the cast as the overtly eccentric and reclusive writer Karen Eiffle who happens to be writing the story of Harold Crick without realizing it. Her fiction is his life and she is writing him to a dramatic, ironic demise. Her steady, strong voice makes an interesting narrative while her rather zany character makes her interesting to watch. She does a good job in a mostly small, supportive role. Also noteworthy is the amazing Dustin Hoffman whom I love. He plays a small cameo type role as the English Professor trying to help Harold figure out who his narrator is and what his story will be. Hoffman has some great lines and as small as his character is, he immediately adds points to the film for just being there. And finally Harold's newfound love interest is Maggie Gyllenhaal, almost the oddest choice for a romantic interest to Will Ferrell as you can get and yet they fit together and seem so right for each other, it's almost disturbing but their romance doesn't whirlwind by any means and unfolds gradually throughout the film and makes a very sweet romance.<br/><br/>The only previous work I had seen of director Marc Forster was 2005's Stay with Naomi Watts, and his incredible piece de resistance Finding Neverland. Forster has an incredible imagination and a way of creating such a unique world, story and complicated plot but somehow makes it so incredibly watchable. Stay was disturbing and twisted and seemingly so complex and yet you couldn't not watch it and Finding Neverland was beautiful, breathtaking and simple and yet tragic. I think Forster has so much potential in film making and Stranger Than Fiction is no exception. He puts his own vision into the film and you somehow become entangled in it's charm. Sadly I don't think Stranger Than Fiction will walk away with any Academy Awards or even nominations being steam rolled by bigger fish like The Departed but it deserves to be seen because it's subtly brilliant. It does have it's drawbacks. The ending is horrendously tacked on, it's almost a complete turn around from the rest of the film because it ends up being predictable and happy go lucky instead of tragic and ironic the way it should have been. Nonetheless for an intelligent adult film this is the way to go and to see Ferrell finally do something else with himself. 8/10"
"prairiedances","7","1","2","21 November 2006"," Not a great fan of this one
","Not a fan of the movie. Spoiler ahead I liked that she saved him in the end but it just completely defeats the point of the movie. Also I'm all about suspending disbelief but I just couldn't completely go there with this one. Why her? Where did she get this power to narrate people's lives? What about the rest of Harold's life? Why this instant? Okay, So I know why. She was too preoccupied with death to live and through his ""death"" he had to learn to live- blah blah blah_ but still. What about her other stories? She was preoccupied with death then why not those people? Where does this gift come from? Maybe I would be able to believe a little more if an explanation was given.<br/><br/>Also this movie fell prey to breaking its own rules. Harold is not in control of his life right? But when he finds out how he going to die and decides he's in control then that defeats the whole point doesn't it? Also she narrates that he is unaware of his death as he makes last phone calls. But Harold is aware. If one can assume that the movie is book and she says then end it is just okay but doesn't make sense with the rest of the book (which is true) doesn't the movie also suck? (which it does in some ways). Furthermore, is Dustin Hoffman's character honestly telling Harold he should die for the sake of the novel ( granted at this point we don't know how he dies but still)? Saving a boy is great and all but come on. <br/><br/>I thought that maybe there was a point to the movie. That maybe is was some kind of metaphor that the narrator is God or something and showing how sometimes he/she as to take good people even if they don't want to but have to. Then they had the real ending which I'll admit I like that he lived, but totally went against where the rest of the movie was going. <br/><br/>One more nuisance, anyone else notice the mise-en-scene? It was hitting you over the face with it almost. I keep trying to figure out the point of it. <br/><br/>The movie wasn't horrible. If you don't over think it, it was funny the acting was mostly good and only a little too long. However a lot of better movies have shown the whole live life to the fullest song and dance a lot better. See, My Life, Life As a House, It's a Wonderful Life, Pay It Forward, even Angelina Jolie's long forgotten, Life or Something Like It for much better versions.<br/><br/>7.5-8/10"
"Rogue-32","10","1","2","18 November 2006"," Wise and profound
","Stranger Than Fiction is a film, judging from the trailers, that appears to be a quirky, clever little comedy. In reality, it's much more than that, and it's much more than the sum of its parts, as well.<br/><br/>As a writer, I am all too familiar with the sometimes-eerie ways that life parallels art, and vice versa. In Fiction, that's just the jumping-off point; there are quite a few thought-provoking ideas and wise messages to be had here, and they're all cleverly injected into the proceedings without the slightest bit of heavy-handedness or preachiness, from the beginning to the very end.<br/><br/>The casting is superb. Ferrell proves once and for all that he is an actor, Hoffman is terrific as always, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was the absolute perfect choice for Ana, the person who arouses Harold's deeply buried feelings of love. I thought the scene where he plays that song for her on the guitar was the best in the movie. Her reaction when she comes in from the kitchen, the look on her face - that rang true on a profound level. And Emma Thompson, who is a writer herself, brought genuine angst to her portrayal of a person who has to come to terms with what her responsibilities are in this life, both as an artist and as a human being."
"moutonbear25","8","1","2","17 November 2006"," Life imitating art imitating life imitating art ...
","""Life is stranger than fiction,"" or so the saying goes. Borrowing from the expression, Mark Forster's STRANGER THAN FICTION is about one man's life that has become the subject of soon-to-be published fiction. An as yet undetermined narrator announces at the very start that, ""This is a story about a man named Harold Crick."" That narrator is revealed to be author Karen Eiffel (the always absorbing Emma Thompson), whose previous novels have all ended with her protagonists dying to serve the story's greater purpose. Somehow, her voice has found its way from the pages that tell Harold's story to the head of a man actually named Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). As she pushes through the novel that has taken her a decade to complete, Harold begins to hear her voice wherever he goes. As she points out his obsessive-compulsive behaviour, he begins to question the strict structure that has kept his life in order for years. When Eiffel announces that he is unknowingly spiraling towards his imminent death, he has heard enough. The funny thing is Harold's death was imminent before someone told him it was. He just needed someone to remind him that he should probably get around to doing some living while he was still alive. <br/><br/>But is this actually a story about Harold Crick? Is it not just as much a story about Karen Eiffel? After all, she knows the story she is telling so well that her words and voice have torn some line in the fabric of the universe to make it into Harold's head. I don't know how likely that is in real life but I'm pretty sure it would never happen if there weren't an intense cerebral connection between the two parties involved or if he weren't a complete fabrication of one's imagination. At first glance, Crick and Eiffel seem like people on entirely opposite ends of the spectrum. After a closer look, they are clearly in opposition to each other but they inhabit the very same spectrum. Both are shown as obsessive-compulsive people. Harold counts his brush strokes and goes to bed at exactly the same time each night. Karen lives a reclusive life in a starkly white apartment, extinguishing her cigarettes in spit-damp tissues she tucks away in her pockets. Both attempt to exert high levels of restraint in their lives to maintain the illusion that they command the direction their lives will take, one through chaos and the other through control. It is also a convenient way to avoid experiencing anything frighteningly unknown, <br/><br/>Eiffel struggles with how to kill Crick for most of the film. How do you kill someone to make a literary point when their life barely has any relevance to begin with? Meanwhile, Harold's recent bout with schizophrenia has him seeing how the tiniest changes in his life can make it all the more exciting. Funny how the knowledge that death may be around the corner acts as a good kick in the ass. The connection between Crick and Eiffel also exposes their attitudes towards life and death while helping each of them heal their apprehensions towards both realities. Crick had conveniently eliminated the possibility of death from his calculated existence. Eiffel's eerie fascination with death had stopped her from seeing her own possibilities for happiness in life. As the two become more aware of the other's existence, and subsequently more comfortable with that, they each begin to see what they were not seeing prior. Life will not be and will never seem worth living if you don't take risks, no matter how small they may be; from wearing a sweater instead of a tie for a change to stepping outside your apartment and meeting new people. <br/><br/>STRANGER THAN FICTION is smart without being superior, funny without being asinine. Forster's previous work has either bored me (MONSTER'S BALL), frustrated me (STAY) or filled my heart with warmth and my eyes with tears (FINDING NEVERLAND). Here he creates a poignant piece about a woman telling the story of a man because its easier than telling her own story. Her real problem with killing Harold Crick is that she no longer knows if she wants to. Killing Harold would just mean metaphorically killing herself again. Writing Harold's newfound appreciation for life has sparked her own and Forster hopes her reminder will be one to us as well. Not to sound too morbid but our deaths are as imminent as Harold's. The film's subtle layers expose a simple insight about the distance between our lives and the stories we tell about our lives. These stories are told to create meaning and give shape but we all run the risk of missing out in the process if we don't allow for the unexpected."

","I am probably one of the few that I've seen that has generally not thought this movie was as great as a lot of people have said. Then again, I completely got it and I knew it wasn't going to be funny. Maybe it was because I was expecting a ""Punch-drunk love"" or ""Eternal Sunshine"" or maybe even a ""Being John Malkovich"" But it didn't come off as those either.<br/><br/>After seeing the trailer I obviously saw what the story was about and everything but I exited the movie with nothing more than the A-B-C's that I had already picked up in the trailer. This could be a spoiler, but there really is no much more of a twist or story than what the trailer shows you. You know, I went in to ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and came out with a D-E-F too. With Stranger.... I really felt like nothing new and original had been popped out. And instead I felt like the trailer basically ended up being a 2 minute synopsis of the entire movie's plot save a few minutes here and there. Literally I left the movie with a ""Is that all?"" Sort of feel.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly but I had a lot of trouble connecting with any of them. I didn't connect with Ferell and that's what really disappointed me. I didn't feel like I really even cared what happened to him at the end.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider this a comedy... or romance or even a tragedy. This was simply a story. Nothing big or fancy but nothing unique either. Just another movie in all respects. I'm rather disappointed."

I used to love it when he'd eat cats and cough up hair.<br/><br/>Also, what is with the Dustin Hoffman? What is this, his 1,000th movie and all of a sudden he tries to be Dr. Funnypants, PhD? He just wasn't right for the part, is all, homies. Why couldn't this be the movie where they resurrected the career of Bull the bailiff from Night Court?

","We caught an early showing of this movie last night and like the rest of the audience (to judge by the laughter and applause) thoroughly enjoyed it. Will Ferrell as Harold Crick is fantastic in a completely different kind of role from his usual over-the-top comedy performances (which I always enjoy, but it was nice to see him stretch a little). Maggie Gyllenhall is adorable, and Emma Thompson is magnificent, as always. Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman are also very good in their supporting roles, as is Tony Hale (Buster from ""Arrested Development"" as Harold Crick's work buddy, Dave). The cinematography and special visual effects are quite nice; it's a pleasure to see Chicago looking so picturesque. Although this is a comedy, it has a deep undercurrent of thoughtfulness that makes you feel really invested in the characters."

","Acting Overall out of 10: 8 Will Ferrel: 10 Emma Thompson: 9 Dustin Hoffman: 9 Queen Latifah: 8<br/><br/>PLOT: 10 SCRIPT: 9<br/><br/>As a student of Drexel University I was quite excited to take advantage of this rare FREE early movie premiere hosted by Columbia pictures, Facebook, and Chase. Simply I just thought the movie was amazing. It had great performances from the whole cast, Queen Latifah the only exception, as she was just herself really like in every movie she does, but overall just phenomenal. Though I would agree with the one other comment a person made before that there really wasn't too much character development. Will Ferrell really pulls off this new part for him, as he is forced to play the reserved, methodical, conformist of society. If you're expecting a laugh out loud comedy from Will Ferrell with silly faces, noises, and stupidity, than this isn't the movie for you, though I still definitively recommend you to go and see this. I mean don't get me wrong it is a comedy, ""Stranger Than Fiction"", but it's a serious part for Will Ferrell, revealing the more practical and realistic side of his charisma and acting. The whole concept behind the story is great though. Really enjoyed it because it was like watching or hearing two movies/stories at once, but about the same person and about the same story.weird but true. Its not confusing or anything like that, but it's a story being written about the movie you're currently watching, so as the story is being written by its author Kay Eiffel, Emma Thompson, in her new book, its also how the movie turns out, or the events which occur in Cricks life. Its smart, funny, can be a tear jerker, and whimsical, its definitely one of Ferrell's best performances and proves he can be serious and normal I guess you can say."
"wavyfrog","10","2","7","7 November 2006"," a great comedy with heart and a brain
","I saw an advanced screening of 'Stranger than Fiction' tonight at my university, and I absolutely loved it. The film presents a fresh take on the themes previously best examined in Pirandello's 'Six Characters in Search of an Author,' but in this instance, it's one character, Harold Crick in search of his life within the narration. Mr. Ferrell plays Harold Crick with the earnestness that always ran at the core of his best characters; this is his 'Truman Show.' The film expertly skates between comedy and tragedy, perfectly voiced by Emma Thompson as the author of Harold Crick's life as we know it. She plays Eiffel with conviction, wit, and a great affinity for gallows humor. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a very ""Maggie Gyllenhaal"" character, but she adds levity and romance with aplomb when necessary. Dustin Hoffman and Tony Hale also do well in their somewhat-limited screen time (especially in the case of the sadly underused Mr. Hale, who imbues each of his scenes with a similar childlike exuberance that those of us who know and love 'Arrested Development' are familiar with). Queen Latifah does an admiral job with a character who seems merely to act as the voice of the audience or the recipient of exposition. Her character sticks out (sometimes painfully) among the many round characters of the film.<br/><br/>The film has a similar tone to 'I heart Huckabees': a little erudite, a little tragic, great fun, witty comedy, generally life-affirming. The difference is that this film has more heart and less pretension than 'Huckabees'. That being said, this is a wonderful English major's movie: it's about the power of literature.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend the film, especially as an alternative (or chaser) to the raunchier 'Borat'. (I saw the two within a few days of each other, and both illustrate that the American comedy is not dead. Both movies thrive on opposite ends of the spectrum.)"
"imdbtruth","1","2","8","2 July 2015"," What the Movie is *REALLY* About... Brilliant.... But *EVIL*!!
","This movie had multiple layers of esoteric symbolism, most will think I'm crazy and will not see my interpretation, but that's because it's not meant to be seen by the uninitiated...<br/><br/>The way the director was able to tell the surface story, but also added layers of esoteric symbolism, that was genius... The reason I'm giving it this low rating is because I'm outraged by the ending of the esoteric story...<br/><br/>The esoteric story being told really is ""stranger than fiction""... The esoteric storyline is about mind-control, and the Illuminati...<br/><br/>The movie is NOT really meant to be a ""fantasy movie"", although it is meant for you to wrongly perceive that it was intended to be fantasy genre... First, let me tell you what is really happening in the main *surface* story The main character, Harold Crick, wakes up one day hearing a voice in his head... Harold was actually a victim of ""mind-control"", and the real world technology exists to make a person hear voices, just like Harold did in the movie, and actually that technology is old... It's called the ""voice of god"" weapon, it uses ELF microwaves to beam a signal directly onto the skull... The ""author"" who was narrating Harold's life was also under severe mind-control, but not the same kind as Harold... The ""publishers"" were the ones behind the mind-control... That's what' actually happening on the surface level storyline, but it's still esoteric, because most people will be fooled into thinking it's fantasy genre...<br/><br/>There's a whole other underlying story being told esoterically...<br/><br/>In the esoteric storyline, ""Harold"" represents humanity, and the ""author Karen Eiffel"" represents the Illuminati... Harold ""wakes up"" one day and becomes very aware of the mind-control and behavioral-conditioning happening all around us... He goes to a professor to try and become more educated regarding the ""plot"" and who is behind it... Harold does find out who's plotting against him, and the professor tells him ""that's not good, everybody dies at the end of those stories""... This symbolizes Harold becoming aware of the Illuminati plans to kill most people on the planet...<br/><br/>PAUSE - The director (Forster) is obviously well aware, as am I, that there's a cabal of global elitists that are committing all their resources towards the monolithic purpose of reducing the global population by 80-90%... Yes, they also want world government, and global currency, but the endgame is depopulation, much in the name of the ""climate change"" myth... RESUME <br/><br/>Harold (humanity) confronts the Illuminati (the author) and informs them that we know what they are planning, and that we do not want to die... This pains the Illuminati (author) to see us (Harold) as real people, and to know that the way they ""author"" the global storyline kills real people, yet they still feel compelled to kill us...<br/><br/>Then the Illuminati (author) shares their plans with humanity (Harold), and the professor / educators are the first to understand it's supposed brilliance, and the educators will teach some to be accepting of the plan... This is symbolized by the ""professor"" reading the ending of the book before Harold and telling him it was a masterpiece, and that he ""had to die""...<br/><br/>Harold (humanity) eventually reads the end of the story, and realizes it has been written that he (we all) should die for ""the greater good"", part of Harold (humanity) buys into it, and part of him doesn't...<br/><br/>PAUSE - So at this point in the movie, I'm really hoping that the esoteric storyline turns out to have a positive ending, it doesn't!!! RESUME <br/><br/>So Harold jumps in front of the bus, to save the boy (who represents the future of the human species)... We find out that the ""author"" (Illuminati) didn't kill Harold (humanity), at least not totally, but he was broken from head to toe... This symbolizes that not *ALL* of humanity will die , but it has been ""written"" that humanity will come within an inch of being wiped out of existence at the hands of the Illuminati agenda, just as Harold was brought within an inch of death by the ""author""... The ""author"" explains that she just couldn't kill somebody who was so willing to die for the cause... This symbolizes the message that if you embrace the Illuminati depopulation agenda, then you *might* be part of the 10% that's chosen to survive and become the slave race of the Illuminati, who believe they will become our ""transhumanist gods""...<br/><br/>PAUSE - That's the message the director is going with??? Get on board with this ""Illuminati"" anti-human agenda, or be killed by the global ""authors""!!! Screw you Marc Forster!! Watch the documentary ""Technocalyps"" for more on ""transhumanism""... Google ""Georgia Guidestones"" and watch ""Endgame"" for more on depopulation etc... RESUME <br/><br/>Then we get a little more blatant clue that the director intended the Illuminati symbolism when the cookies baked at the end are ""Bavarian Sugar Cookies"", Bavaria being the place where the Illuminati was formed... Later I found out that the director Marc Forster was from Bavaria Germany, which made even more sense that he would be a delusional fan of the Illuminati...<br/><br/>I think the wristwatch symbolically represents artificial-intelligence / transhumanism... Remember at the beginning the narrator talks about how good the wind ""feels"" across the face of the watch, this symbolizes a machine having feelings aka artificial-intelligence singularity... Then it was the piece of the wristwatch that saves Harold (humanity), so that symbolically represents the directors belief that humans merging with the machine aka transhumanism will ultimately be what saves the future of our species...<br/><br/>The ""publishers"" esoterically represent the people who actually do the dirty work of the Illuminati, they're waiting for the ""author (Illuminati) to tell them how they wish to end it (humanity)... Notice also the death obsessed and nihilistic nature of the ""author"", that's a very fitting description of the bastards that comprise the ""Illuminati""..."
"Goon-2","2","2","8","5 August 2007"," It's no comedy, and to be a tragedy would probably require emotion, which this movie has none
","This was not a movie I chose to see, but rather agreed to sit in the room while it played. My biggest fear was that it would be stupid, or grating, or annoying, seeing as Will Ferrell is the star. Of course, another alternative was that it might have been a work of genius. Little did I know(the not-very-inspired phrase that is repeated in this movie) was how hideously boring this movie would turn out to be.<br/><br/>If I had seen Will Ferrell in any other movies, he hasn't made enough of an impression on me to... know that I have. His acting style appears grating in the trailers of his movies I have chosen not to see. I wouldn't say it was in this movie. Yet, little did I know, I would have actually Preferred that to the completely emotionless performance he turns in as Harold Crick, the lonely IRS agent whose routine life is disrupted by the sudden overhearing of a British-accented voice who seems to know what will happen next in Harold's dull little life (which wouldn't be that hard to figure out, considering he brushes his teeth the same amount of stroke, walks the same amount of steps to the bus stop.. etc). At first Harold thinks he's crazy, but somehow realizes it's not some mental impairment he's suffering from, some British lady is actually mapping out Harold's life for a story. Somehow this confirms Harold's sanity and makes him the focus of interest for a literature professor who's really hung up on the phrase ""little did he know."" Instead of trying to figure out WHY HAROLD CAN SUDDENLY HEAR HER, or why Harold is COMPLETELY ACCEPTING OF HER NARRATING PRESENCE, Harold just tries to figure out if it's a comedy or tragedy she's writing about him.<br/><br/>I remember this movie being marketed as a comedy and the few attempts at humor making it into the trailer, but it much more seems to be aiming at the ""tragedy"" angle with the feel-good ""live like you were dying"" moral thrown in, minus any inspiration or warm feelings. This movie is essentially without any feeling, particularly as it plods along at its annoying slow pace in its annoyingly bland colors, with its annoyingly limited background sound. I'm not a fan of endless soundtracks, but music can add to a movie and it might have woken this one up a little.<br/><br/>Instead, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" drags along with it's not-that-original-as-it-thinks concept of boring, narrated Harold, who, little did he know, finds the voice narrating him belongs to a real-life author (which ""we"" knew thanks to the random scenes of her trying to get an understanding of death) who just happens to live in the same city and finds her contact information. Little did she know, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS WRITING OUT THE PHONE CALL HE WOULD MAKE TO HER, Harold Crick is real, as well. Instead of wondering, say, HOW she had been able to narrate Harold, or wondering if she wasn't completely insane, or HE wasn't some complete nut who had somehow caught wind of her book and was trying to get to her, she completely accepts that he must be the Harold Crick she was writing about and feels bad because she's written some death scene for him that's apparently so wonderful she can't change it. (Harold also completely accepts this, though he has the ability to invade her apartment and even READS her book, he doesn't think to destroy it or ""make"" her change it.) Considering it seemed to take an eternity for the characters to even meet (Harold should have learned about her LONG before he did, especially about her ""little quirk"" of always killing her characters. It comes so late in the movie, after he ""knows"" he is going to die and the audience knows the author likes to think about death, that it really feels redundant) another eternity follows with the author having a nagging conscience and Harold having a creepy, emotionless acceptance of his impending doom. We also see ""why"" a kid on a bike and a lady bus driver kept appearing in this movie in the first place (er, why else would they keep showing them if they were not to have played a role in ""the end"") and Harold's Mentioned So Often You Know It Will Be Significant in the End wristwatch... also has a significant ""role"" (you would think she was writing a kiddie novel about ""Harold and the Amazing Wristwatch."" It seems to be almost as bright as Herbie the Lovebug). Oh yes, and then the movie goes on for another about fifteen minutes or so. Instead of being ""inspired"" by the not-very-good narration of the author, I felt about as alert and invigorated as Will Ferrell appears to be throughout the movie."

With a lot of overdone and obvious romantics, and an all too easy twist in the end, in which the main character simply calls up his creator, not to mention the mealymouthed continuation thereafter. Now, I hadn't truly expected something as brilliant as films that play with a similar premise, such as 'Being John Malkovich', 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' or 'Synecdoche, New York', but this was all too meager.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays, with little imagination, an ice-cold IRS employee, but even when he's supposed to have become a warmer character, there's not much colour or sparkle. Ferrell's mimicry usually works fine in weird comedies, but here it didn't - and I really had my hopes up. Maybe he should just stick to comedies? Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman do not add much to their characters, even if they didn't do a terrible job, either. Thompson's part is rather annoying in itself, but at least Hoffman's character is a little more interesting. I don't what Queen Latifah's part was supposed to add, but it didn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal's part deserves an extra paragraph. Her character is quite misplaced in most of her actions, and the romance between her and the IRS man is one of the most annoying and misplaced I've ever seen. And that's a shame, because she is a terrific actress with charisma in spades.<br/><br/>Only a couple moments in the film were pretty okay (such as the one with the 'flower'), so I'll be (just) a little lenient.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","At first I thought that Harold is in the fictional world and the writer is in the real world, but then when I saw the connections between them I figured out maybe Karen is his god and the story is the fate of Harold.<br/><br/>No matter if she is his god or not but what is important is that you can't change the fate because it had been written long before you was even born. So the movie shows one thing and that's the fact that we have no control in our life, there's only one thing which is our choices that we make might be able to change our fate exactly like Harold who knows what will happen to him and still he is determined to do it.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is saying that only you can change your fate by good actions.

Everything about it is subtle, but it you are a fan of witty dialogue and amazing wordplay/banter in a very well made movie with a largely unique plot, look no further.<br/><br/>Everyone involved does wonderfully, but again this movie works so well because of its writing. <br/><br/>Don't believe me?

"mcsheehey","4","1","3","26 May 2007"," A Waste of Talent:
","Let me start by saying hat ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is an awful movie. Period. The worst thing about it is not the plot, which is admittedly dull and drawn out. It is not the art direction and cinematography, which is still very plain and unoriginal. Nor is it the title, which is somewhat fitting in a strange sort of way. Though these things are not enormously positive, the worst part of ""Stranger than Fiction"" is the blatant way in which it wastes the talents of its capable cast and produces such a terrible final product.<br/><br/>""Stranger than Fiction"" is the story of the life of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrel. Crick lives an enormously dull life, and Will Ferrel can do little more than make him a somewhat likable, but intensely boring person. Was this the intent? I don't know, nor do I care. Watching the events of Crick's life play out, which we spend the entire movie doing, as about as dull and unoriginal as it sounds. The role is such a waste of Ferrel's talent. We see this problem a lot in the movie.<br/><br/>We soon switch between Crick and Emma Thompson's character in the movie, a best-selling author who's writing a book with Crick as the main character. Emma Thompson gives the writer such a soporific quality that she is even more unbearable to watch than Ferrel himself.<br/><br/>The other main characters to come out of the woodwork in the film are a tax-evader who falls for Crick (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a coffee-hounding scholar (Dustin Hoffman), and a boring publishing executive (Qujeen Latifah). None of these characters are remotely interesting except for Hoffman's, who is brought to life well by the veteran actor (no surprise there). The usually wonderful Gyllenhaal is lacking in every area except for gross-out humor (unintentional), when she and Ferrell...-well I won't ruin it for you.<br/><br/>This film is an overrated piece of trash that is as ridiculous as any comedy of its mold."

I'm not usually a fan of Will Ferrell's more goofy antics but in this he held himself admirably well, amidst such greats as Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman - all while holding onto his unique brand of whimsicality and comedic timing.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson nails her characterisation of a well seasoned author at wit's end, thanks to writer's block, as only she can do. No actor feels out of place among their peers in this piece and not one of them is failing to pull their own weight. The script is like a breath of fresh air. It's awkward, painful, hilarious, charming and refreshingly intelligent, without thinking too much of itself or abandoning its characters in the hopes of purely being a ""smart film"".<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is a small nugget of brilliance for the writer, reader, lover, laugher and life liver in all of us."

The movie had a great premise and wasn't overdone or made silly.<br/><br/>It was well written and the plot not too variegated to the point of ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal have excellent supporting roles and cannot be faulted for their performance.<br/><br/>A light-hearted movie that will segue from sad to happy throughout it's entirety.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing!"
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","1","3","3 December 2006"," Over-hyped, inconsistent and underwhelming
","Stranger than Fiction seemed so promising from the trailer. Could this writer be the new Charlie Kaufmann? Well, sadly the film answers this with a resounding ""Not yet."" A gimmicky and quirky plot (tax inspector starts hearing narration and turns out to be the hero of a novel being written as he lives his life) is sadly not consistently carried all the way through the film. All the best bits are in the trailer, and to be honest, so is about 50% of the plot. A lot of the rest feels forced and unnatural. The casting is mostly superb, except for Will Ferrel, who seems out-thesped wherever he goes. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as usual, but her character is sadly completely unconvincing. Where Charlie Kaufman populates his world with odd characters all of whom have a basic truth and credibility in them, Maggie Gyllenhaal here plays a character whose single purpose is to be the love interest. Her motivations are unconvincing, her development unbelievable, her entire character a slightly upmarket version of a Bond girl. Dustin Hoffman does his quirky I Heart Huckabees shtick, and Emma Thompson convinces as quirky writer (with an underutilised Queen Latifah as enforced assistant).<br/><br/>Sadly, the film just doesn't work very well. There are hints of greatness and originality, but that's all they are. Bits of good writing (sometimes even poetic writing) between minutes of average writing. Glimpses of great performances between hours of Will Ferrel. One cannot help feeling that, with a more experienced writer (read: Charlie Kaufmann) and a better actor in the protagonist's role (read: Jim Carey), this film could have been fantastic. Sadly, the ""could have been"" drawer is firmly where the film belongs, managing to remain average between the rare glimpses of genius, and all the more disappointing for it."

"kadoshsali","10","1","3","11 November 2006"," Excellent Film
","Stranger Than Fiction was excellent. The characters are well developed and strong, the plot -- superb and surprising, and the dialogue-- witty and true. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) seems, at the beginning of the movie, to be a stereotypical sub-genius living the boring lonely office life of a IRS agent. Yet, he is not introduced as a man who is tired with his life and he doesn't really go though some major midlife crisis, which one comes to expect with such characters of Cricks age. No, when he unexpectedly meets up with the knowledge of his own death, given to him by the third person omniscient narrator whom he hears in his one mind (Emma Thomson), Crick does not decide that he wants to live; he simply decides that he does not want to die.<br/><br/>At first glance, each character seems far fetch and overly rambunctious. But as the story unfolds the characters become real. The outspoken baker who wishes to express her political views in any way she can (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the eccentric novelist who has a terrible case of writers' block (Emma Thompson), and the infatuated and unusually wise English professor who tries desperately to find the fate of Herald Crick (Dustin Hoffman) are people that we have met and see often; they may even be our friends. And they do become our friends in this delightfully entertaining and surprisingly thought provoking film."
"Thibodeaux1999","10","1","3","11 November 2006"," From out of nowhere, an unforgettable film
","It took me all of 30 seconds to be completely attached to this film. The idea that all of those archetypal patterns we studied in school can apply to our own lives is only a small part of what this movie offers. You can look past it as simply a fun little film to go see (plenty of humor to please those looking for that surface-level comedy--which I am in need of sometimes, myself), but if you look at literature as an imaginative rehearsal for life, then you may see the ""life rehearsals"" in this film, too. I appreciate having a character who is completely unique, and yet an everyman at the same time. And I like how he blunders his way through the unfathomable predicament of being narrated. Seriously--I am afraid to think about what my own ""narrator"" would have to say about me. In fact, I'm hearing those voices in my head right now.<br/><br/>I like the intense look at these words ""Little did he know,"" because, honestly, think of how little we know about the next moments of our lives.<br/><br/>The character of the boy on the bicycle and the woman looking for a job--those characters represent the fate that we just don't hold in our lives. They come in and out of the film with such stealth that when they pop in, you suddenly remember that you had already forgotten them. Yet without them, an additional layer of meaning here would be lost.<br/><br/>The cinematography is artistic and worth the price of admission in itself, and the graphics here that are used to represent an entire personality are brilliant. Again, if you're interested in applying art (in this case, film) to your own life, you'll begin to wonder about your own graphics? What do they look like right now? Ferrell and Thompson provide outstanding entertainment--Ferrell, especially, because his timing in every respect (dialogue, physical comedy, facial expressions) are flawless. Thompson is excellent casting. I thought that Dustin Hoffman's role added a clever balance, though the symbolism of his role of lifeguard was a bit too in-your-face.<br/><br/>If there's anything that I didn't like about this film, it would be Queen Latifa's small but almost annoying role (very typical of her ""watch me break free from type"" intentions) and the glow of the watch. We could have done without that."
"xredgarnetx","8","1","3","11 November 2006"," Moving drama
","STF is a drama, not a comedy, about an IRS schmuck (Will Ferrell) who starts hearing a voice in his head. The voice belongs to a deranged author (Emma Thompson) who is suffering from writer's block and very slowly spinning a yarn about the schmuck with eventual plans to kill him, as she has done to the protagonists of her previous eight books. The schmuck understandably doesn't want to die, and goes in search of this mystery voice in his head. Along the way, he meets a winsome bakery owner (Maggie Gyllenhall) who helps him take charge of his own fate, more or less. Dustin Hoffman, sporting one hell of a Captain Kirk toupee, plays a coffee-snorting literary professor who helps the schmuck sort out what kind of story he is in, in order to figure out the author's identity. Hoffman is hysterical, Ferrell is tightly controlled as the schmuck slowly coming out of his shell, and Gyllenhall is just about the sexiest baker on the planet -- except for a really gruesome tattoo on her right arm, marking her feminist spirit. Linda Hunt has a tiny role as the schmuck's shrink, and an unrecognizable Tom Hulce plays the schmuck's strange human resources manager. A very good movie, but it is definitely not a comedy, even with quite a few laughs. So, as such, be prepared for a shock or two. The trailers for it stressed the few comic moments. The studio evidently did not want you to know it is a drama, along the lines of the director's previous STAY or that Malkovich movie with John Cusack or that Japanese hootenanny with Bill Murray."

","Stranger Than Fiction is a grown up story. It is a story of an everyman. We aren't given his childhood despair, we don't know how he became who he is, only the nugget that he doesn't like cookies. He could be any of us, who grew up and lost ourselves along the way. Will Ferrel is quiet, restrained, and deeply touching as Harold Crick. The movie of Crick's life made the theatre laugh, especially for those of us that got the literary jokes, but it reflects a lonely life too many of us know. Beyond the superb acting of Ferrel, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson, Ms Latifa and Maggie Gyllenhaal are appreciable side notes. This isn't a Charlie Kaufman film and it doesn't try to be. The fact that Crick is somehow the character of Emma Thompson's new novel is simply a structural element that allows us to see more deeply into his life. It begs us to ask who writes our stories and is our life worth the pages."

","Some concepts are just meant to be used for greater life questions. Think Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind or Donnie Darko. And then, there's Stranger Than Fiction. Even though the concept of a man knowing his fate might leave some scenario writers eager to explore the possibilities, the writers of Stranger Than Fiction just thought it was necessary to turn it into a tacky love story, with a very unsurprising end.<br/><br/>There's just too much wrong with this movie. Although it starts with a promising style, that style is quickly abandoned. Although the movie starts with the promise of creating a deep character, it quickly becomes obvious no psychology is included in this movie. The characters are flat and even though the cast is outstanding, there just isn't any magic between them at all.<br/><br/>Then, there's the love story.

","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at a comedic actor and really shows off their acting prowess in the dramatic talent. Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Will Smith have all made the cut, each of them earning critical acclaim for their performances.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction tells the story of hopeless Harold Crick stuck in a boring job, living in his solitary life, being imprisoned by his daily routines. He trundles along day after day waiting for his life to explode into action. One day he begins to hear a voice in his head. Is it god? A higher power? Someone is writing a story about every waking moment of his life and only he has the power to take control of it; to try new things, fulfill dreams and find love.<br/><br/>The revelation that something is changing occurs almost from the beginning of the film, so little time is wasted on establishing characters and setting. As a result the action begins early, and thankfully so do the laughs.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell's performance has been hailed as moving, touching, and in slyly humorous overtones. He gives one of his best heartfelt performances here with much restraint and self-loathing comedy. By the end though I wanted to see more from Ferrell instead of just the poe-faced, drab IRS auditor. His transformation could have been stellar showing off a palette of emotions. By the time it came to ""carpe diem"" for him I was let down a little bit by his sluggishness.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is charming, sweet and sexy in her role and she provides an attractive love interest. Her character in the film is a good ""opposites attract"" match for Ferrell and she has good material to work with in the film. Hoffman (as well as each of his films) as Professor Hilbert is marvelous and totally outshines Ferrell at times; is so natural and zany, pivotal to Harold's life changing actions.<br/><br/>I really wished we saw more of Emma Thompson's Kay Eiffel, the chain-smoking author of Harold's life experiencing writer's block. She is so believably wacky and eccentric, inhabiting her role. Unfortunately there was not much for her to work with and the character was not fully developed as I would have liked. Her assistant (Latifah) was underused and wasted and I felt did not bring anything worthwhile to the plot or the dynamic with Eiffel.<br/><br/>But the main problem I have with the film were the serious pacing issues, especially during the second half. There were some dead moments where the action didn't seem to move along even despite the commendable efforts of the fine actors. I felt the climax of the film was too drawn out and overdone and really lacked the wit and pace required in tradition with the film's subject matter. Forster tries to infuse humour into many scenes and downplays the score and tone of many scenes. However most of the time it comes out just awkward and lacking energy, ultimately I felt that the film slowed down terribly.<br/><br/>The story itself is a very Woody Allen-esquire premise with voice-overs, blurring between reality and satire and rantings on the futility and ridiculousness of modern life. I was expecting a really clever, witty and satirist comedy but in the end I really was a disappointed. The script lacked energy and bite, the dialogue should have been much sharper. Also given the fantastic cast, how could you go wrong?<br/><br/>This is a remarkable debut for this promising writer and another solid film for this versatile director. They had a fantastic cast that fulfilled their roles very well. But I felt that the script should have been much stronger and the editing was very flat. Still, a valuable addition to Mr Ferrell's resume and worth a look for the very intriguing concept."

","In the tradition of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, Will Ferrell, an actor know for his comedic talents makes the jump from comedy, to drama. He does a superb job and gives his best performance ever. <br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction is a movie about a man named Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). Harold Crick is an IRS auditor who lives a dull, solitary and deliberately predictable life that revolves around numbers. Little does he know that the only reason that he hasn't died is because a writer named Penny Escher (Emma Thompson) has writers block. She has been trying for ten years to find a way to kill Harold Crick. Harold is the main character in a book called Taxes and Death and somehow exists in the same world as the author. When he starts hearing a voice that narrates his life and foreshadows his future death he enlists the help of a literary professor named Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) to find out who the author is. In the meantime Hilbert suggests to Harold Crick that if his life his going to end he should make it the life he always wanted.<br/><br/>That suggestion is basically what the whole movie is about. Living each day like it was your last and getting the most out of life. It is exactly what Harold Crick attempts to do. Will Ferrell, in sharp contrast to his usual role as a crazy, obsessed and dimwitted character is now sensitive, interesting and dynamic. If he continues to star in roles like this one I would not be surprised if he got an academy award nomination. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and seeing how Will Ferrell matured as an actor. <br/><br/>On only a few occasions have I left the theater feeling so entertained. This movie was funny, exciting, emotional, uplifting, interesting, intriguing, touching and inspiring. It makes you laugh and think at the same time. All the performances are brilliant and powerful. The writing is flawless. There are parts where you will be on the edge of your seat and others where you will be basking in pure entertainment.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film.

"DICK STEEL","7","1","4","23 December 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Stranger Than Fiction
","Director Marc Forster has a really diverse filmography, with Monster's Ball, the touching Finding Neverland, and the science fiction thriller Stay, all under his belt. The trend continues with Stranger Than Fiction, a film which is quite difficult to categorize, as it's really a mixed bag, bringing memories of Adaptation (2002), along similar lines where fiction crosses into reality.<br/><br/>Will Farrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who lives live by the clock. Everything is precise, and he has this fixation with order. Some might term it obsessive compulsive, but that's the way this closet mathematician lives, doing seemingly mundane things like counting the number of brushstrokes when he brushes his teeth. His ordered life goes awry when he happens to start hearing a female voice narrating his life as it happens, and that is bizarre enough to freak out anyone since an ultimatum was issued.<br/><br/>I appreciate the parts where fiction and (screen) reality collide in some weird twists of fate, and contemplate moments where reminders about living life to the fullest, the way you want it to be, get drummed up in the narrative. Taking it to the extreme, it's about the power some of us wields over others, be it employer-employee, or master-slave, or relationships of such. Given that you have the ability to cause hurt, will you continue to go with the decision on the basis of the greater good, or will you seek out a win-win situation, or in less selfish cases, allowing yourself to back down on the negotiations? The closest I can think of when watching Stranger Than Fiction, in the event of the course of work we remove someone from a position, will you be emotionally detached and end your concern at that, or ponder what will happen to people around the victim?<br/><br/>Those expecting a comedy by virtue of it being a Will Farrell movie, will be severely disappointed. Similar to Ben Stiller's Night at the Museum, Stranger Than Fiction does contain funny moments, but these are not intentionally funny. It's filled with dark humour along the veins of fellow comedian Jim Carrey's Truman Show, with another being having supreme control over the life of the protagonist. But Will Farrell doesn't disappoint in his dramatic ability to carry the film through as the bewildered, desperate man, and that is essentially what made this movie, which plodded along at times, bearable.<br/><br/>Assisted by a strong supporting cast, it's perhaps one of the strongest this year end. It's been sometime since we last saw most of them. The script allowed Dustin Hoffman to make some references to The Graduate, and it's indeed since Meet The Fockers was he seen on the silver screen. Emma Thompson too, given the last outing she had was under heavy disguise and makeup in Nanny McPhee. Here, she's sans makeup most of the time, as the writer Kay Eiffel, suffering from a bad mental block. Queen Latifah didn't have much to do, while you'll probably be distracted by Maggie Gyllenhaal's huge arm tattoo, as she's the token eye candy in the movie.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction contains nifty special effects but it's something already seen before. The soundtrack is nice, but nothing memorable. That pretty sums up my sentiments of the movie. It's something, but yet something else at the same time, never being bold enough to stick to what would probably work better, allowing itself to surrender its potentially brilliant strength for a typical finale."
"Surecure","9","1","4","25 November 2006"," One of the best films of the year
","Stranger Than Fiction is one of those films that exceeds expectations. It is a beautifully crafted film in all regards with memorable performances, intelligently poetic direction and an absolutely spellbinding script.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise is the range that Will Ferrell brings to his role as a bland, unremarkable man who works for the IRS who finds his life flipped upside down when he begins to hear a narrative about his life. While he is certainly in his element in comedy, the dramatic demands of this film prove to be a feat well matched by Ferrell who left many in the audience I watched the film with in tears. This role certainly stands as a high mark for Will Ferrell and he certainly is to be commended for his work.<br/><br/>The script by first time film writer Zach Helm stands as equal a breakthrough in screen writing as Being John Malkovich was for Charlie Kaufman or American Beauty was for Alan Ball. His creative, narrative style is only matched by his skillful character development. The characters breathe and grow with the deftness of a mature writer and the well-paced plot moves with grace, something sorely lacking in the average Hollywood script.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is certainly one of the few easily recognized Oscar contenders for this year. It certainly stands likely to receive nominations for direction, screen writing and acting for Will Ferrell and for Dustin Hoffman who nearly steals the show. It is an easily recommended film that stands out as fresh and truly heartfelt, and the level of acting talent that the script attracted certainly speaks volumes as to how well written the film was."
"rudy-zung","8","1","4","14 November 2006"," A wonderful movie about fate, destiny, and mortality
","This movie was such the pleasant little movie, and shows Will Ferrel's ability to take on weightier dramatic roles far different from his old school Old School days.<br/><br/>At its heart, the movie is of Ferrel's Harold Crick, a go-nowhere IRS auditor with no friends, living a self-imposed regimented life of constant monotony, doing the same things the same way in the same sequence every single same day. Until one day, he hears the voice of writer Kay Eiffel (played by Emma Thompson) narrating his life, in particular a line of prose hinting his ""imminent death,"" whereupon his life take a turn away from the mundane. Faced with the certainty of his death, he seeks the owner of the voice in his head, and trying to divine whether the way he lives his life is influencing the narrative, or whether Eiffel's writing is directing the path of his life. In the midst of this, no longer fettered by his self-imposed boundaries due to his imminent death, Crick develops as a person aided in part by a renegade baker (in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal) and finally coming to grips with his mortality.<br/><br/>It may sound like this is a tragic movie of gloom, but in reality, it is a comedic tragedy, delivering humor in the unusual. This may be one of Will Ferrel's best and least annoying roles. Emma Thompson is wonderfully on the edge of breakdown as the death-obsessed author."

","This was a great movie. It started off pretty funny and it actually had jokes that weren't in the previews which is always a plus. Later, it took a gradual turn to a more dramatic direction which was unexpected, but not unpleasant. The acting was great. Will Farrel does a great job and so does Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. All the characters worked well together and it turned out really well. I didn't really listen for the soundtrack so I don't remember if it was good or not, but it definitely wasn't horrible. The story line is somewhat simple, but original and well done. I was really glad I went to see it and I would definitely recommend this movie. I'm going to buy it as soon as it's out on DVD."
"samseescinema","9","1","4","12 November 2006"," makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold
","Stranger than Fiction reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>In Stranger than Fiction, reality and the imaginings of a novelist are bridged by, of all things, a British narration; to be precise, the narration of Emma Thompson. She plays Karen Eiffel, a reclusive novelist struggling with an especially thick bout of writer's block. Her narration, clicked out on a typewriter in her huge, all-white apartment, is mysteriously transmitted to Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), whose every action coincides with Ms. Eiffel's words. His life has suddenly become a narrated event. This would only be a slight annoyance had Ms. Eiffel not foreshadowed Harold's tale with what she calls ""imminent death.""<br/><br/>It's a great and clever gimmick for a comedy; a gimmick that could gobble up a whole film without trouble and maybe drop in two years later for second helpings on the sequel. But Screenwriter Zach Helm isn't mining for gimmicks here. Just as soon as he settles in, about to rest on the laurels of his neat plot device, Mr. Helm gets back up and spins the gimmick like a top, letting its breadth span more than the silly expressions on Will Ferrell's face. His hero is a man of routine, one who counts out his steps and times his procedures with quick mathematics and numbers. He's lonely and seemingly mechanized, quietly unremarkable at his job as an IRS tax auditor. But amidst the distracting narration that now plagues his routine, Harold meets Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a grassroots tax-evader who rebels against the government with milk and chocolate-chip cookies from her independent bakery. Harold is assigned to investigate her case and, despite her publicly abusing him at her shop, he falls for her. His routine is thus changed, but his death still imminent. For counsel he goes to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on literary theory to work up a list of potential authors he might be channeling. <br/><br/>In the same way Jim Carrey sang two octaves lower than his usual high-pitched comic screech in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so too does Will Ferrell quiet down for Stranger than Fiction. It's not as though somebody pressed the mute button on Ferrell's antics; his performance is comfortably natural in all its quaint and charming awkwardness. He plucks laughs from the audience, but doesn't whore himself out for them like in this summer's Talladega Nights. Similarly, in her small role as Karen Eiffel's assistant, Queen Latifah turns in a thankfully understated performance. And finally, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal both shine hard and bright under the stereotype characters they're cast under. But great cast work is no surprise from Director Marc Forster. His previous filmsStay, Finding Neverland, and Monster's Ballhave churned out consistently stunning performances from all actors involved. <br/><br/>The only words I have for describing Mr. Forster's directorial prowess are a ""natural affinity for movie-making."" Like Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead), his films are driven invisibly. In synopsis and description they're hardly exceptional, but when seen, the films have a preternatural magnetism. They engage us inexplicably close and don't let go until they're through. With Stranger than Fiction, the draw is wonderfully human. It makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold and let the gimmick work its spinning magic until the whole situation has taken its whimsical turn. It's a wild and delightful success that hopefully won't go unnoticed this upcoming awards season.<br/><br/>Sam Osborn"

","I loved ""Stranger Than Fiction"" although I admit I went in with mixed feelings. I'm not a huge Will Ferrell fan, but I was intrigued by the premise of a life being narrated by an authorial voice.<br/><br/>I had seen enough previews to have my interest piqued, but then I read a few negative reviews. I generally trust the ""movie viewer's review"" over those of critics, but the mix of comments had me feeling a bit cautious as I plunked down my money for a Saturday matinée. I was very pleasantly surprised! Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are both delightful in this film--not that I would expect anything less from either of them. Maggie Gyllenhaal was also terrific. A restrained, less over-the-top Ferrell was also very good.<br/><br/>I don't know if you'll find a most original premise for a film, and I truly think it ""works.""

"superduperspit","9","1","4","12 November 2006"," Quite a memorable movie
","After huge success, many comedians feel they are atop the world, and as a result, try to branch their talents out to other genres (or sub-genres) of film. When it comes to a switch from the outrageous to the subtle in terms of the comedy, popular comedians such as Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, among a number of others, have mastered the switch seamlessly. Add Will Ferrell to the list, who trades in the over-the-top Ricky Bobby get-up of last summer's ""Talladega Nights"" to take on Harold Crick, the protagonist of ""Stranger than Fiction,"" which is, in itself, a fantastical comedy with streaks of drama here and there.<br/><br/>In the film, Harold Crick is a lonely, IRS agent. Hated unanimously because of his job, Harold has replaced the joys of life with numbers, meticulously plotting out every event of his day, from getting to work to tying his necktie in the morning. To put it simply, Harold lives a life of solitude; one that traditionally would not even bear a story worth telling. However, Harold suddenly gets a fantastical twist to his otherwise incredibly ordinary life: He has a narrator.<br/><br/>The narrator is Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric, chain-smoking novelist who is suffering from writer's block. As far as she knows, Harold Crick is just one of her characters, and she is desperately trying to find a way to kill him off to complete her latest novel, ""Death and Taxes,"" which may just end up being her masterpiece. After Harold hears a line saying ""Little did he know that these events would lead to his imminent death,"" he decides to find out what's really going on. He goes to a literary professor named Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who at first passes Harold's story off as nonsense, but becomes more and more convinced that what Harold is describing is really happening. All the while, Harold tries to figure out whether he is in a comedy or tragedy, most of that determination hinging on Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a rebellious baker who he first audits, but comes to fall in love with.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the most interesting thing ""Stranger than Fiction"" does is break down the elements of story by presenting its protagonist experiencing them on-screen. Creative innovation is strong from the earliest points of the film, as computer-generated structures surrounding Harold show what is going on in his head. ""Stranger than Fiction"" clearly has a premise that calls for a large amount of applied ambition from those involved, and in most spots, the ambition is melded with the pure talent of those involved. The script, written by first time screenwriter Zach Helm, is consistently clever and funny, and unknowingly plays off the skills of its performers.<br/><br/>The acting is another area where ""Stranger than Fiction"" particularly excels. As mentioned above, Will Ferrell manages the switch from the over-the-top to the subtle very well, as he believably plays Harold Crick. He is appropriately odd at the beginning of the film, and appropriately advances in tone with his character. Surprisingly, Ferrell manages to draw high-brow laughs as well as he does the simpler, less mature ones he has gotten out of moviegoers with such outings as ""Elf,"" ""Anchorman,"" and ""Talladega Nights."" The Ferrell in ""Stranger than Fiction"" is much different than the one audiences have come to know over the last few years, but it's worth mention, as Ferrell shines in his third attempt of more serious acting, following mixed results from Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" and this year's ""Winter Passing."" The other actors are on similar (or in some cases higher) ground as Ferrell in terms of performance. Emma Thompson is delightfully eccentric in the role of Kay Eiffel, as the actions of her character at first seem to have a twisted humor to them, but audiences soon come to sympathize with her and understand her intentions. A large part of Thompson's performance comes from the narration voiceovers, but she steals the show whenever she's on screen, as she does an excellent job with the brilliant-but-troubled character. Maggie Gyllenhaal continues her excellent year with the role of Ana Pascal, where she turns in a terrific performance. It would be a shame if her name fails to get mention at awards time, given this performance, along with her arguably more impressive turn in ""World Trade Center"" and her powerhouse leading role in the little-seen ""Sherrybaby."" Dustin Hoffman also gives a winning performance as Jules Hilbert, consistently getting laughs from the audience. However, Queen Latifah is unfortunately underused as Kay's assistant.<br/><br/>With ""Stranger than Fiction,"" director Marc Forster has yet another very different film to add to his resume of very differing genres. It's odd that he chose this as his follow-up to last year's immensely confusing thriller ""Stay,"" which followed the personal drama ""Monster's Ball"" and the whimsical tearjerker ""Finding Neverland."" Forster handles the action well, executing the very creative nature of the script and getting excellent performances out of everyone. Granted, it's not the best film on his resume (that honor belongs to ""Monster's Ball,"" with ""Finding Neverland"" also arguably being superior), but it's the kind of solid, well-executed entry that a number of directors would like to have.<br/><br/>If there's anything at all to complain about with the film, it's the ending. It seems very Hollywood-like, and that it may have been tweaked for the sake of getting the best word-of-mouth possible from common audiences. But to be fair, it's more or less a minor gripe, and one of just a few things that the film does wrong.<br/><br/>Through uniqueness, it's clear that ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a memorable film. Though it likely won't be the box office smash that ""Talladega Nights"" was, it will likely be remembered as one of Ferrell's best films. There's lots to love about ""Stranger than Fiction,"" and the film hits on target in just about every area.<br/><br/>Review posted by W. Slinger from http://www.boxofficefanatic.com"
"nickf-17","5","1","5","9 January 2008"," Don't believe the hype..
","Will Ferrell plays the lead here and unfortunately it doesn't work for him. I am a fan of his more slap stick roles, which he excels, but the dead pan state of Harold Crick in this is not something that suits his style. Hoffman and Thompson are good so too Gyllenhaal but they don't make up for a film that fails to draw in an audience.<br/><br/>The story line has true originality but you don't really build any empathy with the characters so in the end you tire of Crick's predicament and the film's sentiment is lost.<br/><br/>Films are subjective and everyone takes something different away from viewing. Friends of mine loved Little Miss Sunshine, others didn't get it. I think in the end this film will polarise audiences as some will really like it but many more wont understand the fuss.."
"skelman-2","4","1","5","14 August 2007"," A major disappointment
","I was expecting great things from this. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" has been lauded by the critics, but unfortunately it never lives up to its reputation. While Will Ferrell's performance is strong, the script suffers from a lack of true invention; its intriguing central premise is never fully exploited, instead becoming bogged down in the same old tired romantic comedy conventions. Ferrell's and Gyllenhaal's characters are so patently incompatible that their relationship never rings true. Dustin Hoffman plays another cookie cutter eccentric who's not nearly as interesting as the screenwriter thinks he is (see ""I Heart Huckabees"" for another example of this) and Emma Thompson's character is simply annoying, a stereotype of an ""important"" novelist who just comes across as maudlin and self-absorbed. Indeed, it is her character's voice over narration which robs this film of its credibility: she is supposed to be a novelist of major talent and importance, a writer whose work is the subject of academic study and fevered reverence; yet the language she uses in her narration is so full of trite clichés and amateurish idiom (she uses expressions like ""But little did he know"" and ""he found himself standing outside the building"") that anyone with even a passing interest in or knowledge of ""proper"" literature will find it laughable. The audience is asked to believe that she is Jane Austen when in fact she writes like a housewife who's taken one evening class in creative writing; a hugely irritating flaw which, for this viewer, almost rendered the film unwatchable. There are one or two striking visual moments and Ferrell's character is given a couple of funny lines, but on the whole this film is a major disappointment. It is as though, in attempting to give it a broader appeal, screenwriter Zach Helm has smoothed away all its rough edges. With an R rating and a good deal more imagination, it could have been truly innovative; instead it must go down as a wasted opportunity."
"terkoss","10","1","5","11 November 2006"," Restoring Faith in Hollywood...
","I went through a period where I hadn't seen a truly great film come out of Hollywood for several years. Last week, I saw Running with Scissors, and was glad to know that not all hope was lost. That film was made by people who really wanted to make something with lots of value. And I walked out of the theater thinking, ""that was the best film I've seen in years"".<br/><br/>Last night, I went to see STF, and had to revise my opinion...IT now was the best film I've seen in years (the former, being American Beauty). The heart and soul of the filmmakers showed clearly evident. No Hollywood sensory overload formula, no grabbing big name actors simply to get people in the theater (Must Love Dogs), no bland or predictable script (MLD again), no overacting (Crash), no red flags all over the movie, that read ""that would never happen in a world of fiction"" (Crash again) (if you can grasp what that means).<br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction was stupendous. The flow of the movie was perfect. It was one that sucked me in, and I stayed in.<br/><br/>The acting was in the top 3% of greatest achievable by man. Will Ferrell's performance was perfecthe's one of my favorite comedic actors, but transitioned perfectly to a subtle personality, believable, consistent and captivating (even better than Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), which I liked very much, as well as JC's performance).<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with Dustin Hoffman's performance. Another great actor, who went through a too long phase of Hollywood formula movies (Outbreak), where the acting was a 2nd priority in the production. Mr. Hoffman's performance in STF was spectacular. Relaxed, fully submerged in his character. Besides everything else I love about this film, I want to see it again just to see DH's supporting character role. Truly, I think this is one of his best films.<br/><br/>But all the characters in the film are to be applauded enthusiastically. Marc Forster's direction left no leniency for a non-fully immersed moment in any of the actor's performances (bravo to Maggie Gyllenhaal). Emma Thomson's character was refreshingly odd, but not overdone  just genuine. Brilliant work by all involved in producing the character of Kay Eiffel.<br/><br/>The plot was not simply a single great idea with a mediocre script. The flow was smooth, and ended perfectly. Never once did I find myself with any confidence of how it might turn out. I had no clue as to if or how he would actually die. And Kay Eiffel's reasoning for changing the ending (no spoiler here!) was impacting and a subtle climax of the movie, revealing much of the spirit of the filmmakers, let alone a very intelligently written script.<br/><br/>I surely hope that Hollywood throws this title in the mix of contenders come awards time. It clearly deserves numerous points of recognition. This film, like American Beauty, seemed to have little concern for pleasing anyone other than themselves. They were far too involved in making something great to be concerned by the aforementioned."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The endless run of previews for this one had me a bit concerned that it might be a comedy with 4 funny scenes - all of which appear in the trailer. I never should have doubted director Marc Foster, who has two excellent films to his credit: ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland"". As different as those two films are, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" proves Mr. Foster has a real eye for quality scripts, regardless of genre.<br/><br/>For anyone expecting a typical Will Ferrell film or performance, I say go in with an open mind instead. Ferrell is remarkably deadpan as IRS agent Harold Crick, who just so happens to also be the protagonist of novelist Kay Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest book. This is Ferrell's best performance on film to date.<br/><br/>The film is a bit quirky, but provides an excellent look inside the world of creative writing, while at the same time allowing us to question the daily process we go through in living our lives. ""Adaptation"" provided a look behind the curtain at the writing process and in this film the ""meet your maker"" theme is an added bonus as a nice thought provoker. What if the maker is really making it up as he/she goes? What if we have more control over our destiny that some would believe? <br/><br/>The three lead actors are all terrific. Ferrell as Harold Crick is like a blossoming flower as he discovers life with the luminescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (a baker - one who makes things for others enjoyment). Thompson is just outstanding as the blocked writer who always kills off her main characters and finally starts to question why. Few actresses would allow themselves to be filmed as disheveled and unmade-up as she appears here. Supporting work is solid by Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah (surely much of her role was left on the editing floor?), Tony Hale, Linda Hunt and an almost unrecognizable Tom Hulce (remember ""Amadeus""!).<br/><br/>A solid script, nice direction, wonderful acting and a very interesting theme make this an excellent film for most ages. Pay attention to the nice music provided by Austin's own Spoon."
"filmfan92","6","1","5","11 November 2006"," ""Stranger"", but not better
","Call it ""I Heart Huckabees"" for the average moviegoer. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a trippy dramedy about a drab IRS auditor Harold Crick ((Will Ferell), who discovers his life is being written for him, by uber-successful author Karen Eiffel (the hilarious Emma Thompson), which would be great were it not for the fact that she unwittingly plan to kill him off. Thus begins the quest to find the reclusive Ms. Eiffel and convince to alter the story. Crick is aided by a looney lit professor (Dustin Hoffman), and a rebellious tax-evading baker who he falls in love with. Sound strange enough? The script was fought for among the Hollywood suits, but I can't see why. Sure it's a modestly entertaining existential piece, ala ""Eternal Sunshine"", but not nearly the same caliber. The acting is excellent. The soundtrack is awesome (in my humble opinion, Spoon is the best rock band on Earth). The cinematography is beautiful. But ironically for such a sought after script, ""Fiction"" stumbles because of its writing. At times, the story becomes too trippy for its own good, trying to beat us over the head with its indie ""smartness"" and ""everything's connected"" storytelling that has become in vogue since ""Crash"" took home Best Picture. The story is fun and poignant until the end, where it trips over itself, trying messily to make ends meet and spoiling what began as a lot of fun. This film is worth watching, just rent it so you can turn it off before the final 20 minutes. Create your own ending. It will be better than the real one."

","I was recently given the opportunity to see a screening of ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a new film by director Marc Forster (who also directed the acclaimed ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland""). After seeing the many trailers for this particular film, I came into the crowded movie theater expecting another silly Will Ferrell movie with asinine jokes and situational irony around every bend.<br/><br/>Fortunately enough, this movie caught me off guard. Although it is categorized as a comedy under IMDb and other websites alike, I found it to be much more of a drama than anything else. I maybe laughed once or twice throughout the extent of the movie. I was much more enthralled in the story being unraveled through each reel, almost every scene filled with ingenuity and cleverness.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I see this film as Will Ferrell's best role in a movie. I had been beginning to see him as a continuous actor, always playing the same ""funny guy"" roles in every film. But he took a delightful turn in this as Mr. Harold Crick, a very structured and organized middle-aged man who follows a specific routine every day. I found Will Ferrell to be both humorous and charming in this certain role, and I believe he portrayed his character really well.<br/><br/>The other actors in this movie that I thought really, really stood out are Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman. Gyllenhaal, as the obnoxious yet delightful Ana Pascal, somehow managed to become the apple of everyone's eye even through her rather harsh façade. Thompson, as the kooky and exuberantly depressed Kay Eiffel, brought out a comic relief that was very refreshing from other films. Almost every scene featuring Thompson and the always splendid Queen Latifah are simply movie magic. Hoffman, as the eccentric and witty Prof. Jules Hilbert, was probably my favourite actor in the entire film. I shared his views and I thought he was amazing in his role.<br/><br/>Throughout the entirety of this movie, the plot thickens and thickens until you've begun to really feel for Harold and Kay alike, even though they completely contrast each other (you know, except for the fact that she's narrating his life). The ending is certainly one I will not forget, and I loved how everything pulled together for the conclusion.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" is definitely one you'll want to check out sometime, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.<br/><br/>8/10"

It proved that he can do a lot more than make us laugh, but he can touch our hearts as well.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it yet, but basically it's about an IRS agent named Harrold Crick who is stalked by the voice of a strange woman (Emma Thompson) who ends up being a famous author who just happens to have writer's block. The only trouble is she has a habit of killing off her heroes, and Harrold Crick just happens to be the same man in her story. I won't say much else, but I will tell you that you will laugh, you will cry, and you will be very touched. The acting is great, especially on the part of Maggie Gyllenhaal, whom I never saw act before but now really enjoy, as well as Dustin Hoffman, who is one of my favorites.

Many (might I say most) typical Will Farrell movies are a little over the top with easy slapstick, teenage boy laugh humor. This movie has a heart. Many of the great laughs don't even come straight from Will Farrell.<br/><br/>This is a vary subdued, laid back, well thought out movie, that progresses much like a well-oiled machine. Every movie usually has a love story of some kind in it, but even within the well-thought out main plot, at the heart of this movie, is a love story. It's not gooey or gushy, but a straight-ahead, nerdy guy becomes a man (and yes, in this one it works quite well) and falls in love.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie (and main plot) is that Harold Crick (a stuffy IRS auditor) starts hearing a female voice in his head, and it has a British accent. Yes, understandably, for the comic factor, no one else can hear it, but it seems to know him, narrating his entire life, just as he's living it. It drives him crazy. <br/><br/>First he visits a psychiatrist, and then, from there visits a literary professor, all in an attempt to get hold of his life, which is being torn apart from end to end, due to this voice in his head.<br/><br/>It turns out, Karen (played by Emma Thompson) is a well known author, writing a book. Each sentence she types is what Harold hears in his head<br/><br/>Of course, that, in and of itself is disturbing to him, but not as disturbing as what he finds out the author is going to do to him in the end of the book she's writing....<br/><br/>Gross out Factor - .5 (as they walk through a men's locker room, there are a few old man butts seen, very briefly) Profanity Factor - .5 (just a handful of words to get their PG13 rating) Sex Factor - .5 (just a little bit - no sexual nudity) Feel-Good Factor - 5 - all in all, after leaving the movie, I knew inside that I had a really good time and felt good about having seen the movie. I'd recommend it to 99% of my friends. It was definitely worth spending all of the 113 minutes in the theater."

","This movie is excellent. The beginning ties in with the end perfectly. There are very few inconsistencies. In a movie like this, you may thing that there would be extensive plot holes, but there aren't.<br/><br/>The wristwatch seems to have nothing do with the story, even though its promised in the beginning, until the very end. Its similar to Click, but more unique.<br/><br/>The special effects in the beginning are really good. There are parts that show exactly what the author is thinking through visuals. Its almost like you see her narrowing down possibilities until she gets to one. It makes you feel like Harold Crick was a character in the Sims computer game."
"educallejero","1","1","10","20 October 2018"," A difficult film to make. Maybe it shouldn't have been made?
","I don't even pay attention to this page ratings anymore. I read one long review with a positive score, one long with a really low score and one that is closer to what I think, and that's it. 7.6? This? Lol.<br/><br/>This story was probably really hard to make. It's kind of a really Nolan-like intelligent type of story, that plays with reality, time, and ever changing (or not?) destiny/end. And yet, the execution of this was so stupid, so ridiculous. I feel the producers and director just quit before even trying.<br/><br/>And even then, you can cast Will Ferrell and try to take the most humorous parts of the story and tell it that way. If that's what they tried, I just didn't see it, because I didn't laugh (not even chuckle) once. The movie takes itself completely serious even when scene after scene, the acting it's so bad for a realistic take, making it looks worse for itself, second after second.<br/><br/>I don't blame Will Ferrell in the least. He put his trust in Marc Foster and the casting director, and they let him down. A scene with Maggie Gyllenhaal in particular was so jarring to see. It was like someone mixed ""Anchorman"" with ""You've Got Mail"" and couldn't decide the tone they were going for so they just keep it like that instead of re shooting the whole thing."
"Turfseer","4","0","1","25 June 2020"," 2006 fantasy dramedy lacks internal logic
","With fantasy films, there needs to be an internal logic that makes the premise plausible. Usually an external event or character disrupts the protagonist's world, creating an alternative universe in which the protagonist must navigate and gain insight: Back to the Future (time traveling car), Wizard of Oz (malevolent tornado); It's a Wonderful Life (Guardian Angel). Stranger than Fiction lacks the internal logic of these other films; no alternative universe is created. Rather the fantasy character Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), the fastidious numbers crunching IRS agent, suddenly discovers he's part of novelist Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest novel and becomes a real person in her world! So the idea of the fictional character becoming part of the real world lacks credibility and reduces Crick to a character you cannot take seriously. Had it been the other way around, with Eiffel finding herself in the fictional novel she's been writing, that might have worked a lot better!<br/><br/>
Crick is depicted as a faceless bureaucrat, whose life is ordered by numbers. When he starts hearing Eiffel's voice in his head, he consults a couple of therapists to find out what's wrong with him but is eventually referred to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a ""literature expert"" who finally buys the idea that Crick has come to life out of the exertions of a novelist. It's a silly idea with a professor accepting such a nonsensical idea but this is the logic neophyte screenwriter Zach Helm has handed to us!<br/><br/>
The bulk of the film involves Crick's involvement with Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young bakeshop owner whom he must audit. It turns out that Ana has refused to pay part of her taxes in the last few years as a sort of protest against a cold-hearted government, which has failed to live up to her left-leaning, Socialist beliefs. Of course Ana ends up transforming Crick into a mensch, who dispenses with his number-crunching ways, and develops a ""personality.""<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, the big question is whether Eiffel will kill off Crick as she has done with her previous characters in all her prior novels. The publishing company assigns an assistant, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), to help her finish the novel (if you can believe that). Crick finally finds Eiffel and begs her not to kill him off but after consulting with Hilbert, he accepts the idea that Eiffel's outline (in which she kills Crick off), is ""just right.""<br/><br/>
Fortunately Eiffel changes her mind, and we're left with a happy ending, in which Crick survives and I guess becomes a real person (please ask screenwriter Helm how?). The diverse cast does its best with the flimsy material. That includes Ferrell in a more ""straight-acting"" role."

","I just wanted to submit a goof but don't see how to do it on the app. The bus collided with Harold at a bus stop!! This makes no sense. He clearly walked up to a bus stop eating his apple. There was already a group of people waiting at the bus stop. He jumps into the street directly in front of the bus stop (toward the front of the line) to attempt to save the biker. The bus would already be slowing to a stop as it approached the bus stop. The bus driver moans ""where'd he come from?"" This is lazy writing for a movie about a writer."

"shimenpf","6","0","1","6 December 2019"," Great idea, the execution could have been better
","I think the movie spends too much time in unnecessary dialogue, and doesn't quite build up for the final climax as it could have.
Also, for me, Harold's death would've been great if the kid he saved had a more important role in the story, either established before the incident or, even better, revealed after. It has been set-up for so long in the movie that the Eiffel's change of mind makes the climax underwhelming and disappointing.
But even the change of mind of Eiffel could've worked if we had been established earlier how important she was in the literary world of the story and how important her reputation was for her. Then, her changing the ending wouldn't only be saving a person's life, but actually sacrificing what she values the most to do it. We see she struggles to find that perfect ending, but we don't see how important it is for her and what she would lose if she doesn't, which means stakes.
The relationship between Harold and his romantic-interest is just too forced. She hates him and then, suddenly she doesn't. And she is not controlled by Eiffel so that wouldn't work as an explanation for it.
The idea is pretty good and there are some nice moments in the story, like when Harold is advised not to do anything in order to see if plot found him. The revelation that the watch didn't hace the right hour was also very good. The first act is pretty good at first, although it then becomes too slow and chatty. The bits of Harold and Dustin Hoffman's character trying to find out who the narrator is and what she's gonna do next are also very entertaining and definitely move the plot forward."

"jacobwspringer","6","0","1","12 October 2019"," Bad writing can't overcome good idea and decent acting
","How did such a blah screenplay get such a big cast? I don't understand Hollywood.<br/><br/>First, Dustin Hoffman is a true actor. Similar to DeNiro, when he enters the movie its quality and thus legitimacy immediately become viable. The movie is worth watching if you like these actors and/or creative plots. I appreciate movies that aren't remakes, copies, or just another sequel to some poorly thought out ""universe"". But if you're thinking of how to spend a Friday night this is likely not it.<br/><br/>Overall the writing is terrible. The idea of the movie is good and the themes and delivery are like a less artsy Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which is another movie that can't live up to its creative ideals. The music is even pretty good like Walter Mitty. Will Ferrell does a very fine job. Emma Thompson is pretty good, but the writing just keeps pulling her down. I honestly think she did what she could. Maggie Gyllenhaal is what she always is: average.<br/><br/>The isn't a feel good movie but it plays like one. If a movie like this isn't humorous, which it's not, then it needs a better screenplay to carry it. I imagine this would've been great if the Coen brothers or Wes Anderson had gotten a hold of it."

The actors were great (even Ferrell) and the story was great and shooting style was awesome. There's a great shot on a bus - look for it.

","So when the Dustin Hoffman character reads the story, he's moved by it and thinks it's some beautiful masterpiece. So let me get this straight. An IRS agent (Harold) with OCD follows the exact same regiment daily. He ends up auditing some chick from a bakery that he starts taking a liking too. He begins to hear that someone is narrating him, so he tracks down the Dustin Hoffman character who helps him narrow down the author that may be writing his story. Harold begins to live less regimented, he hooks up with the chick from the bakery, he tracks down the author who's writing his story. Apparently this is such a beautiful masterpiece that the story should really end with him dying? That's a masterpiece? How? Did they edit all the good stuff out of the movie? Now don't get me wrong, the movie is OK, but you want us to play along and pretend that this story is a bring you to tears masterpiece? I'm sorry I won't play along, my imagination only goes so far."
"CinePendejo","4","0","3","13 June 2017"," Kaufman-lite. Don't bother.
","If you know my style, ambiguous movies are always a scream for me. A film with so much subtext and inner symbolism gives me a lot to enjoy while dissecting and interpreting at different angles. The oeuvre of David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowski, Stanley Kubrick, and even Charlie Kaufman all live up to this notion, offering masterpiece after masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, there are some hackneyed films and filmmakers that shamelessly try to replicate that sort of style. Where they make a story buried in subtext and ""mind-twisties"" without any grace or intelligence to make it all work. A movie that thinks its soooooo smart with the subtext but winds up obvious and pretentious, and offers a unique universe that is barely explored beyond plot mechanics that make no f-ing sense. And said hackneyed filmmakers is Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm, and said film is STRANGER THAN FICTION, a stupid, bland, pretentious mockery of a Charlie Kaufman film without any understanding of what makes them great in the first place. It's literally ADAPTATION for morons.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel stars as a mediocre IRS agent living a normal life until a narration explains his everyday life like he lives in a novel. See, his whole life is orchestrated by this narrator, a real life author who makes great stories about troubled people. He suddenly hears her, and needs to find the narrator in person in order to understand his true fate.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting, but that's about it. There's literally nothing else underneath that beyond ""boy this sounds trippy, yo!"" There's no underlying subtext about the nature of authorship, no impressive visuals or symbolism, or any depth of this world beyond the surface level. All it does is illustrate how everyone's lives are like stories right down to the minute plot progression and arcs as if we never took 9th Grade English class! Even then, it's used no more than a guy loosening up, finding his fun inner self, and get laid to a spunky and rebellious girl in the end. Because WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ENOUGH ALREADY! This is another problem: the film tells waaaay too much of what should be shown. Subtext is way too much the text in this movie, in which characters blurt out what we should interpret on our own. Here's an example: one of the psychiatrists (played by a bored Dustin Hoffman, no doubt) suggest that this ""real story"" could either be a tragedy or a comedy. So Ferrell experiments this to aforementioned spunky rebellious girl in a bakery. She tries acting nice to him, but because he's a stereotypical stick in the mud, he rejects unintentionally. She reacted slightly unkindly, to which Ferrell notices. Had the scene end right there, we would've got enough information about whether or not it's tragic or comedic all on our own. But then it keeps going, with Ferrell comically saying ""You were being nice and I rejected it. I guess this ends in tragedy."" SERIOUSLY?! WHO WROTE THIS? Oh and it doesn't matter since they pork 20 minutes later anyway. Oh well. The whole film is like that, where it constantly holds your hand and expects you to be impressed by its genius. All I'm thinking about is ""JUST GET TO THE POINT!"" <br/><br/>But here is what really blows my horn. The narrator is supposed to be this high-class author who makes poetic movies about lonely man, and there is a certain recurring sequence of event of which they endure that truly makes it ""masterful pieces of work"" But as I sit there, I realize, ""well why does it matter if that event needed to happen to Ferrell and what kind of poetry to his life should be 'profound'?"" It's literally a boring life Ferrell's character is living in, and said event wouldn't make a damn difference at all. Its heavily emphasized in great importance that the inevitable event in his life that the narrator is constructing is what makes this ""story"" work, but I don't see a damn bit of difference at all! Not to spoil, but it makes no sense.<br/><br/>Even among the frustrating screenplay, everything else is all smack dab right in the middle of ""Not bad but not good"" section. The cinematography is uninspired, the actors merely act instead of conveying earned and true emotions, the color palette is drab, and the movie is overall a slapdash of clichés and fake emotional moments. I'm more than certain it has its fans, but I'm still hard-pressed to realize how anyone, who has seen at least ONE drama or ONE mind-bender"" in their lives, should like this."
"sharky_55","5","0","2","21 May 2016"," You're asking me to knowingly face my death?
","Has Harold Crick ever gone out of his way to talk to someone (let alone a female) that wasn't part of his daily schedule before the film's fated events? My guess would be no. There are plenty of people like Harold that exist in real life - those in the menial, day to day grind, who are ordered about by routine and a strict adherence to it. Their lives are unspontaneous and uninteresting. That begs the question, is it worth pointing the camera this way and crafting a narrative about one of these types? We never really find out. In Stranger than Fiction, Karen Eiffel has written a modern masterpiece on his life and all its rigidly compartmentalised sections, but finds that the only way to give it the ending it deserves is to kill Harold off. This might be meaningful if we were given enough reason to wonder why. Eiffel's omniscient narrator flows in and out of the story without any real guidelines. Forster picks and chooses the moments of the film in which a thoughtful and contemplative voice-over might add to the emotion, or clash with Harold's apparent nonchalance. Dustin Hoffman is introduced to attempt to explain the phenomena, but even he cannot define it except in the vaguest of ideas. The concept is left to flounder. The ideal that any masterpiece must end with tragedy is a cliché and trite one, as is Thompson's insufferable caricature of the tortured artist, the dishevelled and weary body language, the angst of writer's block, the hopeless pessimism. Not to mention there is nothing at all remarkable about her flowery, waffly prose - the film stands on this idea that her story must be finished, because it is a vital and important piece of work. But we rarely see much of it at all, and are given no incentive to believe that Harold's demise would go towards a bigger, artistic cause. We are forced to cheer for someone who only writes only joyless, morose tragedies (sorry, masterpieces) and then inexplicably has a change of heart. <br/><br/>The layering of the story, with Eiffel as the grand orchestrator and the narrative therefore altering depending on her mood, is something that the director might hide behind if the film draws criticism. What better method of dismissing any flaws by claiming they are the bland, uninspired ideas of the fictional struggling writer themselves? But at the end the film still manages to sabotage itself. Eiffel has presumably had a change of heart and wants to pen a more heartfelt, inspiring tale. That slow-mo montage with the sunshine and daisies and everything happy is as telling as it is. But where really is the change? Ferrell is played straight unlike his comedic man-child; too straight, in fact, because even as he throws himself in front of a bus or proclaims his love for the first time ever or even strums a guitar solo he is still the robotic character that has steadily worked its way through life all these years. There is no real motivation within but from Eiffel's pen, as if huge puppet strings are pushing him to do these things. Stranger than Fiction falls victim to its own clichés; it wants to portray real life as exciting and spontaneous as fiction, but ends up just re-visiting the same riffs over and over. There may be an intention to subvert somewhere hidden inside, but it is smothered by the simple existentialism crisis it presents and then quickly waves away. None of these characters have any substance and therefore agency to them. Ana is an uninspired caricature of the hippie that dropped out of college to start her own business - she has a few tattoos and wants to break tax laws because they are obviously some sort of government evil and that would go against her lifestyle. All it takes is a little guitar to make her jump straight into bed with a cardboard cutout. Though Harold Crick is let out of the cage to live his life, the film ironically is uptight - it doesn't allow for any other ending other than that overly saccharine, neat resolution. Many films have approached the idea of purpose and control within and outside the story. The Truman Show was one; that had visual meaning and layers that this does not. Adaptation was another, also about a writer unable to finish a story. But it did not take the easy way out."

","I tried going in to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with as little info as I possibly could. Really liked the begin and corpus. But the script let me down when the film neared its ending. <br/><br/>First of all: class acting. Especially by Ferell, Thompson and Hofman. I really liked how they played their rolls, they added to a very nice vibe throughout the film. <br/><br/>For the storyline; the mysterious vibe throughout the film kept me really interested. Instead of thinking it was all 'real' (meaning Thompsons character was like a puppet-player), I thought it was all in 'Karen Eiffels' head. Thought that'd give it a nice psychological ring to it. I thought Eiffel was indeed writing a book about someone hearing a narrating voice, guiding him towards his 'immenent' destiny. Thàt'd be good literature! Instead they kinda took 'the easy way out' in my opinion. The plot where Ferell knows he 'has' to die, was too cheesy for me. <br/><br/>The film had a high level of intelligent entertaining.

","If ever the discrepancy between real writing and screen writing were still moot this film makes it apparent, in a script which contrives to appear quirky, self-reflective, and because it is non naturalistic, contemporary, even pushing boundaries of narrative form in film.<br/><br/>While that may seem true to anyone who last read a book prescribed by their high school teacher, this movie is a derivative and arch work that has poached Borges, or Sterne, among others, for its motive and conceits and consequently the finished work is completely pedestrian.<br/><br/>The banality is compounded by a layer of trite homily suitable to a youthful, if inexperienced audience, about leading an authentic life. This element might have come from the counterculture but it is then reflected through bland corporate platitudes that have the effect of trans fats on the mind.<br/><br/>The shortcomings aside the director has done well, as has the editor, to realize the result. Likewise the actors manage quite well with the material they have, although it becomes more and more strained.<br/><br/>How this stale, hack, script ever saw production, let alone was lauded with awards, should be a cause for some soul-searching by all concerned."

","I got really geared up for this film before it was released. Had the makings of Spike Jonze doing a Douglas Adams novel with Terry Southern and Tom Stoppard as the screen writers. And the cast drafted, it had the Vegas odds of being a sure fire win. So why wasn't it? In two words - 'creative restraint'. What had the air of a 2hr 23min Woody Allen or Terry Gilliam art house masterpiece was brutally condensed, compressed, and compacted to run just a little more than a hour and a half. And even then it still seemed like it was too long. It starts off well enough, and draws the viewer in. But as the revelation and paradox starts to unfold, it gets sidetracked to this valiant and righteous love story. Which could have worked well enough on it's own without the superfluous and surreal pretense of this 'parallel universe' meanderings. But that's what I initially bought the ticket for. And was like sitting on a well inflated Whoopee Cushion with a delayed reaction. It was sitting high at first, and comfortable. And I knew something was going to 'go off'. But when it did, it was quiet and muffled and not at all the outlandish and chaotic hilarity I had hoped for. I just slowly sank in my seat disgusted while the old lady three rows behind thought it might be her emanating the rude expulsion - which this film rightfully deserves anyways. Too little with too much does not always equal cinematic merit. The box office receipts, and where did a hour and a half of your life disappear to is the true mystery of Stranger Than Fiction."

","Can you imagine your life as a story? Some people today may relate to certain stories that authors have written, but what if you were living a story by an author you didn't even know. Imagine hearing voices in your head narrating your life. The voices would be telling you how many steps to take to the bus stop, how many times to go up and down when brushing your teeth, and even predicting your death. This is exactly what Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) was going through.<br/><br/>Crick, who worked for the IRS, auditing people who didn't pay their taxes was living a non-fiction story. Everything he would do was being controlled by a voice, and the creepy thing was he had no clue who this was. Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) was the author who was writing the story of this man's life. Mr. Crick tried to go about his daily life and keep his mind off of it as much as possible. The next assignment he would take part in would change his life forever. He had to audit Ana Pascal's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) bakery. The first day after working on her taxes all day, he was love struck by this girl who he was auditing. When he was about to leave for the day, Miss Pascal stopped him and demanded he have some cookies. Harold didn't want the cookies and refused to have them for free because he couldn't be ""bribed"" by the person being audited because it was against the IRS rules. He was as ravenous as a pig and later accepted them.<br/><br/>The couple fell in love with each other swiftly. They soon started to hang out more and more. Ana could also see how Harold's life was controlled. She asked him a few times about it and Harold told her he hears voices and convinced his life was a book waiting to be written. Whatever this author would write or type in this book (which was Harold's life), would instantaneously happen to Harold. <br/><br/>Harold also had a wrist watch which he would keep a close eye on because it kept his life on track. He would know exactly what time to get to the bus stop or how long he had been brushing his teeth. The watch that had kept his life on track was also the piece that would save his life. In the end, Harold tries to find the author who is writing his life. He ends up finding her and explaining the whole situation about writing about his life and told the author he cannot die. Karen didn't believe it all at first, but then figured out it was true. She didn't want to ruin her writing career just because of a bad ending. She ended up writing the story ending about Harold getting to his bus stop that morning a bit earlier, and then saving a boy from being hit by the bus. Harold was injured bad, but lived. The watch that he once used to control his life, ended up saving him from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>I personally liked this movie myself. It had a very steady, normal plot line to it which made it easy to follow. There was also a good amount of humor in the movie as well, I mean it has Will Ferrell! It's like pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving, it's good. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good movie!"

Harold had lived this way for years, until one day he woke up to a strange voice that seemed to be narrating his own life.<br/><br/>One morning, he awoke to the familiar sound of his wristwatch chiming.

He could not tell where it was coming from. He then took out his toothbrush and the voice suddenly stopped. With a puzzled look on his face, Harold Crick started brushing his teeth again, but soon got interrupted by this strange woman's voice. He rushed through brushing his teeth and listened intently to this voice. Where was it coming from? He did not know. His wristwatch chimed again, signaling to him that it was now time to get dressed for the day. Harold wore his usual dress shirt and pants with a suit overcoat and a dark blue tie. The voice had gone away up until the moment he had started to fix on his tie. The woman's voice seemed to be telling Harold how to put on his tie.

After hurrying through his morning routine at home, Harold then listened to the woman's voice narrate his life as he made his way down the sidewalk towards the city bus. The voice told him how many steps to take, where to step and precisely the exact time he would arrive at the bus stop. He was still thoroughly confused at this newfound voice that had seemed to creep its way into his every day life.<br/><br/>I very highly enjoyed this movie. The plot kept me very entertained and it was interesting to see how Harold Crick reacted to this strange voice that was guiding him. We were able to see his life go from an every day routine, to completely incorrigible. The story structure took a turn when Harold started to fall in love with Ana Paschel. I certainly did not see this coming and I don't think anyone else did either. I highly enjoyed the story structure as a whole. This movie keeps you entertained, while also adding just the right amount of emotion so we're able to really feel what the characters are feeling. This movie is full of emotion. Happiness, confusion, even complete sadness. Harold soon has to come to the realization that he is going to die, and this is when the movie takes a turn for the worst and becomes very sad. I was able to feel for the characters and this is one thing I really liked about this movie. I also liked the acting in this movie. The actors and actresses chosen to play these particular roles really bring this entire movie to life. I think Emma Thompson played Karen Eiffel very well. In this movie, she is portrayed as a quite depressed person. All of the books she writes end in death and she is not known to write anything positive. Emma Thompson was able to make her character seem dreadful, and have a look about her that says she just doesn't even want to be on earth. I also liked Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick. In this movie, Harold is supposed to be portrayed as a serious character. He sticks to the same routine every day, does the same thing every day. When he is able to hear the narrator, he tries to go against some of the things she says in order to try and change his fate, which is ultimately death. After seeing this movie, I have decided that Marc Forster is one of my favorite directors. He was able to capture many different emotions in this movie, and that is what I like in order to keep myself entertained. He also seems to have a natural eye for picking out just the right actors and actresses to play the perfect characters.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this movie. It had a wide variety of characters. From the serious Mr. Crick to the hard headed Mrs. Paschal. The plot line was very interesting and kept me watching intently through out the entire movie. I never once found myself looking at the clock wishing when this movie would be over. To me, this movie has a very abstract feel to it. I recommend this movie to anyone who definitely likes emotion when watching a film. I found this movie to be so full of emotion, I was stuck wondering how the director managed to fit them all into a two hour segment."

","I always thought Step-Brothers was Will Ferrell's best movie but boy was I wrong. It was very humorous with a nice touch of romance and a ton of drama! I had not heard of this movie actually until just a few weeks ago and was insure whether or not to watch it but I'm very pleased to say that I give it two thumbs up. I was very moved by this movie and it got me thinking, what if your life was like a book. Your fate being controlled by a writer who knows nothing about you, or even the fact that you are a real person. A truly original film that really draws you in from the beginning and keep you laughing and in a great mood. It has a star-studded cast and great all around acting a definitely worth the watch."

Will Ferrell is fine as the lead in a difficult role and I enjoyed every moment the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal, looking younger than ever, was on screen. Difficult to describe without giving all away but if this is not quite, laugh out loud comedy, it is certainly, smile all the way, comedy. Some great lines and some thoughtful ideas, indeed this could be taken as pure silliness or a more serious existential exploration of life and death and the bits in between. Light and airy with something more solid as an optional extra."

","This is a pretty engaging movie. For me Will Farrell is really up and down. I would generally consider him pretty lightweight. This film, however, shows that he has a great deal more range than I've given him credit for. Once we accept the premise of the whole thing, he begins to engage us. His plight is certainly one of great urgency. What I enjoyed was that they didn't play it for a sense of slapstick. Some filmmakers would have used the author's touch to put him in all kinds of ridiculous situations, finding himself naked on a street, or hooked up with some street gang, or some other ludicrous thing. He come off as a truly developing character who probably does what most of us would have done. Granted, he is a quirky IRS agent with symptoms of OCD, but the story is about what happens when you begin to realize how precious life is. It's been done a million times, but here it works quite well. It doesn't even matter that the writer painted himself into a corner because the joy of the movie is watching Farrell's character commandeer his ship. Emma Thompson's character is just a bit much; so is Dustin Hoffman, but they are certainly interesting."

","I absolutely love Stranger than fiction. Which to me is Will Ferrell's best movie. I mean I loved Anchorman but Stranger than fiction is just an amazing movie. To this day, people sometimes say"" Everyone expected that movie to be really funny and it wasn't"". Well, clearly not everyone expected it to be a comedy. I didn't expect it to be a comedy. what I expected was a fantasy film and that's what I got. This film is from director Marc Forester, who directed the damned good Quantum of Solace and Monster's ball. Stranger than fiction, to me, is probably his best film ever. Stranger than fiction is deep magic and I love it. I think everyone in the film does a great job. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal, who was Katie Holmes's replacement in The Dark Knight. I think she was better than Katie Holmes. Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't really pretty, but she can act alright. Will Ferrell gives a different performance which perhaps isn't as good as Ron Bergundy but I like this movie more than Anchorman. Dustin Hoffman is pretty self explanatory, of course he was great. If it was Meet the Fockers, Tootsie, or Mr. Magorium, Dustin Hoffman sure can act. Dustin Hoffman is awesome. Also, Queen Latifah isn't given too much to do here, but I still liked her. Because she's Queen Latifah. Last but not least is Emma Thompson, who, behind Meryl Streep, is my favorite actress. Emma Thompson is great as Karen Eifel. Stranger than fiction is an emotional masterpiece. I love Stranger than fiction, and you should too.<br/><br/>The Plot: In every one of Karen Eifel's books, the main character dies in the very end. Eifel soon starts writing a book about a person named Harold Crick. Harold Crick actually is a person. So any time he does something, he hears her voice. It soon starts to drive him insane, and he soon realizes that his life is coming to an end."
"MonkeyDonut69","8","0","1","28 June 2009"," A surprisingly thoughtful, affectionate movie
","I have often been told that you should never base your review of a movie on your initial screening of it. First of all, since you do not necessarily know what is going to happen next, you tend to overlook certain nuances simply because you are following the story or trying to figure out what is going to happen next. For the second and subsequent viewings, you are able to notice more in different areas because you aren't so focused; you might even see something you missed on the first go around.<br/><br/>Sadly, I have only watched this movie once; however, I can confidently give this an 8 / 10 rating because it had a profound effect on me while watching. Afterwards, I thought about it for quite awhile. I even thought about buying a guitar because I always wanted to play a musical instrument.<br/><br/>To me, this movie is about discovering yourself and making a choice to actually 'live' your life as opposed to only being a part of it. The movie's main character, Harold Crick, lives a mundane and structured existence, one in which his everyday actions are planned and timed to the very second. He is a lonely and bored accountant for the IRS who doesn't really know how lonely and boring his life actually is. Everything changes, however, when he begins to hear a voice in his head paraphrasing and describing his actions and thoughts. His annoyance with the voice turns to fear when the voice mentions that he will soon die. Harold seeks out the help of a local college professor played by Dustin Hoffmann to figure out who it is that is authoring his life. The struggles continue as Harold and the professor try to discover who the author is and what kind of story he is actually in. Contributing to the stresses are several life-changing experiences including meeting a very difficult audit case in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>I thought Will Ferrell was great in this movie. He really had to play a different part from every other movie he has been in. This was not a slapstick comedy by any means; this is a very thoughtful and affectionate movie about a person discovering himself and what his purpose in life is.<br/><br/>The voice overs by the 'author' are eloquent and the 'help' provided by Hoffman's character is funny but acceptable. Sure, there is a certain amount of disbelief that has to be given for this movie to even exist, but the premise is original and is executed perfectly. I felt for Harold's character and felt myself hoping for positive resolutions in his life.<br/><br/>The story, acting, and originality carry this movie very far. I am really glad I was able to watch it finally and hope that it stands up after the second viewing. 8/10"
"solacewaves","9","0","1","21 October 2008"," An intelligent mood film that begs the question...
","Why aren't there more films like this? I'll be up front, I am not a Will Ferrell fan. In fact I find his comic shtick on things to be over the top, totally ludicrous and thus not funny. And this may very well be why some people hated this movie. If you're expecting a Will Ferrell vehicle along the lines of ""Blades of Glory"" or ""Talladega Nights"", then you will find this film very disappointing.<br/><br/>Others hate this film because they find the whole premise boring and all I can say to this is I believe this type of movie calls for the viewer to be in a certain type of mood. And this is where the film can cause a bit of confusion; it's not really a romantic comedy, it's not really a silly comedy, it's not an out-and-out drama, it's definitely not an action flick. Because it doesn't fall into a specific category, people unsure whether to watch this film may create preconceived ideas which ultimately result in them not enjoying it because it wasn't what they expected (i.e. their mood was for a specific type of flick and ""Stranger than fiction"" didn't fit into that category).<br/><br/>It's also a film that I strongly recommend you watch without interruptions. If your attention is not firmly fixed on the subtleties and intricacies of the character development and plot then you'll lose the overall effect of what this film tries to deliver. And what this film does deliver in spades (if you let it) is the idea that no matter how alone you might feel, you can find love. And bravery, hope and courage can come from the most unexpected of places.<br/><br/>I saw this movie without any idea of what it was going to be like. I found it to be the surprise film of the year for me. The characters are all colourful and have layers of depth that come forth the longer the film goes on. But really the story is where it takes it from a 7 or 8 to a 9 out of 10. I'm all for the ""brainless"" movie every now and then; I'm a big fan of the action genre and enjoy the ""there's no need to think through this movie""-kind of flick. But during a time when box office success seems to mean ""more special effects"" less ""substance"", it's wonderful to see a movie that not only has a bit of thought in it but also a heap of substance.<br/><br/>Class performances all round - Ferrell as Harold Crick is a revelation, Maggie Gyllenhaal (marvelous as usual), Dustin Hoffman (underrated humorous turn) and Emma Thompson (can drain drama out of a stone) are all casted wonderfully. And lest we forget I would like to make a special mention to the undisputed hero of the film, I won't actually identify this character as it would spoil the film but I will say Harold Crick's sidekick brought a smile to my face by movie credits end."

","Not a horrible movie.. but it's just.... awfully average; almost like a monotone flat beep on a heart meter at by the hospital bed.<br/><br/>It started out decent (think ""Adaptation"") but this movie's lack of any cerebral storyline became soon apparent: it's paper thin. The premise felt more promising during the trailer but this feeling did not translate into the actual film itself. There is simply nothing beyond the initial ""gimmick"" that we already know before hand.<br/><br/>Good acting all around but I felt Hoffman's part was written poorly (wooden). All of the characters were quite cliché (zero depth), even Will Ferrel's own character who is supposed to go through trials and errors and becomes a new man: ends up becoming exactly what everyone would expect him to be in a cliché movie. You can smell the outcome of each scene from a mile away. There are no surprises. Quite frankly I felt disappointed.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***When Will is confronted with the book author, the whole sci-fi main gimmick was somehow ""accepted"" in the reality of the movie by the lead actors.***SPOILER*** The use of CGI and little cartoon logos further distracted any reasonable amount of seriousness from the movie. Nothing felt really significant. By the end it was obvious that it became dragged on its last leg as nothing else beyond the basic storyline from the trailer was to be fleshed out. It's an attempt at an ""artsy"" sort of film but ends up being no Picasso; in fact it's more like a $5 coloring book one can buy at Walmart with Spider-man doing cool looking poses.<br/><br/>How this ended up being nominated for so many things is beyond me. Perhaps it is more important these days to have a film that LOOKS artsy (""sophisticated"") and employ well-known A-listers, rather than making sure there is a meaningful story to be told first."

","Along the ideas found in films like ""Sliding Doors"", ""Waking Life"" or other alternate/parallel realities, this one slowly pulls together instead of tearing apart. Unfortunately, as it pulls together, it loses much of its wit and edge. It becomes less interesting, frankly. Will Ferrell does a fine job of being subdued yet comedic, Maggie Gyllenhaal is not tested in her role, Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as a neurotic author with writer's block, Dustin Hoffman straight-faces his way through as though he were a responsive version of ""Rain Man"", and Tom Hulce and other stars round out the cast. The decors are a little too consistently hip to be seen as individualistic (the set designer paid less attention to the characters than to his/her own interests), and the scoring seems pasted on. Once I caught on to the story's movement, I reasonably guessed the ending, due to the romantic angle. It's an okay film. It's not great, it's not awful. It's entertaining, asks you to think for the first ¾ of the story, and slowly lets you off the hook. I like more challenge than this one presented."

","Twist Endings have always faded in and out of popularity over the decades...recent movies, from ""The Usual Suspects"" to ""Fight Club"" to the first ""Saw,"" usually bank on a curveball in the last act that aims to redeem something seemingly conventional with a forehead-slapping plot development. In the world of ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" the ""twist"" is done with such earnestness and honesty that part of me felt bad in not completely accepting it; there is a palpable dramatic swell, after which we cut away to What Really Happened. I guess any movie that casts Will Ferrell as a bland-as-cardboard IRS auditor looking to seize the life he's wasted deserves some consideration, especially in its third-act machinations. Ferrell plays the painfully-named William Crick, who lives a life of routine (counting teeth-brushing strokes, for instance), until one day he begins to hear a woman narrating his life (including a budding relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaal); turns out he's unwittingly become the main character in reclusive author Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) new novel. The catch? Eiffel's lead character always dies. While ""Fiction"" is modest in its exploration of existential matters, the randomness of its premise comes off as gimmicky; while director Marc Forster (""Finding Neverland"") keeps things moving along with a sense of purpose (though the superimposed diagrams that occasionally flash on-screen are a distracting miscalculation), Zach Helm's screenplay barely rises above convention. Ultimately, ""Fiction"" is a case of the performances really selling the material: Ferrell is quite good in a quietly funny and believably dramatic role; Gyllenhaal is plucky and spunky as his love interest; Thompson communicates a wonderfully wiggy, stress-fried persona; and Dustin Hoffman shines as literature professor who helps Harold with his predicament."

","This is not another Will Ferrell comedy. He actually tries his hand at drama here. It is different type of film for Ferrell; however, we have seen films like this before. Such as Jim Carey in the Truman Show. Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent who wakes up one day and hears a voice describing his life. He thinks he's crazy as well as others. He visits a doctor but doesn't want to take medication. So, he goes to see an English professor. He describes what the voice says and how poetic he sounds. One day at the teachers office, he sees an interview on the TV of an author who sounds exactly like the voice in his head. He tracks her down and discovers she is writing a book and he is the central character. She writes tragedies, but he asks her not to kill him off. There is a side plot of him falling for a baker whom he audits. Not really a whole lot there.

"Adrian_Atkins","5","0","2","29 August 2007"," A Fair Effort
","Stranger Than Fiction is a fair attempt. The premise is very appealing but ultimately one gets the sense that it is a gimmick. One gets the sense that the book Emma Thompson is writing is superior to the movie we are watching. If so, then why not make a movie on that?! And why not kill Will Ferell if that is ultimately the path to greatness. The film would rather hang in its own cleverness than dare step into a more profound terrain. It is conscious of what it is trying to say and thus reduces itself from being true art. It over-simplifies everything by imposing its sentimental and simplistic message and spelling out its themes. It doesn't simply let things be as they are. The world is far more complex and fascinating than to be reduced to this paint-by-numbers storytelling. And given its literary awareness, that is hypocritical.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is bad. Her acting seems affected and is somewhat irritating. And when she meets Will Ferrel in person, she acts so theatrically that it is hard to believe. Added to this, this event doesn't follow the logic of the film. How is any of this possible? And when I say possible, of course I don't mean the whole premise, because any premise is valid - they simply must remain consistent to their own machinations - and this one doesn't. The direction is uninspired. The shots are uninteresting and obvious. The attempt to create a surreal world through white clinical sets and baron spaces is not consistent or fully explored through mood.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal turns in a fine performance although I find her attraction to Will Ferrel a little difficult to buy. What is it that she suddenly finds attractive in him? Also, the theme of a person not living their life because they are such an exaggerated ""by the clock"" rigidly organised person is such a clichéd example of a person not living. In order to truly live, one does need structure and discipline, so these are not the things one must give up in order to be free. A simplistic notion.<br/><br/>Finally, Will Ferrell himself just isn't a good actor. He is always ""acting"". His persona never comes through by allowing himself to ""be"". Although he has toned down his theatrics, what is left is a blandness that, yes, suits the ""character"" but also renders the character rather one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction undoubtedly draws its parallels or influences to the work of Charlie Kauffman, particularly Adaptation. But without the depth and flair of Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry, we are left with a paper-thin, uninspired lackluster experience that not even the always terrific Dustin Hoffman can redeem. 5.5 out of 10."

","Having seen the trailer for this film, I was moderately interested in how it would play out. Having seen the film, I am quite disappointed. Will Farrell is yet another SNL grad who, for my money, should stick to sketch comedy and films that mimic that short-attention-span genre, ie. Anchorman. I really liked the notion of a character discovering that his life is a fiction produced by someone else's imagination. I think there's a lot can be done with that. But this film didn't manage to do that much other than make it a cute comedy with a few clever lines. Maggie Gyllenhall is completely unbelievable as an anarchist; check out her apartment. Dustin Hoffman is on auto-pilot. Emma Thompson seems to have picked up Kenneth Branagh's taste for chewing scenery, and Queen Latifah looks completely bored. Poor acting, a half-baked (pun intended) script. Oh, by the way, it isn't Monty Python and the Holy Grail that you see on the television, it's the infamous Mr Creosote scene from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. I've never been a big fan of Charlie Kaufman, but this disaster puts his skillful handling of similar narratives into sharp relief."

First there's Gyllenhaal's Ana. An anarchist running a oh-so-cool bakery, who then falls remarkably quickly for the nerdy, uptight IRS guy. Next there's poor Latifah, brought in to close a book buy getting the author to kill the character, an intriguing premise, but she doesn't do anything. These two characters are crucial to the plot, but they are in the end simply devices, ironic since this is supposed to be the author's (Thompson as Eiffal) masterpiece."

","Will Farrell is in a new avatar. Is this the turning point of his career? Time alone can tell. But not for Harold Crick. His life is being controlled not by time but by a tragedy writer Karen Eiffel. Her fiction is his life. Harold is tied up in a routine and going through his life lonely and unaware, until he realizes that he is a part of somebody's storyline.<br/><br/>This film is an example of how incidental cruelty is acceptable in cinema but obvious cruelty is not. Harold Crick could have died at the end but cannot because the viewers are already told he is going to die untimely and unnaturally. From that moment on, the viewers knows that Harold won't die but the question is how will he survive. This is an intelligent way to implicitly engage the viewers in the opposite of the actual proceeding all the while and at the end surprise them with what they already expected. It is traditional, but still a challenge for the writer and the director.<br/><br/>Zach Helm does not complicate the story though he had all the opportunities. He does not focus on the events but on their impact. The idea, I guess, is to capture the helplessness and resignation when somebody already knows what is to follow. Bill Murray was in the same state in The Groundhog Day. Surprising the response of Murray's character and Harold's are very similar. They accept it and wait for it to end, whenever and in whatever manner.<br/><br/>Will Farrell fits Harold like a glove. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are seasoned actors and deliver what you expect from them. Maggies Gyllenhaal is good but her character is very predictable."

","The central idea of 'Stranger than Fiction' is an increasingly fashionable one in movies at the moment: that an individual suddenly becomes aware of their existence as a character in someone else's book. This idea can be milked for straight comedy, or used to ask profound questions about the nature of existence or writing. Unfortunately, 'Stranger than Fiction' has some value as a straight rom-com, but meets all the expectations of the clichés of the genre, and while this is part of the point, the story is insufficiently clever to render this a satisfying conceit. More seriously, the film asks no profound questions about life or literature whatsoever. In one scene, for example, Dustiin Hoffman's professor takes an interest in the case because the narrator has used the expression ""Little did he know..."" - ""I've written books on 'Little did he know'"", says Hoffman, but there's no discussion of what he might have written about this formulation. And above all else, Emma Thompson's author is meant to to be a brilliant writer, but the excerpts we here from her narration are so uniformly dreadful that the pretence cannot be sustained: if Will Ferrall's character has a justifiable complaint, it is not at being a character in a novel per se, rather being caught in a story so bad. Moreover, nothing about the writing process as depicted convinces. As the film fades into a feel-good ending, I was left feeling cold: there's nothing in this take on the theme that adds anything to previous treatments."

","I often find Will Ferrell hard to watch, because I get tired of his comic schtick very quickly. But his role here as Harold Crick is totally different, and I found him very enjoyable. Much as Jim Carrey or Robin Williams playing serious roles. Crick is an IRS auditor and a person who lives alone in a very sparse apartment. In fact, it looks like a motel room. He does everything with a purpose, a certain number of tooth brush strokes, a certain number of steps to get to the bus stop without wasting any time.<br/><br/>One morning he hears a voice narrating his activities, as if it were being read from a book. Every detail. The voice is Emma Thompson's as famous novelist Karen Eiffel, but only he can hear it. She is writing a book with a main character named Harold Crick, and is stuck, not sure how to end it, not certain how to kill Harold Crick.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman is Professor Jules Hilbert who tries to help Crick sort things out, in often very funny ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal is bakery owner Ana Pascal who is being audited by Crick, and of whom Crick begins to take a liking. So he brings her a dozen flours (not flowers). Queen Latifah is good as Penny Escher, the assistant that the publisher sends to Eiffel to help her meet the deadline.<br/><br/>The whole movie is good strange in the same way that 'Being John Malkovich' is good strange. You know this can't really happen, but it is fun to think 'what if.' The whole movie is about whether Crick can survive his being killed by the author, whose narration appears to be accurately describing everything about Crick and his life. Also, whether Crick and Pascal can make romantic sparks.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. There is a scenario written where Crick will be killed by a bus as he tried to rescue a young boy who darts out into the street on his bike. But after Eiffel meets Crick, and now has a real person in her thoughts, she cannot kill him as she would a genuinely fictional character. So she re-writes the end, he saves the boy and only gets injured badly, and he and Pascal become a couple."

","Will Ferrell temporarily withdraws from his usual comic shtick and persona to play the predictably dull IRS auditor, Harold Crick, in Marc Forster's ""Stranger than Fiction"". One day this man of rigid ritual, who literally sees the world through its system of numbers and dimensionality, hears a voice narrating his every basic movement. His quest to find the producer of that voice leads him bumbling through a number of encounters, including one with an attractive theoretical anarchist played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and a literary expert played by Dustin Hoffman. The performances are strong, especially Will Ferrell. His performance here resembles everything his standard work does not, with the surprising exception of a few overtly innocent moments during ""Elf"".<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in this sophisticated film that makes sharing too much of the premise feel like taking away part of its charm, while on the other hand sharing that same premise is exactly why most people would care. There are echoes of the Charlie Kaufman penned ""Adaptation"", with its meta-cinema presentation and it's spot-on analysis of the schizophrenic mental state of a writer. As taken through the always dependable lens of director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball"" & ""Finding Neverland"") first time screenwriter Zach Helm's script is a well-executed, intelligent, and clever piece of storytelling. The third act drags on too long, but ""Stranger than Fiction"" is still a refreshing, original work."

I still give it a 6 because I enjoyed the premises and I loved how Karen was crazy and so morbid. I was reminded about how Dickens said that after writing a book the author got to know the characters so well that it has hard to leave them after months (or years) of them being some of the most important people in the authors life.

","Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent obsessed with numbers. He brushes his teeth a certain number of times each day, walks the same number of steps to catch the bus, and does complex multiplication in his head with great ease. One day, however, he hears someone ""narrating"" his life as he goes about this daily existence. He consults a psychiatrist who suggests schizophrenia. But, Harold knows he is not going crazy and, instead, turns to a literature expert (Dustin Hoffman) to help him make sense of the voice. Then, too, Harold is struck by some of the narrator's words and he realizes he is missing some of the big assets of life, such as love. He is smitten with a lovely baker, who he is supposed to be auditing, and he goes for broke in the romance department. It works in his favor. But, wait a minute. The narrator suddenly predicts Harold's death. Does poor Mr. Crick have any hope in avoiding his own demise? This is an out-of-the-ordinary movie, to say the least. It has wonderful messages about living life to the fullest but it's own construction is somewhat awkward and misconstrued. The idea of Harold being a character is someone else's book is difficult to fathom and does not quite work in the final analysis. That being said, Ferrell is absolutely wonderful as the man who needed a running commentary on his life to discover new possibilities in living. The rest of the cast, including Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah, is also very nice. Production values, including costumes, setting and photography, are more than adequate. If you want to see a film that is a far cry from the formulaic, this is the one to choose. The story may not be entirely successful, but with Ferrell in the lead and the other fine cast members in tow, a viewing of this film will take you to the brave new world of intriguing film making."

Here I was, at the movie theater, attempting to predict a movie with so many twists and turns. When you hear Emma Thompson's words projecting from that movie screen, your mind is elsewhere, trying to figure out what all this means. There are so many lessons to be learned from this movie. Even if you think you figured them all out, you still have many more lessons to learn.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with Harold Crick (Will Ferrel), an ordinary IRS agent, hearing a strange female voice in his mind. This voice narrates what is happening in his life and foretells what will happen to him. Harold figures out that he is a character in a novel... written by an author who always kills off the hero (which is in this case, the hero is Harold). And then, the author narrates that he will die. So then Harold seeks out a literature expert, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) to help him out. Jules helps him reveal the identity of the author. Harold then seeks out Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) to tell her that he is real and that he will die if she writes this.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson make a fantastic movie, as they usually do.

They seem to be complete opposites, yet he knows from the moment he meets her that he ""wants her"". One of the better aspects of this film is the chemistry between Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhall, and it may not be too long when they are paired again for a romantic comedy. She was a bright spot in the movie.<br/><br/>StF is not a comedy, but rather a drama with some comedy and romance thrown in. It's a little different than the typical Hollywood fare, which appeals to me, and the movie challenges you to think sometimes, which is more than just amusement. I can also see some theology/faith issues people can use from the movie. Besides the ""what am I here for and is my life worth anything"" question, you also have the question of how you get direction in life.<br/><br/>Does God speak to you? Is your life script already written and you're just working through the narration? I have not watched any Ferrell films besides ""Elf"", but if he can continue getting work like this he could have a long and strong career.

Some things were a little awry, like the little boy and the older woman, who are always parts of Thompson's death scenes, but they all connect at the end. Ferrell gave a terrific performance and did something that (at least to me) was the most suttle performance of his to date.

At first it seems to me that she is a hippie, and that's kind of what she is, but she if great and she gets great marks in my book. Thompson was also fabulous again and she gave an inspired role as a writer. Dustin Hoffman did great, but the life-guard scene with the naked men in the shower was a little pointless. BUT- I didn't think that it was a mark down for the overall rating of the movie. Queen Latifah did great with what little part she was given. I didn't enjoy how (once again) this movie made Thompson (who was the real main actress) take a back seat to Gyllenhal and Latifah (who were the supporting actresses).

","STRANGER THAN FICTION may just be one of 2006's finest movies.

Emma Thompson delivers another strong performance as the chain-smoking author of the book who's main character is Harold Crick, a living person stuck in a fictional drama! The idea is splendid and so is the final finish of the movie, leaving your heart touched and your mind impressed by it's ingenious storytelling. STRANGER THAN FICTION also came out of the blue, and while many were hoping for another crazy Ferrell 100& comedy he delivers a fine piece of romantic drama which's tied smoothly together with it's adventurous plot. And although this is as mentioned, a more serious Ferrell, the first part of the movie does deliver laughs (mostly on Ferrell's odd persona) and it's actually the whole plot who finds opportunities creating fine comedic sequences, making it a bittersweet tale as Thompson's tragical tales of death lay a gloomy mood over the movie as the movie drives down the path to reveal that Crick is not a in a comedy, he's in a tragedy. Maggie Gyllenhaal's rebellious baker is brilliant as she falls in love with Crick, what she sees in him may not be easy to describe but their love is compassionate and beautiful, charming to the bones Ferrell makes a wonderful romantic moment when he appears with a box full of flavors, charming both us and Gyllenhaal.

","Stranger Than Fiction is one of those movies that keeps you thinking about for some time after you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, (I especially liked Maggie Gyllenhaal), and the representation of what is happening in the main character's head it is well conveyed as well.<br/><br/>*******MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD********** There are two parallel story lines in the movie: One) Harold hearing the voice of a writer in his head, and trying to come into terms with his existence. Two) Kay struggling with her existence and trying to come to terms with her psychiatric illness and her role as a writer.<br/><br/>I particularly found the second more interesting. I believe that Harold is a fictional character, struggling to open up (to connect) and it is through him that we get a certain perspective into the writer's mood.<br/><br/>Early in the movie, Kay (Emma Thompson as a writer) appears to be on the edge of a building contemplating suicide but also looking/imagining the characters-to-be of the ending of her book. Penny drops in just in time and introduces her self as an ""assistant"" that came to help her finishing her book.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie Kay wears the same clothes and looks disheveled. She keeps smoking and saving her cigarettes in a tissue paper. Her loft is white, clean and in an old building. We and Kay see a loft, but it is likely to be a psychiatric hospital. Penny is introduced to us as a ""assistant"", but she comes across as a very firm nurse.<br/><br/>Professor Hilbert, who is a professor in literature, is a great support for Kay. It's him that tells Harold (that is Kay) to take the plunge, to go ahead with her ideas. He has been in contact with her by sending letter to her for the past 10 years, and it is to him that she looks for help when she is struggling to finish her book; in this way Professor Hilbert has been a life saver for Kay, and I think this is represented by him having a ""second job"" as a lifeguard (in the scenes where Harold is looking for some advice regarding what to do).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it, and will see it again in a few years time!!"

","I always welcome the notion of a career comedian steps out of his element and turns to drama. It's done well for the likes of Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show"", Robin Williams in ""Good Will Hunting"" and Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"". We're able to add Will Ferrell to that list, who takes a break from his usual goofy, over-the-top shtick to take on a toned down and more serious role in Marc Forster's (""Finding Neverland"") new film ""Strange Than Fiction."" Ferrell plays Harold Crick, a lonely IRS agent who lives a simple and menial life until he starts hearing a woman's voice narrating his life. He decides it's not schizophrenia, as the voice isn't communicating to him, it's just talking about him and what he does, and seeks out help from a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) to help him figure out what the narrator means by ""imminent death."" After the pseudo-soul searching he's forced into, he changes his life so as to live it to it's fullest before his death.<br/><br/>It's a comedy of sorts. There are plenty of jokes in Zach Helm's script to keep it light, but it's still a somber piece that keeps the audience hooked by having us trying to figure out the end just as much as Crick is. And through the scenes involving Emma Thompson's writer character Kay Eiffel, you become entrenched with the life and outcome of Crick.<br/><br/>Ferrell is of course the star, and he is able to prove to audiences that he is more than a ""frat-pack"" goofball. His emotional and subdued performance is gold and I can only hope that he does more dramatic work in the future.<br/><br/>I have yet to come across a performance of Hoffman's that I don't like. Sure some are better than others, but I've enjoyed them all. This is one of his average ones, and certainly won't be one that will be spoken of at an Academy Awards or AFI tribute to him, but seeing a good actor work isn't something that should be passed up. Maggie Gyllenhaal is still doing a balancing act between independent features and major studio productions. Here she plays the love interest of Crick, and while I don't dislike her as an actor, she has yet to do a major studio film where she's really good. She handles the smaller, edgier fair much better and until she finds a stronger voice, should stick to those for a while.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much how the whole film goes. There is no wow factor to it. Hoffman, Thompson, Queen Latifah and Gyllenhaal, all competent, capable actors give middling performances in an intriguing film, but goes the route of the Hollywood happy ending, rather than the shockingly depressing ending. There's almost a wink and a nod to the movie in relation to Eiffel's book in a scene between Hoffman and Thompson. It's OK but not great. And Thompson says she's comfortable with OK, and explains her rationale behind it. It seems like the writer, director, actors and producers settled on OK, rather than trying for great. It works as an OK film. But that's ultimately all it is, Ferrell's award caliber performance aside."
"EUyeshima","7","0","1","12 December 2006"," Life and Art Clash for a Sad Sack Tax Auditor in a Kaufman-Lite Fantasy Dramedy
","Put-upon protagonist Harold Crick appears to exist in the same absurdist universe as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's off-center characters in ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"". It is not Kaufman, however, who penned the creative script here but rather Zach Helm, whose fertile imagination drives this fatalistic 2006 dramedy. Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy-driven film focuses on Harold's sadly mundane existence as an emotionally unavailable, anal-retentive tax auditor for the IRS.<br/><br/>One morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real-time precision and zealous literacy. Harold desperately seeks out the source, first by speaking with the unctuous office psychiatrist and then by eliciting the help of an eccentric literature professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert. It turns out to be the voice of author Karen Eiffel, who has been undergoing writer's block for nearly a decade, a situation alarming enough to her publishing company that they send a foolproof assistant to ensure a final manuscript is delivered. In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high-spirited, non-conformist bakery owner named Ana in the middle of a testy, confrontational audit. But the more serious problem is that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's nearly completed novel, and she always kills off her heroes in her books.<br/><br/>How Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far-fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance. If the rest of the set-up doesn't reach the dizzying high-wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum. In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time. Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb.<br/><br/>As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona. Playing a more deadpan variation of his bumbling sleuth in ""I Heart Huckabees"", Dustin Hoffman nicely underplays Hilbert. Queen Latifah has relatively little to do as Eiffel's assistant Penny, but she does it with authority. With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story."

After Cecil B. Demented, I hoped Maggie Gyllenhaal would be in a part like this. Will Ferrell's less than leading man's features gives us all hope because Maggie is stuff. Emma Thompson was also beautiful and engaging but her scenes reminded me of those photos of George Foreman with a cow on his shoulders. Dustin Hoffman seems to be doing a variation of his role in I heart Huckabees, and in middle-age is starting to look creepily like my dad. And I'm sure everyone knows what he looked like. It is making me identify with the Jason and Will characters for reasons that only affect me. The music was singularly intrusive and misguiding. It is indicative of what went wrong.

It's heartwarming, fantastical and maintains a certain sweetness that, as cynical as I am, I found incredibly appealing.<br/><br/>The story's hook: Renowned author Kay Eiffel (Thompson) is penning her latest book in which her protagonist is a chap named Harold Crick (Ferrell). However, unknown to her, Crick is an IRS auditor in real life and can hear her narration in his head and that drives him bonkers.<br/><br/>What follows is a wonderful film that unwinds unexpectedly and slowly, allowing us to know and appreciate not only Kay and Harold, but also supporting characters, including a literature professor Jules (Dustin Hoffman) and a bakery-story owner Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), who proves to be Harold's object of desire.<br/><br/>It is inevitable that Zach Helm's screenplay would draw comparisons to Charlie Kaufman's works, ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999), ""Adaptation"" (2002) and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004), which is one of my favorite films. I suppose it is unfair to compare Helm to the incomparable genius that is Kaufman.<br/><br/>So, though Helm seems like Kaufman-lite, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is helped immensely by four superb performances and it's premise: The responsibility of at. How many good films could you say you've seen about that topic? Ferrell - who is best in small doses, which is why I've never really enjoyed his starring roles all that much - is finely subdued as a man slowly becoming unhinged as he realizes his fate. Ferrell never overacts - I know, that's shocking to believe, but true - and his goodness and kindness serves the story very well. I wish he'd take on more roles like this and fewer Ron Burgundys.<br/><br/>Thompson makes a welcome return to the screen - I know she was in ""Nanny McPhee"" (2005) and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) - but she's back playing a normal person. Kay's a woman with writer's block, desperately trying to figure out how to end her novel. She knows how it will end, but doesn't know how exactly, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>But the star of the film is Gyllenhaal. She truly is one of the most gifted and talented actresses working today, someone who completely takes over a film with her charm and uncommon beauty. Here, she's Ana who's being audited and turning Harold's love life upside down. She wins us over with a minor role.<br/><br/>The questions Helm raises in his film are intelligent ones about art, love, life, responsibility. If there's a flaw in the film, it is the ending. The ending is a compromise. And I couldn't help but think it felt something handed down by a studio exec. I don't know. Or, perhaps, Helm, realizing that he needed to make his film more appealing to the masses, compromised at the very end. He does seem to make it work, though the other possibility would have been excitingly intriguing, trying to see if the characters could get out of that one.<br/><br/>However, the compromise aside, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" works beautifully. Despite it's fantastic ideas, it never seems forced or false. We buy the premise and are taken along for a delightful ride. I always thought Forster's other, better known, films, ""Monster's Ball"" (2001) and ""Finding Neverland"" (2004), were a tad over-rated. With ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" however, he proved me wrong. He's made one of the best films of the year."

","A unique storyline and excellent performances combine for a very enjoyable movie. Much better than I had expected!! Will Ferrell as Harold Crick, the prototypical IRS agent gives a strong effort. Maggie Gyllenhaal is superb and passionate as Ana Pascal. Dustin Hoffman provides an excellent character role as Professor Jules Hilbert. Queen Latifah brings warmth and character as Penny Escher the author's assistant. Emma Thompson is perfect (as always) as the neurotic author Kay Eiffel.

","Well, what can I say? They don't make enough films like this!!! First of all I must state that it appears to start off as a regular Will Ferrel film, being a comfortable viewing experience. Don't be fooled however....A quite notable difference with this film, is Will Ferrel acting in a not entirely comical storyline, and boy does he do it well! Having seen almost the full line-up of Mr. Ferrels movies, it was a pleasant change to see him in something with a little more depth, and he excels in this environment.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson is fantastic, and although I wouldn't have initially seen her in this role, she is a more than worthwhile addition to the cast here.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal is an enigma yet again, and I think and hope she will go on to yet bigger and better things, as she also performs well here, albeit in an ever so slightly small part.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman is amazing in one of his ever more common aloof comedic performances, and I look forward to seeing him in more of these roles.<br/><br/>Queen Latifah is more than adequate in this film, and I hope she continues to appear in these; slightly more intellectual stories.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough of the bullet points....<br/><br/>I watched the trailer for this film, and thought; hmm yeah, could be good, so the Girlfriend and I went to see it. Well, I was kept guessing till almost the very end, and just when I thought I'd second-guessed them out of new idea's, they go and surprise me again(the writers that is!).<br/><br/>Somewhat slow-paced at the beginning, better and better as it goes on, I can't stress enough how good this film is! It has made me curious enough to go and watch Will Ferrel in forthcoming not-entirely-comical films without a second-thought. It really does leave you thinking about life, and how precious it is. (nb; whilst on this note, watch the video to Savin' Me by Nickelback, another reminder of how every second is precious) Fairly similar to another recently released film starring Adam Sandler, it is both better written, and much more clever.<br/><br/>Go on, take a chance, and go and see it, it is even worth the extortionate London Cinema Prices to get in!

"ejavignon","8","0","1","6 December 2006"," Not that edgy, but not that bad
","This film has an interesting twist, but does not meet its full potential. I like movies that play with notions of reality, how we perceive reality, and how we interact with the hidden forces that control our fates (Being John Malkovich, Wings of Desire, The Truman Show, anything by Terry Gillum). This film is not the best in the genre, but it is definitely worth seeing, even if you decide to wait for video.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel keeps his clothes on in this one. Some commentators seem to prefer him in Ricky Bobby type roles. Old School was an enjoyable movie, but actors can't keep playing the same character over and over forever.<br/><br/>The film almost lost me when Will Ferrel survived the bus crash. For a moment I thought it was going to be another trite Hollywood happily ever after ending. However Emma Thompson's character brought things back in the scene with Dustin Hoffman and the dynamic shifts from author-character to author-audience. The film's lesson is that we are all going to die and that virtue consists of bravely facing fate nonetheless, whether we know what that fate is or not."

"alafolle","8","0","1","4 December 2006"," Charlie Kaufman-lite isn't such a bad thing...
","""Stranger than Fiction"" is a smart, entertaining film that doesn't quite achieve greatness, but it's definitely worth a trip to the theater.<br/><br/>This is the story of a stiff IRS Agent who slowly realizes that he's actually a character in an unfinished novel, narrated by a voice in his head, and he's slated for imminent death. It would have been an easy setup to play for cheap laughs, or as pseudo-intellectual Oscar bait that takes itself way too seriously. So I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this is actually a very good movie.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell's performance is so understated in the early scenes that it almost defeats the purpose of casting him in the role. But as the story builds up steam, he does a fine job of balancing the comic and serious aspects of his character. Ferrell also has surprisingly good chemistry with Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is terrific as usual. Although the romance is not well developed (which makes sense, I suppose, in a film about the formulaic and arbitrary nature of fiction) the scenes between the two are memorable. Queen Latifah is unfortunately wasted in an underdeveloped role, but the rest of the cast is pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>It's true that Zach Helm's script can be described as ""Charlie Kaufman-lite"", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The dialogue generates laughs without forcing them, and the story is clever without aggressively reminding us about how clever it is. The metaphysical and literary themes of the story are handled with a light touch, which keeps the fantasy plot devices from feeling completely contrived. By focusing on the human side of the story, rather than just trying to dazzle us with narrative complexity, ""Stranger than Fiction"" is ultimately more satisfying than Kaufman's ""Adaptation"".<br/><br/>This may be lite literature, but it's very funny in places, it has a stellar soundtrack, and it doesn't require you to check your brain at the door. As far as I'm concerned, that's entertainment."

","Stranger Than Fiction <br/><br/>3.5/4<br/><br/>Harold Crick: ""You don't understand that this isn't a story to me, it's my life! I want to live!"" <br/><br/>Having just written and optioned his first feature, Zach Helm decided to take a risk. Rather than taking on writing assignments or rewriting various projects, Helm went the unorthodox way and decided to take however long he needed to write a new, original screenplay. Coincidentally, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a wonderfully inventive and substantive film; it is one of the most original films of the new millennium.<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent living a life mired in routine. He counts brush strokes, wakes up everyday at 6:17 AM, and maintains a precise schedule for everything he does, even the most trivial of activities. However, Harold starts to hear a voice, a narrator- a voice only he can hear. The narration begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death.<br/><br/>One of Stranger's strengths is that it is able to both create and sustain a perfect balance between moments of drama and comedy. This is rare, especially in 2006 as scripts like Peter Morgan's ""The Queen"" fail to find equal footing in these territories resulting in a handful of poorly received jokes. Even in the moments leading to the films dramatic climax, Helm cracks a shell of tension through comedic narration that is both effective and hysterical. This is an incredibly difficult area to navigate for any screenwriter, but Helm, aided by Marc Forster's assured direction, succeeds.<br/><br/>The most notable aspect of the film is Zach Helm's masterfully crafted screenplay. It is awe inspiring in its creativity and novelty. Every word is exact in its selectivity, just like Harold Crick's life. The quality of the script is what caused such stars as Oscar winners Thompson and Hoffman as well as the talented Maggie Gyllenhaal to gravitate toward the project. The crux of its dramatic material is powerful, to say the least, and ultimately heartbreaking. Such a screenplay demands recognition but sadly, it may be passed over in an incredibly strong Original Screenplay category this year featuring Oscar winner Eric Roth, the renowned Peter Morgan, and a fellow freshmen, Michael Ardnt.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is a revelation in ""Fiction,"" he is cast perfectly and shocks his audience. Ferrell strides through the dramatic material with ease, something that fans of his comedic ventures such as ""Talladega Nights"" will be surprised to discover. Emma Thompson thrives as struggling author and narrator Karen Eiffel, delivering one of the best supporting actress performances of the year. Hoffman, always charming, works his magic here with a good turn, triumphantly returning to a quality films.<br/><br/>The films only misstep occurs in its final act, which I won't discuss in length. Suffice to say, rather than going for the gut with an incredibly dark and emotionally complex turn, the film takes a different route but still ends on a relatively satisfying note. Despite a slight wave of disappointment that came over me, I understood why Fiction took this direction and still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" isn't a great film but it comes close enough. Fiction is drenched in poignancy, and manages to be uniquely intelligent and profound. These qualities are exceptionally rare in today's world of blockbusters, sequels, and low budget horror films. Stranger Than Fiction deserves its pathos, it is a pleasurable viewing experience amidst its intermittently dreary (yet simultaneously brilliant) content. It is a film worth seeing, if only for its wit, let alone the questions it poses. The film hits topics ranging from carpe diem to omnipotence to routine and it does so successfully. Helm has a bright career ahead of him and if he continues writing like this, he will join the ranks of writers like Eric Roth and Charlie Kaufman as the best writers in the industry. If this happens, I can assure you, film-goers across the world would not be in a tragedy."

","I knew nothing much about this film, only what I had seen on the trailer and that the cast included Will Farrell. I immediately assumed this was a comedy, yet I found it to be more of an 'easy' watching romance film with a few laughable parts. Enjoyable, but a little disappointing as I went in expecting the usual from Will Farrell, a comedy. I managed to get hold of some advanced screening tickets free of charge to see 'Stranger Than Fiction' so I can't really complain!<br/><br/>Plot Summary: Karen Effiel is an author writing her latest novel about an isolated man named Harold Crick. What she doesn't know is that her fictionalised character is real. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has lived a dull existence and one day begins to hear Karen's voice as she narrates what she puts on paper to what Harold has and is doing. Because of this Harold enlists the help of a literary professor to find out what is happening and ends up changing things about his life including beginning a relationship with his IRS client, a government-hating bakery owner named Ana Pascal. Harold, however, finds trouble when he hears that Karen plans to kill him."

"jzappa","9","0","1","25 November 2006"," We Never Know When Life Will End, Or How
","Stranger Than Fiction is a film written by Zach Helm, a screenwriter who never let there be a dull moment in his dialogue or his story, and that includes the internal mechanics of both. Each character is a much different character than you expected them to be, and very absorbing and compelling that way, creating the film's universe, and because your attention is drawn to a character you've never seen before, you feel much more inclined to get to know them.<br/><br/>I've always found Will Ferrell to be more of a talented actor than just a comedian, or an SNL alum who had a character big enough for the movies, hence happening upon a so-so film career. His characters in his comedies are too brilliantly stupid and wholly created. His timing is impeccable, as you will see in his almost robotically dull character in Stranger Than Fiction, Harold Crick, whose sudden losses of control are hilarious simply because of the contrast to what you've seen of him so far. He's an all-too-real satire of a commonly overlooked sort.<br/><br/>Having recently seen In the Name of the Father, I commented on Emma Thompson's stunning talent as an actress, because I'd re-watched Primary Colors not too long before, and I realized how sparingly one thinks of her as anyone aside from her character. She completely becomes whomever she plays, like a chameleon. I see her now in Stranger Than Fiction and I realize the same thing about In the Name of the Father. Each film I see her in, the more I like her. She has a scene in this film that stands out, an interview her character gives on a network talk show, her host being a young bimbo whose lack of knowledge she finds so aggravating that she can't help from showing it in the expression of the answers she gives her, and she is hilarious.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman does the opposite. As in Confidence, he's playing sort of a caricature of himself or a variation on his own personality rather than becoming a different one like in Rain Man or most of his earliest work. This doesn't detract from his performance however, though I've always enjoyed him as one of the few classic contemporary actors with the charisma that influences so many actors of later generations who actually does play many different people and explore many different genres and characters, as opposed to other great actors in that category---Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson, Penn---who take generally relative roles and infuse their own personas into them.<br/><br/>The visual style of this film is very smart, conveying Harold Crick's mental state, as a mentally refined, all-too-reserved fellow who sees the world in numbers, systems and mechanisms everywhere he goes and fails to see life in other ways. The director, Marc Forster, shows us this as Crick goes through his daily algorithms and we see elegant diagrams and word groups with pointing lines, math problems done corresponding to his pondering through them. These image accompaniments don't necessarily face the audience, though they sometimes appear to be. Rather, they are facing Crick himself.<br/><br/>It may seem odd that I analyze this film so much and study it so meticulously. When you see it, you'll realize that it truly is not just another blueprint zany comedy. It is one of the most intelligent and most well-made Hollywood films this year."

The cast was great, Dustin Hoffman was great. I really like Maggie Gyllenhaal, she is funny and very cute in this film. Emma Thompson gives a great performance, as always.

"little-bees","7","0","2","25 November 2006"," Fell just short of Greatness!
","Last night we went to see ""Stranger than Fiction"" which, by all reviews, promised to be a fabulous experience and a refreshing movie plot we had not seen before.<br/><br/>In fact, everything was in place for this to be a GREAT movie...a well crafted story, great performances by Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhal, a great soundtrack and a very fresh and new kind of cinematography which illustrated the main character's obsession with numbers.<br/><br/>As the movie started and the plot began to unfold I was immediately drawn into a main character, Harold Crick, that you easily come to love and route for. And the story was interesting and different enough to hold your attention. Up to this point the only drawback was a very unnecessary placement of Queen Latifa as a writer's assistant....a role with no magic, which could have served it's purpose just as well by Emma Thompson speaking into a tape recorder.<br/><br/>Yes, everything was in place for movie greatness and sadly, the last 1/3 of the movie fell flat as a pancake for me. I wish I could go in depth into what made the movie fail at the end, but to do so I would have to ruin the plot twists and ending, so I can't. But I will say this in an abstract way. All of the well-executed components of the movie had successfully made the viewer feel a certain way about the life of the main character and then, in the 11th hour, everything you have been built up to root for is switched and the movie tries to force you to completely change your way of thinking about what is valuable in this particular story...leaving me feeling let down and a bit confused.<br/><br/>The movie's end could have been triumphant if the ending had been less morbid or even more morbid, but the middle path they chose was almost disconcerting and held the meaning of the movie back from what it could have been. In vain the writers tried to tie up it's ending with a few musings by the ""author"" writing the fictional story, but it falls way short of being reflective, deep or meaningful like it so easily could have been. In the car on the way home we could have talked about insights about life the movie offered and instead we talked about what the ending SHOULD have been to match the build-up of first 2/3 of the movie. While the movie isn't bad by any means, it is definitely short of greatness."

","I found ""Stranger Than Fiction"" to be one of the best movies I have seen in theaters for an extremely long time. It's plot, though not completely a newly formulated idea, as babsbnz from Chicago, IL ( ...""a la 'Groundhog Day'..."") so perfectly stated, is quite engaging. Will Ferrell did a very good job switching from his more comedic characters, such as his well remembered ""Elf"", to being quite solemn.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" did have two goofs that jump out. Firstly, in one scene Harold Crick sits calmly on a bus reading the story of his life. As time passes, the bus comes to the end of it's route, with Harold remaining oblivious and absorbed in his own story, and pulls into the bus garage, for lack of better term. At this point there is a cut to a forgettable scene where I found myself curious as to how Harold would return home; however, within the next scene, Harold surprisingly found himself once more, as I figured, in the same bus, still reading his life story. Viewers are left to ponder whether Will Ferrell was visited by his fairy god-mother and granted magical powers all in one scene cut.<br/><br/>The second glitch in this movie is in the script. Harold Crick is forced to live (how long must be solely determined by the viewing of this movie) with a narrator depicting his novel life in a smooth British accent. As this is the main part of the storyline, it is assumed that the reason Harold Crick is able to hear this narrator would be explained. Even if not fully explained, some explanation seemed to be quite necessary to allow a viewer to fully comprehend ""Stranger Than Fiction"".<br/><br/>Over all, this movie, hardly able to be considered comedy, was very good and worth the ever increasing ticket and concession stand prices."

This film was truly unoffensive which is quite refreshing, and managed to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch too. <br/><br/>Be sure to see this film from the beginning.

Somehow the film manages not to fall into being a sentimental sappy mess either. I would place it between The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. It's not quite as fantasy-like as the Truman show and it's not quite the tragic romance of Eternal Sunshine. I didn't get the feeling that it was trying to give an earth-shattering message about life, but it also wasn't light-hearted fluff either. It was a very balanced film with good acting, a great plot and a lot of laughs.

Writer Zach Helm shows us his intellect by writing this movie and succeeding rather well. Before seeing this movie, my crazy predictions were telling me that this movie is just going to be about this well organized guy that has a narrator narrating his life ""accurately and with a better vocabulary"". However, the story goes much beyond that, and shows us that Will Ferrell is THE perfect actor to portray Harold Crick. Harold Crick is SUPPOSED to be a fictionalized character in Karen Eifel's (Emma Thompson's) new novel. What Karen doesn't know is that her character is a REAL person. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has a rebellious IRS client Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who just doesn't want to pay (in her words) ""unnecessary taxes"". He tries as nice as possible to make her to. She wouldn't. The movie flips between scenes with Karen Eifel and Harold Crick very frequently. The Karen Eifel scenes are disturbing in some ways because she is a messed up author who smokes and drinks. When you think about it, she's basically playing a TRUE author, because a lot are messed up. A lot of authors in the world today are just a bit ""off"" in how they get their ideas. In her case, she sees a fruit rolling down the road and it gives her an idea on how to kill Harold Crick. It shows she does have an imagination but an imagination so ""out there"" like, a perfect example, Stephen King. The movie is a comedy-drama, and it even has scenes where Harold uses a journal to find out if his life is a comedy or a tragedy. He puts a tally mark under Comedy if something comedic just came about, or he puts a tally mark under Tragedy if something somewhat tragic came about. He uses this as an experiment to see what kind of story Eifel is writing, that is after he finds out she's writing a story about him. He goes for help a couple of times to find out if he's losing it. One person told him if he's hearing voices in his head, then he's suffering from schizophrenia and should go on qualified medication. Others were of no help until he went to a literary professor named Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who was very humorous in this movie and played his part perfectly. Crick was insisting help from Hilbert. Hilbert asks him loads of unnecessary questions, including, ""What's your favorite word?"" Crick replies, ""Integer."" Funny, yet not helping his situation a bit. Plus, this might interfere with his love for Ana Pascal. Crick is desperate and doesn't know what to do now that he finds out that Karen Eifel is going to kill him. Will Eifel kill him? If she did it would be a very depressing ending, especially since Crick is such a kind person in this film. And after a little while in this film, Crick stops thinking about counting his brush strokes from top to bottom and from left to right, and stops thinking about counting his steps before work and catching the bus at the exact time. His wristwatch is one to keep him so organized. And the story is about him and his wristwatch. And he is an organized person. But what happens when your wristwatch goes bad. You might not get up at the exact time in the morning or get somewhere at the exact time you need to. You lose your perfectionism after that. I would focus on life a little more too if I knew I was going to die. You shouldn't worry about the trivial things in life, but the important things in life. He had many important things in his life and had even more when he stopped worrying about being perfect. Do Karen Eifel and her assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) (who helps her find an ending because she has writer's block) know that she is writing a story about a REAL LIFE person? It is not my job to tell you, but it's your job to find out. Movie directed by Marc Forster."

","Commercials have a tendency to make a movie appear as a comedy instead of what it really is. Often people go to a film such as the recent disaster, The Break Up with Jennifer Anaston and Vince Vaughn. In that film the previews show ads that would make you think that this is a light hearted film but it was more of a bad reminder of my worst fight with my wife. I left that movie thinking I should have been paid a counseling fee for sitting through it. Fortunately this film was no where near that far off the mark with the ad agencies attempts to get viewers at the box office. This is a serious piece of art for Will Ferrill. It is truly one of his best films. I was rather surprised by Queen Latifa's role in this film. While she was in it, her presence didn't effect the film either way with exception just to say her name was attached to it. Emma Thompson really got me involved with the role of the author/narrator. Her own hang ups and obvious self destructive nature really comes out. I don't want to say anything else, as I am sure to start spouting all the good stuff that would truly spoil it for others. NO MATTER WHAT, THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE!"

","It's NOT a Will Farrell movie, people! Yes he stars in it. Yes he does make a couple of ""Farrelesk"" jokes. But this film is NOT an ""Anchorman"" or ""Talladega Nights"" by any stretch.

He's following in the footsteps of comedy-legends Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams just fine with his dramatic turn in this film. Farrell proves that he can carry the leading-man load without his fellow ""Frat Pack"" mates (Stiller, the Wilson brothers, Vaughn, and Carrell) to back him up. As a matter of fact, NONE of them make cameos in this movie! But aside from Will's admirable performance, the story is something anyone who has ever dipped into the art of story-telling can relate to. Just how do you kill Harold Krick?

","Harold Crick is an IRS agent who hears a woman's voice narrating his life as he goes through his day. The woman is actually a novelist, and he is the main character in her latest novel. This is bad enough for the fellow, but one day he discovers she is going to kill him off.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant. The premise, the dialog and the acting are superb. The story is literal and allegorical and clever all at the same time. It's wraps a lot of different concepts together in a way I've never seen done before in a film.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel has truly made the transition into ""serious"" acting here. Dustin Hoffman, as usual, is amazing to watch, and he has the best lines. Emma Thompson has her character flawlessly portrayed.<br/><br/>The reason I have not given this film ten stars, is because the ending is not consistent with the rest of the film in terms of quality. OK, it's an acceptable ending, and it makes sense, but it lacks the brilliance of the rest of the movie. They should have come up with something better. Also, the Maggie Gyllenhall character was flawed; she starts out a firebrand and ends up a Barbie Doll. Unfortunate.<br/><br/>But these flaws notwithstanding, a great film to see and savor. The most original dialog I've heard on screen, and an amazing tour de force of literary style that shows a respect for the audience rarely seen in a tinseltown production.<br/><br/>P.S. Trivia note. The director went to great pains to make this take place in an unidentfiable city -- all the transit buses have nary a word painted on them -- but the opening scene has Harold getting onto a BART train! The rest of the film doesn't look like San Francisco tho."

"jaredmobarak","9","0","1","18 November 2006"," Harold Crick and his wristwatchÂ…Stranger Than Fiction
","Marc Forster is one of those directors that over that past years have been on my film radar. After a strong debut, (I know he had a couple previous, but lets go with it), with Monster's Ball and a great follow-up of Finding Neverland, he really wowed me last year with the visual flair and emotion of Stay. This year sees the release of Stranger Than Fiction written by Zach Helm, whom people are hailing as one of the best new screenwriters, interesting since this is his first script made into a Hollywood feature. There were definite reservations on my part having the lead be cast to Will Ferrell, but I decided to go with my inclination to Forster movies and hope that we get Melinda and Melinda Ferrell, not watch me be an ass Ferrell. Thankfully Will gives possibly his greatest performance yet and really helps drive this intelligent, poignant allegory into a strong feature and a continuance to Forster's streak of winners.<br/><br/>Many things could have gone wrong with Stranger Than Fiction. Ferrell could have pulled a Jim Carrey and highjacked the tale, it could have turned into slapstick comedy, or also could have become a Wonderful Life ripoff of sentimentality as all involved discovered an inner love and exuberance for doing good. Credit Helm and Forster for sticking to their guns and creating a true existential parable, showing how we are in control of our actions and we make choices in our lives either for worse or better. If you woke up tomorrow hearing a narration of your mundane activities, you have the ability to dismiss it as craziness, disregard it all together and except your fate, or wake up and decide to do something about it. Fate doesn't dictate your willingness to survive and that is exactly what Harold Crick wants to do. No matter how worthless his existence has been, all it takes is one wakeup call to turn it around and make something meaningful happen, to take a chance rather than cowardly take the easy way out.<br/><br/>Yes the film has many laugh-out-loud moments, however, it is mostly a nuanced and subtle film. It takes itself very seriously and most of the laughs hit big because of the deadpan delivery and gravity of the situation at hand. These characters don't necessarily make light of the circumstances as much as go along with skepticism and a dash of possibility. Every instance is orchestrated to perfection and besides bringing up early on that a certain Wednesday event held the key to Crick's demise, days before our author even began to know how to go about killing him, complete without any real plot holes. Helm took his time with this tale of the meaning of life, (great reference to this by having Monty Python's movie of same name on screen briefly), and made every detail work throughout the evolution of a nobody into a literary hero.<br/><br/>Besides Ferrell's revelation in acting ability, we are treated to numerous standout performances. The always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal shows how skilled she is in playing a bitter idealist while deftly balancing a budding interest in that she is against. Dustin Hoffman does spot-on work as an eccentric literary historian trying to help Crick, more out of educational curiosity than human compassion; a nice companion to his performance in the other recent great existential tale I Heart Huckabees. Emma Thompson steals the show, however, with her broken reclusive writer, so enthralled in finding ways to kill her characters she can't have a real connection with that of living people. The need she has to correspond with Hoffman's character, but her inability to do so as it might cloud her ability to write profound dark tales, is portrayed beautifully. Every emotion she goes through during her discovery about the novel is great to watch.<br/><br/>Every minute of Stranger Than Fiction is measured and calculated to the utmost degree. Much like the film's fetish for numbers, (I loved the computer grids and diagrams superimposed throughout), Helm's script is a formula being solved. Every equation has one answer to even out both sides and while this film is no different, the filmmakers took a bit of liberty with its ultimate conclusion. The way it was going was perfect, the characters reactions to what was about to happen magnificent, and then the story took one last turn. While at first unfortunate, the final twist of the tale was redeemed by a profound statement from Thompson's Karen Eiffel, so true to form and relevant to the proceedings that I agree with her: I'm OK with just good. Just because the answer wasn't quite correct doesn't mean they can't get partial credit for the great work they did in the process."
"rosepol","9","0","1","18 November 2006"," Best movie in several years
","Stranger than fiction starts out like post-modern literary snob snot -- anyone good with numbers must be dull and obsessive -- and never entirely leaves the genre. However, the acting brings the script to life (when Maggie Gyllenhaal enters, it is like switching on the sound). And the nuance and wit elevate the movie above its plodding peers such as Endless Sunspot Mind and Malkovich Bees John. The transformation from sneering tragedy to feel-good comedy is self-aware, leaving the characters and audience satisfied but ambivalent. To what extent should we be willing to exchange humanity for art or vice-versa in this instance, a movie?<br/><br/>I'm left at the end with a sense of the triviality of the fiction and movie business. Just as the script exalts baking over academe, so it says that you shouldn't take your entertainment too seriously."

","Stranger Than Fiction has had endless comparisons to the films written by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), while the performance of the film's lead actor, Will Ferrell, has been compared to the dramatic turns of comedic actors, such as Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, and Robin Williams. While Stranger Than Fiction is definitely more mainstream than a film written by Charlie Kaufman, comparisons of Will Ferrell's performance to Jim Carrey in The Truman Show do have merit. Will Ferrell successfully gives a dramatic performance in this comedic film.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) reinvents his directing style by creating a film that is very reliant on its screenplay. He refrains from an overly visual look by composing a flat, minimally toned image, and carefully directs Ferrell to a performance where not once does he overact. The screenplay, written by Zach Helm, apparently was much buzzed about when it was initially pitched. It sparked a bidding war throughout many studios and was eventually won by Sony Pictures. Helm's first produced script provides an extremely creative premise, but in parts, seems like the characters were too self aware of the direction of the storyline.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell gives his best performance to date as the IRS agent Harold Crick, and Emma Thompson is equally great as the writer's block suffering author Karen Eiffel. Crick starts to hear Eiffel's voice narrating his actions, and we come to realize that Crick is the main character of Eiffel's new book. Out of desperation, Crick seeks out literary professor Jules Hilbert, quirkily played by Dustin Hoffman, for guidance on where his own narrative is going. Hoffman's performance is reminiscent to his role in 2004's similarly toned, I Heart Huckabees. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also great as Ana Pascal, a tattooed baker who refuses to pay her taxes, while Queen Latifah reminds us that she's still funny as the underdeveloped character of Eiffel's assistant..<br/><br/>The film weaves comedy, romance, and fantasy all together in a similar fashion to Adaptation. Also like in Adaptation, the character of the author will create an ending that parallels the ending of the actual movie. Stranger Than Fiction's ending is incredibly fascinating, and will be either loved or hated. While others might see the ending as an unsatisfying copout, it is a truly complex conclusion that gives the audience closure on whether the film is a comedy or a tragedy. <br/><br/>Stranger Than Fiction is not your typical Will Ferrell comedy. It isn't loud, and it doesn't contain Ferrell running around nude. However, it is an intelligent, clever film, that has its moments of contempt, fantasy, and romance."
"Goatgirl-4","10","0","1","18 November 2006"," Comedy and Tragedy
","One of the many ironies of this film is that the characters are concerned about the difference between comedy and tragedy, while the movie's plot seems to have a perfect balance of the two genres! It is at times hilarious and at others poignant, thrilling, and even heartbreaking. It begins with an unseen narrator narrating the dull daily routine of Harold Crick(Will Ferrell), but that changes when Harold begins to hear the voice, but no one else can. He tries to ignore it, until it makes a fatal prediction for him, at which point he frantically searches for help, first from psychiatrists, then a quirky literature professor(Dustin Hoffman). We aren't introduced to the narrator, Kay Eiffel(Emma Thompson), an author with a case of witers block and a smoking habit, until later. There are two characters thrown in at seemingly random places whose significance can't be understood until later.<br/><br/>Through a sequence of events set into effect by the voice, Harold begins to change his monotonous life, from learning to play the guitar to falling in love with a rebellious baker(Maggie Gyllenhaal) he was sent to audit. Just as this is unfolding, he-and the audience-are faced with an unthinkable, painfully ironic possibility. Will he be able to stop the author from ending the life he has just begun to live?<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. Who would have guessed Will Ferrell could pull something like this off? And he does it without one stupid joke or outrageous moment! You sympathize with his character and root for him, even in the parts when you're laughing at him. Proves he should make his way into drama. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the complicated author- could even get an Oscar nom. Dustin Hoffman , like Ferrell, doesn't overplay his character, who is still funny, but ends up being a serious driving force. Maggie Gyllenhaal has a lot to add as the sweet-and sassy baker, and ends up rising above love interest status. Queen Latifah has an unusually small role as Kays assistant who has her moments. <br/><br/>This is script be Zach Helm, A first time screenwriter. You can tell how good the screenplay was from the strength of the story, which never gets fluffy or boring for a moment, and feels realistic despite it's fantasy elements. Helm deserves every bit of his publicity, i see great things ahead for him.People should stop comparing him to other screenwriters, he's got a voice all his own. Directed by Marc Forester, this is just as good as his Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a funny, touching film that with a great message keeps you interested and stays on your mind long after you leave the theater. It might not be the box-office draw of the week(there were only about 10 people in the theater with me!), but I would strongly recommend it to anyone. A 10/10."

","I loved this movie because it not only speaks to those of us who are writers, it speaks about humanity and life in general. If you are a writer, you must see it. If you are any other human, you should also see it if you want to laugh, feel move, and see just how strange/weird/boring the creative process really is. Emma Thompson is the prefect writer without an ending, and true to how we writers are very odd and always looking at things differently than most people. How often do you find yourself in a hospital looking for people about to die? If you do, that just weird.<br/><br/>Here's something to think about: What if you are a character in somebody's novel? Are you a tragedy or comedy? Fantasy or Science Fiction? What if someone already has an ending planned for you, what would it be? Happily ever after or random tragic death; love or loss. Can you write an ending yourself, e.i., are you in control of your own fate or is it in control of you. I'm not giving my answer because it may or may not offend some one and this isn't about what I think, it's about the theory of it, which may never be clearly concluded...<br/><br/>On a lighter note, if you want to see a good movie well worth the money, this is for you. And don't worry if you're not a Will Ferrell, he is not his usual self in this film. He is a thousand times better; a real, normal, loser of a grown man who lives a very boring life filled with only numbers as company. You will feel sorry for Harold Crick because he is just so lame to begin with, his life is a sad boring routine that would drive many normal people crazy out of their heads.<br/><br/>The story, the narrative bit a least, is almost in the vein of JK Rowlings, in it's style and way of letting the little things play out in a funny way. Thompson's English accent makes her the prefect Narrator, similar to how Morgan Freeman made a cool God in Bruce Almighty. And you can't beat a grown man talking to his toothbrush and shower head while insisting that he is not crazy.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I might give something away. So I will say this: Go see the movie for yourself and see what you think of the ending..."

There was no random awkwardness of some comedies, that makes you want to skip that particular scene because of that terrible joke. Well that never really happens with Stranger Than Fiction, because it flows, and it has an intelligent storyline. Take the manically depressed but genius writer who wants to kill a character she doesn't know is real. Then there is the character, who makes his routine, then is forced to break it. There is almost no scene in the whole movie that doesn't make sense. Everything ties together, and everything works well. See it, you'll love it.

","I have to admit I have become a Will Ferrell fan. I honestly did not used to be. I found most of his work on SNL somewhat shallow. His earlier movies were along the same lines. Then suddenly, in the movie Elf, I started seeing something more than just another crude slapstick comedian. I noticed Will kept his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. There was also an ""I know a secret about this character but I'm not going to tell."" look in his eyes that I have seen so infrequently. It drew me in in spite of myself. I had the feeling that he had spent real time thinking about the history of the character and their life prior to the movie. He took this feeling to a new level entirely with Stranger Than Fiction. It is a comedy but it is also much more than that. It has been a long time since I have been in a movie and wanted to laugh yet, at the same time, felt the need to hold my tongue to not spoil a tender moment. If they gave Oscars for performances in comedies I think Will should at the least be nominated for one in this. His range is becoming nothing short of impressive and I very much look forward to seeing him in more films and hopefully cast in rolls that challenge him to discover how great he can become!<br/><br/>I also suggest this as one of the best ""date"" movies this season if not this whole year."

"Ndirsch11","7","0","4","15 November 2006"," 'Stranger than Fiction' a Good Dose of Comedy and Tragedy
","'Stranger than Fiction' tells the story of Harold Crick, a dull and unimaginative man whose life seems to be stuck in pause. His days are spent adhering to an uncompromising routine: he wakes up, brushes his teeth, goes to work, comes home, eats alone, and goes to bed. Everything is perfectly timed down to the minute by his wristwatch. Spontaneity is simply not an option, and not surprisingly, Harold has no real friends. To make matters worse, Harold is an IRS agent. When he does go out to meet new people, it's usually to audit someone for tax fraud.<br/><br/>The film opens with a series of shots showing us Harold's daily routine. Almost immediately we hear the voice of a narrator telling us the details of Harold's boring life. The narrator is not Harold, but rather an unidentified female voice. Here's the catch though: one day, Harold begins hearing the voice that's narrating his life story. Since nobody else seems to hear it, Harold believes he's going crazy and seeks professional help. In a very short time, Harold's life will be turned upside down.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson plays Kay Eiffel, a well known author in the midst of writing a new novel. She also happens to be the voice of the narrator! Unknown to Miss Eiffel is the fact that Harold Crick, the protagonist of the novel she's writing, is actually a real person. Reality and fantasy collide throughout the movie as we see how whatever is written in the story becomes true. As the story is being written, Harold can hear every word that is typed and knows his fate before it comes. <br/><br/>Will Ferrell, who plays Harold Crick, gives an unusually understated and subtle performance for a comedic actor. His performance is reminiscent of the kind of minimalism that we usually expect from the likes of Bill Murray. By not overacting, Ferrell gives the movie weight and depth and manages to make a mundane character worthy of audience sympathy.<br/><br/>'Stranger than Fiction' is ultimately a movie about fate and control. That's one of the problems I had with it. On the one hand, Harold Crick learns his fate from the narrator and tries to change his ways. He falls in love with Ana Pascal, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and tries to learn to play the guitar. All of this is an attempt to truly live life as it is meant to be lived. On the other hand, Harold's life is being dictated by someone else. So doesn't that mean that Harold has no free will? The movie tries to have it both ways and it doesn't really work. It's hard to cheer for a character whose life is being completely controlled by someone else. Even when Harold does try to change his ways and escape fate, he remains a passive character.<br/><br/>The ending, which I will not reveal, is both unsatisfying and disappointing. It's a bit of a cop-out and an appeal to Hollywood sentimentalism. Also, some of the supporting roles are wasted opportunities. Dustin Hoffman, who plays a college professor helping Harold Crick, is given little to do. Queen Latifah, who plays Miss Eiffel's secretary, is given even less to do. I'm still going to recommend the movie, however, because it's always well intentioned. I think it's one of those movies that might have looked better on paper than on film. I'll definitely give it credit for being original."

","I admit that I'm a film snob. When my sister first told me about the plot some months ago, I thought, ""Wow! What a great idea for a movie."" I went into the film with incredibly high expectations, and I must say that Stranger Than Fiction far surpassed my already high expectations. Next to An Inconvenient Truth, Stranger Than Fiction is the best film I've seen in 2006.<br/><br/>I don't currently have the energy to write a full-blown review, so I'll briefly discuss some highlights: - When Harold Crick is sitting in his apartment watching animals eating other animals on TV, I was blown away when the giant construction machine claws into Harold's apartment, beautifully paralleling what is on television.<br/><br/><ul><li>I loved the mention of all of the small things people take for granted that is listed at the very end (e.g., a loving embrace, etc.). This, in a nutshell, is the theme of the entire movie. In other words, we should enjoy life for its own sake and not be so overly concerned with the black and white life that we only think exists.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Even the film's poster is amazing with incredible symbolism. The period dropping on Harold Crick poses with it multiple layers. Not only does the period (dealing with writing) act as an instrument of death (dealing with killing), but a period also indicates an end--in this case it's both the end of a sentence and the end of a life.</li></ul><br/><br/>It's the small intricacies that matter most in this film, along with a common theme--a theme we've seen multiple times (e.g., Life or Something Like It, Big Fish, etc.). Despite this common theme, it was delivered in an original way that maintained my interest throughout the entire film. It did so with a beautiful blend of comedy and drama in a film that was wonderfully acted by all of the prominent characters, notably Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>I predict an Oscar nomination for writing, but probably not much more (maybe a Best Supporting Actress nomination for either Thompson or Gyllenhaal, but most likely Thompson if either).<br/><br/>Movies don't make me cry, but a tear actually came to my eye after watching this. It wasn't the plot that did it. It was a real appreciation for a craft that I love and seeing it so beautifully portrayed that moved me."

Will Ferrell has proved to me that he can carry drama, heavy and light hearted, with grace. Even the more minor characters added depth to the story.

","The narrator is a very important component of literature. In order for a story to be told, there has to be someone telling it. It can be an outsider, the person involved, or someone known only as ""The Narrator"". Life, however, doesn't have a narrator. People have the power of free will.<br/><br/>For Harold Crick, life isn't as care free. His life is being told to him. In Marc Forster's film Stranger Than Fiction, Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent, has lived his life in solitude, to the tick of his wristwatch. For no apparent reason, on what seemed to be an ordinary Wednesday morning, Crick can hear a woman narrating his life on while he brushes his teeth.<br/><br/>This voice that only Crick can hear is of acclaimed writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Eiffel hasn't published a book in nearly a decade. Her publisher sends Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to her rid her of ""writer's block"". All of Eiffel's troubles rest on one predicament: how to kill Harold Crick.<br/><br/>It seems like Crick is just going to have to deal with this ""voice"" when all of a sudden while waiting at the bus stop, the voice tells Crick of his ""imminent death"". When looking for help, he is placed in the lap of literature theorist Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Like everyone else, Hilbert believes that Crick is crazy, but is willing to give his literary advice to Crick to see whether or not that his life is a comedy or a tragedy. In other words, will Crick end up dying or ""getting hitched""? To make things more complicated, Crick must audit an anarchistic baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom he becomes attracted to. She becomes his obsession and a way of finding out whether or not his life will end up being a comedy or a tragedy.<br/><br/>Director Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) along with up and coming writer Zack Helm deliver a heartfelt film. The film itself looks really nice. Crick's life is surrounded by routine and he sees and does things that a normal person wouldn't. Forster's makes his world look like it is filled with diagrams and timers like a futuristic touch screen. Slow motion shots and fantastic dream sequences make this a visual feast.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Ferrell's performance is original compared to his other characters in Old School and Elf. His timing is perfect and his delivery, delightful. This could be his Lost in Translation. Along with Ferrell is Hoffman, who together deliver some of the funniest dialogues on film. The cagey veteran Hoffman has such a wide range in his acting from The Graduate to Rain Man, and it shows. He is always spicing up the screen with his characters.<br/><br/>The leading ladies deliver superb performances. Thompson is paranoid and jittery, perfect for the troubled author. Also a veteran actress, Thompson's composure and presence gives more substance to the film. Gyllenhaal's ""fight the power"" attitude along with her tattoo's make her the perfect love interest for Ferrell. She can be so nasty and still be desirable. Latifah's performance, although a minor role, is a step back in the right direction for the Oscar nominated actress (Chicago).<br/><br/>All it needed was a great script. Helm's fresh style of writing is a breathe of fresh for the screen. The story itself is very original and exemplifies his unique way of thinking. The future is bright for Helm.<br/><br/>There is a lot of buzz surrounding the film. The Oscar season is just beginning with many highly anticipated releases coming up. Stranger Than Fiction is a hopeful at the 2007 Academy Awards in several categories. With some many variables not yet accounted for, it is too early to decide.<br/><br/>There are laughs across the entire spectrum of comedy from the blatantly funny to the more complex jokes. There are even some heavy moral issues that provoke some thinking for the audience. Stranger Than Fiction is guaranteed to strike a cord."

","This film has everything. It's funny, scary, surprising, happy, sad, romantic, and the list goes on. If you are not a fan of works previously done by Will Ferrell, do not let that stop you from seeing this movie. This is not only a fabulous script, but it is, by far, the best performance Ferrell has ever given. Emma Thompson is absolutely incredible as the author. She makes what her character does seem so normal. Deep down everyone does it to some degree, but she is completely up front about it. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant, of course. Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as well. Her character reminded me that a life I might see as too simple can still be exciting as long as you relax and just be who you are. It's an inspirational, thought-provoking story that you don't want to miss out on."

","I had high expectations for this film, I must say. Marc Forster also directed one of my favourites, Finding Neverland, so I was excited to see how he would direct a comedy. I was wrong, however, about the film being a comedy. There are funny scenes, just a few, but if you are expecting the old ""Anchorman"" Will Ferrell, that's not what you're getting. Will Ferrell shows a new, more mature side in Stranger than Fiction. <br/><br/>I'm not normally a big Will Ferrell fan. And this film does not make me want to go watch ""Talladega Nights"", or any of his other zany films, because after seeing how versatile an actor he actually can be, Talladega would just disappoint me. I've heard it said that Stranger than Fiction is Will Ferrell's ""Eternal Sunshine."" This is almost true. I don't know if Will was allowed to show the emotion that would qualify this as his ""Eternal Sunshine"", but Stranger than Fiction proves to me that Will Ferrell can do drama, and eventually he will be able to star in a film of that caliber. <br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction concerns Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent, who hears a woman's (Emma Thompson) voice narrating almost everything he does. Just as things start to get interesting for Harold (he falls in love), the narrator declares that Harold's death is imminent. The acting in this film was convincing and intriguing. Dustin Hoffman played the distant literaryprofessor to a tee, and Queen Latifah held her own as the author's assistant. I must say, that Maggie Gyllenhaal and Emma Thompson's performances were the best of them all. Maggie brought a great depth to her performance as the not-so-typical love interest, and Emma Thompson was fantastic as usual as the author struggling with writer's block, as well as thoughts of suicide. The film was sweet, funny, and at times heartbreaking. One particular quote spoken by Emma Thompson near the end of the film made the film all the more worthwhile. All in all, with a great script, a great plot, great acting, including a surprising performance by Will Ferrell, Marc Forster's Stranger than Fiction does not disappoint!"
"mindy-81","9","0","2","13 November 2006"," Great Movie
","I loved this movie! I think many people will have a hard time seeing Will Ferrell as a serious actor after he has done so many comedies... and often relied on childish, slapstick humor (and being naked). In this movie his performance is still funny, yet it is much more intelligent and subtle. The meaning of his life, life in general, and the life of Harold Crick (as the narrator's character in her latest novel ""Death and Taxes"") all run together in a way that intrigues me enough to want to see it again. If you liked Punch Drunk Love, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you will probably enjoy Stranger Than Fiction. Do not go if you expect it to be anything like Anchorman or Old School!"

","For those who haven't seen the previews, the basic premise of the movie is this: Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) plays a boring tax auditor who one day starts hearing a woman's voice narrating the events of his life. Emma Thompson's character, Karen Eiffel, is an author who is writing a book and it so happens that the main character in her book is Harold Crick. The things that she writes about her ""fictional"" character Harold Crick are what ends up happening in the real Harold Crick's life. She is famous for killing off her main characters in the end and has struggled for years to find a way to kill off Harold Crick, not knowing that he is a real person and that she is controlling his life.<br/><br/>The film overall has somewhat of a renaissance, awakening, coming of age type of feel to it. Harold starts out as a fairly drab ""tax man"" whose eyes are slowly opened to life and whose emotions begin to bubble up inside of him as Karen Eiffel leads him through a series of life-changing events.<br/><br/>The kicker in the movie is that it engages the viewer into wondering how everything is going to tie together in the end. There are a few instances of foreshadowing like one involving an apple that kept me very interested in what ultimate significance it may hold. Early events that seem like trivial details end up being very important for the ending. There is enough humor to keep the mood light, yet it is subtle enough humor to maintain the tension that should exist in a movie where the main character's ""impending death"" is constantly hanging over him like a cloud.<br/><br/>The movie is smart and witty and I found the acting in it to be quite believable. The intro has some clever visual effects and sets the tone well very early in the movie.<br/><br/>If I had one criticism for the film, it would be that Will Ferrell was at times a little bit too humorous and clever for the type of bean counting tax auditor that it seemed he was supposed to be portraying. Overall, however, I would strongly recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys a good intelligent movie and can deal with one scene of bare male buns in a gym shower and one F bomb."

","The only thing missing was a Rod Serling look a like at the beginning. Will Ferrell gives a worthy performance, a good change of pace from his overly silly roles he is best known for playing. He plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor, who brushes his teeth a certain way, goes to work, eats lunch and dinner, like it was a daily routine. His existences in life seems to bring out the worst in some people, like baker Ana Pascal(Maggie Gyllenhaal). Until one morning everything changes when Harold starts hearing a woman's voice, the voice seems to be narrating his every movement. Harold knows he is not crazy, so he turns too professor of literary theory named Jules Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman) who comes to the conclusion that he is a character in a book, but then Harold discovers that woman's voice is author Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson). Will these two ever meet? You'll half too see the movie to find. Everybody gives a good performance. To the people who have not seen this yet, please it is worth it."

","The film follows Harold Crick, a dour Chicago auditor for the Internal Revenue Service who lives alone, eats alone, counts the number of steps he walks for fun, focuses on ways to save time tying his tie and brushes his teeth exactly 72 times (36 up and down, 36 back and forth) and suddenly finds himself the subject of wry narration only he can hear, a narration which begins to affect his entire life. Harold instantly attempts to search for the body of the voice with no success. He realizes the voice does not know that he can hear it and that this voice plans to kill him.<br/><br/>Harold visits a psychologist who misdiagnosis the voice as schizophrenia. Harold, desperate for another answer, asks the psychologist to imagine if it really was a voice who was going to kill him, what would she do? The psychologist recommends a literary expert. Harold then goes to Professor Jules Hilbert to find out who the author of his life is and to stop her from killing him. They eventually narrow it down to several authors and the professor tells Harold to find out if the ""book"" (his life) is a comedy or a tragedy. All the while, Harold develops a love interest in a woman he is auditing, Ana. Ana first rejects him, prompting him to believe the ""book"" is a tragedy, but slowly she shows a liking for him.<br/><br/>Back at Hilbert's, as they are trying to decode the author, the TV switches to show an author speaking, Harold realizes the author of his life is a woman named Karen Eiffel. Hilbert tells him she is known for bringing about the demises of her main characters. Harold then begins a frantic search to find her to stop his death. He eventually tracks her down by finding her phone number through IRS reports and meets with her. He tells her that he found her through Hilbert, and that he is her character. She is then stunned to find that what ever she writes happens to Harold Crick. She gives him the manuscript of the story and tells him he deserves to know. Harold, before he reads it, gives it to Hilbert to read first. Harold then goes home and lives his life as he would want (buying a guitar, no longer wearing neck ties, spending time with someone else, in this case Ana). When Harold receives the manuscript back from Hilbert the next day, Hilbert tells him it's a masterpiece and cannot be changed. Harold then gets on a city bus and spends all day there reading the manuscript front to back. When he's done, he gets off and bumps into Karen again. Harold tells her that it is a masterpiece and he will die this meaningful death. Harold then spends his last night with Ana and then wakes up ready to face his destiny.<br/><br/>Karen calmly narrates his life: his waking up, his getting ready, and eventually heading to the bus stop. At the bus stop, Harold and a group of about a dozen others are waiting for the city bus when a little boy on his bike comes riding along. Attempting to cross the street, he falls off directly in the path of the oncoming bus. Harold leaps forward, pushing him out of the way, but gets struck and killed by the bus.<br/><br/>Back in her office, Karen ponders how many people she's killed, how many lives she ruined and decides that she has to go back and save Harold. Feeling guilty, she decides to rewrite the ending so that Harold lives."
"musicalphan1216","10","0","2","12 November 2006"," Ferrell's best performance by far.
","Nothing annoys me more than an average and unoriginal film that I forget before I've left the theatre. I prefer movies that are either extremely poignant and thought provoking, or silly comedies that don't require much brain-work. As a dedicated fan of Will Ferrell, naturally I was expecting 'Stranger Than Fiction' to be another of those silly comedies, which I was fine with, however this movie turned out be so completely removed from my pre-conceived notion of the typical Ferrell-style comedy and instead has become the first (in which I hope there will be many more) Ferrell-style drama.<br/><br/>While I love Will because he can alway give me a good laugh, I had to wonder whether or not he would ever branch out into the world of dramatic acting, or if next summer he and Adam McKay would spring another version of the Ron Burgendy/ Ricky Bobby story on us. However, in 'Fiction,' he gives the most stunning performance of his career. While Ferrell delivers plenty of laughs, it's his dramatic side that is a real treat. Finally, he's proved he is capable of delivering an emotional performance. He brings a sweetness to Harold Crick instead of silliness, so despite the fact that he's an IRS auditor, you'll find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. At first, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to take Ferrell seriously as a dramatic performer, but his performance is so smooth and effortless that was sucked in right away, almost to a point where 'Elf' is no longer satisfying seeing as he's more than capable of performing at such a higher level.<br/><br/>In addition to a wonderfully satisfying performance from Will Ferrell, 'Stranger Than Fiction' was an extremely satisfying film as a whole. It's just different, in a good way. Kudos to Zack Helm for such a wonderfully unique screenplay. This isn't your average, predictable romantic comedy, it's not a tragic love story, it's not 'Anchorman' revisited, it's not a remake of something that came out in the 70s. I found it a truly enjoyable film simply because it's something I hadn't seen before. Just for originality it deserves a prefect 10, and for treating us to a side of Will Ferrell that was long overdue!"
"mfsor","8","0","2","11 November 2006"," Logically moving
","It was a great premise and a great exit. I mean the ending depends on the narrator realizing something about a character which changes the narrator's view, personal attitude towards, the character. Once the fated character accepts his fate because it is good, the character becomes more than a fictional character and cannot be destroyed. This is the way gods view humans, as beings which can be saved if they have certain good characteristics. Using the writer as a god is an excellent tool to bring this idea across. Thus, the whole logic of the film is moving for the audience, i.e., the audience realizes at the end that the altruistic character cannot simply suffer at the hands of a god. Which is logically clever because it allows the narrator to change the original fate of the character."

The direction was excellent.<br/><br/>BUT! I can say that Will Ferrell was amazing. This performance by the outlandish comedian was not amazing because he stepped out and did something different. He has done some serious comedic work like in Melinda and Melinda and Winter Passing. This was just an excellent performance by a honest, caring, and truthful actor. This was a performance i would expect from a Dustin Hoffman (who was also excellent). Not that i am comparing the two time Oscar winner with Will Ferrell. I am only saying that Will Ferrel was understated, poignant, and funny. This was a performance as good as Paul Giamatti in Sideways. This is a performance that deserves a nomination for Best Actor. This performance will surely win a Golden Globe for Will Ferrell. I hope that it wins him an Oscar for him as well.<br/><br/>As for the movie; it is better than every movie it has been compared too.

"dfranzen70","8","0","2","11 November 2006"," Ferrell good in dramatic role; film is a true winner
","It's been said that when an comedic actor decides to take a turn at dramatic emoting, the results usually veer more toward the cloying, oversentimental than toward the sincere. (Think Bill Murray in The Razor's Edge, not two decades later in Lost in Translation.) And Will Ferrell, star of such wacky fun as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby, wouldn't at first glance seem to be the type of actor with the necessary range to carry a dramatic role. But Ferrell, miraculously pulls it off.<br/><br/>Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS auditor who's, shall we say, fastidious. He has routines, you see, from the number of brushstrokes his teeth get to the number of steps he takes to get to his bus stop. A place for everything, and everything in its place. In short, the sort of punctual, detail-oriented soul that an entity such as the IRS love to have on its side.<br/><br/>Everything's moving along smoothly for Harold, at least as much as it's moving at all. He lives a solitary life both in and out of work and has no dreams or ambitions. But everything changes when he's brushing his teeth one morning and hears a British woman's voice narrating his actions.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that Harold's well-ordered life could hardly stand even the slightest deviance, it's easy to see how he might completely wig out over this, and that's about what happens. The HR department wants to talk to him, and then he's shuffled over to an in-house doctor (Tom Hulce) and then finally to a college professor (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to figure out the identity of Harold's mysterious novelist through literary means.<br/><br/>So now things aren't moving along smoothly, although they are moving along. Until Harold hears some ominous words in his head that suggest that he'll soon be killed off.<br/><br/>In the hands of a comedic actor who lacks range, this would have been a maudlin, treacly pile of goo. But because Ferrell is so wonderfully understated, you instantly empathize with Harold. And that's no small feat, considering the wild implausibility of hearing someone's voice in your head; the movie ran the real risk of alienating its audience when it desperately needed it to identify with the main character.<br/><br/>Another highlight is the sweet, caring relationship that develops between Harold and Gyllenhaal's character, Ana. Physically, they're an oddball couple - he's quite tall, she's quite not - and personality-wise the two actors seem kind of a mismatch. But although their characters suffer through some necessary awkwardness, the two actors are able to make their union believable and desirable. In other words, they look great together.<br/><br/>As Kay Eiffel, the novelist in Harold's head, Emma Thompson brings a coffee-and-cigarettes nihilism to the role; she's supposed to kill Harold off, but she doesn't know quite how to do that; her publisher has sent her an assistant (the always solid Queen Latifah) to encourage things so Eiffel meets her deadline.<br/><br/>Thanks to beautiful performances by Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal, an exceptional supporting cast, and a script that doesn't nosedive into oversentimentality but does sprinkle in some genuine laughs, Stranger than Fiction is an exuberant, charming film."

It's pleasant to see Will Farrell as a low-key melancholic rather than his mundane alter-ego. Usually when a movie tries to juggle between a tragedy or a comedy, it fails...this one doesn't. It was obviously intended to entertain us on many levels and its poignancy, especially at its end, makes it heartfelt. Maggie Gyllenhaal is delightful as the free-spirited and earthy love interest and Dustin Hoffman's vast experience shines through as a likable yet vile literary guru. It's always refreshing to see a film and think of a particular word that can sometimes be its biggest compliment: original!"
"TheMovieMark","8","0","2","10 November 2006"," A compelling collision of fiction and reality ensues.
","If you're looking for a ""Will Ferrell comedy"" where he runs around acting stupid, screaming at the top of his lungs, and basically annoying the (Fergie's Music) out of me then you need to keep on lookin'. What I'm about to say will soon become a cliché, but this is a different role for Ferrell, and I happen to think that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Is ""subduedness"" a word? If so then that's what Ferrell brings to Harold Crick. *pulls out the dictionary* Cool, it is a real word! Just a slightly awkward one. Fine, we'll say Ferrell underplays this just enough to make Harold the sweet, innocent hero that he is required to be for us to cheer for him to find that alternate ending. Better?<br/><br/>Harold seems like a tough guy not to like. Until you find out he's a tax man. Plus, he's a little obsessive. He counts the strokes when he's brushing his teeth. He knows the exact number of steps he must take to reach the bus every morning. He takes a 45.7-minute lunch break and a 4.3-minute coffee break. Everything is a routine, and he relies on his wristwatch to keep him on track.<br/><br/>Contrast that with the woman he's sent to audit - the tax-evadin', anarchy-lovin' bakery owner Ana Pascal (played by the extremely personable Maggie Gyllenhaal). It's a match made seemingly, well, not in Heaven, so when they start to have feelings for each other you really don't expect to buy it. But you know what? It works! The romance is simple and subtle, and surprisingly believable.<br/><br/>But the meat of the story, the ol' sauce on the steak as grandpa used to say, revolves around Harold's efforts to figure out from whence the voice in his head is coming. Whereas I'm about to initiate some efforts to find out why I just used ""from whence."" Harold really needs to figure out what to do once he hears her talk about his death. Is his life a comedy or a tragedy? Can he change his fate, or should he resign himself to accepting what appears to be inevitable? <br/><br/>I can hear you now (you crazy voice in my head!) - how do you take a story about a real-life man who slowly learns his life is some weird product of fiction and make it work? How do you deliver a satisfying ending to such a perplexing structure? Well, I had the same questions. I didn't know if it'd pull it off, but it does, and all I can say, without giving too much away, is the proof is in the viewing.<br/><br/>A viewing experience that is unique in how it takes so many elements of different genres and figures out how to make them work together. There are laughs, there's drama, there's fantasy, and as I mentioned earlier, there's a little romance as well. In fact...<br/><br/>*puts down man card* <br/><br/>Ferrell gives Gyllenhaal a gift that inspired the most amount of ""awwwwws"" from the audience that I've heard at a movie this year. I have to admit, it really is a sweet moment.<br/><br/>*picks up man card* <br/><br/>I liked the structure of the story, and Emma Thompson's narration is handled in such a way that it adds a little mystery and keeps you guessing how the story will wrap. I was even impressed with some of the visuals in the film, specifically the manifestations of the numerical analyses in Harold's mind.<br/><br/>The first 2/3rds of the movie set everything up so well that I was really scared of a disappointing payoff. I wasn't necessarily rooting for a ""happy"" ending; I simply wanted a satisfying one. If it were true that Harold must die for the book to be Emma's masterpiece, then sell me on it. However, if Emma could figure out an alternate ending, then sell me on that.<br/><br/>As always, I won't reveal what happens. I recommend you watch it and find out on your own. So I'll just sum up my final opinion this way - sold.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>You might be disappointed if you want another over-the-top Will Ferrell comedy. However, those of you in the mood for a less annoying side of Ferrell, a mix of drama and comedy, and something a little different and inspiring should consider giving Stranger than Fiction a chance."

What I will tell you is that you should be prepared to laugh and tear up and to go on an emotional roller coaster. The acting was phenomenal and I felt that Will was the perfect person for this role. From his many years on SNL, we have seen him make us laugh in situations where he is unaware of the humor and there is a lot of that in this movie.

","Marc Forster's latest film maybe stranger than fiction, but thankfully it's also much better than the average movie playing at your local theater, well almost. It's seems that ever since Scorsese's Departed just about every week there's been a new movie that's actually really good and finally there seems to be a reason to keep returning to the movies. Hey, they're finally making some good stuff for a change! In Stranger than Fiction Will Ferrell plays a calm and orderly IRS auditor named Harold Crick; a man who lives for his job, day in and day out. Harold seemingly has one friend at work, Dave (played by Tony Hale, formerly of TV's Arrested Development), no private relationships and no personal life what-so-ever, and his entire existence is about getting up and going to and from work. Harold is stuck in a never-ending routine that is disturbed one morning while brushing his teeth. While counting the number of brush strokes Harold begins to hear a strange woman's voice narrating the things he's doing as he's doing them. The voice is that of Kay Eiffel, a depressed, chain smoking and very talented author whose come down with a serious case of writer's block. When Harold discovers that Kay's novels are quite famous for their tragic endings, where the hero always dies, he seeks the help of literary professor Jules Hibert, played by the always entertaining Dustin Hoffman, to help get to the bottom of Harold's problem.<br/><br/>Two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gives a wonderfully distressed performance as the author that shakes up Harold's life, and Queen Latifah plays an assistant brought in to help Kay break through her writer's block and get back to finishing her new novel. Harold is driven crazy by the voice of the narrator in his head, and is heart is aching for a feisty young woman named Ana, played with a free and wild spirit by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who he's assigned to audit for failing to pay all her taxes as a way of sticking' it to the government. As Harold comes closer and closer to his demise he falls in love with Ana and discovers how sweet life can be with just a few cookies and a glass of milk. Life can be so sweet; we just have to go after it, each and every day. But time is running out for Harold and he is desperately trying to track down this mysterious author while there's still time to stop her from finishing her novel.<br/><br/>Director Marc Forster, whose last films included last year's Stay and the imaginative Finding Neverland has crafted a wonderfully entertaining and equally smart film with some great performances from one of the best ensemble casts this year, right next to Little Miss Sunshine. Will Ferrell gives what is easily his best performance of his career, and his most sincerely enjoyable since Elf. Stranger than Fiction does for Will Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine did for Jim Carrey; it's just the right material for the right actor, and I'd love to see Farrell do more roles like this one and lay off the Anchorman kind of stuff for awhile and give him some room to grow as an actor. I don't know what its Oscar chances are, but given the films that have already come out this fall in my book all bets are off; expect a very close and interesting Oscar race.<br/><br/>Stranger than Fiction is part comedy, part drama and part romance; there's a little bit of something for everyone. I found myself getting so wrapped up in the film's premise and constantly thinking to myself; ""How is this all going to come together in the end?"" so much so I was never bored for a single moment and not only was I fascinated with it's ideas, but I was also quite touched emotionally with it's engaging performances. I really enjoyed this movie, and more importantly its message. Yes, on the surface Stranger than Fiction may look like a Charlie Kaufman-esquire psycho-babble ""weird $hit happens"" movie in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, but beneath it all there's something that those films didn't quite have  a beating heart, without all the cynicism."

Coincidentally, or by design, that movie, ""Stay"" was also directed by Marc Forster. As a result, I guarantee I will not miss a single Marc Forster movie no matter what diversion may attempt to block me. His direction was sheer genius. I truly believe that Forster deserves an Oscar for this movie (he really deserved it for Stay too).<br/><br/>This may scare some people away but I hope not. Book-readers should be encouraged, though. Watching this movie was exactly like sitting down in your favorite chair in an atmosphere you choose, with a book you cannot put down. I have not read a good book in a very long time and I suppose it is mostly because I do not feel I have time to read a book. But after watching this movie, I felt like I soaked in everything just like you do with a good book. I felt like I was part of this remarkable experience and not the client in a sales job.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell was remarkable! I have not been a great fan of his and always thought he should have stayed with Saturday Night Live. But his performance takes him out of the scatterbrain slapstick comic mold. He was so charming in this movie, I hope he can refrain from going back to silly, nonsensical, nonstop slapstick. But never fear, he was still comical when it was required and beautifully so.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal was seductive, beautiful and totally enchanting. As the person everyone loved she proved to be just that. She easily had the ""Meg Ryan innocent young woman with a delicious smile"" appeal but was able to also exhibit the kind of power hard headed people have when they make up their minds to hate someone.<br/><br/>Queen Latifah added her charm as a mysterious, dedicated and determined beauty who made her presence known but kept you in the dark with her performance.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman provided everything that only he can. Subtlety was a total stranger to this direct, arrogant, yet totally charming and strange professor. I didn't mention funny did I? He was that, too.<br/><br/>After all is said and done, no performance was as satisfying as Emma Thompson's. She also should be up for an Oscar nomination. The characterizations, mannerisms, timing and expressions were a professional's dream come true  perfect, without flaw.<br/><br/>Zach Helm should not be left out. He wrote such a strange and certainly satisfying story that everyone helped to make a masterpiece which I will see again and again. I might even start reading again because of him.<br/><br/>If you are a book-reader who believes movies are a waste of time or a movie goer who cannot stand to sit and read a book, do not miss this magical work of art. You will find yourself stunned.<br/><br/>This, in all its glory, gets a perfect 10 from me!!"

","Q: When is a Will Ferrel movie not a Will Ferrel movie? A: When it's ""Stranger Than Fiction"".<br/><br/>In the wake of movies like Charlie Kaufman's oeuvre (""Eternal Sunshine..."", ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"") and ""I Heart Huckabees"" comes this more-hit-than-miss what-if story about IRS auditor Harold Crick, a borderline obsessive-compulsive who only learns how to live when he discovers he's going to die.<br/><br/>Pretty standard stuff, but it's handled with a zinger: he hears a voice in his head, telling him what's happening to him at that moment. A narrator. It turns out he's a character in a novel-in-progress by a writer who's infamous for tragically killing off her main characters. And Harold doesn't want to die, despite the fact that he really has nothing to live for.<br/><br/>There's little astonishing in this modestly funny movie, but it's so entertaining and intellectually stimulating that its faults are more than outweighed by its pluses. Will Ferrel has to get the lion's share of the praise here; he goes from near-catatonic at the start of the film to being a very lovable and root-for-able everyman stand-in by film's end. He admirably keeps his comic persona almost completely under wraps here, only allowing it to show in very tightly controlled peeks here and there.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast? Emma Thompson is fine (if a bit showy) as the writer trying to figure out how to kill Harold. Queen Latifah is utterly wasted here as the assistant sent by the writer's publisher to help her complete the book; I'm not even sure why her character was included, as she adds nothing to the story except to provide the pressure from the publisher to finish the book which will lead to our hero's demise.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman is a hard-edged college professor of literature that Harold turns to for help in understanding how he became a character in a book. While Hoffman could have done this in his sleep, he still throws off a spark or two above the call of duty.<br/><br/>And Maggie Gyllenhaal. as the anarchist baker that Harold unexpectedly falls for during an audit, is adorable. How could anyone resist falling for her? She's so good in this I almost bought the story convenience of her rapid switch from repulsion to attraction for Harold.<br/><br/>Did I mention there are some problems with the plotting? Without getting too heavily into the details, things are just slightly implausible. I don't mean the part where Harold's wristwatch develops a mind and agenda of its own, or how Harold seems to drift in and out of his job without any repercussions, or even the biggie: how a writer can inexplicably begin writing about and thereby determine the destiny of a real person. No, I mean that things just kind of happen because they need to in some cases, not because they actually make a whole heck of a lot of sense.<br/><br/>You can argue that the whole movie is allegory, that the characters are stand-ins for the human condition, and you'd have a strong case. And the sheer interest this movie generates for its characters allows most of these things to be willfully ignored by a person having a good time.<br/><br/>But these niggling details wet down the wings this movie would use to soar to greatness.<br/><br/>""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a sweet fairy tale and is enjoyable as such. It even contains meaning beyond its surface in symbolic terms. But it is no ""Finnegan's Wake"" or ""Ulysses"", for better and worse. You could do far, far worse than to watch this movie."
