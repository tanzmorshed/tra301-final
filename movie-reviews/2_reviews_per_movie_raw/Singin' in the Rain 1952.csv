","Can you imagine? Me, a film lover since the age of six, hadn't seen ""Singing In The Rain"" until last night. I had read and heard so much about it over the years that I knew I was going to be disappointed. As a musical I've never seen anything so perfectly ""in tune"" I can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. I've seen even Federico Fellini here. The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in ""Will and Grace"" She hasn't lost her zest. I'm sure I'll be seeing this movie many times and I intend to show it to very young people from the post MTV generation and I'm betting with myself that they're going to love it. Greatness is timeless."

","Last year I was very lucky to catch this on the big screen. This film is meant to be seen on the big screen! It was also the first time I saw it at the theaters and I was very impressed with the visuals.<br/><br/>In this film movies are switching over from being silent to being ""talkies"". However the film is a spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the movie industry in the late 1920s when movies when the change over went from silent to sound. When two silent movie stars', Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, latest movie is made into a musical a chorus girl is brought in to dub Lina's speaking and singing. Don is on top of the world until Lina finds out.<br/><br/>This is such a great film that if you ever get the chance to see this at the movies then DO IT.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds made an awesome team."
"BrandtSponseller","10","109","134","1 May 2005"," A fabulous musical romance about film technology
","Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in ""The Nanny"" (1993).<br/><br/>Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.<br/><br/>But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and d√©nouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.<br/><br/>But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.<br/><br/>Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended ""Broadway Rhythm Ballet"" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, ""rain"" is pouring down on him.<br/><br/>While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you're relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start."
"ToldYaSo","9","161","206","24 May 1999"," The title alone will have you humming the song
","I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, ""Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance."" Or even more ridiculous, ""Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance."" Forget about suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.<br/><br/>With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.<br/><br/>They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by ""talkies"" with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.<br/><br/>One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one's caliber to make me sit up and take notice."
"jotix100","10","64","80","2 January 2006"," The talkies
","The transition from the silent film era to the newly arrived technique of the 'talkies' proved to be the ruin for many well established stars that were great on the screen, but who had no professional training in the theater, or otherwise, and had horrible speaking voices. Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.<br/><br/>That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: ""Singin' in the Rain"". The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.<br/><br/>MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno. As if those names weren't big enough, there is the fantastic musical numbers that even, viewing them today, have kept their freshness because of the care in which this film was crafted.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the best musicals of all times. It's right up there with the best of them thanks to the vision of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and it will live forever as more people discover this wonderful example of entertainment."
"preppy-3","10","95","125","22 January 2005"," One of the best Hollywood musicals
","This isn't my all time favorite (that goes to ""Meet me in St. Louis"") but this is definitely in the top 10. This is a fictitous musical comedy of the 1920s when silent films became ""talkies"". It chronicles how it affects Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), his leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and Lockwood's new girlfriend Kathey Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...<br/><br/>This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, ""Make 'Em Laugh"", ""Beautiful Girl"", ""Good Morning"" on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: ""Fit as a Fiddle"" which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and ""Would You?"" at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his ""Make Em' Laugh"" number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.<br/><br/>I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem. This remains one of the 10 best movie musicals ever made. HIGHLY recommended!"

","Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.<br/><br/>The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his ""second banana"" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ing√©nue trying to break into films. <br/><br/>The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" classic; all three in the ""Good Mornin'"" number; O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh""; and Kelly and Reynolds in ""You Were Meant for Me."" The masterpiece however may be the ""Gotta Dance"" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charisse¬ójust perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses Supposes.""<br/><br/>There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the ""Beautiful Girl"" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. <br/><br/>Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.<br/><br/>The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly ""lip syncing"" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the ""I Would, Would You"" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing ""Singin' in the Rain"" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.<br/><br/>Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams ""I LOVE YOU"" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.<br/><br/>A great film!"

","Many good things can be and have been said about this one and they're all true.  It's a great movie.  The title number gives us Don Lockwood (Kelly)...In love as no other person has ever been in love, no doubt.  He steps out the door and it's raining but he's oblivious to the rain.  Who needs an umbrella when you've got wings on your heart and on your feet? Not the incomparable Gene Kelly as he treats us to THE single finest moment in the history of cinema.

It is a great script that was made better by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens' fluid direction. Everything in this movie glides effortlessly. Throw in dancing by Donald O'connor, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse and of course Gene Kelly, Great songs and the willingness of producer Arthur Freed to let the creative people to do their thing and you have a classic."

","Singing In The Rain is to me the greatest musical ever made, sure many others push it close, The Wizard Of Oz for one will always be a 10/10 movie in my opinion, but Singing In The Rain is a film that has no flaws, it is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Don Lockwood is a star of silent movies but his life is boring, then talking movies arrive and with them he eyes an opportunity to greatly improve his life. A chance encounter with dancer Kathy Selden will further shape his destiny, and along with best pal and partner Cosmo Brown, their respective fortunes will hopefully dovetail towards fulfillment.<br/><br/>Where do you start? The film is a homage to happiness, be it film making or love, or friendships and honour, the film is pure and simply joyous from the first reel to the triumphant last shot. Featuring stunning choreography, Singing In The Rain doesn't cop out by merely having characters plodding thru a script and then bursting into song occasionally, each song furthers the characters and fleshes out the story unfolding to keep the plot lines tight and crucially, important.<br/><br/>Make 'Em Laugh, Good Morning, and Singing In The Rain are just some of the brilliant songs and dance routines on show here, with the latter a now legendary piece of cinematic history that speaks volumes for the joyous nature of the film, whilst the finale sequence of the 'Broadway Ballet' is magic & elegance personified. The cast are uniformly excellent, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor & Debbie Reynolds interplay together like they were hatched from the same egg, and the joint direction from Stanley Donen (along with Kelly) is seamless.<br/><br/>Full of hat tipping and self-referencing winks, Singing In The Rain regularly hits the top ten lists of critics and movie fans alike, so lets not beat around the bush about it...it flipping well deserves it. 10/10 in every respect."
"cinemel","10","78","108","25 January 1999"," The dancingest, funniest musical of Hollywood's golden age.
","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the ""Fit as a Fiddle"" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical ""Make 'em Laugh"" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later ""An American in Paris.""<br/><br/>What makes ""Singin'"" such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her ""fingernails on a blackboard"" voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.<br/><br/>This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.<br/><br/>This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age."

","This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.<br/><br/>Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.<br/><br/>Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like ""Singin' in the Rain.""<br/><br/>There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (""She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!"") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (""Fit as a Fiddle,"" ""Good Mornin'"").<br/><br/>Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to ""You Were Meant for Me."" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.<br/><br/>Great stuff!<br/><br/>If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!<br/><br/>PS: In the ""rent-this-too"" category, if you've seen and love ""Singin' in the Rain,"" check out ""The Band Wagon."" It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"
"ecjones1951","10","74","107","10 September 2005"," The Divine Miss Charisse
","I'm going to confine my comments about ""Singin' in the Rain"" to the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.<br/><br/>Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know¬Ö as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.<br/><br/>And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion¬ónot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.<br/><br/>Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.<br/><br/>Wonderful."

","Everybody knows Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the films title number, but this is just one of the many magical musical numbers in this epic piece of blissful entertainment. Set during the turbulent period when Hollywood was converting from silent films to sound, ¬ëSingin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of everything that is good and right about movie-making. Gene Kelly in his greatest role is an all singing, all dancing sensation and his acting is pretty damn good too. Donald O'Connor excels as his exuberant sidekick and almost steals the show with the unsurpassed ¬ëMake ¬ëem Laugh'. Debbie Reynolds is feisty and sexy as Kelly's love interest, while Jean Hagen gives one of the screen's greatest supporting performances as the horrid Lena Lamont, a silent screen goddess whose voice will just not cut it in talkies.<br/><br/>The musical numbers flow fast and furious as Gene and Donald perform amazing feats of choreography with ¬ëFit as a Fiddle' and ¬ëMoses Supposes' while ¬ëGood Mornin' will have you dancing in the aisles. If ¬ëSingin' in the Rain' had no musical numbers it would still be a contender for the funniest film ever made. The problems with experiments with sound films are painfully funny, and Kelly's silent sparring with the demonic Hagen is hilarious. The accolade of sheer perfection can be conferred on few films, and such a title is perhaps even an understatement in this case. And never before did rain look like so much fun."
"MovieAddict2016","9","13","17","28 December 2003"," What a glorious feeling, indeed!
","Everybody remembers the scene. It's the one where he walks along the street, dancing, and singin' in the rain. The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, ""Grease"" (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is ""Make 'em Laugh.""<br/><br/>Not many people know, however, that Gene Kelly had a 103 degree fever during the filming of the infamous scene -- a dangerous thing to do, in retrospect, considering that he was flailing about and working up a sweat in pouring water with such a high temperature. But even then, not many people know that the ""rain water"" pouring down on the joyously cheesy street was actually composed of water and milk. The milk was added to the mix in an effort to achieve the effect of raindrops showing up on screen. (Mel Gibson noted once that most of the time during the filming of ""Braveheart"" it was raining around them, but it was basically impossible to notice any rainfall in the film since the sheets of liquid were so thin.)<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" can probably be called the greatest musical of all time, even though my guilty pleasure is ""Grease"" (how outdated the film is, and yet how amusing it remains!). Every serious filmgoer knows this movie, and just yesterday as I watched Britain's countdown to the greatest musical ever made, I noted that ""Singin' in the Rain"" was high on the list (""Grease"" was no. 1, although any list that posts ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical"" higher on a list than ""Singin' in the Rain"" can't be trusted).<br/><br/>Don Lockwood (Kelly) is a silent film star in 1927, an ex-musician living an on-screen romance with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and letting the publicity take their screen relationship to a whole new level (think Ben and Jen's recent tabloid romance). The press loves to think that its two biggest stars are the nation's cutest couple, but in reality Lockwood despises Lamont, and Lamont -- having read trashy magazines -- believes their relationship to be factual. ""Oh, Donny!"" Lina cries. ""You couldn't kiss my like that and not mean it just a teensy bit!"" Lockwood: ""Meet the greatest actor in the world -- I'd rather kiss a tarantula."" Lina: ""You don't mean that."" Lockwood: ""I don't? Hey Joe, get me a tarantula!""<br/><br/>When the silent film studio begins the transition from silent film to new ""talkies,"" it means that Lockwood will have to take acting lessons in able to learn to truly be able to act, and Lamont -- a squeaky-voiced young lady -- will have to learn to learn proper grammar. (Some scenes with a grammar instructor reminded me of ""My Fair Lady,"" truth be told, although it was filmed 12 years afterwards.)<br/><br/>Lockwood meets a young girl named Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who refuses to fall victim to his Hollywood charm but eventually learns to love the guy after he gets her out of a tight squeeze or two.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lockwood's pal, Cosmo (O'Connor), suggests that they start to stage film musicals instead of feature ""talkies"" -- that way, all Lockwood needs to do is sing and dance, something he already excels at. (""Make a musical! The new Don Lockwood: he yodels! He jumps about to music!"")<br/><br/>But people want Lockwood and Lamont, not Lockwood by himself, and the prospect of losing money is not a bright prospect for the film company. So Lina is filmed in the musicals with him, and towards the end of our film, sweet young Kathy dubs over Lina's voice and is given no credit for the task. Lamont is too embarrassed to admit that she can't sing, and so she blackmails the film distributor -- if they credit Kathy at the end of her new feature film, she'll take legal action.<br/><br/>And so comes the climatic finale on stage as Lockwood reveals the true singer behind the film (ironic, since it was Lamont herself who dubbed over Reynolds' voice during the sequence). As Roger Ebert noted, the scene where Lockwood bursts onto stage and fingers out Kathy from the crowd of onlookers is corny, but it's sweet and exactly the time of emotionally uplifting moment that is rarely made nowadays.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly's notorious cruelty on the set of ""Singin' in the Rain"" has become a sort of folklore, and it's true. He berated the actors if they messed up a single dance number. O'Connor later admitted that he was extremely frightened to make a single mistake, afraid that Kelly would lash out at him.<br/><br/>That strictness doesn't shine through Kelly's character in ""Singin' in the Rain."" In fact, many of the dance moves (such as the frantic splashing in the puddles) look quite haphazard, but they were all choreographed to an extreme.<br/><br/>Is that why the film is highly regarded as perhaps the definitive American musical? That probably has something to do with it. I think it's mostly the joy of it all, though -- bright, cheery, happy, and uplifting, the film is one of the most purely fun films of all time. It doesn't demand anything like some films, but it gives a lot back.<br/><br/>The ads for ""Singin' in the Rain"" promised a glorious feeling, and in that way the film lives up to its slogan. It is fun and bright and glorious and entertaining. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it offers the viewer a chance to experience something quite rare -- an all-around great movie.<br/><br/>
What a glorious feeling, indeed.<br/><br/>5/5."

","This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better!<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song ""Singin' In the Rain,"" featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.<br/><br/>A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs."

","It has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film.  And while the case holds water, it is not entirely correct.  As `Singin' In the Rain,' so eloquently shows; comedy, charm, music, and dance can all be featured successfully within one film.<br/><br/>`Singin In the Rain,' is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time.  Roger Ebert, the late Gene Siskel, Leonard Maltin, and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion.  The plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years, ever since `the talkies' were born in the late 20s.  The screenplay was written according to the songs.  Although the cast had been cast,  and re-cast several times; the end result was one of perfect chemistry.  The combination of the ever-so talented Gene Kelly (arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever) and Debbie Reynolds worked very well, despite complications that arose off the set. And Donald O'Connor was born for his role as Cosmo Brown, the best buddy to Kelly's Don Lockwood.  His wit keeps the film fresh and funny.  If you took a drink for every smart remark he made, you'd be drunk, before Lockwood gets the girl!<br/><br/>All the characters in this film are dynamic, save Cosmo Brown and Lena Lamont (played by Jean Hagen).  This was perfect for what was called for, for this film to succeed.  This helps the film `move,' where other musicals fail.  This is where the irony enters; since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy.  Being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered, even to this day. Even, MGM, which was known as `the king of the musicals', failed more often than it succeeded.  To this day, no one has mastered it; although Disney has almost reached MGM proportions with its animation department.<br/><br/>As the film opens, the premiere for one of the famed `Lockwood/Lamont' films is taking place for `The Royal Rascal.' As the stars arrive, one by one, Cosmo Brown arrives.  A bit later Lockwood and Lamont arrive. Lockwood tells a `story' of how he and Cosmo get to stardom.  To celebrate the release, there is a party at the studio's producer's house.  But to get there, Lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else, finding Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) in the process.  After a few cute surprises and accidents, Don gets a conscience attack.  After finally finding her, he realizes that he cares for her.  Meanwhile, Cosmo Brown keeps up his antics and funny nature.  The comic relief is never amiss in this film.  Lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something, but what?  What do you think she is, `.dumb or something?'<br/><br/>The co-director (also co-directed by Gene Kelly) Stanley Donen called the `Moses Supposes' dance sequence with Kelly and  O'Connor, the best dance sequence ever.  I agree that it is in the Top 3, but not the best, that's in another film; which Donen directed, for another review.  All numbers in this film are memorable, where most from other films are not.<br/><br/>There is only one detraction in this film.  It is the `Broadway Melody' sequence.  It begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by Mr. Lockwood, trying to convince his producer of something.  But the scene becomes too long and unnecessary.  Cyd Charisse is an amazing talent, but the dance number she has in the film, should have been deleted. It is mesmerizing, but is out of place in this film.  This 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 7-8 max.  Still, this detail is so minute, that it isn't a bad detraction. When this film was released in 1952, it opened to luke-warm reviews and average box office receipts.  It wasn't until it's `10th Anniversary,' that people began to notice that `Singin' In the Rain' was special and has been known as such ever since.  The AFI, when it released it's list of `The 100 Greatest Films Ever,' ranked this film No.10, to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place Ms. Debbie Reynolds as half of the only mother/daughter combination on the list*.  `Singin' In the Rain,' is always fun to watch, the film has also been recently released on DVD with tons of extras.  As enduring as Mr. Kelly's lamppost lean is, so this film echoes Mr. Lockwood's sentiments of nothing; nothing but pure joy that is.<br/><br/>Personal Rating: 99 on a 100 point scale<br/><br/>*Note-Ms. Reynolds' daughter, Carrie Fisher appeared in AFI's No. 15 film, `Star Wars.'"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This is a nearly perfect film from my perspective: It feels naturally improvised. Its episodes are radically discontinuous, but feel like fluid transitions. It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.<br/><br/>But what really puts this on my `must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.<br/><br/>
There were precessors: `Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, `Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: `Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well. But here, the technique becomes visual jazz improvisations on reality. Thrilling.<br/><br/>None of the people involved ever came close on other projects. Odd.<br/><br/>Ted's evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this."
"sibisi73","10","16","22","22 August 2001"," Most entertaining movie ever made!
","A perfect movie in every sense, 'Singin In The Rain' has rightly gone down in history as the best musical picture ever. But it is much more than that. A sparkling comedy, with a cast that is 100% perfect, and one of the best movies about movies ever made too.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly's genius has never been more apparent than in this movie, but, as always he never steals the show, in fact here practically having the show stolen from him by Donald O'Connor's gravity defying 'Make 'Em Laugh' and Jean Hagen's unforgettable Lina Lamont. Kelly's title number is the epitome of carefree nonchalance. The guy's in love and he isn't going to let a little rain get in the way. This 'classic' scene is possibly the feelgood moment to beat all others. I defy anyone not to succumb to the Kelly's Irish charm during this number, if you haven't already been won over.<br/><br/>But a musical is just a musical without a decent story. That's where Comden and Green's pertinent screenplay comes in. Using Nacio Herb Brown's songs from the era in which the movie is set we are taken back to Hollywood in transition, a time when silent movies were ousted by the talkies. For what is generally regarded as just a light-hearted song and dance movie 'Singin In The Rain' takes a pretty accurate line and takes a satirical swipe at the studios and the gossip mongers of the day. There were stars, like Lina Lamont, whose careers disintegrated on the advent of talking pictures, and others, like Kathy Seldon, whose stars were beginning to rise. For a while, there weren't enough voice coaches to go round! The race to match the success of 'The Jazz Singer' was truly chaotic, with studios churning out potboiler after potboiler to cash in on the talking picture. It was also a time when MGM itself started it's reign of the musical genre with epic production numbers, and casts of thousands. In a sense,'Singin In The Rain' both lampoons and celebrates it's own ancestry and place in cinema history.<br/><br/>Exhilarating, exuberant, and mesmerising. Still, in my opinion, the most entertaining, and the best, movie ever made!"

"schappe1","Null","13","18","18 April 2002"," Why it's the best
","There are two kinds of musicals. You can call them different things. You could call them the Hollywood Musical and the Broadway Musical. That's not quite proper because the Hollywood Musical is what the Broadway Musical was in the 20's and 30's, before Rogers and Hammerstein changed everything. maybe a better distinction is the Dancing Musical vs. the Singing Musical, except that both kinds have dancing and singing...<br/><br/>Let's try it this way. The original musicals on Broadway in the 20's and 30's and Hollywood in the 30's and 40's were musicals with a slight storyline, some singing and tremendous dancing numbers. They also have low comedy and plenty of beautiful girls. They usually are about show business itself and many of the numbers take place on the stage. the others seem like the likely result of bringing show people together: of course they are going to sing and dance from time to time. Looking at them these days, the singing is kind of boring, the comics dreadful and the plots the answer to a moron's prayer. It's the dance numbers that are timeless. These films were made for highlight reels like ""That's Entertainment"".<br/><br/>Rogers and Hammerstein changed all that. They took serious plays and converted them into operetta of popular music. Characters who were not in show business at all used songs and dances as soliloquies to reveal their private thoughts. The result was some of the best plays and films of all time- Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Gigi, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, etc. South Pacific was the first film my parent sever took me to see and this is the type of musical I normally prefer. Here songs tended to dominate- ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top, ""Out of My Dreams"", ""People Will Say We're in Love, ""If I Loved You"", ""My Boy Bill"", ""I Have Dreamed"", ""Hello Young Lovers"", ""Some Enchanted Evening"", ""Younger Than Springtime"", etc. ,etc. There are dance pieces but the dancers are on the sidelines.<br/><br/>""Singing in the Rain"" is the greatest of all the Hollywood Musicals. It has the memorable dances a Hollywood Musical needs: ""Make 'Em Laugh"", Singing in the Rain"", ""Good Morning"", ""Broadway Melody"". There is also the best of the Freed-Brown songbook, such as ""You are My Lucky Star"". But it has the strongest story of any of the Hollywood Musicals, thanks to the Comden-Green team and the memories of the early days of sound. it's virtually the only Hollywood Musical that could have held up as a non-musical. It could have just been a comedy about he conversion to sound. it would not have been ""Singing in the Rain"", but it would have been good.<br/><br/>As it is, it's the one musical that has it all."
"silverscreen888","7","11","15","14 November 2005"," Genial, Strongly-Made Satire With Music About the Early Days of Talkies
","""Singin' In the Rain"" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done ""Gotta Dance"" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to ""talk into the flowers"", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, ""Moses Supposes""; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add ""On The Town"" and ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, ""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"", the TV show ""So This is Hollytwood"", and ultimately ""The Great Race"", ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story"" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background."

","Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of ""An American in Paris"", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - ""I love you, I love you, I love you"".<br/><br/>All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number ""Make 'Em Laugh"" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun."

","I was decided to watch this movie, because I knew and already watched the famous sequence of Gene Kelly singing in the rain .(what makes the movie very famous and also gives the name of it). After watching it, I can say that it is a delightful movie with also a pleasant story: They are in 1927, and Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are famous actors in Hollywood, who always make a couple in their movies,making many rumors emerge about their real relationship. The problem is that the movies now are not mute as a year ago, and they couple of actors have difficulties, since both need to take new acting and speech lessons. Lina, however has a horrible voice, needing to be dubbed by Kathy Selden, a young actress who has a beautiful voice, and makes Don fall in love. It's very funny to see the difficulties of the producers of that time, like when they put the microphone in Lina's chest to record her voice, but they also record Lina's heart beats."

","Much as I admire the talents of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, it's really Jean Hagen who provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. Her character also provides the key to the plot for this witty look at Hollywood making the transition to sound films. A pity Hagen wasn't given any of the song numbers to participate in--but that's my only complaint. Everything is in good hands here--Kelly and Reynolds and O'Connor do outstanding jobs. The only other drawback, as I see it, is the extended Broadway musical number Kelly imagines and co-starring Cyd Charisse. It strikes a somewhat jarring note and wasn't really necessary. His song-and-dance routine in the rain is, of course, the most famous highlight--but equally endearing is the 'Good Mornin' number, staged with such style and verve and performed with gusto by the three stars. Betty Comden and Adolph Green provided a supremely funny script, somewhat reminiscent of an older film with Alice Faye and Don Ameche called 'Hollywood Cavalcade'('39), which also dealt with the transition from silent to sound movies. One of the great MGM musicals, not to be missed."
"JaydoDre","6","16","27","23 December 2014"," A bit of a mess.
","Every now and then comes along a movie so iconic, everyone knows its name, even if they haven't seen it. And sometimes the hype greatly overstates the value. Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.<br/><br/>The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old clich√© where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the clich√© is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.<br/><br/>The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.<br/><br/>The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.<br/><br/>The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.<br/><br/>On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.<br/><br/>Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.<br/><br/>As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong. Next time someone asks me to watch this movie, they will need to get me high first, because clearly that is what the makers were when they made it."

But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.<br/><br/>""Singing in the Rain"" is a musical masterpiece, one of those unforgettable movies that the viewer never get tired of watching. The cast is in state of grace, with wonderful interpretations. Jean Hagen is simply fantastic in the role of Lina Lamont, an actress unable to speak correctly and with an awful voice. Debbie Reynolds has a doll face, Donald O'Connor is very funny and Gene Kelly is fantastic. This is certainly one of the best movies ever made. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Cantando na Chuva"" (""Singing in the Rain"")"

","The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on ""Singing' in the Rain"" have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why ""Singin' in the Rain"" was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.<br/><br/>I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made (I liked MGM's ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" more), and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again. I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly, and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing, and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny. But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess, and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career, before she became a broad.<br/><br/>The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film --you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions. But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care. The ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence does what far too few films do -- it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Let's get things straight: this is by no means a bad musical. There are some wonderful numbers- ""Make Em' Laugh"", ""Good Morning"", that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.<br/><br/>I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.<br/><br/>I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers."

","SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.) Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall. The solution? Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals. The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.<br/><br/>In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early ""all talking, all dancing, all singing"" movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers. The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm. As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an energy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.<br/><br/>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love. Whether or not you consider it ""the"" finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.<br/><br/>Gary F.

"slokes","10","6","9","5 May 2005"," It's The Cat's Meow!
","""Singin' In The Rain"" is a musical for people who don't like musicals. Fast, funny, self-aware, and chock full of the best singing and dancing you can cram into 105 minutes, it might as well be the best movie musical since the entire genre peaked here, never to be effectively revived.<br/><br/>Fittingly, the movie focuses on the birth of the Hollywood musical. It's 1927, and the silent-film romantic pair of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) find themselves suddenly wired for sound after ""The Jazz Singer"" inaugurates a new era. While there are a lot of problems for the pair to overcome, including the fact he hates her for the nasty witch she is, the only real problem is that Lina's Godzilla-like ego comes with a Godzilla-like voice. Making their new movie into a musical might then seem a bad idea, except that Don's new girl Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) can sing like a dream, and doesn't mind dubbing Lina.<br/><br/>Knowing humor abounds in this classic, clever film. ""You have to show a movie at a party. It's a Hollywood law,"" says Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Lockwood's buddy. An opening sequence features a Hedda Hopper announcer introducing vogue-ing celebrities at a red-carpet premiere. ""They've been married two months now, and happy as newlyweds,"" she coos as a catatonic couple stroll past.<br/><br/>Even the musical numbers are done with a wink, like ""Beautiful Girl"" and ""All I Do Is Dream Of You."" This would be a great film even if the most famous of those numbers, Kelly's ""Singin' In The Rain,"" was left on the cutting-room floor. There's still ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" the funniest song-and-dance routine ever done (by O'Connor and a mannequin) and ""Good Morning,"" with some of the most intricate tap dancing ever performed times three.<br/><br/>But ""Singin' In The Rain"" IS there, and it fully deserves its place in the pantheon, not only with Kelly's wonderfully irrational exuberance but some incredible camera work that pans over and around him to maximize the uplift in this goose-pimple number.<br/><br/>If only they left out (and not just trimmed) that Broadway musical number near the end, the pseudo-ballet with Cyd Charisse. It pulls us away from the story for 20 minutes, apparently so Kelly could have a section with his favorite dance partner. No one ever looked better on the big screen, or projected such natural-seeming charisma, as Genial Gene, but apparently he could throw his elbows with the best of them. It's obvious how much this film owes to the other director, the playful and creative Stanley Donan. If Kelly stuck to the on screen stuff, this would have been a better film.<br/><br/>But what am I talking about? It's ""Singin' In The Rain""! I can't dock this simply because Kelly had a big ego. He earned it with this great film, a movie milestone. If you never see another movie musical, see this one. You'll be glad you did."

","I watched Singin' in the Rain for the first time ever this afternoon and I think I'm in love. Oh Gene Kelly!.. *What* I would give to have you flash those pearly whites at me! The story is really just a musical about a musical, going into various dream-like sequences embodied in the twelve minute ""Broadway Ballet"". The songs are cleverly intertwined with the acting so there's none of that phoniness one is used to seeing in some musical pictures. To watch the choreography is to watch pure genius. Gene Kelly is so talented it should be outlawed. (It's downright sacrilegious he wasn't nominated for the Academy Award¬Æ!)  I mean - DAMN! I kept backing up to the 'Singin' in the Rain' part seventy-five times in a row...it fills me with such a sense of joy! My Gramps once broke his ankle trying to imitate ol' Gene. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is perfect as well, you really must hand it to Debbie Reynolds! She wasn't a trained dancer up until this point. They made her rehearse eight hours a day, hiring different dance instructors to work with the young actress in shifts. The stress proved so overwhelming she eventually had a breakdown and caught the attention of neighboring Fred Astaire who asked, ""Why are you crying?"" Not able to recognize the man through her tears, Reynolds confessed she felt hopeless and would never meet Kelly's standards. Astaire led her to another rehearsal room where he was busy working on Royal Wedding. ""You come watch me,"" he said. ""You watch how hard I work. I don't cry, but I do get frustrated and upset and I'm going to let you watch."" The experience showed her how a legendary performer like Astaire, known for his elegant moves on the dance floor, can even feel daunted : )<br/><br/>Finally, what else can I say (other than Cyd Charisse wears the hottest dress I've ever seen)? This is one of THE greatest films of any genre ever! They just don't make 'em like this anymore."

","SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) **** Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O' Connor, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno.  One of the most beloved and greatest Hollywood musicals ever showcases the divine gifts of musical comedy in the fetching forms of the always subliminally graceful balletic Kelly, rubber-limbed amiability of O' Connor and wholesomely adorable Reynolds as struggling silent screen era film stars (and wannabes) who are at the cusp of the Talkie era to be that will only strengthen the trio in friendship and ultimately romantic true love.  Hagen is a stitch as the Noo Yawky cartoon-voice afflicted shrew co-star of Kelly in their ascent to stardom.  Moreno has a small role as Hagen's equally troublemaking flapper gal pal and look close for character actress/comic foil Kathleen Freeman as Hagen's diction coach (she'd have her hands equally full in several Jerry Lewis vehicles to come).  Filmed in bravura color bursting from the screen with indelible images of eye candy in bountiful cornucopia with its striking backlot sets, larger-than-life costumes and masterful direction by Kelly and the indomitable Stanley Donen featuring Kelly's indelible iconic moment performing the titular tune in resplendent glee and amor du jour.  Kudos to the estimable songwriting team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden for their lively tunes matching in sync to Kelly's choreography (with Harold Rossen) is movie magic replete. Nominated for 2 Oscars (Hagen's hilarious Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton's musical score), they just don't make them like this anymore!"

In fact I don't recall ever blinking during the show, it was Funny, Romantic- but not corny, seemed real life- for the most part, and over all quite inspiring to me and my fellow classmates here at The University Of Kansas, KU, United States of America. I must suggest that all those who have ever seen a movie before must buy this movie and add it to their collection of all-time favorites. I garante that any person between the ages of 9months and 120 years will love this show and share the same enthusiasm that I have."

","For sheer enjoyment, no movie ever made beats Singin' in the Rain.  Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly remind us why vaudeville was as popular as it was in the 20s, Debbie Reynolds lights up the screen, and Jean Hagen gives the performance of her career-of anybody's career for that matter.  If the title dance sequence doesn't get you moving, then there's no hope for you. There are only two down spots, ""Beautiful Girl"" and the never-ending ""Broadway Melody"" dance sequence (but the latter is worth it just to see Cyd Charisse).  The rest of the movie is flawless."
"PureCinema","Null","6","9","17 April 1999"," What a glorious feeling!...
","OK, after commenting on many of the great films that I liked very much, I figure it's about time to comment on one of the films that I truly love... ""Singin' in the Rain"".... I just adore the hell out of this film. There are only a few movies out there that can truly transcend any and all boundries, and make even the most depressed person joyful... Singin' in the Rain is one of them.<br/><br/>This film is pure magic. In today's teenage-dominated film industry audiences seem to want more of an adrenaline-pumping, special effect-driven thrill ride instead of a film like this which is true cinema art. It communicates feelings of joy instead of mindless heart-pumping action. Today's films are not art... they are mass-produced moneymakers that attempt to give you nothing more than a rollercoaster-like experience. No substance to them at all...<br/><br/>But back to the film, the performances are phenomenal! Gene is always great and is the true entertainer. In the famous 15 minute Broadway finale Gene combines three art forms into one (Song, Dance, & Film) to communicate the story of the aspiring actor who comes to Broadway without using one line of (spoken) diologue. This scene should also be noted as quite possibly the most beautiful use of technicolor ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>Donald O'Connor... what can I say, the man is incredible! It is so refreshing to see a vaudeville performer in a film outside of the silent era. His gravity-defying performance of ""Make 'em Laugh"" echos the great silent comedians of the 20's (especially the great Buster Keaton)...<br/><br/>And Ms. Debbie Reynolds rounds out the trio. She's magnificent... especially considering that it's one of her first roles. She posseses a wide range of emotion throughout the film, going from the popping out of a cake :) ...to the tears at the end. I really think her performance is underrated... she really brought so much of everything into this movie and I could never, ever picture anyone else in her role. It's really a shame that her performance of ""You are My Lucky Star"" was cut from the final print.<br/><br/>Of course my favorite moment is when these three legends come together to sing ""Good Morning""... ahhh, pure magic!<br/><br/>Anyway, I just thought I'd express my joy towards this film... not one of the greatest musicals of all time, not one of the great classics, but one of the greatest films of all time.... period."
"bkoganbing","10","7","11","4 February 2007"," We Lived The Research
","In the book The Films of Arthur Freed, Freed made one comment about Singin' in the Rain that always stood out in my mind. As the film was about the Hollywood era when films were learning to talk, Freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. He and any number of people who were still working at MGM a quarter of a century later.<br/><br/>The knowledge that folks had who worked on Singin' in the Rain and the talent of Gene Kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals.<br/><br/>Arthur Freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties MGM musicals together with his partner, composer Nacio Herb Brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. The whole score is Brown-Freed except for Moses which was written by Roger Edens and Adolph Green and Betty Comden and Fit As A Fiddler with lyrics by Freed and music by Al Goodheart and Al Hoffman.<br/><br/>The only 'original' song written for the show was Make 'Em Laugh by Brown and Freed and was Donald O'Connor's specialty. You have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off Cole Porter's Be A Clown. Which is from an MGM musical that Arthur Freed produced. Lucky they weren't sued.<br/><br/>Of course the number that Singin' in the Rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by Gene Kelly. That and the Broadway Melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. I know I don't enjoy myself as much as Mr. Kelly did in that inclement weather.<br/><br/>Jean Hagen got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing that 'shimmering star in the cinema firmament' Lina Lamont. Unfortunately she lost to Gloria Grahame for The Bad and The Beautiful. One thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created. <br/><br/>That was done for great comic affect by Hagen, but Kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of John Gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. Just think how history might have been different if Gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals. <br/><br/>Of course Debbie Reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. So many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. A favorite of mine in this is Douglas Fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal Hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time.<br/><br/>As Freed said, no research was needed. Singin' in the Rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound."
"dexter-3","7","7","11","19 April 1999"," Dated, but fun...
","This film, one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) musicals ever made, unfortunately shows its age.  Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish.  It has not aged well.  I recently saw ""Singin' in the Rain"" at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium.  (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show.  Films selected are usually ""classics"" like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities.  Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts.  That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints.  I rated the film a ""7"" just for that scene alone."
"No 6","1","17","33","12 September 2001"," GREATEST MUSICAL EVER MADE!!!!
","Singin' in the rain is one musical that even the most devout of the musical haters in todays world cannot ignore. And speaking as a reviewer who generally dislikes musicals I feel it has everything a musical should have. The songs ""You are my lucky star"", ""Good morning"" and of course the title track are timeless classics to even the most cynical ear. The film also contains a lot of satirical humour which is aimed mainly at the attitudes of the Hollywood Film community of the 1920's.<br/><br/> The film is about Don Lockwood and his onscreen (but certainly not offscreen) love Linda Lamont who are big box office movie stars of the silent era. Also in the background is Cosmo Brown who used to work with Lockwood onstage during their early musical careers before making a name for himself as a silent movie actor. But thanks to the success of a certain film called The Jazz Singer their silent world is about to get loud. The Jazz Singer because of its talking segments has stirred a lot of interest among the general public and the Hollywood moguls decide to start making ""Talkie"" vehicles for their biggest stars. At first the silent movie stars mock the idea of these talkies but they soon find themselves undergoing speech therapy and singing lessons. Don Lockwood successfully passes these tests but it is his co-star Linda Lamont who cannot make the transition to be a proper ""talkie"" actress.<br/><br/>The Hollywood bosses decide to hire Kathy Selden who is a chorus girl to overdub Lamont's voice. But soon Lockwood falls for Kathy much to the dismay of Lamont who tries her best to break them up.<br/><br/> Singin' in the rain features some of the greatest dance numbers ever filmed particularily during the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" segment which is performed by Donald O'Connor. That dance sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Gene Kelly takes his most famous dance steps is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humour especially in the scene where Don Lockwood describes his early musical career to the press as being glamourous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Cosmo and himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall.<br/><br/> Though at times the humour is a little bit cruel as a lot of it is at the expense of the character of Lamont. Because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is constantly ridiculed in this film. The character of Lamont epitomises the actors and actresses who failed to transcend to the world of sound because many of them were from foreign countries who spoke with thick accents. These people were eventually cut loose by the Hollywood industry and many of them lived out their lives in poverty. The fact that this film mocks them by portraying Linda Lamont as an idiot villainess with a horrible irritating voice who deservedly gets pushed aside by the Hollywood Studios at the end of the movie appears to be quite an insult to their memory. These people were not talentless like the character of Linda Lamont they were artists of a different type of medium who suddenly couldn't catch up with the technological advances of Hollywood.<br/><br/> This film also places an emphasis on the romantic interest between Lockwood and the chorus girl Kathy. This is very good in parts but there are at times when it doesn't gel together quite right. A snobby movie star of the 1920's would never get too serious with a humble chorus girl. It would have been more believable if Lockwood had been penned as a struggling movie actor himself.<br/><br/> The film does have a rather weak ending which would stir up a lot of derision among people who dislike musicals. This is where Lockwood sings ""You are my lucky star"" to Kathy in an attempt to stop her angrily leaving a packed movie theatre. I think they should have just filmed Lockwood singing the song to Kathy alone without anyone else watching. This would have made the ending less cheesier to modern audiences.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone whether they were a musical fan or not. This film along with Calamity Jane, Finian's rainbow and Grease are I feel the greatest musicals of all time."
"hiproductions","2","26","55","27 May 2005"," best film musical of all time?! I don't think so G.
","I watched this film with the expectation that it would have a good storyline that would keep my interest like Oliver, My Fair Lady, or at least Mary Poppins. I was sorely disappointed. This film has been called ""the best"" film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.<br/><br/>The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical ""How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying"".) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.<br/><br/>I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous ""vision"" that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.<br/><br/>This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their ""ingenious"" work when they name ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" a musical ""classic"" as well.

"TheMovieDiorama","10","2","2","23 February 2019"," Singin' In The Rain is pouring with whimsical musicality and soaking in silver screen magic.
","The musical genre is not my favourite. Not in the slightest. Taking a drama and having characters randomly burst into a musical number never really appealed to me. But here I am reviewing what is quite possibly the most famous 50s musicals to ever come out of Hollywood. And I'm going to start this review with a bold statement. I've had some time to contemplate and arrange my thoughts before confirming my opinion. Not only is this the best musical I have ever seen, but actually one of the best films these eyes have watched. Period. A stuntman turned actor finds love with a stage actress and must quickly adapt to the era of ""Talkies"", where dancing, singing and acting are consistently scrutinised.<br/><br/>During the 40s and 50s, actors didn't have to just act. They had to perform energetic choreographed dance sequences whilst singing in tune. Multi-talented stars that put actors working today to shame. This musical takes the evolution of early cinema and uses it to depict a blossoming romance. From lessons in diction to gain the proper pronunciation for the sensitive microphones at the time, to the technical synchronisation of sound and picture. The film doesn't need to convey heavy themes or a tell a melodramatic story. The reason why it has become a timeless classic is because of its light-hearted wholesome magic that is purely made for cinema. The characters, including the bitter Lina, had infectious personalities that made them likeable. Kelly's Lockwood is as charming as ever and Reynolds' Selden (who was an absolute diamond) is magnificently developed. Every character was engaging, and that is primarily thanks to a well-rounded script that was surprisingly comedic. Several laughs came from visual humour, like being unable to capture an actor's voice as they talk away from a concealed microphone, however a large portion of smiles came from silly jokes (particularly from O'Connor's Cosmo). ""Remind me to give you a raise""...""Can I have a raise?"". Simplistic lines of dialogue like that really do age well.<br/><br/>With a musical, it is imperative that the original songs that are performed are memorable. Well, Singin' In the Rain has some of the best. From the eponymous tune that sees Kelly joyfully dance through a rainy street, to songs like ""Good Morning"" and ""Broadway Melody"" that are still referenced today. Whilst the lyrics are catchy and easy to remember even after one watch, it's the choreographed dance sequences accompanying these that provide the core energy for this musical. Absolutely sensational. Kelly and O'Connor were spellbinding as they tap their way through various numbers and dance the Charleston til the sun comes out. Consistently inventive with each sequence being varyingly different. The dazzling frocks and stylish haircuts emulate the era it is portraying with accuracy, making every scene pleasant to watch. Donen and Kelly's directing techniques ensure that minimal cuts were injected within the musical numbers, resulting in several long takes that really draw you in.<br/><br/>To be quite honest with you, I'm lost for words. Unlikely as that is, I am. Timeless classics like this is the reason why I love film. No matter the age and technological limitations, masterpieces can still be conceived. I truly believe Singin' In The Rain is just that, which is why it is getting the perfect rating. I didn't want it to end!"
"alinmihalcea","10","2","2","14 October 2018"," The best musical I've ever seen
","I never thought I'd write a review for a musical since usually I am annoyed by the long, poor-made singing scenes, especially in Bollywood movies.
But I could never say that about this one, there is no way a single scene from this masterpiece could be annoying or anything close to that, it's just full of joyful scenes, all the dance scenes are catchy and well, anyone could admit that you don't see these things done anymore... at least not as much as they were done before.
I'm a '98 kid so I can only guess what it felt like for that generation back then to make this movie and to be a part of that scene of musicals and lifestyle in general and most important what it feels like for them watching this movie now.
It's one of the rare gems of television and I am so glad that I saw it and that many people still watch it today, it's like the most lively and charming history lesson about musicals.<br/><br/>P.S.: I don't usually rate movies, but I thought I'd just do it now so it boosts it's general rating a bit, even in the slightest.

","Copyright 11 March 1952 (in notice: 1951) by Loew's Inc. A Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer picture. New York opening at the Radio City Music Hall: 27 March 1952. U.S. release: 10 April 1952. U.K. release: May 1952. Australian release: 27 June 1952. 102 minutes.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: At the advent of talkies a popular silent screen team is hamstrung by the fact that the female partner has a voice like a berserk chipmunk.<br/><br/>NOTES: Would you believe that Singin' in the Rain ‚Äî the most popular, the most critically acclaimed musical of all time ‚Äî did not receive any prestigious Hollywood awards. In fact the film had only two nominations, the first for Jean Hagen as Supporting Actress (she was passed over by Academy members in favor of Gloria Grahame in The Bad and the Beautiful), and the second for Scoring of a Musical Picture in which category Lennie Hayton lost out to Alfred Newman's With a Song in My Heart.<br/><br/>The film didn't fare any better with contemporary critics. Although it placed in number three position (after The Atomic City and My Six Convicts) on his supplementary Hollywood movies list, it didn't make Bosley Crowther's Top Ten Pictures of 1952 for The New York Times. At least the film came in at the number eight spot both on The National Board of Review's Best American Films of the year and the annual Film Daily poll of the nation's film critics.<br/><br/>MGM production number: 1546. Shooting from 18 June 1951 through to 21 November 1951, plus one day, 26 December 1951. Rehearsals started on 12 April 1951. Ernie Flatt worked with Debbie Reynolds on her tap dancing, while Kelly, Donen and Haney started on the staging of the numbers.<br/><br/>Kelly explains that the two directors, whilst always working in close collaboration, sometimes worked individually as well as in tandem. Two sound stages were often used simultaneously, with photographer Rosson rushing from one set to the other. Kelly says he concentrated on directing the musical numbers, whilst Donen usually handled the straight story material.<br/><br/>Two numbers were deleted before the first preview in order to speed up the story: ""You Are My Lucky Star"" sung by Betty Royce whilst Debbie Reynolds gazes at a billboard of Kelly; and Kelly singing and dancing ""All I Do Is Dream of You"".<br/><br/>Negative cost: $2,540,800 (which was over budget by $620,996 mostly because the ""Broadway Ballet"" which had been estimated at only $80,000 was considerably extended when Donald O'Connor was unable to participate in the number due to a prior television commitment and a new story was built around substitute star Cyd Charisse). Initial domestic rentals gross: $7,665,000 which made it number ten on the nation's list of Box office Champions for 1952. Interestingly, it was by no means MGM's top grosser of the year, its takings exceeded by both Quo Vadis (shown at roadshow admission prices) and of course Ivanhoe which sold more tickets than any other movie of that year.<br/><br/>COMMENT: Why is Singin' in the Rain the greatest of all screen musicals? A perfect marriage of story and songs, for one thing. The story's fresh, vital, witty, sharp amusing, charming, pointed, satirical with interestingly likable characters pacing from one fascinating crisis to another with agreeable fortitude. The songs flow naturally from and are an integral part of the story-line. Moreover these songs themselves are fresh, vital, witty, sharp, amusing, charming, pointed and satirical.<br/><br/>Add to perfect story and perfect song, a perfect cast. Kelly is more debonair here and has lost most of that unattractive brashness and even boorishness of the screen persona he created in his earlier films. O'Connor too has toned himself down, only really letting loose in the musical numbers which make a nice contrast to his more unassuming role in the straight sequences. Miss Reynolds is perky, energetic, self-confident yet identifiable girl-next-door. Jean Hagen of course has the best role of her career and gives the performance for which she'll always be remembered.<br/><br/>Add to perfect story and perfect songs and perfect cast, perfect direction. Kelly and Donen move their camera fluidly yet unobtrusively through both complex dance steps and constantly entertaining, twisting plot situations. Supporting technical credits are likewise as highly accomplished as they come.<br/><br/>One of the things I most like about Singin' the Rain is that it's so consistently entertaining. There are no dull patches at all. True there are highlights, but the pace is so fast, and one highlight follows so quickly on the heels of another, and there are so many, it seems invidious to single three or four out in preference to seven or eight others.<br/><br/>I suppose On the Town should have forewarned us, but the super- stylish, super-energetic, super-witty Singin' in the Rain is anything but the sort of stodgy, second-hand musical we expect from MGM. It's nice to have wit plus MGM's super production values as well.<br/><br/>POSTSCRIPT: In the picture's credit titles, Freed's song is quoted as providing the script's inspiration. This of course is malarkey. The credit is nothing but a sop to producer's Freed's ego. When initially preparing the script, Comden and Green used their own imagination and initiative. And of course, as we now all know, Kelly actually hated the brash, egotistic O'Connor and conspired with Donen to fabricate various shooting delays so that O'Connor was unable to participate in the movie's rousing finale due to his previous TV commitment."
"barrymn1","1","24","54","1 April 2007"," Here's 1 person who hates this movie
","I know this film is considered a classic among classics, but as a knowledgeable fan of 1920's music, I always thought this film was the most typically bad example of rewriting late 1920's/early 1930's history. Yes, the settings and costumes are more proper to the period than other films, but the arrangements of the music is strictly 1952.<br/><br/>Also, I must put in a plug; I have always thought that Gene Kelly was the most overrated Dancer/Actor of that era.<br/><br/>So, while I'm sure that my comments won't change anyone else's love for this movie, I, for one, have always thought it was another typical 1950's musical attempt at history with no grains of truth."
"TxMike","Null","6","10","28 May 2001"," Most likely the best musical ever filmed, although I sure like ""Cats"" and ""A Chorus Line"" too!.
","""Singing In The Rain"" is unique in that the song actually inspired the movie. It is set in Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Gene Kelly, 39 when it was made, stars as Don Lockwood, silent film star. Donald O'Connor was 26, played Cosmo Brown, Lockwood's long-time sidekick. And 19-yr-old Debbie Reynolds, in already her 6th film, plays Kathy Seldon, aspiring legitimate (stage) actress set on going to NYC. Lockwood met her initially when he was escaping overzealous fans and leaped into her car from a streetcar top. Also, they later met again when she jumped out of a cake at a party. She obviously needed work!<br/><br/>However, the character who really makes the whole story possible, and the movie fantastic, is Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Lockwood's silent screen co-star, who also happens to be a totally self-absorbed person with the most irritating voice possible. Hagen is absolutely perfect in this role, and I understand she received an Oscar nomination for it.   In 1927, the first ""talkie"", ""The Jazz Singer"" with Al Jolson, changed movies forever. Suddenly the ""talkies"" were making all the money and the Lockwood/Lamont team had to follow or close down. No amount of diction coaching could get Lamont to sound good, and the audience could only laugh at the test screening just 6 weeks before scheduled opening. Cosmo had a great idea - Kathy would dub in her voice over Lina's. Also, the serious ""Dueling Cavaliers"" would become a musical, ""The Dancing Cavaliers.""<br/><br/>
The new musical is a big hit, Lina gets coerced by the live audience to sing a song, but it was Kathy singing behind the curtain. Midway through it, they raised the curtain to expose the truth, Lina was put in her place, and the new team of Lockwood and Selden was a hit, on and off the big screen.<br/><br/>Except for an extended surreal dance scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, which seemed to break the continuity of the story, the movie is almost perfect. I rate it ""9"" of 10. Of course Kelly was choreographer, and co-director, so I suppose he just wanted that number in. The several energetic dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor are simply great, as are the two individual solo numbers, ""Singing in the Rain"" by Kelly, right after Don leaves Kathy's apartment, realizing he is in love with her, and ""Make 'Em Laugh"" by O'Connor, which includes his running up two different inclining walls and back-flipping off them. <br/><br/>Who knew Debbie Reynolds could dance so well, and hold her own with Kelly and O'Connor??  Well, she couldn't until she was cast for the part, and she literally worked herself to bleeding feet in rehearsing for the production numbers, and all her hard work shows. She became a dancer for this role.<br/><br/>I love music, and I love good dancing. I cannot watch a film like this without mentally comparing the two great dancers of 1950s film, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. I suppose Astaire was the greater ""pure dancer"" of the two, with always perfect positions and movements that would just glide over the floor.  Kelly, however, is my overall favorite of the two. Not only is he a superb dancer, his more athletic build and dancing style, combined with good looks and singing voice, make him more believable in the musical film roles they both starred in."
"TJBNYC","Null","6","10","3 September 2001"," ""Round tones, Miss LaMont, round tones...""
","This is near-blasphemy, but I would love ""Singin' in the Rain"" even more than I do if it were a non-musical, or, more to the point, a musical with different music. Gene Kelly's talent is incontrovertible, and sequences such as the lengthy ""Broadway Rhythm"" number underscore his (and Stanley Donen's) remarkable vision and talent.<br/><br/>They also hold up this snappy, bright, FUNNY comedy.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that all of the musical portions are not entertaining adjuncts to the film; the ""Beautiful Girls"" fashion show is hysterically camp, and of course, Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"" is charming, romantic and joyous. However, the screenplay is so solid on its own, the lesser moments (""Good Morning,"" ""You Were Meant for Me"") seem to drag on forever.<br/><br/>Kelly is movie star handsome here, befitting his role as silent screen lover, Don Lockwood. Donald O'Connor is fine as the ubiquitous funny man sidekick, while Debbie Reynolds displays a nice, sassy touch, especially in her first scene. ""Here we are, Sunset and Camden,"" she trills, having just deflated the ego of one of Hollywood's most notorious wolves. She's a much more interesting romantic foil than most of the colorless ingenues which grace male-dominated musicals.<br/><br/>But the real scene-stealer is the extraordinary Jean Hagen, as shrill-voiced screen queen Lina LaMont. It is such a bravura performance, she simply blows the competition off the screen. Never once does she break character. Her slow burns and takes as she reacts to other characters' comments and actions are almost as funny as her (numerous) quotable lines. ""I...can...SEEWWWW."" ""People?! I ain't PEOPLE! I'm a...'shining, shimmering star in the Hollywood firmament.' See? Sez so, right there!"" ""I CAN'T make LOVE to a BUSH!"" ""Gee, this wig weighs a ton! What kinda dope would wear a thing like this?"" And, her ultimate manifesto: ""We're so thrilled you enjoyed 'The Dancing Cavalier,' our first musi-cale picture, togither. If we bring a little joy inta ya humdrum lives, it makes us feel all our hard work ain't been in vain for nothin'.""<br/><br/>There are countless comic gems in this film: gossip monger Dora Bailey's breathless account of a movie premiere; Lina's hopeless voice lessons; Lina attempting to ""sing""; Don and Lina fighting as they act out a tender, silent movie love scene; and, most famously, the disastrous sneak preview of Don and Lina's first talking picture.<br/><br/>This is one musical that can stand on its own merits as a fine example of Hollywood comedy at its best."

","Wow did I hate this movie. I feel like I need to rewatch it, because this IS supposed to be a good movie right? Like, classic, everyone loves it? I don't for the life of me understand why. I know all the songs, everyone knows all the songs. I recognized the singing in the rain scene. Who doesn't? But goddamn! This movie was a star vehicle if there ever was one! This movie exists just to show how awesome Gene Kelly was, and doesn't get anything else right. I've seen musicals before (who hasn't?), and I know for a fact that they're capable of having good plots and likable characters like any other movie! Then why does this one seem so flat?"
"MississaugaJohn","3","13","27","16 June 2007"," The most over-rated film ever? Pure contrived advertising and product placement
","This is the most disappointing film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is certainly not the worst film, but I had such high expectations because of the cast and how famous the movie is.<br/><br/>However, as a movie, it is contrived, banal, uninteresting, uninspiring and unbelievable. In fact, none of the movie made sense at all until I watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie.<br/><br/>Then it all became clear: One interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what the movie looks like - a disjointed collection of 'music videos' strung together into a contrived story.<br/><br/>Lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the Abba musical Mama Mia. And while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as 'great' musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can - where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own.<br/><br/>It has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. But any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks.<br/><br/>As it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities. And that wide embrace of shameless-advertising-as-art and celebrity over quality would prove over subsequent decades to be the dominant trend."
"rmax304823","10","5","8","29 July 2005"," About as Good as They Come.
","A lot of people seem to gush over this picture -- ""It's my favorite musical,"" said one critic, and Kelly replied, ""That's good to know."" Well, it's hard to believe in lists of best or worst things because everything is made up of several dimensions. Some are good and some are bad. Sometimes very bad. Nobody would argue that Hitler was a nice guy but he DID love his dog, Blondi.<br/><br/>However, I have to agree that within the limits of the genre this is probably the most satisfying musical I've ever seen. There is not a single musical number that is a dud. Kelly and Donen avoid Kelly's usual repetitive steps and he really stretches out on this one. There is about a one minute sequence in the ""Broadway Rhythm"" finale just after Kelly sings ""Gotta Dance"" from his knees that is given over to his solo. His dance is full of balletic leaps and jagged edges. It's a moment on unequaled exhilaration. He seems at time suspended by wires.<br/><br/>I'll skip over the contributions of Cyd Charrise -- my God, those LEGS, like a more than usually sinewy giraffe -- and Donald O'Connor. You cannot NOT laugh at O'Connor's number, ""Make 'Em Laugh."" Even after several viewings.<br/><br/>The most charming (and best-known) number is Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain,"" but it's not the most technically accomplished. I'd give that honor to ""Moses Supposes."" The whole movie is of course as corny as they come, although it probably didn't seem so in 1952 when it was released. There's nothing pretentious about it. Kelly had an unfortunate tendency to step out of his class with films like ""Invitation to the Dance,"" and to be involved in musicals with dramatic underpinnings like the overblown ""American in Paris."" The thing about this MGM musical -- and a few others like ""On The Town"" and ""The Bandwagon"" is that they were funny as hell IN BETWEEN the musical numbers. Nobody could ever criticize Astaire's dancing. He was great, a much better dancer than Kelly in many ways, but his 1930s musicals with Ginger Rogers were appealing mainly because of their musical numbers. Betty Comden and Adolph Green in the 1940s added stories that could stand on their own as a comedies.<br/><br/>There's something about singing as opposed to dancing too. Anybody can sing -- however lousily. You can sing. I can sing. My pet canary sings. Not well, but we all can do it. But dancing is a skill of a different order and to do it well we need the attention of Terpsichore. All those steps that seem so effortlessly improvised on screen (the taps are always dubbed in later) must be memorized one by one by the performers. Tap? Okay -- heel or toe? Thirty seconds of unedited dancing on screen represents about 100 hours of memorization and practice. Not to mention that you have to be in as good a physical shape as a running back.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is a perfect example of how a nearly perfect musical should be made. Okay, Debbie Reynolds isn't much of a dancer and she can't sing well, but so what? The overall impact of the movie is so warm and fuzzy that it doesn't matter. It's like nibbling some kind of tiny and exquisite pastry, not a big deal, but the equal of any experience."
"kristystarlight","3","8","15","13 February 2013"," This movie certainly didn't appeal to me
","Well, I have to be one of those people who simply HATED this musical and really cannot see all the fuss over it, or ever why people think it should have won the Oscar for best picture of that year. Although it had some catchy tunes, and I guess the dancing was fine, it really didn't grab me. The plot was nearly non-existent. I put it up there with ""Easter Parade"", ""Bandwagon"", and ""Finian's Rainbow"" as the most boring musicals. Even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. Though I fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from Vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, I found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs (albeit some really catchy and lively ones).<br/><br/>Sadly, I find that to be the trouble with most Movie musicals. There are no characters that develop at all. However, there are some that have really grabbed me: ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""Meet me in Saint Louis"" (and yes, it hasn't got a strong plot either, but it hangs together far better than ""Singing in the Rain"")""Brigadoon"", ""Showboat"",""Wizard of Oz"", and a few like that. My favourite musical is ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Why it appeals to me is there is a real plot, and the music is not intrusive and doesn't stop the actual storyline. That is my biggest complaint with musicals is the way everything comes to a stop for the music (""Oliver"" is one of the worst for this), and that usually the plot is so weak that well, were it not for the music there would be nothing whatever to watch.<br/><br/>Each performer did a masterful job in this movie, that I can admit. The choreography was well thought out (especially anything that Gene Kelly danced, but of course, he did the choreography, so naturally what he designed for himself would be masterful). Even the singing was quite good (though I prefer more robust singing over Kelly's soft breathy crooning). And of course, the sets, costumes, and all that were wonderful. And the editing was well done.<br/><br/>But even with all that going for it, it just left me cold and for the most part, bored. The only Movie Musical that bored me more was ""Westside Story."" And again, it is a musical with some really great music, just far too long."

","Singin' in the Rain (1952)<br/><br/>You gotta love a movie like this. <br/><br/>But--how in the world do you talk about a classic that has grown so big it defines its own genre? How can you mention, politely, that it's filled with flaws?<br/><br/>If there are parts that are frankly corny, to the point of being ""stupid"" if they appeared in some other movie, can you say so? (The first big opening night scenes where people are getting out of their cars might be one.)<br/><br/>If some of the dance scenes seem like throw-ins, adding nothing to the plot and offering only more lighthearted tap dancing and goofing around, isn't this a distraction? (The diction coach dance is one candidate.)<br/><br/>What if it's just full of itself? (The Cyd Charisse ballet scenes can be seen that way, for sure.) Or what if the plot is just too obviously a vehicle, and we can't get involved like we should in something more sincere, or more surprising? (The guy lands in the seat of a moving car and finds himself next to the girl, hello?)<br/><br/>Well, the answer to all these is you need to chill and lighten up and realize that that's how these musicals go. It's like you had Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds over to your house and everyone started hamming it up and dancing and being silly. And Donald O'Connor stopped by to play piano (and dance up the walls). And you blow it up and give it dazzling color and bright lights. Then rehearse a little so the dance steps aren't just fun, but they are astonishing, and choreographed exquisitely? And what if you, say, want to have a little history of dance thrown in, why not? And of course modern ballet is the counterpart to modern Hollywood musical dance numbers, so why not try to mix them a bit (this is Gene Kelly's doing, mostly)? <br/><br/>So if you ramp up the affair into a big budget, slickly filmed movie, but never lose sight of its origins as a kind of fun, not-so-serious romp, it's just a great time. A corny, silly, improbable, romantic, self-effacing, celebratory great time."

","'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favourite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film, one that can be easily enjoyed with family or a group of friends. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem. The leading lady has a ghastly voice and she can't act. Enter Kathy Selden who offers to be a partial replacement.<br/><br/>Donen and Kelly do a stupendous job as directors. It's remarkable how they have brought such a well-crafted piece on screen. For Kelly this is a multiple achievement on different levels as he directs, acts, sings and dance. Clearly the guy is a multi-talented legend. Cosmo Brown too is great as the laugh-out-loud supportive friend. His physical comedy are among the funniest sequences of the film. Debbie Reynolds is pretty ands vivacious. She is lovely, both as singer and actress. Jean Hagen deserves mention as the squeaky voiced and arrogant Lina Lamont.<br/><br/>The songs are full of energy and spectacularly shot. The dances are amazingly choreographed and a treat to watch. The visuals are pleasantly colourful. The cinematography is superb, especially the long takes. There has already been so much said about the film that I doubt I could add anything new but this is one of the few classic that feels fresh, lively and energizing even today and perhaps it will remain a significant hallmark in the history of cinema."
"john-ruffle","10","4","6","5 September 2007"," Timeless Perfection from Hollywood's Studio System
","Up there with film classics such as 'Casablanca' and Orson Wells' groundbreaking 'Citizen Kane', 'Singin' in the Rain' is one of the all-time top films to come out of Hollywood. Considered by many (including the American Film Institute) to be the greatest film musical, 'Singin' in the Rain' , with its awesome production values, was made 12 years before the stunning 'West Side Story'.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film as a teenager, however, failing to see beyond its American sugar-floss sentimentality, I arrogantly despised it. Yet just one year later I sat through it again and instantly came under its spell, caught up in a magic that has never left me. 'Singin' in the Rain' is a riot of self-indulgent fun, studio skulduggery, romance and innocence of not just one, but two by-gone ages: and therein lieth part of its enduring magic. In rich Technicolor, with some of the finest and slickest visual stunts, (it all looks so effortless on screen) along with some of the greatest song and dance numbers, no one can really say they 'know Hollywood' until they've laughed and cried their way through this film. Parodying a Hollywood back in the days when sound was first coming to the silver screen, it simultaneously reflects the late 1920s, in which the film is set, and the early '50s, (the era in which it was produced). Thus, unwittingly encapsulating much of the entire golden age of Hollywood in one motion picture, like fine wine, it has simply matured with age. The production values are so flawlessly high that I sometimes have to pinch myself to remember that the film recreates in song and dance an era some 25 years earlier..<br/><br/>All the songs, including the famous title number, are revivals of numbers that appeared in early sound films, giving the film an air of authenticity. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh' number is a particular highpoint to watch out for. The typically flamboyant Gene Kelly ballet sequence in the second half is slightly more controversial, with some viewers feeling that despite its brilliant choreography and staging, it slows the action and is out of touch with the naive innocence of the rest of the film, but others view it is the sequence that makes the movie, giving it balance.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that this ballet sequence probably would never have made it into the film at all has it not been for the stunning 1948 British film, 'The Red Shoes' (produced by Powell and Pressburger). The ballet sequence featuring Moira Shearer included 15 minutes of uninterrupted, dialogue-free screen time. Gene Kelly loved it, and thanks to the critical and popular success of 'The Red Shoes', (photographed by the legendary Jack Cardiff), Kelly convinced producer Arthur Freed that ballet on film was commercially viable.<br/><br/>Just five months before the 1952 premier of 'Singin' in the Rain', MGM had released another major Gene Kelly musical, 'An American in Paris', and initially, this was the film critics preferred. However, with audiences making 'Singin' in the Rain' a box-office hit from the very start, critical opinion began to change and it soon became clear that 'Singin' in the Rain' possessed a timeless quality approaching sheer perfection, revealing that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, in a happy combination of chance and design, (not forgetting the chemistry a 19 year-old Debbie Reynolds brought to the screen and Adolph Green and Betty Comden's wonderful script), the production elements in 'Singin' in the Rain' flow together perfectly, revealing just how well the Hollywood studio system really could work at those special moments when everyone, craftsmen and artists alike, were on peak form.<br/><br/>Due to loving restoration and the marvels of modern digital transfers, we can now see the film as it originally looked, in all its brilliant colour saturation - a far cry from the washed out versions you may have seen as Christmas time TV fodder. If this is the fist time you've ever seen it, then I hope you are wiser than I was, and that you fall in love with this timeless picture first time around: it really is a cinema treat for all ages!

"pattonisgreat1944","10","4","6","24 July 2006"," Sheer Cinematic Joy
","I will make my comments short and pithy, since not many words can describe the sheer grandeur and thrill of watching this film.<br/><br/>So many movies nowadays are two-bit shows that required no thought but lots of CGI. The stories are weak and bland at best, and when they do contain something original, it is usually dull, depressing, and morally sh*tty. The acting is insincere, and the characters are ridiculously one-faced and emotionally distraught in some way. The special effects are the only things keeping the movie in theaters.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is the complete, polar opposite of that. When you watch this film, you are transported back to the time frame in which it takes place. You feel the color, excitement, and sounds of Hollywood. But the best thing about it is its boundless joy. This is simply the most fun you will ever have at the movies. You can just feel the vibe and happiness of Gene Kelly's character when he dances through the rainy streets of Hollywood singing that immortal song. The humor is pricelessly good. The musical numbers are simply dazzling, the dance numbers are just sizzling. <br/><br/>This is a magical experience. A great substitute for Prozac."

","and came up with:<br/><br/>1. Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown are supposed to be about the same age, judging by their childhood flashbacks, but as adults Don looks significantly older (Gene Kelly being thirteen years the senior of Donald O'Connor).<br/><br/>2. When Don leaps from a streetcar into Kathy Selden's convertible, she doesn't recognize him, which is odd considering that she later confesses to having seen a ton of his pictures (implying she's a big closet fan). Maybe they'd planned for the makeup crew to muss him up and then forgot about it.<br/><br/>3. I wish that the weakest song in the film (""Make 'Em Laugh"", Arthur Freed's quick knock-off of Cole Porter's ""Be A Clown"") didn't accompany what is probably the best dance routine in the film.<br/><br/>4. The woman doing Kathy Selden's singing for ""Would You?"" (Betty Noyes) doesn't sound anything like Debbie Reynolds.<br/><br/>5. Events in the picture are a little condensed in relation to the real-life birth of the sound era. It's unlikely that a 1927 film like ""The Dueling Cavalier"" would have been hastily remade into a talkie.<br/><br/>
(I thought about including points like ""a few of Don Lockwood's spiffy outfits are really ugly"" and ""that head-of-the-studio guy is sometimes annoying"" but then decided that these things, which were no doubt intentional, added to the charm.)<br/><br/>And I couldn't think of anything else. The fact that such minor nitpicking was all I could come up with in the movie's disfavor should give an idea of how good it is--as almost all the other reviews here confirm. (Yes, I know some folks think the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence is as long and unwieldy as Cyd Charisse's scarf and that ""You Were Meant For Me"" is a little poky, but I wouldn't change either of them. I doubt most people would, when you get right down to it.)"

","I didn't like the film i thought it was drawn out way to long at the end when you already knew what was going to happen. Im not big on musicals though i thought the artistic aspect of the film was very cool. As well as the ability of the main character to act and dance. I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract. Though i don't like musicals i thought a lot of the film was interesting even though i didn't like the music there is a lot of visuals in the film i found to be cool."

","I know this is going to be contentious, but I HATED this film. I'm a fan of musicals, but this is by far the worst musical I've ever seen. I only carried on after the first half hour because my wife came to watch (and ridicule) it with me.. otherwise I could not have taken any more. I found it so boring that I didn't care one bit what the ending was going to be - I was ready to go out for dinner, but my wife said she was at least curious to know the ending.<br/><br/>It's musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" that help give musicals a bad rep amongst the young IMO - people bursting into cheesy, pointless songs, with ridiculous, goofy expressions on their faces while doing slapstick dance routines that make you want to cringe with embarrassment. It was all so silly - over-the-top acting at every turn, Cosmo's clowning around downright embarrassing, and some of the cheesiest effects imaginable in the dance routines. As far as being a comedy, there's more good humour in the first 5 minutes of Phantom of the Opera than there is in SITR.<br/><br/>The only scene of any worth at all is the title song, which is understandably a classic scene. But the film itself is just horrible. It embodies everything I don't like about old musicals. Another ""classic"" movie I hope I never have to sit through again.<br/><br/>UGH. 2/10."

","There's just something about musicals that I simply cannot buy into. Something very cheesy about them, but Singing in the Rain is at least watchable. <br/><br/>This movie has a cool concept. it's about the transition from silent movies to sound and the problems that arise. Actors/Actresses with unpleasant voices for instance, like Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen, will not be wanted in sound movies. That is the basic story here in this film. Lina Lamont has a horrible high pitched voice that needs to be dubbed out. Kathy Selden, played by the beautiful Debbie Reynolds, is chosen to do the voice over for Lina. Of course things don't go as planned and it culminates in an entertaining ending."

","Wonderful wonderful movie! I love this movie as seeing it is a musical. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you scarce any time to be bored. The lighting of the screen as well as the voices of the actors give it a ""vaudville"" taste. It tells of the silent movie era and the transition to ""talkies"" (as mentioned) along with the Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood duo. Wonderful choreography, as seeing the two dancers match up just perfectly in step. I imagine it must have taken a long time to learn, practice, develop and film the steps perfectly. It is chock-full of wonderful music, dancing and singing. What's more, the songs sang by the actors reoccur frequently during the movie, which reminds you of the scene it was last sang in. Which is a refresher, and the closing is a wonderful aspect of humanity. I love it!!"

There was a comical side to from the great Donald O'Connor(Cosmo Brown) and wonderful dances including Cyd Charisse.

","Singin' In The Rain quite possibly one of the best movie musicals of all time. The dancing is unforgettable and fantastic, mesmerizing the audience until the credits are done.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are perfect in their roles.  Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a cocky and handsome superstar in the 1920s who just made a bad talking movie with his romantic leading lady, Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen).  Donald O'Connor's character, Cosmo Brown, is the absolutely hilarious best friend of Lockwood, who sings his famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number and cracks jokes from beginning to end.  Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) enters the plot as Lockwood's love interest and Lena Lamont gets jealous.  ""Moses Supposes"", ""Singin' In The Rain"" and ""Broadway Melody"" are fantastic and classic numbers that will make you want to become a dancer yourself!

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is rightly regarded as one of the most fondly regarded musicals of Hollywood's golden age.  Not only does it contain four superb performances (Gene Kelly as vain silent screen idol Don Lockwood, painfully making the transition to sound; Debbie Reynolds as Cathy Selden, a chorus girl who wants to be a great actress; Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, the dependable friend who puts fun into the movie; and Jean Hagen as the screechy Lina Lamont, Don's erstwhile co-star) but is an affectionate tribute to the birth of the talkies.<br/><br/>The best scene of all is of course, Gene's dance down a rain-sodden street, much anthologised and by far the most technically accomplished and totally joyous piece of musical cinema.  I also have to mention the Broadway Melody sequence, featuring the great Cyd Charisse - perfection itself."
"Spleen","10","4","7","26 November 2002"," It's the vitality of its parts, as well as of the whole, that does it
","That ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a great film you can learn from more erudite and closely argued reviews than mine (and from more enthusiastic reviews, too, although I love the film as much as anyone and could be just as enthusiastic if I chose).<br/><br/>I'd just like to mention one thing: the films within the film. Donen and Kelly deserve especial credit for not slacking off here. The swashbuckling silent picture that introduces us to Lockwood and Lamont actually comes across as a well-made crowd-pleaser (it is admittedly more compressed than a real film of the era would have been, but we can forgive the compression), and since Gene Kelly isn't afraid to give Lockwood his own charm, energy and physical skill, it's no strain at all to believe that he's a popular actor, or that the film could be a box-office success. (I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.) And the first and last sound Lockwood-and-Lamont vehicle is equally persuasive (in its earlier incarnation as a dire piece of petrified staginess AND later, when it's a perfectly decent early stab at a screen musical).<br/><br/>Kelly claims that the ""Broadway Melody"" section grew and grew from a tiny diversion to a huge, long, lavish diversion; and this, too, tells us something: that side references of this kind, to projects which the various characters happen to be or have been working on, have a life of their own, which means that the projects themselves have a life of their own. This is a GOOD thing. The musical numbers that are part of the story fit the story perfectly well, and as everyone knows the title song could not be a more natural or apt expression of Lockwood's feelings than it is in context. The musical numbers that are NOT part of the story are bound by no such rules of integration. Nor should they be.<br/><br/>The final film-within-the-film ¬ñ Lockwood and Selden's first project together, the film they're looking at a billboard advertisement for in the final shot ¬ñ is also entitled ""Singin' in the Rain"". Some people think that the film they make is more or less the film we see. But of course it isn't. ""Singin' in the Rain"" ¬ñ neither the film we see, nor any film that Lockwood and Selden would have made together ¬ñ is not some exercise in twee, unimaginative, academic self-reference. These people have talent. It's clear from the other samples of their craft that they're capable of CREATING stuff (in fact, they could scarcely prevent themselves from doing so), and they don't need to bottle their own autobiographies and pass it off as art. If you want some clue as to what the film-within-a-film version of ""Singin' in the Rain"" is like, look to the opening credits, in which we see Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds singing in the rain together. I believe that this is a conceptual sketch (just as the version of ""Broadway Melody"" we see is a conceptual sketch) of the musical number as it will appear in Lockwood and Selden's film. It's clear the film they make is something entirely removed from the story of how they came to make it."
"Dweasel","Null","4","7","9 May 2002"," Good movie, but too much singing and dancing
","This is a good movie.  Good acting, nice story, all that.  But several of the song and dance numbers seem like they were in the movie just because they thought there should be a song and dance number at that point.  The numbers didn't advance the story, or illustrate people's emotions, or anything like that.  Some examples are the dance number with the dialogue coach, ""Good Morning"", and the entire ""Broadway Melody"" sequence.  That last one is an amazing number, but it doesn't fit in this movie.  There's no reason for it."

Enter a very young Debbie Reynolds as the voice behind Hagen's physical performances.

","Let me start off by saying, I hate musicals.  Hate them.  I have little respect for a genre with such patently bizarre conventions as the musical. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment, they are part of the American cultural landscape in a way that makes them almost unavoidable.  I also, much to my chagrin, like Grease and Hair, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain.  I love it.  It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again.  SitR is a fun movie, that pokes fun at its own conventions and explodes them in strange and wonderful ways.  <br/><br/>Gene Kelly is simply too cool.  He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance steps (Billy Joel could pull it off sometimes too).  Gene Kelly is a damn cool guy with the chops and credentials to make nearly any role legitimate.  SitR is no exception. Especially the bizarre, Bernhard-esque dance number at the end, which Kelly choreographed himself.  Fantastic.<br/><br/>Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works.  He is damn funny.  His hyperkinetic Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today.  He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes his scenes work.<br/><br/>The plot itself is interesting, it is a musical about the origins of musicals.  It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one.  I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow."

From ""Fit as a Fiddle"" to ""Lucky Star"" the numbers sizzle.  If you single out the title tune and Kelly's wonderful dance, you can't forget the outrageous O'Connor's ""Be a Clown"" or either of the male leads comedy duets.  Words fail me.  See the movie."

No one really makes much sense at 1:30 in the morning if they have been up all day.<br/><br/>The casting and direction were done superbly.

","With an entertaining story, interesting characters, a good cast, and song sequences that are often both lavish and creative, this has everything you could ask for in a musical.  Besides being one of the best musicals ever made, it is also one of the best of the movies that Hollywood has ever made about itself.<br/><br/>The story is a somewhat exaggerated and very amusing look at Hollywood as it underwent the transition from silents to sound.  The main characters are defined nicely, and the cast does a fine job with them.  The trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor really look as if they are having a good time together.  It gets a lot of mileage out of even the simplest aspects of the changes that sound pictures brought, and while the main plot is fairly simple, there are plenty of laughs.  Most of the musical numbers work quite well, although the rest of the movie is so good that it probably could have stood up pretty well on its own anyway.<br/><br/>This classic is great entertainment, and a movie you can enjoy whether or not you usually like musicals."

Everything is as it should be: the cast, the music, the lyrics, the dancing, the script and plot... the last is most significant, since with musicals (and movie musicals in particular), you always get the sense that the plot has been skimped on--compromised for the songs that the writer wants to feature in the film. In this film, however, all the songs are part of a whole, and the whole works beautifully.<br/><br/>If you watch one movie musical in your whole life, make it 'Singin' In The Rain'.

","Singin in the Rain is perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made. I absolutely just love this film. It combines music, dance and a really witty script to make the most magnificent of MGM's musicals.  The story goes like this: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the toast of 1920's Hollywood. Then The Jazz Singer comes out and all hell breaks loose when they realize that talkies are going to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, Lina has a voice that could shatter a mirror and caaaiiint seem to get anything done when a microphone is present. Don't worry though; Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) saves the day and knocks Don right off his feet. She promises to dub over Lina's voice and stay at the back of the cameras. Of course while Lina believes the press that Don and her are an item, Don is falling in love with the beautiful Kathy. All of the stars put in brilliant performances, especially Donald O'Connor, his ¬ëMake em Laugh' scene has to be one of the best-choreographed displays ever. Jean Hagen's portrayal of the shrill blond bombshell is absolutely hilarious, which won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination that year. And of course the multi-talented Gene Kelly: he can act, sing, and dance¬Ö the triple threat.  It still amazes me how Gene Kelly was also able to choreograph and co-direct while taking on the role of the main character. Debbie Reynolds is great too, but in my opinion she plays second fiddle to Ms. Hagen. My favorite bit would have to be the trademark Singin in the Rain scene. Just watching Gene Kelly sing and dance around in the streets while it is pouring rain is just wonderful.  This is a great film and I recommend it to everybody.  If you haven't seen Singin in the Rain then you must go see it, if you already have seen it then watch it again, and for those who don't think highly of musicals; this one is a must for you guys cause it will change the way you view musicals."

It was very refreshing to watch again for the first time in years, and I will honestly probably end up watching it again.<br/><br/>The storyline with the movie star actress (Jean Hagen) being a royal witch with a B and having an annoying voice was a little corny, but still undeniably fun to watch. The ending, with Debbie Reynold's character winning the man (Gene Kelly) and becoming the huge star, was predictable, but that is part of what makes the movie a classic romantic comedy.<br/><br/>If you are ever feeling down or depressed, perhaps because it is raining outside, put on Singin' In The Rain, and I can assure you almost completely that it will cheer you up."

","Just a great piece of Golden Age Hollywood entertainment, and this coming from someone who doesn't generally take in a musical complete start to finish. The 'Singin' In The Rain' number I could watch over and over again, it strikes a wonderful balance of joy, freedom and artistic expression. Besides that, it's flawless, making me wonder if it could possibly have been done in one take. Curious though, if you watch closely, you won't see any 'rain' hitting Gene Kelly's face.<br/><br/>Though it's primarily Kelly's vehicle, I was sure impressed by the little bit of dance time Donald O'Connor got. That 'Make 'Em Laugh' number was funny and bold, and if I had to say, might have been the best part of the film. OK, for me it was, without taking anything away from Kelly, especially the numbers done with the exotic Cyd Charisse. Growing up in the Fifties and Sixties, one would see all of these greats appear on a variety show every now and then, but this movie puts into perspective just how great each performer actually was.<br/><br/>It seems to me the film got away with quite a bit in the sly innuendo department, some cleverly low key and some right out there. The Kelly/Charisse flapper number gets downright steamy at times even while it looks as innocent as all get out. For a head spinning double take, you don't get much more brazen than Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - ""Well I can't make love to a bush.""<br/><br/>""Singin' In The Rain"" is one of those films that will continue to wear well and entertain audiences for a long time to come. It captures the grandeur of that Hollywood Golden Age without getting overly theatrical and choreographed, and with a great blend of romance and comedy mixed into the story. It's the kind of film they don't make anymore, and in a way, that's just a bit too bad."

","If you closed your eyes and threw a potato into a crowded street, you'd be guaranteed to hit someone who loves this movie. Everyone loves this movie. Just looking at the other reviews here, it's hard to find anyone who thinks it's anything less than a masterpiece. I guess I'll just have to be Billy No-Mates, because I found it to be significantly less than that.<br/><br/>Whether you've seen it or not, you've at least heard of it and been made aware of its reputation, but as is so often the case, its reputation overstates its virtues. But while it may have been a fair distance from the five-star masterpiece I was expecting, it was still a good, and sometimes great, movie.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me was Gene Kelly's smile. Cheesier than a statue of Celine Dion carved in Gorgonzola, it simply refused to leave his face. He seemed incapable of frowning, and typified the mood of the movie. Its relentless cheer and optimism was infectious, and it is easy to understand why so many people describe it as a feelgood film. No one could be miserable watching this.<br/><br/>There is an unavoidable quaintness in the film. Set in the 1920s, as silent movies gave way to talkies, it both celebrates and gently mocks a legendary era in Hollywood history. But the movie itself is now part of another legendary era in Hollywood history, and this double-nostalgia works only in its favour and adds to its immense charm.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent without exception. Gene Kelly is great, and Donald O'Connor is just hilarious. He seems to be having the greatest time in the world making this movie and making ¬ëem laugh. His face-pulling scene is undoubtedly one of the funniest moments the film has to offer. Jean Hagan is perfect as Lina Lamont, and gives us a truly original character. The scene where her terrible voice is revealed was lessened somewhat by having seen a similar joke in The Man with Two Brains, but this deserves the laughs having got there thirty years earlier. Her stupidity is at its funniest when she insists she and Kelly are an item because she was told so by the gossip columns, and she is blessed with perhaps the funniest line of the film: `Why, I make more money than... than... than Calvin Coolidge, put together!'<br/><br/>It may be stating the obvious, but the dancing was just mesmerising. Kelly and O'Connor move as if on ice, and their energy is just stunning. To see real talent like theirs, and then switch to the jerky, simplified arm-waving that appears in every video on MTV, emphasises their genius. The songs, however, were something of a disappointment. With the exception of the title track and Make ¬ëEm Laugh, they are nothing special. There were times when they felt forced into the story rather awkwardly, with Good Morning being the most irritating example.<br/><br/>I can understand why so many people love this film, but I have no love for it myself. It was fun, and there were a load of great moments, but it didn't come close to being a masterpiece. I know I'm in the minority. For most people, it's a flawless classic.

","The title song is catchy, and it's doubtless interesting for younger viewers (those under 65) to see why this guy was so happy that he'd get all wet and yet remain in high spirits. The whole thing is so clearly fake that the most impressive thing in that scene (apart from the cunning decision not to use cardboard for the lamp-posts) is the wonderful drainage on the set.<br/><br/>Hmmm... you write a tongue-in-cheek review with a sarcastic title, and now the reviews are of course reviewed... well, fair enough, this is not a ""useful"" review, as determined by fans of the film that have been willing to trawl through and rate the 200 or so comments... but for the average Joe who will probably never make it through to the last pages of the reviews anyway, feel free to make up your own mind -- if you're planning to direct or star in your own musical, it may be compulsory viewing -- there's no denying it is a classic that captured the hearts of a generation or two."

"conedm","10","4","8","17 May 2003"," A homage to movies and actors
","This movie still stands as a rock today, over half a century after its release. As movies from the 40s and 50s seem to be a bit slow compared to today's standards (for example in movement and conversation) this is certainly not the case in 'Singin' in the Rain'.<br/><br/>Maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is a winner when it comes down to remarkable and memorable tunes, but this movie also has a few pretty tricks on its sleeve.<br/><br/>First of all there is the fabulous and superb choreography and (tap) dancing, one of the most impressive achievements in movie history.<br/><br/>Secondly this movie is a homage to movies and actors, in their struggles to make the movie a mature form of art.<br/><br/>And last but not least, there is humor all over the place. Especially the ups and downs of making and releasing the first 'talkie' musical is extremely funny. <br/><br/>'Singin' in the rain' is therefore a milestone in the evolution of movie making and deserves to be watched by everyone who likes dance and musical."

"ElMaruecan82","9","2","3","12 September 2011"," What a Glorious Feeling ..
","And what a glorious film ... #5 film in AFI's Top 100 movies, #1 musical, #16 romance and #16 comedy, ""Singin in the Rain"" doesn't celebrate Hollywood, it defines it through a range of emotions, so rich that you can't finish this timeless classic without shouting : ""Now, that's entertainment!"" <br/><br/>If there is ever a movie for which the word iconic takes its full meaning, ""Singin' in the Rain"" takes the cake, and an appetizing one where you can expect the beautiful Debbie Reynolds jumping out of it. With Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, she forms the so lovable trio that sets the cheerful mood in the opening sequence : holding their umbrellas, wearing raincoats, they enthusiastically walk and express their joy to be simply 'singin in the rain'. Indeed, the title itself, beyond its reference to the most memorable song, embodies the film's main feeling, something so positive it's impossible to write a review without using up all the synonyms of 'happiness'.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" incarnates a quite hedonistic philosophy of life, inspiring the most positive emotions even when the natural elements don't help. While many people try to run for a dry spot, afraid to get wet and catch a cold, Gene Kelly's let himself getting rain soaked while his heart is basking under sunshine of love. He savors the moment with a total carelessness, inviting the rain to come at him. This part doesn't only work because of the communicative aspect of the 'glorious' feeling, but also as an incredibly inspirational moment in its sheer simplicity. The image of Kelly swinging on the lamppost, is the eternal allegory of happiness that only Cinema could have illustrated, a happiness going through every possible stage, delight, pleasure, enchantment until it becomes a totally jubilant moment where Kelly literally splashes on a ocean of joy, until he faces a cop, whose presence puts an end to this orgasmic mayhem, and the melody can finally end ¬Ö leaving us with these immortal lines ""I'm dancing and singing in the rain""<br/><br/>This is one of these magical sequences that immediately penetrated people's hearts and, once and for all, our universal heritage. No one can imagine this film without immediately thinking of the rain, the lamppost and Gene Kelly's illuminating smile. I can't evoke the film, I can't watch it or live it without it bringing me back to my childhood memories. I discovered the song through one of its countless parodies, and it stuck in my mind right away. Once, my dad saw a documentary about the film and immediately called me to see if I that sequence rang a bell. Another day, still as a child, I saw a documentary about Hollywood MGM Golden Age, only waiting for the 'Singin' in the Rain' part ¬Ö and when I got to see the film, I finally surprised myself by enjoying the comedy more than the musical, and ""Make 'em laugh"" by Donald O'Connor, became my favorite part.<br/><br/>""Make' em Laugh"" is another amazing achievement that works alone as an efficient antidepressant. Donald O'Connor accomplishes an impressive acrobatic number, extending his comedic performance to every single element of slapstick, with a natural goofiness and perfect timing that makes it look like a spontaneous act of virtuosity and makes you forget about the rehearsal this would have probably taken : you just open your eyes, and admire the performance. He laughs, smiles, makes funny faces, gravity-defying moves with one motto, no ... not ""dignity, dignity"" but on the contrary trading any sense of dignity in order to make the other laugh, or giggle, or smile or at least feel good. O'Connor is the perfect clown without any ounce of sadness, the scene-stealing comic relief of a rather hilarious comedy! <br/><br/>The movie doesn't disobey the implicit golden rule that there's no better comedy than one with a heart, and the heart of the film belongs to the exquisite Debbie Reynolds, whose character has the merit of having 'inspired' the iconic rain sequence. She's extremely poignant in her lack of confidence and her will to help her friends that we automatically feel for her, as he would do to a Disney Princess. This analogy is not fortuitous and probably explains why I enjoyed the comedy more than the romance, the funny musical numbers more than the serious ones, the villain more than the princess. What a villain by the way, hard to imagine the film's success without the incredible Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen who provides perhaps more laughs than O'Connor in the comedy department, with her voice, speech mannerism and hilarious ""What am I dumb or something?"" catchphrase.<br/><br/>My last comment didn't intend to diminish the merit of the romance but I don't really see it as the movie's highlight although it features many memorable scenes. When Kelly as Lockwood says to Lina : ""I don't like her half as I hate you"", I think he sums it up quite well, as many fans probably love the romance but not as much as they adore the comedy. And count me also among those who fail to see the relevancy of the whole 'Broadway Melody' sequence that kind of deviated from the intelligence of the plot and weakened its 'vis comica'. ""Singin' in the Rain"" had to keep on the clever homage to that crucial transition to talking pictures and self-reflexive celebration of the genre that consecrated the triumph of talking pictures, the genre that probably best incarnates the bright side of Hollywood : musicals. As flashy, flamboyant and enjoyable as it was, the scene could've been shorter, end up with a kind of punchline or at least respected the ""Make' em laugh!"" motto.<br/><br/>I rated it a 9 because of the Broadway sequence, but the rest of the film deserves a 11 as one of the greatest comedies and the greatest musical ever, even better than ""Guys and Dolls"" put together."

"jayjaycee","9","1","1","28 February 2020"," The titular song is still stuck in my head
","""Singin' In The Rain"" is a 1952 musical romance directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly starring him and Debbie Reynolds. I think I speak in the name of countless when I say that two of the most important factors in my life are my passion for movies and my love for music. Not only do I happen to be a passionate stage actor and musician myself, both have played a major role since I was a kid and there's nothing more moving for me than the rawest and purest output of emotions. That's why I think that I was literally born for the genre musical - in both watching and performing. In any way, having witnessed this classic was a revelation for me. From the first minute on, it grabbed me on a deep emotional level. There's no actor or actress in this feature whose ability to act, dance or sing isn't absolutely masterful. Kelly and Reynolds pretty much dominated the screen with their absolutely heartwarming chemistry. It's a colourful piece or art that perfectly manages to amaze the audience with it's uplifting story that realistically depicts a time in the history of cinema when talking films were said to never make it in Hollywood - and at the same time subliminally criticises it. It's a touching story that perfectly balances well written and crafted scenes or dialogue and drama with ingenious and non-repetitive musical numbers. They all fit so well in the atmosphere of their respective scenes and (except for one in the end) had me on the edge of my seat and in a form of indescribable ecstasy. What I experienced there was classic acting at it's finest. The songs and musical score are absolutely loveable and unforgettable and the titular number has been stuck in my head for hours since I watched it. The magnificent camera work enables the viewer to literally live every scene on such a close level that everyone who feels in a bad mood before watching it will feel immensely better afterwards. It's the sheer amount of talent and the perfectionist directorial style of the director duo that make this film almost reach perfection and so much inspiring in so many ways. All in all, it's outstanding as it is iconic, still untouchable and the forerunner for every musical that comes after. Even in modern standards this one still beats every film in direct competition. I'm pretty sure that when you look up the term ""musical"" in a lexicon you will find an image of Gene Kelly dancing around a streetlight pool and singing one of the most famous numbers of all time. No matter how I felt today, I can't help but repeat what he's singing over and over again. It cheered me up and made me see rain in a way more positive way. ""I'm dancing ... and singing in the rain."" - and literally feel this. Thank Hollywood this films exists!"

Aside from the fact that the numbers featured are immortal, the dancing is a lot more athletic and frankly amazing, for those of us who don't really ""get"" Fred Astaire.<br/><br/>What grabbed me about ""Singin' in the Rain"" is that it's about a serious issue, the move from silent films to talkies, and actually features some real-world detail, like a star losing her career when she opens her mouth to speak, and a relationship manufactured by a studio.<br/><br/>The movie lost my attention at times, but it works.

","A movie about the early years of Hollywood. More specifically, about the transition period between the silent era and the so called talkies. One of the most well-known musicals of all time. The best musical of all time, if some critics are to be believed.<br/><br/>And there definitely is a lot of musical content. The movie sees no problem in bursting into a song and dance number whenever it pleases. I'd even argue that it's a bit much. By the time the seventh or so tap dancing sequence rolled around, I was ready to throw in the towel. Granted, some of the song numbers are absolutely phenomenal, like the titular Singin' in the Rain or Good Morning that comes immediately before it.<br/><br/>Luckily the film hits its stride around the middle and it's a much smoother sailing from there. Or I just got used to it. Who can say.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good, which helps a lot. Gene Kelly not also directed the film, he also plays the lead role, and he's certainly having a blast with it. Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, playing Kelly's love interest and best buddy, respectively, are also great and their joined song numbers are easily the most entertaining ones.<br/><br/>Character-wise, the one thing I didn't quite get is the character of Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), the acting partner of Kelly's character. She's showcased as this great villain and is the primary antagonist of the film, but the way the film tried to portray her never quite matched with the actual character. Sure, she's self-centered, narcissistic and willing to trample others in her pursuit of fame, but she never seemed all that malicious to me. It seemed much more like she didn't know any other way to act.<br/><br/>A film that certainly earns its status as a classic. It's a product of its era and quite different from modern films, but it has a lot of charm and energy, which carry it far. Recommended for fans of the musical genre."

","I've always had a problem with the accolades heaped upon this fine movie because that's all I see, a FINE, well-made, well-sung, well-danced film as opposed to a 'classic', 'all-time great', 'best musical ever made' notices that hand around its neck like an albatross constantly threatening to choke the life out of it. It's also difficult for me to think of anyone more overrated than Comden and Green, who are right up there with Hitchcock as far as misplaced plaudits are concerned. Their schtick was New York and the bulk of the Books and lyrics they wrote seldom ventured West of Central Park, this Hollywood-spoof being one exception. Producer Arthur Freed clearly wanted to kill two birds with one stone by raiding his own back catalogue of mediocre lyrics (you don't believe me? try listening to Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Larry Hart, Johnny Mercer, etc) written largely with Nacio Herb Brown and then blatantly 'stealing' Porter's Be A Clown melody and cobbling on new lyrics. The satire is okay but even in 1952 was hardly new, Debbie Reynolds is competent at best, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor excellent which leaves Gene Kelly showing yet again how many light years behind Fred Astaire we was lagging. Pleasant rather than memorable."

"Quinoa1984","10","3","6","31 March 2007"," unequivocally the best American musical-comedy out of (and about) the Hollywood Golden age
","Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain embraces conventions and self-reflection like it's the most wonderful things that can be accomplished with a musical-comedy. It's knowing so well of everything that made up the Hollywood musical- and the bumpy transition from silent film to sound- and always gives a wink and a nod while retaining as a form of pure cinema, in a sense, by giving into its gleeful archetypes. It's also, surprisingly, very smart and witty for a comedy, with its goofy and cornball moments well earned thanks to the earnest effort put into looking so effortless and totally fantastical. It's a fantastical sensibility that can only come out of the movies, the escapism of smitten romances, eccentric characters, and a more contemporary spirit than one might expect (one ends up laughing at how risqu√É¬© the humor can get, and how guiltlessly silly). And ultimately, it breaks ground, like Citizen Kane, using all of the songs, tricks and superlative technical additives at the disposal of the artists to make a film/amalgam a marvel on all fronts. To put it in a more direct way, if you don't feel happy once this movie ends, it may be time to hit up the the doctors for some heavy medication.<br/><br/>The story is like a double-edged sword, where the world of film-making and musicals get their just due in being revealing and reveling in the history of it all. Two movie stars (Kelly and Jean Hagen) of the silent era on high acclaim, who really shouldn't be together, get put to the task of there being a new medium: the sound picture, where people need to talk into the microphone, big physical acts and motions of the grandiose don't quite fit, and the dialog needs to make sense- through strong voices. After a disastrous test screening, a new plan is hatched- that the leading lady, the wonderfully high-strung and ""dumb"" Linda, be dubbed over from her squeaky voice to the impeccable voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Adding in the musical sequences, and tweaking it a bit, make it a total hit, but at what cost? This is the broad stroke of the story, anyway, but there's much more to Singin' in the Rain than the usual double-crossings and cynicism to the Hollywood ""dream factory"".<br/><br/>All the humanity that the principle characters feel, be it humor (""Make em Laugh"" is a classic number), or in love (the sweet song behind the Dali-esquire set behind Kelly and Reynolds), or in just enjoying what the world has to offer ala ""Good Morning""), gets expressed through song and music, with the title song given a classic form of song and dance expression- as elsewhere in the film- as the camera gets its chances for going into the vibrant style, but also is patient in just capturing all the music on all fronts. On top of being such a sharply crafted comedy, with practically all of the jokes hitting levels of hilarity few musicals could aspire to today (usually in part to Donald O'Connor's determined comic relief and levity), Kelly creates indelible images of choreography, in painstaking detail of foot-work and in the timing of movement with the characters. This all reaches its nexus in a sequence that's all the more brilliant considering it's not even a filmed scene within the film, but that it's the visualization of the idea behind a musical sequence in the film, as Kelly pitches it to his producers. <br/><br/>It's loaded with bits of sensuality one wouldn't expect in a 1950s movie (look at those legs!), and encompassing all of the juicy, delightful bits in the crossroads between Broadway and Hollywood musicals. You can lose yourself in this sequence, and always with a big grin at the proceedings. Even towards the end it doesn't lose sight of its 'movie-ness', yet critiquing the nature of the business amid the magic that comes out of it. So get ready to tap your feet and, if inclined, sing along to what serves as the perennial feel-good movie, a work of popular art that has some serious questions in the subtext and never relents to let the audience have a good time at the absurdity of it all- a master's class in absurdity, artificiality, and a love of all things Golden-Age-Hollywood. Think of it as the musical-comedy side of the coin to the dark film-noir coin of Sunset Boulevard; both question what it is to work and stay pertinent in the Hollywood system, but where one treats Hollywood with tougher satire and darker themes, the other goes the route of everything being so fake that it resembles a reality of a fluffy, knowing and kidding dream. An essential of 50s cinema."
"jboothmillard","10","3","6","7 December 2005"," Singin' in the Rain
","One of the greatest classic musicals of all time, and one of my favourites, from directors Stanley Donen (Charade), and the star of the picture. Oh before I start, its not just the film that is a homage to past musicals, but the song (along with many of the others in the film) is popular in two other films. Anyway, basically it is 1927, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, starring, directing and staging the musical numbers) is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, along with his annoying voiced co-star of his new picture, Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen). Warner Bros. have created the first talking motion picture, or ""talkie"", and all other studios are joining in, including Don's current studio, who have decided to turn his new upcoming silent film, The Duelling Cavalier, into the first talking musical, The Dancing Cavalier. Don has the perfect voice, where as Lina obviously ruins it, so they get a new star to replace her voice, who Don has already met and become very close to, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Cosmo Brown (Golden Globe winning Donald O'Connor, kind of like another Sir Norman Wisdom or Lee Evans) is also a part of the act, not just as Don's best friend and help in production, but at showing him and others his great, and often hilarious abilities. In the end, the film, after all its trouble in production, is a success, Kathy is revealed as the true great singing voice of Lina, and she stars with Don in a new motion picture (shown on poster). The story has taken great songs from other musicals, there are great colours and staged dances, including that one where Kelly is imagining a part of his new film where he wants to be a dancer, and eventually runs into Cyd Charisse. The cheerful ""Good Morning"" was number 72, the hilarious ""Make 'Em Laugh"" was number 49, and of the course, the key sequence of the film, Kelly's solo dance routine showing a character's true love and expression of this, ""Singin' in the Rain"" was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. I can believe the rumour that because of An American in Paris a year before took over the Oscars, and this as a result did not win any, which it should of, it only received two (pretty lousy) nominations, but I would say that this certainly much more admired. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Lennie Hayton, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Gene Kelly was number 66 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 1 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","The Broadway dance sequence is quite phenomenal, but I always thought it was inconsistent with the rest of the movie.  It's pretty impressive for a 1952 musical, but not the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a 20s era studio's first talkie.  The movie (Singin' in the Rain) is about the making of a talkie about a dancing cavalier, but this modern sequence suddenly pops up unexpectedly.  And where's Lina Lamont who's supposed to be the star of the movie?<br/><br/>The Broadway sequence is a joy to behold, but it really doesn't fit."

","I'm not a big fan of musical movies, in general, and this one is no exception. I only give the movie a 6 out of 10, because of Donald O'Connor's amazing dance and movement, and Debbie Reynold's innocence. The focus of my comments, however, goes to Mr. O'Connor. The fact that he spent 3 days in bed resting after ""Make 'em laugh"" shows how hard this man worked. It is one of the most brilliant pieces of solo physical comedy in any film. <br/><br/>Donald O'Connor makes dancing look like walking, it's so natural for him. Gene Kelly dances like the egoist that he apparently was. I love the fluidity of O'Connor's movements, and the contrast is never so pronounced as when they are dancing the duet in the elocutionists office. O'Connor is fluid, whereas Kelly is clearly stiff and wooden and ""on"". This is what makes O'Connor, and Danny Kaye, so much more professional than the Kellys and the Astaires. They put their efforts into their work, not into their egos. <br/><br/>I also can see where Chevy Chase snagged some of his aping techniques that he used so well when he mocked Jane Curtin behind her back on Weekend Update. O'Connor does the job here, behind the elocutionists back - what facial dexterity!!"

"MartinHafer","9","3","7","18 July 2011"," As long as Anne Marie is no where about, you'll enjoy this lovely film.
","Tonight was my second time watching ""Singing in the Rain"" and I am actually surprised that I ever saw it again. Now it is not because it's a bad film--it just holds an annoying memory. You see, when I saw the film, an annoying person named Anne Marie was also watching it....and yelled out what would happen in the finale BEFORE it happened. So, after years of therapy, I have finally decided to watch this again. And, in light of the annoying Anne Marie, I WON'T spoil the film by announcing spoilers in my review! <br/><br/>""Singing in the Rain"" is set at the time period in which silent pictures were being replaced with sound (about 1927). Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen play two established stars who are beloved by the public. Sound isn't a bad thing for Gene, as he can sing and dance. But Jean, uggh, she has a voice like a Brooklyn parrot and her career is doomed (and she great in this role). That is, until they get the idea of dubbing her with sweet Debbie Reynolds. But as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Jean is a devil and Debbie is amazing--and Gene is head over heels for her. What's to become of them?<br/><br/>The film does something interesting for a musical. Almost all the music is actually recycled from earlier MGM musicals (often from this late 20s time period). While this might seem cheesy, it worked very well because the songs were period and because the production values (the dancing, Technicolor and singing) were so nice it really breathed life into them. In fact, several of the musical numbers are among the best ever filmed--such as ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""Make 'em Laugh"". Unfortunately, and I know this will sound like sacrilege, but I think the film had too many numbers, as some of the more garish dance numbers (""Gotta Dance"") detracted from those that were sublime. Still, it has a very, very memorable score, a lot of energy and fun make this a musical to watch...provided Anne Marie is no where in sight. I wonder what ever became of her....perhaps some other film viewers killed her (we can only hope)."

I really didn't like the ""Gotta Dance"" video thing, and the woman who tosses the coin over and over, that was really corny.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the song that\'s called, ""Make 'em laugh!"" was really good. Especially when Cosmo crashed through the wall. The Lima thing sounded rally psycho. Her voice made me want to cringe. But I guess that's how Jean Hagen's character spoke. Good movie.

"richard-dainty","9","3","7","18 April 2005"," How musicals should be!
","There are a very small, select number of films, which stand the test of time and will live on forever. One such film is 'Singing in the Rain'. Made in 1952, much of the Hollywood satire found in the film is still relevant to the star system and studio structure of Tinsel Town today. Gene Kelly puts in an unforgettable performance as the all-singing, all-dancing, Don Lockwood.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of Hollywood filmmakers, making the transition from the silent movies of yester-year into the new age of talking-film. With a little help from his friends Lockwood turns a terrible formulaic studio picture into a show stopping musical.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that everyone should go back to and watch again. It is a fantastic reminder of how the musical genre used to be, and should be! It also struck me as surprisingly historical, charting the introduction of the talking-movies and the initial public and professional reaction to it. Watching this film will remind you of the heart-warming, lifting feeling that many modern films just fail to deliver. If anyone can resist the urge to smile and laugh during Donald O'Connor's fantastic performance of 'Make 'em laugh' then it would be a very sorry day indeed! If it is an achievement to get your audience on the edge of their seat then this film surpasses that achievement because I was very close to dancing on mine!!!"

I have seen An American in Paris many times and of course I adore the ballet encapsulated within the film.

"FilmOtaku","9","3","7","14 July 2004"," How rare! A thoroughly enjoyable musical!
","Not being a fan of the Musical genre, when I come across a musical film that I enjoy, it's pretty much an anomaly.  `Singin' in the Rain' is one of those exceptions, because it is not only immensely enjoyable, but it is sarcastic and intelligent as well.  `Singin' in the Rain' stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and is a romantic comedy about the advent of the talking picture in 1920's Hollywood.  While a lot of the jokes are over the top and biting, one can't help but imagine that this is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the hysteria over talkies and the scramble by the studios to compete.  <br/><br/>Probably the most striking thing about `Singin' in the Rain' is the unbelievable talent, particularly the performances of O'Connor and Kelly. When they start dancing and doing their shtick, I'm suddenly ten years old again and grinning like a fool at the screen.  There are few films that make me laugh out loud, and often, but this film is one of them.  One of the very few criticisms I would have about this film is the scene with Gene Kelly (`Gotta Dance!') toward the end of the film that is about twenty minutes long and pretty much grinds the film to a screeching halt for me.  Until this (unbearably long) musical number, the film is moving at a really quick pace, but it takes a few minutes after this scene for the film to pick up steam again in time for the hilarious conclusion.  I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind the decision to put such a long and displaced number in the film, but if the intent was to show the irony of Hollywood, etc. I'm sure they could have been a bit more concise about it.  (And still showcase Cyd Charrise's amazing legs!)<br/><br/>It takes a lot for a comedy, and especially a musical comedy at that, to turn me into a drooling fangirl, but `Singin' in the Rain' does that every time to me.  This is a feel-great movie that is truly a fantastic classic.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","There is no need to make another statement on the superior quality of this musical of musicals. But what strikes me is that subsequently  neither of the four secondary performers (Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen or Cyd Charisse) got the opportunity to develop a top career as a movie star. Nor the unbelievable performance of Donald (have you ever seen such an all-round and perfect comedian?), nor the stupendous achievement of 19-year old Debbie (not being an educated dancer doing what she did in the shadow of a superstar like Gene Kelly), nor the high quality act of Jean, nor the most beautiful Hollywood female dancing of Cyd, got them what they deserved. Apart from a few minor exceptions they had to act in a few long forgotten movies or had to go back to the theater or try nightclubs or TV. What a pity."

","I was raised around musicals, but I could never stomach the concept of people breaking out into song and dance at the most inconceivably awkward moments.

For that, I tolerate it.<br/><br/>As one of the best musicals ever, I rated it above-average as a movie.  For me, that's an impressive feat.

Why she didn't become a bigger star than she was, I'll never understand. Nothing against the also-talented and versatile Debbie Reynolds, but I would like to have seen less of Debbie and a lot more of Cyd. Maybe this is just a movie that hasn't worn well over the years, but to me, it's greatly overrated.

","Although I wouldn't call this film Oscar worthy, it was definitely one that captured my attention. The quick witted humor between Don and Cosmo, as well as the adorable romance between the Hollywood beau and the up-and-comer were entertaining, to say the least. <br/><br/>I do however, believe this movie is both wonderfully simple and highly overrated. Yes, the musical numbers are outstanding, the singing and dancing are great, the cinematography looks beautiful, and there's some memorable sequences, but overall, this feels rather light. But, it did irritate me that most of the musicals numbers weren't really there to serve the story or move things forward, but just pass the time. <br/><br/>I will say, that Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's direction is flawless. Rather than the quick cutting and intense camera movement which is supposed to create more excitement but is really just proof of the director's lack of confidence, Kelly and Donen are content to simply enjoy the spectacle of each amazing set-piece. Their restraint is on display throughout the entire film, trusting that the audience is feeling each moment without the need for explicitly telling them."

The problem is that Hagen's voice is so terrible that Cathy Seldon, played by Debbie Reynolds, has to dub her singing. Therefore Seldon becomes the real star of THE DUELING CAVALIER. The interesting thing about it is that for some of the songs in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN Reynolds' voice was dubbed by someone. So the question is: Who is the real star of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN?"

","If I had to recommend a musical director this is Stanley Donen. The director of films like ""Funny Face"" (1957), ""Charade"" (1963) or ""Two for the Road"" (1967).

I though: ""isn't it a Hitchcockian movie?""<br/><br/>And yet, Donen borrowed some technical advices from the Master of Suspense. But this is not the movie I'm goin' to talk about. Right now the movie that concerns us is a masterpiece called ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952). A movie with three hit songs ranked in 2004 AFI's 100 Songs 100 Years: the well-known ""Singin' in the Rain"" by Gene Kelly, ""Make 'Em Laugh"" by Donald O' Connor and ""Good Morning"" by the protagonist trio (Reynolds is the third one). But this isn't just the beginning.<br/><br/>""Singing' in the Rain"" is a history travel though the 20s silent history of Hollywood. When ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927) marked a before and after on the next generation. The movie is a testimonial video file recorded with mastery with which Kelly has acclimatized his audience since ""On the Town"" (1949) as the first collaboration with Donen. Nothing further to say about. The camera movements and surreal pictures in some parts of the plot are transgressive for that period of time.

This is so well rehearsed and choreographed that even if I didn't really get into the story as much it was just worth it for the dancing talent.<br/><br/>Movies of this era seem to have some real issues with the pitch of a women's voice.

","Admittedly, for someone who has little contact with song and dance films, ""Singing in the rai"" is still amazing to me. It is said that this film is a classic of song and dance films in film history.
From this film, you can also see the decline of silent films. The film is set in the background of Hollywood's transition from the silent film era to the sound film era. In 1927, Tang and Linna were a famous screen couple in the silent film era. With the rise of sound movies, Linna fell into a huge dilemma. Although she has a beautiful face and a plump posture, but she does not have a good voice, she is very different when making sound movies. In order to give Linna a good voice, Tang introduced Cathy to the production team and asked Cathy to voice Linna. Cathy's voice and Lina's beautiful appearance made Linna's popularity soaring; however, Linna, who was blinded, did not recognize Cathy's credit. Linna's approach caused dissatisfaction from other production staff. In a performance on the stage with the film, everyone designed Linna to be a big ugly.
I actually do n't really like singing and dancing movies. In the plot, singing and dancing always seem very lengthy, but when watching this movie, I can watch this movie peacefully with a smile, but the song and dance movie is always a decline Genre, pure song and dance films have already entered the current film in other forms and with another element. Perhaps song and dance films are no longer suitable for today's era, just like the era of Chaplin's silent films is incompatible with the current sound era. In the film, when the sound film appeared, everyone can't wait to cast into the embrace of the sound era.
However, what I want to say more is that this is Hollywood's self-deprecating work. In a fundamental sense, this is to put a movie in a movie, make a movie in a movie, and in the movie, it clearly shows us the Hollywood at that time. The way of filming can even be said to show us without scruples, the gossip and inside story of the star's life.
Of course, the classic dialogue in the film can touch my heart all the time, maybe in our fashionable words, Tang He is too provocative. In the film, although it is raining heavily, the mood is not wet, because of her, so You can sing and wander in the rain wantonly. Even though there is heavy downpour, you can gently put down the umbrella in your hand and sing in the rain wantonly!
When it comes to this, I have to talk about a personal rainy complex. Whenever it rains, I can't help but put away the umbrella in my hand and hum gently: ""I am singing in the rain"""

"krational66","9","0","0","24 April 2020"," A classic of musical films
","It is said to be a classic musical film in film history. It was made in 1952, when other countries were rebuilding from the ruins.<br/><br/>(perhaps only the United States could have been so happy to be singing and dancing after the war in the faith of its idealism.)<br/><br/>The film began when Arthur Freed, a MGM producer, wanted to ""recycle"" some old songs, so he asked two of his writers to string them together into a story, and Gene Kelly agreed to perform. As these old songs happened to be in the 2030s, they were set in the period when the silent films were transformed into sound films, vividly depicting all kinds of interesting things in the studio. It is said that people often come to their sets to share their memories of that period. They also examined in detail the costumes and equipment of the Hollywood stars.<br/><br/>For me, the song and dance were a bit long, distracting memories of high school cheerleading practices; That kind of Cinderella storyline often makes me think the heroes and heroines are like barbie and Kenny (or shrek 2's Prince Charming). What attracts me most is the details of those early studio shooting. In the film, you can see a lot of props, equipment and lights in the studio. You can also see the rehearsals, the movements of the stunt actors, the dubbing to the mouth and the way of early radio.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain, which is classed as a backstage musical, is a way for viewers to see things backstage in the form of a show. The main character in the play is set to be the main character in the movie, so you can see the production process and shooting effects (especially the sound) of the movie. The film talks about the nature and meaning of film media itself with ease, touching on the boundary between truth and fiction (ex: what the hero says at the beginning is not consistent with the truth presented in the picture, the heroine speaks out her doubts about the performance of the movie, the hero's best friend makes me Laugh to defend the entertainment of the movie, etc.). Through the process of making the film to highlight that this is a ""film about film"".<br/><br/>It has been said that 'a film about a film' is a subject that masters and writers and directors only touch upon, and that is a serious salute and question to the film. I don't really know the definition or the depth of it, but I think Singin' in the Rain is often a very clever way to play with the fun of the real versus the real, singing and dancing and having fun. It's a lot more approachable than tsai ming-liang's 'don't go anywhere,' fellini's 'eight and a half' or chu fu's 'Day for night.'<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain, with its love story as the first sugar coating, and the package of wonderful songs and dances, has become a commercial selling point, but in addition to that, it has many interesting aspects and exquisite details, which make it famous in history, popular and popular.<br/><br/>In the rain nest at home looking at the wonderful dance to listen to the melodious song, just like the appreciation of the Disney cartoon do not have to worry, there is a natural optimism: evil will overcome the right, the difficulties will eventually overcome, the discrete will also be reunited, love, cause success.<br/><br/>(this film is suitable for every tired night, to soothe the reality of cynicism, hypnosis to sleep.)"

Watch as O'Connor throws himself around like a ragdoll, singing ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" and Cyd Charisse, one of the best dancers ever to appear on screen, adds elegance to a film that is set in the 1920s, when sound motion pictures spelled career-end for many a whiney-voiced silent film star, spoofed in this film by the hilarious Jean Hagen. The film also revived the song of the same title by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, which was first popularized in ""Hollywood Review of 1929."" Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen directed the movie, with story and screenplay by the dynamic husband-and-wife team Betty Comden and Adolph Green, lyrics by Arthur Freed.

","(Best read while listening to Benny Goodman's Carnegie Hall Concert)<br/><br/>When I was a slave in Egypt (as I reminisce yearly at the Seder table), I was driven with whips and scorpions. As a young man in New York City, my father was driven with the drums of Gene Krupa, just like Benny Goodman's band. The whips and scorpions yielded only ten plagues and some pyramids. Listen to the music of Benny Goodman, and hear ecstasy. Listen to it and need to dance. Look at the word, and trace its origins to the Greek. That's what I mean: ecstasy, like a maenad high on wine and ivy and dance.<br/><br/>That's why I love musicals. I don't know who said it, but when mere words fail you, you sing; when song fails you, you dance. Listening to Goodman play ""Sing, Sing Sing (with a Swing)"" makes me want to dance. So does Singin' in the Rain. Gene Kelly drove Debbie Reynolds, sobbing, to Fred Astaire (another famous taskmaster) for sympathy. Donald O'Connor was sent home for a week's bed rest after performing ""Make 'Em Laugh"" and after that, had to perform it again. When Arthur Freed asked what Gene Kelly would be doing for the title number, Kelly said ""I don't know, Arthur. All I know is it'll be raining, and I'll be singing."" Millard Mitchell based his performance on Freed; Jean Hagen was robbed of a best supporting actress Oscar; Comden & Green were still building their reputation and Kelly & Donen were taking it easy after An American in Paris.<br/><br/>As a wiser man than I has noted the best works are often produced when the artists are slumming a bit. All I know is that when they're not making me laugh in this movie (and sometimes when they are), they are dancing joyfully, and making me wish I could dance. There are no sad numbers, and for me the song ""Moses Supposes"", when Kelly & O'Connor rip the speech expert's office to shreds with a tongue twister and a tap dance, is just as exhilarating as ""Good Mornin'"" or ""Singin' in the Rain"". When I'm in the depths of one of my depressive funks (as I am today), and every task seems to be impossible, it's good to look at this movie. It helps me remember that, fantasy though it is, it exists, with its performers' feet bleeding, and rising from their sickbeds to try again to make me smile. And they will succeed.<br/><br/>According to the story my jazz maven from Toronto tells me, they were not even going to record the Carnegie Hall concert. They had more than enough air checks. At the last moment, they put a mike in its wonted spot in the ceiling, ran a wire across the street, recorded in wax and then the masters went into Benny Goodman's hall closet for a decade and a half, until his young daughter said ""Daddy, what's this?"" We came close to losing that. Singin' in the Rain has remained on view for more than sixty years, a commonplace miracle of survival Let's enjoy it, separately but together, and thank all those people who made it, from Arthur Freed down to runner who fetched coffee on set. They've never done better."

"vincent-27","5","0","0","24 March 2020"," Good dance numbers, interesting as historical reference
","I only watched this movie because I am making my way through the AFI top 100, and it another one of those 50's movies that are cringe worthy by today's standards but it is interesting to watch as historical reference. Musicals are tough to get through normally, but 50's musicals are even tougher, especially Gene Kelly musicals.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that during this time America was trying to rebuild society both internally, and around the world, as well as trying to forget the horrors of WWII. Enter Gene Kelly with enough schmalz to kill an elephant. So much so that it seems like a parody. It is interesting to see a movie made at a time (the 50's) looking back to a *previous* time (the 20's) and portraying that as even MORE cutesy and ""gosh gee wiz"". After watching An American in Paris, I realize that this has a lot to do with Gene Kelley, As a dancer he is amazing, and Donald O'Connor is equally impressive, but that's about it. After a while it becomes more painful to watch a middle aged man falling for a late teens/early twenties girl (Debbie Reynolds was 19 in this movie). Also for all it's praise, the iconic singin in the rain dance sequence has some bad tap dancing overdubs.<br/><br/>What is interesting is as you read behind the scenes you learn about how difficult the movie was to make for everyone (Oconnor collapsed after he had to redo his famous make em laugh sequence and Reynolds was reduced to tears trying to learn the dance steps) yet they're beaming with big smiles. It is symbolic of America in the 50's, smiling on the outside while you are in pain on the inside.<br/><br/>Another thing that is hard to watch is all the garish costumes, so many ugly colors! Historical reference is import here as well since movies in color was a new thing, and it's painfully obvious that they really wanted to show it off.<br/><br/>So overall, some impressive sequences, some good songs and a reference point for what hollywood was before the neo realism wave of the 1960s and 70s, but not much else. If you like sugary sweet fluff, this is your film."

"o-11280","10","0","0","22 January 2020"," Unforgettable Masterpiece
","When asked to name movie musicals, the average person might list Into the Woods (2014), La La Land (2016), or The Greatest Showman (2017). A real theater kid knows that the greatest movie musicals were made before our time. The greats include My Fair Lady (1964), The Sound of Music (1965), and, of course, Singin' in the Rain (1952). Despite being nearly 70 years old, MGM's Singin' in the Rain still proves itself as one of the greatest musical movies. The light-hearted and fun musical dazzles audiences new and old with every viewing.
Singin' in the Rain shows a studio switching over from the silent film era to ""talkies"". Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) works with his friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and ""love interest"" Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When they try to make the change to talkies, they discover that Lamont's voice, sounding more like nails on a chalkboard than a voice, is unsuitable for film. After a hilarious run in with chorus girl and inspiring actress Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) Don falls deeply in love and works with Cosmo and Kathy to get her into the talkies and to replace Lina. Hilarity ensues as Kathy dubs for Lina in the film and the secret is uncovered. The film is filled with unforgettable songs and jaw dropping dance numbers done by the stellar cast. The title number, singin' in the rain, in which Gene Kelly sings dances around a street while drenched in rain, is the most famous part of the film, but the other overshadowed numbers are nothing short of masterpieces. ""Make em' Laugh"", sung by Donald O'Connor, is a joyful and lively number about how everyone loves a comedic performance where O'Connor does a number of ridiculously hilarious tricks and flips. It never fails to impress me as i can only imagine the toll running that scene must've done on O'Connor's body as he never seems to stop moving. Another overshadowed song is ""Good Morning"" sung by the lead trio, Kelly, Reynolds, and O'Connor. They sing together in a heartwarming pick-me-up song filled with dancing and laughing. Balancing out the breath-taking numbers is some forgettable scenes. The whole broadway melody scene is so unnecessary and drawn out. I find myself fast-forwarding past it every time I watch this movie. While a beautiful dance, its adds nothing to the film and takes away from the plot already built up. They smacked it right in the middle of the movie with no explanation and it ends up being a 15 minute useless interlude to an otherwise incredible story. Besides this fault I can't help but forgive the film because the rest of it is so fun to watch. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds beautifully play a wonderful couple and both put so much passion into their performances that you can truly feel the love oozing from the screen. The talent and commitment of the entire cast is incredible and something that is rare in movies now and can only be seen on the stages of broadway.
Singin' in the Rain will forever be a film that I will never tire of no matter how many times I see it. The combination of fantastic acting, singing, choreography, cinematography, and colorful costumes make this into a highly entertaining movie that can cheer anyone up. I don't use the word masterpiece lightly, but this film is truly a masterpiece and I hope the new generation doesnt let it pass them by."

","Singin' in the Rain achieved only moderate success after its initial release. Though it was the tenth highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., it did not show up in any ""10 Best Pictures of the Year"" list, and did not win any Academy Award. It achieved its current legendary success not through its box office or reviews, but through later critics that occupied university classrooms who acclaimed it as the ""best Hollywood musical of all time."" But while classics were often memorized along with their derivatives and influences, Singin' in the Rain, despite paid tribute by numerous later directors, was followed by the demise of classical era of musicals in Hollywood. Singin' in the Rain became not only the apogee of American musicals, but also one of the last great American musicals.<br/><br/>This embarrassing status was, of course, due partially to the development of American film industry. The 60s' witnessed the rise of the New Hollywood, in which the types of the films produced and the production of films differed distinctly from its classical counterparts. But the early 50s' was also a time period shadowed by the Hays Code and the blacklist, which jointly limited the space for artistic expression. If we trace farther, in the 50s' and the 20s', following the upshot of World Wars, the sphere of influence of the old Europe whittled down, while the U.S. became increasingly vocal in shaping world order. Even the center of the arts shifted from Paris to New York, due partially to the CIA, the secret sponsor of Jackson Pollock, the great new American artist.<br/><br/>In this context, the enduring success of Singin' in the Rain should be examined critically. Like lots of musical pictures, Singin' in the Rain was acclaimed for its spectacular score and visual effect, but its plots are far from flawless. For example, the role of Lina Lamont can represent every star fallen into oblivion in talkies era, but her fall, despite her beauty and acting skills, was justified by emphasizing her hubris. Don is just another male actor that makes far more money than his female coworkers and is adored by literally everyone surrounding him. Kathy makes her way up to the top through, well, her great singing skills and a male actor's favor. This is just the same old Hollywood that has been predominated by gender inequality, where men always have a place and can even determine (under a benign disguise) the fate of women.<br/><br/>Kathy, at first sight untamable, was eventually incorporated into Hollywood. Singin' in the Rain markets the splendor of Hollywood by appearing as honest as it could be, which did leave a great impression on audience with its kaleidoscopic scenes and heartfelt revelation of the true feelings. As the Tiller Girls, lamented by Jewish intellectuals as the quintessential mass culture, proudly presented in Singin' in the Rain, it was inevitable American mass culture achieved its status in postwar world. In 1956, Jackson Pollock committed suicide; in the 60s', Andy Warhol became another great American artist. Hail American pop culture, for all its greatness and the rot within."

","'Singin' In The Rain (1952)' is one of the most memorable and enduring movie musicals of all time, remaining a classic even after all these years. It is also, despite my well-documented reservations with the genre, one of the best of its kind, especially when it comes to handling its sing-song scenes. All of its song-and-dance numbers are diegetic, or otherwise make total narrative sense, and only a couple seem to slightly break from the presented world-space, with the occasional abandonment of actual scenes to long tap routines feeling like there'd be at least some objection from those being fobbed off in favour of dance - or those wandering why on earth the characters are dancing like madmen at these occasionally inappropriate times - and the players sometimes making eyes at the 'camera' as opposed to anyone within their vicinity. There's also one number in which three people simultaneously know choreography to a dance they're making up on the spot, though this isn't a massive issue as they're all professional dancers and doing fairly standard tap for most of the piece - plus, the song in question is pre-existing and so the dance could be inspired by it. Indeed, only two songs were actually written for this flick, despite the fact that most have become synonymous with it. Even the title song was already around, which has certainly been tied to its segment in the film but is actually supposedly the inspiration for the entire picture (somehow). What's most striking about the flick, for me, is its story. Sure, the musical aspects are wonderfully done and certainly some of the best of their kind. I can't express how impressed I was when Donald O'Connor ran up a straight wall and back-flipped off it. Sometimes, these dance-numbers go on for too long, though, especially towards the latter half once the choreography starts to repeat. They actually begin to detract from the narrative slightly. While the 'Broadway Ballet' sequence is a visual treat and a remarkable achievement, it is totally superfluous and kills the pacing. It takes away from the most important aspect, which is - and always should be - the story. Still, we're back on track before long. The tale is an interesting and rather well-told one, despite some unfortunate signs of its age. The silent star pulled into the sound era has been used in a number of films since this, though this puts its focus more on creating the first movie musical and therefore becomes a slightly meta experience. It is also nicely satirical, too, a self-aware look at cinema history seen from fairly fresh eyes (the fifties weren't far off from the late twenties, after all). It's this light-tone and moments of genuine humour that keep the piece afloat, with an endearing cast caught in an entertaining quest to keep their careers afloat. It's an enjoyable experience that provides all the spectacle you'd expect but does sometimes get a little too caught up in it. 7/10"

","Singin' in the Rain is considered one of the best movies of all time. Although, only two Oscar nominations prove that movie wasn't that highly appreciated when it came out in 1952. It was directed by Stanley Donley and Gene Kelly who is also the main star of the movie and it tells a story about a silent film transition to sound.<br/><br/>To be honest, despite being a huge movie lover, I am not really into musicals. During these types of movies I often lose focus because of overlong singing and dancing scenes which I believe are created for theatre, not for cinema. That's the reason why I've seen only handful of musicals. So when Singin' in the Rain started I didn't really have big expectations. Don't get me wrong, I knew that I'll be watching a classic movie, that's why I decided I'll give it a chance.<br/><br/>All I want to say is that I'm very happy now that I've seen this film. It has both interesting and educational story. As you would expect, the acting is great too. From the technical standpoint Singin' in the Rain is flawless, the use of color and long shots is very impressive. I was really surprised how funny this movie is, even almost all of the singing and dancing scenes are hilarious. I am really glad I've seen this great movie."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","24 May 2017"," Among the most iconic Hollywood musicals
","""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the most highly praised American films of all time, regularly appearing on critics' top ten lists. It tells the story of a group of film-makers and stars circa 1927 making the awkward transition from silent to 'talkie' pictures.<br/><br/>The film is basically a celebration of the well received MGM musicals that had been appearing for about 25 years at that point. Almost all of the songs featured in the film originated from earlier films. Actually, the story was built around the songs, which is sometimes evident in the tenuous associations given by the script.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the story is quite interesting as it revisits the period of transition between silent and talking pictures, showing some of the difficulties encountered along the way. The romantic subplot is a bit more pedestrian but, on the whole, the story is both joyous and satisfying.<br/><br/>Whatever the material, the cast certainly left little room for improvement. You couldn't ask for a better leading man than Gene Kelly for what is arguably the definitive MGM musical. He's well suited to the role of movie star Don Lockwood and his singing & dancing are as good as ever. Nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds was as cute as a button while holding her own with both Kelly and Donald O'Connor, who was no slouch himself. Meanwhile, Jean Hagen snagged an Oscar nomination for what is easily the film's best comedic performance. Also notable were Millard Mitchell as the studio head and Cyd Charisse as a featured dancer.<br/><br/>Another of the film's high points is the technical aspect. The co-direction by Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen is top notch and provides us with several memorable moments. The ""Broadway Melody Ballet"" portion of the film is particularly ambitious and breath-taking, while Gene Kelly's rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain"" is legendary. And let's not forget the sumptuous Technicolor photography.<br/><br/>All things considered, ""Singin' in the Rain"" has to be regarded as one of the best movies in the musical genre. While there are a few Hollywood musicals that I would rank above it, there's no denying that the movie is a joy to behold and that it still holds up surprisingly well today."

","""Doot Doot Do Doot Do Doot Doot[¬Ö]"" this joyful hum sung and danced its way into America's hearts in the 1950s, and even though the 21st century is well under way, this glorious film continues to put smiles on people's faces. <br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 musical comedy which starred Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Conner. The film was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and produced by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer or MGM. The movie premiered in Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 27, 1952, and was released in theatres on April 11, 1952. It made over 7 million dollars in the box office and was one of the highest grossing movies that year. <br/><br/>Just to summarize the film a little bit without giving away too much of the plot, the films opens on a movies premiere at the renowned Grauman's Chinese Theatre in California. The crowds have gathered to see the star studded cast including Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont arrive for the premiere of their new movie. When the premiere had finished, Lockwood finds himself in a situation where he is running away from female fans that are chasing him. Lockwood hops into a car where he meets Kathy Seldon. Not realizing who he is at first she screams and tries to get him out of her car. Finally a police officer sees them and instantly recognizes Lockwood from his movies. Seldon feels a bit embarrassed, but continues on the conversation. They get into a disagreement over whether what Don does in his movies is really acting or not. Kathy believes that just looking at the screen and miming the words is not really acting. There needs to be spoken word. Later after having run into Kathy again, he becomes infatuated with her and tries to track her down but is unsuccessful.<br/><br/>A few weeks later Don walks onto set for his new movie and the producer of the company approaches Don with a crisis. The talkie The Jazz Singer had become a huge success and the public no longer want to see silent films but wanted to see talking films. The rest of the film deals with the struggle of transforming a silent film into a talking motion picture as well as inner character conflicts resulting in the iconic film that we all love today. <br/><br/>Being slightly on the biased side because I am a geek for musicals whether it be on the stage or on the screen, I think that this film deserves all of the recognition that history gives it. While I can understand that it was seen as just another movie when it was released, Gene Kelly made his roll iconic and his scene Singin' in the Rain is one of the most recognized movie scenes in history with his swinging around the lamp post holding his umbrella. This film does a great job portraying the transition that production studios and companies had to go through when the element of a sound system was introduced to the film industry. When the films were silent, they did not have to worry about what the actors' voices sounded like because no one could hear what they sounded like. <br/><br/>This film has the perfect balance of humor woven in with desired romance while portraying an important period in history for the United States. While this film may not have been revered during the time of its release, it certainly has made its mark in film history, and if you are in for a good laugh and love musicals, or if you just want to watch a great film, Singin' in the Rain is definitely a film to pick up and watch. It's going to make you want to get up, walk outside and skip around in the summer pouring rain, because we need to ""let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place"" and ""come on with the rain[¬Ö]"""

The title song is popularized in a more recent film a Clock Work Orange(1971), and having seen that film first i think gave me the wrong preconceived feeling about the song maybe causing me to enjoy it less in this film.

This film successfully managed to tell two stories parallel to each other: the romance between Kathy and Don and the way that the industry dealt with the turning point of cinema (sound). The dancing was flawless and the costumes were vibrant and beautiful. Some of the humor was enjoyable. ""Make 'Em Laugh"" was a funny song and the physical comedy was entertaining.

","This musical was built around the title song. It was calculated to please the masses, and it does. The three leads all turn in fabulous performances, with some of the best dance moves by O'Connor, and some of the finest singing by Reynolds. Of course the best all around singing and dancing is by Gene Kelley, especially performing the title song. You would probably have to have been living under a rock to have been born in the 20th Century and not seen that scene at some point. Noteworthy in that and many other scenes are the long, continuous takes of song- and-dance numbers. They are beautifully shot with no cuts to interrupt the flow. Ultimately, the film is little more than a bunch of dance numbers with a corny plot to string them together. If that's good enough for you - you'll love it. If you want more substance be it romance, drama or what have you, chances are you'll find 'Singin' in the Rain' little more than a pleasant time-waster."

","I had put off seeing this movie because of the tremendous amount of build-up it has associated with it.  ""The Best Movie Musical of All Time"" is a large title to uphold and...well...it just couldn't do it.  Now, before I get pummelled with rotten tomatoes, I'd like to point out the things I really liked about the film.<br/><br/>First, and foremost, watching Gene Kelly dance was very entertaining.  He really made it look effortless, and it was so delightful to see a man of his build and facial expressions doing the kind of dancing he was doing.  One just doesn't get the opportunity to see that in film anymore, and I think it would still be received appreciatively today.<br/><br/>Jean Hagen's performance was hilarious.  She was very believable and no ""dumb blonde"" either (well, of course she was!).  To me she was the true scene stealer who gave a timeless comedic performance that will continue to be revered.<br/><br/>I think one of the reasons this movie will not be timeless as a whole, however, is because of the Donald O'Connor character.  There is no doubt this man was a product of a time when Hollywood actors had to work extremely hard to earn their money (I'm thinking of his dancing solo where he defies gravity) but there is an element to his performance that screams ""I'M TRYING TOO HARD TO ENTERTAIN YOU"" and it is hard to ignore.    I found it to be really annoying, particularly in the ""Good Morning"" segment, which in and of itself, was a terribly silly concept and situation.  Not a funny silly either--more of a preposterous silly.<br/><br/>I don't think a film like this could be redone, and I don't think it is supposed to be.  It is just one of those films you are supposed to see because it represents a certain time in American film history, and it can be appreciated for some of the things it is missing.  Hard work was definitely not one of them."

","This movie was too silly for me. Especially how they were dancing in the beginning with the rain coats. But I should expect stuff like that for watching a musical. But it was still a silly musical. Some parts were funny and the story was good and different from what I expected; I had no idea what the movie was actually about besides having a scene where some guy sings in the rain. I like how they referenced the Jazz Singer. I didn't like the main guy's singing and how he was super tan. I didn't realize so many songs I had heard had came from this movie so that was a surprise. Maybe this movie deserves more credit than I'm giving it. The choreography for all the dances was good though."

","I love the title song to Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain. The whole scene, with Gene Kelly joyfully relishing in his love for Debbie Reynolds is a pure and simple delight. Yet, strangely enough, it's Malcolm MacDowell and his Droogs' home invasion, assault, and gang-rape in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange that gives me a pause when I think of SITR.<br/><br/>That and the fact that, after it gets off to a rousing, funny, and witty start, Donen and Gene Kelly's musical comes apart at the seams, with one over-long and self-indulgent song-and-dance number after another, eventually causing the movie to become a tedious mess instead of the tender love story it should have been.<br/><br/>With all-due attention given to my musical apostasy, I got half way through Singin' in the Rain and started to squirm and harumph, wondering when this damn thing would be over. I started longing for an episode of Don't Forget the Lyrics--at least that's only an hour! SITR just seems to go on and on, heaping on noisy songs, and it's not until the end that Donen and Kelly bring the original story back to its logical start, that of a talented heel who finds character and fulfillment in a nice girl's arms.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is a big, bloviating pain in the butt, with one or two great--really great--bits, and a sore butt for sitting through the rest."

","Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are silent movie stars in Hollywood in 1927 when all of a sudden the talkies come in, and unfortunately Lina can't sing or dance and sounds like a balloon exploding. Don, with the help of his friends Cosmo and Kathy, hatches a crazy plan to turn their new picture into a musical success despite Lina's shortcomings ...<br/><br/>There are certain untouchable movies the Establishment informs us we must like. I agree with some of these choices (Citizen Kane, The French Connection) and disagree violently with others (Gigi, Kramer vs. Kramer). Singin' In The Rain falls somewhere in the middle; I like and admire it, but I don't quite see what all the fuss is about. It has great dancing, some good songs (the majority of which were not written for the film), is very well made and keeps you chuckling. But for me it's not the greatest musical of all time and it's not Kelly's best movie, or even his best musical (that's An American In Paris). It's real strength I think is in the variety of dancing. Rather than either the big glamorous ballroom numbers or good-natured hot-cha-cha hoofing, it has almost every conceivable type of number; a romantic waltz, a crazy tune, a tap duet, a vaudeville stroll, a three-way jitterbug around the house, a big Broadway folie, even a ballet sequence. All of these are terrifically staged and expertly performed - the title song (originally from The Hollywood Revue Of 1929) is of course one of the most famous moments in cinema, but I prefer the zesty Moses Supposes shenanigans and the showstopping Good Morning number with all three leads in top-notch form. The film also has great art direction by MGM's design genius Cedric Gibbons, and the gentle satire of Hollywood's transition from silents to sound is nicely done, particularly by co-star Hagen (who actually dubbed herself in the scene where Reynolds is dubbing her). However, something just doesn't tickle me the way it should about this movie (and many other fifties musicals) - I dig the dancing but the romantic and melancholic aspects always seem phoney to me and pad it out. It keeps coming up with interesting moments though, like the vampy dance Charisse does or just about all of O'Connor's slapstick. It's good entertainment, but I can't help wondering if those who rate it so highly really admire it as much as they say they do. Written by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Bizarre trivia - there are fascinatingly weird references to this movie in two science-fiction classics; A Clockwork Orange and Alien."

The performances give a rare sense of energy and charm, particularly Gene Kelly as Donald Lockwood, also co-director. His rendition of the title is possibly the most famous scene in the movie, and is pretty extraordinary. Donald O'Connor is hilarious as Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds, with her lovely appearance and fabulous voice is perfectly appealing. Jean Hagen is quite hysterical as Lina, the source of the film's ongoing joke, that her character can't act, dance or sing, and her acting in the talkie was intentionally laughable. Also nice to see the beautiful long-legged Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno. (best known for Anita in West Side Story)The plot mayn't be the best merit of the film, but with everything else so good, it is such a minor criticism. All in all, a wonderful film, that is well worth watching for the song and dance numbers alone. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is a musical that explores the transition from silent to sound films. It also features the story of actor Don Lockwood, who is famous for his on-screen romantic pairing with Lina Lamont. Lina expects Don to marry her, but Don is more interested in Kathy Selden.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Debbie Reynolds are all excellent in the lead roles. Hagen is especially amusing and her screechy voice functions perfectly as an impediment in the transition to sound films.<br/><br/>There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended ""Broadway Melody"" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story.<br/><br/>The storyline exploring the tumultuous transition from silent to sound films and the relationships between characters were clever and amusing. It helped that I watched ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927) shortly before watching this one, as the film makes reference to its role as the film that ushered in the sound era. It is not essential to view it before seeing this, but it may help to learn of the song ""Mammy"" from that film since some of the jokes in this film make reference to it. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is not my favorite musical, but it is certainly one of the better ones I have seen."
"SHAWFAN","10","2","5","22 November 2007"," Great in all respects
","Everyone seems to agree that not only is Singin' in the Rain the greatest of Hollywood musicals but one of the best of any kind of movie ever made. That's what I think too. Its plot line of the arrival of movie sound points one inevitably toward one of the greatest comic plays ever written, Kaufmann and Hart's Once in a Lifetime, (1931) written equally hilariously about the same topic. And its reminding us of all the vocal pronunciation coaching that went on in those panic stricken days irresistibly summons up analogies to Eliza Dolittle's language lessons in Shaw's Pygmalion and My Fair Lady.<br/><br/>The musical goings on are very hard to focus on in the crediting department. Usually one name in the credits will suffice for a movie composer. But between orchestrators and music directors there are about 15 musicians in the crew list, most of them uncredited, including Johnny Green as music director and Alexander Courage, later of Starwars fame. The lush adaptations, orchestrations, and ballet numbers, all especially written for this movie make it a festival of musical riches, never mind the great songs themselves. I found it strange that Donald O'Conor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" song never broke into the more familiar words ""Be a Clown"" featured in ""That's Entertainment."" Anyone wanting to read an excellent background book on the whole silent-to-sound transition should read ""The Shattered Silents,"" by Alexander Walker (1978)."

Glorious musical-comedy is savvy (if a little soft-hearted) about show business, and truly first-rate as a visual feast (with colors that saturate the screen like a painter's dream palette). Though he deserves most of the credit for his co-direction, singing, dancing and choreography, I'm not sure how convincing Gene Kelly is as a love-interest for Debbie Reynolds (they seem more along the lines of close pals, or perhaps brother and sister). Kelly, a real showboater who constantly plays to the camera, knows his strengths like no other musical star, yet his penchant for playing to the audience can either be deemed cute or simply unctuous. Still, the man is a human dynamo, and he cuts quite a presence on the screen; though his elaborate ""Broadway Melody"" number really belongs in a different picture altogether, Kelly is ingratiating calling out ""Gotta Dance!"" to a stage full of arms-flailing teens--he's the bedrock of the movie, as well as its heart and soul. Debbie seems rather young for him, but she's full of joshing good cheer, like a great buddy. Donald O'Connor has energy to spare as a pianist, and his exhausting showpiece ""Make 'em Laugh"" (though prolonged) is one of the few times when Kelly doesn't steal the spotlight. ***1/2 from ****"

In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared.<br/><br/>Following the great success of 'An American in Paris' a year earlier, 'Singin' in the Rain' was co-directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, and is set in 1927 ¬ñ appropriately, the year of cinema's transition from silent films to ""talkies."" Don Lockwood (Kelly) is silent cinemas biggest star, featuring in a string of monumental financial successes for Monumental Pictures, usually opposite the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who can't comprehend that Lockwood only acts affectionate towards her for his films' publicity.

Don's energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and pretty, young Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, just 20 years of age when the film was released) suggest turning the disaster of a movie into a musical ¬ñ ""The Dancing Cavalier"" ¬ñ with Kathy dubbing all of Lina's dialogue and singing. Of course, not everything goes quite to plan, particularly when the selfish and arrogant Lina finds out about this and tries to have Kathy stripped off all the credit for her excellent work. What sets 'Singin' in the Rain' apart from almost every other musical is the story. Whilst it's obvious that most of the songs were selected well before the plot was formulated ¬ñ sometimes the musical numbers go off on an unnecessary tangent that is irrelevant to the story ¬ñ no true fan of cinema can go past a film about Hollywood itself.<br/><br/>The actual storyline is genuinely engaging, and Lina turns into quite a loathsome villainess by the end of the film, especially when her selfishness threatens to destroy the career of one so innocent and promising as young Kathy. Gene Kelly is great in the main role, his superb confidence and boyish charm, coupled with flawless singing and dancing skills, helping to make him one of Hollywood's most fondly-remembered stars. Debbie Reynolds was also very good, despite reportedly having a difficult time on set, her underdeveloped dancing skills often incurring Gene Kelly's frustration. Donald O'Connor, who I can't believe I've never heard about before, is absolutely phenomenal throughout, his every appearance funny, energetic and memorable. Likewise, Jean Hagen savours every moment as the dim but influential Lina Lamont, earning an Oscar nominations for her troubles.<br/><br/>Of course, the true highlights of ""Singin' in the Rain' are the musical numbers. Whilst very few of the songs are original to the film (for example, the title song was taken from 'Hollywood Revue of 1929'), the use of each is so inspired that they now forever associated with it. I'm not particularly a fan of the slow, romantic love songs, but some of the more lively tunes appealed to me greatly. ""Singin' in the Rain,"" performed by Gene Kelly on a rainswept nighttime street, has now becoming legendary, superbly demonstrating how Don's love for Kathy has eradicated all of his troubles and left him blissfully happy. O'Connor's energetic rendition of ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" in which he somersaults off the walls of a movie set, left him in a state of extreme exhaustion. ""Good Morning,"" a catchy little tune performed by Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds was also nice to watch. Perhaps the film's centrepiece, Kelly's ""Broadway Melody Ballet"" has little to do with the plot of the film, but it is such an astounding flurry of colour and excitement that I am willing to forgive its running a bit overlong. For fans of musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Indeed, even for people who have little interest in watching musicals, you shouldn't give up on the genre until you have at least seen this one."

","What a great musical absolutely brilliant and i can easily say to someone who has not seen this that this is a movie you much watch before you die. This is Gene Kelly at his very best and was his best by far but his other films are still good to watch. But let's not forget Donald O'Connor's performance he was just as good but like many others will never be as good as the great Gene Kelly. The songs were catchy and is something that would suck in the audience and make them sing along. Gene Kelly's dance when he sings singin in the rain is just fantastic and leaving me wondering how on earth he can dance like that. Even though Goodfellas is my most favourite movie of all time, i would still have to put singin in the rain up there on my list, but would definitely be my favourite musical as nothing compares to this. It is authentic and has some funny moments in it too but anyone who has not seen this PRETTY PLEASE i beg you to watch this movie."
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","2","5","10 February 2005"," near perfect musical brilliance
","SPOILERS It was once said that ""Everyone loves a musical"". Whilst not completely accurate (there are those who just can't get their heads around the genre), there's no denying that the majority of people across the globe love the beauty of a true musical. Often brightly coloured, sometimes with spectacular dancing numbers, and always with a soundtrack to die for, these films have made generations smile for a long time now. The most famous, and perhaps the finest musical ever made, was ""Singin' in the Rain"". Starring Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, the film made a dancing heroine out of newcomer Debbie Reynolds, and aside from one irrelevant period where Kelly dances through a 1920s setting, it is the most well constructed and well known musical of it's (and any other) generation.<br/><br/>Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen) are the favourite silent movie couple of Hollywood. Unfortunately though, with the rise of the talking picture, with Lamont's squeaky voice, their days look numbered. That is until Lockwood accidentally meets Kathy Selden (Reynolds), an unknown with a beautiful voice. Now, putting the screen presence of Lamont and the voice of Selden together, Lockwood might just have a way of saving their careers.<br/><br/>Everyone able to watch television will have seen or heard about Gene Kelly's scene in the rain. It's a scene of legendary status, and worthy so. The film itself though is so much more. With songs like ""Make 'em Laugh"" and ""Good Morning"", there are more musical gems in this film than you could ever want. All sang by either Kelly, Reynolds or O'Connor, you hear these songs and you find yourself singing them back weeks afterwards. There's just no way to criticise them.<br/><br/>On acting and dancing fronts as well, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is as good as it should be. Kelly and O'Connor were already dancing geniuses when they agreed to star in this film, but Reynolds was a complete newcomer to the art. This obviously didn't stop her as she not only manages to perform brilliantly, but she more than equals the abilities of the two male leads.<br/><br/>Aside from the three main actors, Jean Hagen is more than worthy of her Oscar performance as the infuriating Lamont. She screeches and grates throughout the entire film, despite the fact that the actress herself actually has an amazing voice (and even ironically provides the voice in the musical that Reynolds is meant to be providing for her). Hagen is the ridicule humour in a film of good intentions. She's the bad guy who everyone likes to see suffer, and she does it exquisitely.<br/><br/>In fact, despite it's slow start, ""Singin' in the Rain"" would be the finest film of all time, if not for one key flaw.<br/><br/>About two thirds of the way through the film, we are whisked away to a musical number where Gene Kelly is a young talent in New York. Trying to make it big, he dances his way along singing ""gotta dance"". Eventually, a woman becomes involved, and he makes it big, and all manner of events happen, but we just don't care. The scene is completely irrelevant to the film and does nothing but ruin it's flow. The scenery is too bright, the clothes are ridiculously colourful, and basically the scene feels like it goes on for hours at an end. If they wanted to feature the scene, it might have been tolerable for a tiny period, but by putting the whole piece in, it destabilises the structure of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ruins what could well have been the perfect film.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is without a doubt the finest musical ever made. It's songs, it's dancing, it's acting, it's cinematography, everything is perfect. That is, except for one woefully inappropriate scene. The film is more than worthy of any praise it might get, but until we witness a version without that scene, it won't quite make it as the greatest film of all time."

","What a wonderful feelin'! There is no other movie that will brighten up a cloudy day more than 'Singin' In the Rain'. A classic movie musical, complete with comedy, romance, and a full-length Broadway Ballet, 'Singin' In the Rain' is an enjoyable watch. The story features Don Lockwood, (Gene Kelly) a young, romantic, 'swashbuckling star of the silver screen' who rose to fame via a lucky break, after living the trials and tribulations of a vaudeville hoofer/musician, accompanied by his lifelong best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor). After a flashy world premier, Don is nearly suffocated by adoring fans, and narrowly escapes by jumping from a tour bus into the car of the unsuspecting Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), a cute, talented dancer/actress, and not only finds himself falling into the passenger seat, but falling for her as well. Throughout the film, he and his leading lady, the very stunning, not so cunning, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are presented with the challenge of switching from the over-dramatic silent films to the new, hip talkies. The production studio then attempts to transform their current film, 'The Dueling Cavalier' staring Don and Lina, into a vocalized picture. Donald, who has had vocal training, can easily surpass this new feat, but the lovely Lina has a voice that would rival a banshee's. After the humiliating sneak preview airs for theaters, and only a few months until the world premier, our three heroes undergo converting the 'Cavalier' into a musical, and superimposing Kathy's exquisite pipes over Lina's screechy squeals in an attempt to save their careers. From here on out the story roller coasters through romance, comedy, betrayal, and fabulous, incredible, world class DANCING."

"maitreyee_mishra","Null","2","5","21 April 2004"," GREAT MUSICAL!!!
","Singing in the Rain is another brilliant musical based on the 'Talkie madness' of the late 1920's. Two famous celebrities, Don Lockwood and Lena Lamont are a famous on- screen couple. However, their 'getting along together' is pathetic. Don meets Cathy Selden accidentally and is amazed that she is the first girl not to have fallen for him. She says 'You're nothing but a shadow on film, a shadow'...and these words haunt him. Another accidental meeting- and this time Cathy is being considered for a role in a movie. Don falls in love with her and vice- versa.<br/><br/>When the talkies are in a rage, the audience asks for more and Don and Lena are put to their first big test. One big problem is Lena's unattractive and squeaky voice which Monumental Pictures are a bit frightened to reveal. Other problems do arise and the premiere of their fist talkie becomes the laughing stock of the masses. With six weeks left for release, things look pretty hopeless until a solution comes; they decide to make the film into a musical with Cathy speaking for Lena. However, this is not known to Lena, but when 'The Dancing Cavalier' (the movie) becomes an overnight success, Lena plans to have Cathy speaking for her in every movie without any credit. Things are revealed to the audience in the end and Lena leaves, having made a real fool of herself in front of the world.<br/><br/>The movie is really hilarious and entertaining. You can't really get tired of it. Gene Kelly's dances are brilliant (man! what a dancer) and the others are great too. My favourite song is 'Singin' In the Rain' but all the others are pretty good as well, such as 'Make 'em laugh' and 'Good morning'.<br/><br/>Good direction, very good acting, entertaining and very animated. A must for all to see. Real fun to watch! A GREAT MOVIE!"

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Classic musical making its way through art houses with a remastered format that causes the colors to jump off the screen.  Never a much of a Gene Kelly fan, however, his pompous persona lends itself very well to screen star Don Lockwood.  Tremendous performances by Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, Hagen and Charisse drive this spectacle to heights no other song & dance film has ever reached.  I do not rate it as the best musical of all-time, because I think ""Sound of Music"" and ""Music Man"" are both slightly better, but only ""West Side Story"" even comes close on the dancing.  O'Connor is nothing short of physically amazing on his ""Make 'em laugh"" and the trio's performance during ""Good Mornin'"" will leave you wanting more.  Jean Hagen is perfectly excrusciating as the screech-voiced Lina.  Truly, I think Reynolds and O'Connor should receive more credit for the success of the film.  Both are in supporting roles that nearly steal the film.  If you have never seen this on the big screen, hunt this down in your town - and take your friends and kids and parents!!"

It is probably the greatest feel-good movie of all time.  Kelly and O'Connor have a great musical duo with ""Moses Supposes.""  Add Reynolds and you have the classic ""Good Morning."" O'Connor's ""Make 'em Laugh"" is a scream and hilarious.  Kelly has his unforgettable ""Singin' in the Rain"" number where he literally tap-dances with an umbrella under pouring rain.  Jean Hagen, as Lina Lamont, was the only actor to be nominated for an Oscar and is truly the standout in the film providing most of the laughs as a brainless and obnoxious blonde with an annoying high-pitched voice.  The film is a perfect showcase for showing the transition from silent films to talkies and all the mishaps that came along with the period of the late 20s and early 30s.

","I think the dance numbers, and even some of the songs, are less amazing than those of its immediate predecessor, An American in Paris, made by gene Kelly a year beforehand. I know that the An American in Paris songs were just adaptations of Gershwin songs, but they're great, and they work. That rendition of ""I Got Music"" is wonderful, and the 20 minute ballet at the end is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in a film. There are several songs from Singing in the Rain which were a little weak, and the ""New York Ballet"" doesn't feel right at all in this film. It's obviously a grab for the success of An American in Paris and its amazing finale. That one made a lot of sense in that film (and was itself inspired by the even more amazing ballet sequence from The Red Shoes). That ballet sequence had much more substance, and didn't seem excessive. The New York Ballet did seem a bit excessive, although nice to watch.<br/><br/>What puts Singing in the Rain above An American in Paris is its plot. An American in Paris' plot was almost completely filler material between the songs and dance. The ending to that film (after the ballet sequence, that is) was very abrupt and didn't even make much sense. Singing in the Rain is extremely interesting in its setting. It's very interesting from a historical perspective, and that's what pushes it to a 10/10 for me, 1 above An American in Paris."

It it is university policy that each students undertakes 3 units totally irrelevant to their degree with the intention of broadening ones greater knowledge of the world.  I am delighted by this films story line, it offers the viewers so much and given the period in which it was filmed, it would have to be up there with the best produced movies for that era.  The dancing is fantastic, the synchrinisation is perfect, each song neatly entailing a story, a theme. As a movie to study, Singin' in the Rain has provided me with many issues and topics that I have been able to recognise and follow throughout the movie, noting the significance of each song and dance to the story line.  I have since watched the film a few more times, each time appreciating it more!  I am surprised at the level of interest that I generated personally to towards this film, very out of character for me given my usual broad narrowed high action movie preference."
"Southpaw-9","Null","2","5","23 August 1999"," A film musical of the highest caliber
","In the Golden Era of Hollywood (1930s-1950s), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer set the standards for high-quality in musical films.  Well, with ""Singin' in the Rain"" MGM managed to outdo itself!  This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  Packed with timeless songs, exuberant dancing, and fantastic performances all around (especially by Jean Hagen, who shines as Lina Lamont), ""Singin' in the Rain"" shows the movie musical at it's best.  Run out and watch it now, if you haven't already!  It's definitely worth it!"
"minerva-11","10","2","5","3 August 1999"," One of the greatest films of all time
","This is a sparkling film and the best musical of all time. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen are masters of musical movies and this is the best of the bunch. The dance numbers are technically perfect and, more importantly, beautiful to watch. Of course it is easy to mention the title routine but no one should forget Donald O'Connor's spectacular ""Make 'em Laugh"" or the lead trio's ""Good Mornin'"". The star of the film has to be Jean Hagen, as the high pitched, untalented actress Lina Lamont- but everyone is a stand-out in this gem. The only quibble would be the obligatory Gene Kelly modern ballet number, but over look that, sit back and enjoy the magic."
"Chaff","10","2","5","10 July 1999"," ""Uv cawss we tawk, doan ivverybuddy?""
","The songs: Beautifully simple and almost artless. You can't make this stuff up! And they didn't, cleverly going back to ""Broadway Melody of 1929"" and other MGM tuners of that era. I can't think of anything that would work better.<br/><br/>The dances: Big, bold and brash. There's a reason Hollywood made seemingly a thousand backstagers: I can't imagine a natural story being served well by the numbers for ""Fit as a Fiddle"", ""Singin in the Rain"", and the Broadway number.<br/><br/>The comedy: What confidence and self-assuredness to bait us through the first ~20 minutes until Lina Lamont squawks ""Uv cawss we tawk, doan ivverybuddy?"" Sometimes the more sumptuous and MGM-ized a musical, the weaker the comedy content. Not here."

","This is easily the finest musical Hollywood has ever made.  I don't understand all this about Kiss Me Kate. Singin' in the Rain is not dated at all.  It is an amazing mixture of dance, SOng, and story.  Donald O'Connor's 'Make em' Laugh' along with Kelly's title number rank as among the best songs ever caught on film.<br/><br/>Deserving of the #10 spot on the AFI list."
"DaleT","10","2","5","17 May 1999"," ""Enchanting. What?""
","This movie is simply fantastic and certainly has a cushy spot in my top five. Singin' in the Rain was a high-water mark for musicals, and after 1952 there would be few true classics of the genre (just The Band Wagon, Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story and a couple of others). What a pity, especially since Kelly had only been in Hollywood ten years when this was released.<br/><br/>But regardless, Singin' in the Rain is a real treat, from the first time to the fiftieth, because this one just keeps getting better every time.<br/><br/>Yet I can see how it might seem overrated to some. When I first saw it I had never been very interested in classic film, so phrases like ""best musical of all time"" and ""one of the greats"" certainly weren't running around in my mind. I'd heard of it, it was supposed to be good, so I watched it and I was hooked. Only when I started looking around the net and the library for more information on this gem and it's star did those words pop up. I thought about it and, since by then I'd seen more of the genre, I decided it seemed to fit. So I am now one of the many who regards this as one of the greats. But people who go into it thinking this will have high expectations and will possibly be disappointed.<br/><br/>The songs and dances are sheer perfection. I love them all, but my favourite is the Broadway Melody Ballet in which Cyd Charisse slinks around a bewildered Gene Kelly. Incredible. I admit that the rest of the number is a bit lengthy, but it's worth sitting through for Cyd.<br/><br/>If you need encouragement beyond the comments on this page, forget it. It will be lost on you. But if you're willing to give it a try, do so, but don't go expecting entertainment that far surpasses anything you have ever seen, or a plot so complex that you have to take notes, but look for cute numbers, likeable characters, and great use of colour. You will certainly find these things."

"jhclues","10","2","5","3 January 2002"," ""Gotta Dance!""
","This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.<br/><br/>Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.'  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.<br/><br/>When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.<br/><br/>Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.<br/><br/>As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.  I rate this one 10/10."
"hick817","Null","2","5","27 November 2001"," A Delectable Film for all Ages
","Singin' in the Rain is a film that will be enjoyed by all ages.  This musical is the only one which my friends and I have truly enjoyed.  It is a humorous film that has talented actors and actresses such as Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor.  Singin' in the Rain was a great movie in the time which it was produced, even though there were some critics who would disagree.  It is a story based in 1927 about a man named Don Lockwood who has yet another film to star in.  Only this time it is a `talkie' which his partner, Lina Lamont, doesn't have the voice for.  It was great how they showed the use of dubbing in films which is used quite often in many films.  Don later falls for a fan of his named Kathy Seldon. This becomes the romantic part of the movie that mostly appeals to older generations.  The film was pretty cool in the tap dancing and musical parts, but the most amusing was the comedy. You don't really see men dancing and singing all the time, most of us are brought up to be masculine and do masculine things, not sing and dance. This is where the great Gene Kelly came in, he made the singing and dancing seem like it was the thing to do. The comedy mostly played by Donald O'Connor, was hilarious.  It was by far the funniest classic musical I've ever seen, and blew everything else in those genres out of the water.  The more technical fascinations with this movie are just as great.  The illusion shot was definitely one of my favorite parts, when Cosmo, played by Donald O'Connor, runs up a wall.  The synchronous sound worked great for the film, and I'm sure it amused the audiences then as it still does now.  As for the illusion and reality part, in reality not many successful actors go for their fans.  Also Jean Hagen who played Lina Lamont, can actually sing and doesn't sound like she has been sucking helium. One thing I have found, is that, if you are ever feeling down or sick, this is a great movie to see to get you going again."
"coryadam82","Null","2","5","27 November 2001"," Simply Amazing
","Being that the is the first musical I've seen it is hard to say that this is the best, but I must say that it was an incredible movie, and must see for movie lovers. The originality of Gene Kelley and his dance scores is just simply put,  `amazing.' As the director and major character of the movie, Kelley makes this film come alive. The plot line, based around a silent film movie actress forced to begin making talking pictures, is an inviting and amusing one that keeps you coming back for more. With such talented actors as Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds it's hard to find flaws in the casting directors picks. O'Connor's antics and awesome dance routines make him unforgettable. The role that he plays as Cosmo Brown, Don Lockwood's sidekick, is very well acted. The chemistry between O'Connor and Kelley is well rehearsed. The beautiful Debbie Reynolds, who plays the young Kathy Sheldon, is also stunning. In the beginning of the film she picks up Lockwood so he can retreat from the crazy crowd that is chasing after him. She pretends to know little about him and his impressive career, but we later find out she has seen a great deal of his films. Lina Lamont, who is the silent movie actress, is so realistically played by Jean Hagen. She is the gorgeous blond bombshell that is certainly not hard on the eyes but whose tone of voice could just pierce your ears. This movie is just such wonderfully directed and almost effortlessly made movie. I would suggest it to anyone in for classic movie and great time."

","Classic musical that features superb song and dance numbers woven about an uncharacteristically engaging story. Fluffy as you would expect, but downright heartwarming and as entertaining as any film ever made. Shot in that magnificent color typical of the era.<br/><br/>I know there's a Woody Allen movie where his character tells Mia this is the only film he actually owns, and he watches it whenever he gets depressed. Thats a spot on description describing this film's relevance. I personally find Singing in the Rain to be one of a handful of perfect efforts. Set in the 1920s its a loving sendoff of the industry's early years and its transition from silent to talkie. I am by no means an MGM buff, some if not most of them I cant bear to watch, some of Gene Kellys especially since while the acrobatic dancing stuff is always cool, the movies are often just dumb if not annoying. Not so here. Singin in the Rain has a clever innocence which is sadly a memory now in film-making, that evokes laughs and tears and leaves you feeling just a little better about life than before you watched it. Trust me its worth a shot."

","It's the year 1927 and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a silent film couple. Their latest movie is transformed into a musical but for Lina the transition to talkies isn't so easy-she has the most horrible singing voice.But they have a solution to that problem.They dub over her voice using an actress called Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds).There is the plot for this incredible movie called Singin' in the Rain (1952).Gene Kelly (1912-1996) in the lead is just brilliant.The way he sings!The way he dances!The way he acts!He was a star that you can't find too many these days.He wasn't only the star of this movie, he also directed it with Stanley Donen.I have to give credit to other actors too because they really deserve it.Debbie Reynolds (1932-) is wonderful as Kathy.Donald O'Connor, who plays Don's former partner Cosmo Brown is superb.Unfortunately Donald passed away this year to heart failure at the age of 78.We will miss you, Donnie. This movie has the most amazing singing and dancing scenes.Just watch how Gene sings and dances in the rain so cheerfully without a worry on his mind.And O'Connor's performance Make 'Em Laugh is really something. They really don't make movies like this anymore.Some people want to bring the musicals back and that's good.Chicago and Moulin Rouge are two modern musical movies and probably there will be more.But I think the magic's gone.There was magic in the musicals when there were Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.But those days are gone now.Watch Singin' in the Rain and have a piece of the good old times."

","...and I am not merely saying this because I love it..., I am not saying this because AFI says it, but I have watched this film over and over again since I was six, and I have not been able to forget it. It was mentioned at my theater class a few years ago, and it is by far one of the most colorful musical of all time.<br/><br/>Who could incorporate more important songs into one musical like they did here? Unlike many musicals that are coming out not, this was originally a movie. The plot is so beautiful, and the songs just nail it on the head.<br/><br/>While the film is long... possibly too long for a young child, it is certainly a movie that should not be watched in two sittings. The splendor of the color and the dance sequences are killed when the film is stopped. Believe me. I know this from experience. <br/><br/>The plot is relatively simple. Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan) are two legendary silent film stars. A young Debbie Reynolds is a great Kathy Selden, a girl who is trying to break into the film business. Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan), who is Don's stage girlfriend, disproves of Kathy's breaking in, because Kathy is winning Don's affection and love. All at the same time, a movie that Don and Lana have made, `The Dueling Caviler' is not safe. Warner Brothers has come out with their first talkie, `The Jazz Singer' and studios are now converting to sound. Not only that, but they must do so, also, in order for the long-awaited film, `The Dueling Caviler' to be a success. <br/><br/>So Don, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and Kathy decide that the film must be made into a musical, `The Dancing Cavalier'. One problem- Lana's wretched voice. Kathy will have to dub all of Lana's lines and songs without Lana knowing.<br/><br/>The film ends with a great finale and all throughout the film the sons are intertwined with great fun. Not only is this film the best film ever, it is one of the most fun!<br/><br/>MPAA Rating: G<br/><br/>My Rating: 4-up<br/><br/>My * Rating: 9.5<br/><br/>This film contains: Minor Violence."

Kelly oozed confident masculinity from every pore and Charisse was the only woman who could match him with her sexy, sensual femininity.

When you watch the ""Moses Supposes"" number, it looks like he is just as good a dancer as Gene Kelly, who was considered one of the best.  And no one can deny that ""Make Them Laugh"" is hysterically funny and shows great talent.<br/><br/>Nominated for two Oscars, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a wonderful musical comedy with romance and unbeatable performances.  I highly recommend it to anyone, and give it a rating of 10 out of 10!"
"HotToastyRag","6","1","2","16 December 2018"," Overrated but cute
","It's a shame that Gene Kelly's most famous movie is Singin' in the Rain. This is a man who's danced with a cartoon, on roller skates, and with a trash can lid strapped to one foot, but for some reason, he's famous for splashing around in some puddles and posing on a lamppost. The same argument can be said about Donald O'Connor who got his start singing with Bing Crosby, recreated many of Buster Keaton's famous stunts, and did one of the most impressive dances in screen history where he popped balloons while tap dancing-yet he's remembered for making faces and running into a wall during ""Make 'Em Laugh"".<br/><br/>Still, as much as I've just dissed Singin' in the Rain, the movie does have it's good parts. As a kid, I didn't like this movie and actually got rid of my DVD copy, but when I grew up and went to film school, I grew a new appreciation for it. I learned that there was a time when movies were made without sound and that the adding of the element was often difficult for actors and crewmen to adjust to. Kids don't know these things, so when an entire scene is devoted to Jean Hagen's inability to change her lowlife accent into a cultured one, they don't care. When the actors learn they can't move their face away from the microphone, kids don't care or understand. When actors lip-synch and loop their own dialogue, kids are bored and wondering when they can go outside and play. But film students will definitely get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen are silent movie stars in the 1920s, and the tongue-in-cheek salute to the silent era is very amusing. With the advent of sound, they each face challenges to keep their jobs and their adoring public. Also, Gene clashes with a hopeful starlet, Debbie Reynolds, who ends up dubbing Jean's speaking and singing voice. Interestingly enough, Debbie's singing voice was dubbed by Betty Noyes. She also wasn't nearly as marvelous a dancer as her costars, and during rehearsals, she reportedly cowered under the piano crying because it was too difficult to live up to Gene Kelly's standards. One has to wonder why she was kept on in the cast-or why she was cast in the first place-and if she showed such unprofessional behavior on the set, why she continued to have a career. In case you can't tell, I'm not a Debbie Reynolds fan; she's ruined for me almost everything she's been in.<br/><br/>When all's said and done, this movie is a classic and a staple in old musical viewings. You're going to want to see this one. It has cute songs, like ""Moses Supposes"" and ""You Are My Lucky Star"" and classic dance numbers. If you've seen Donald O'Connor running into a wall, Gene Kelly posing next to a lamppost, or the three leads toppling over a couch, those famous clips are from this movie."

As a lover of old movies, it's hard to believe that it took as long as it did to watch ""Singin' in the rain"" not being a great fan of musicals, I was skeptical. Silly me! The absolute talent on display is simply breathtaking. You simply cannot take your eyes off the screen when Gene Kelly, Donald O'connor and Debbie Reynolds are dancing.

","What is about Singin' in the Rain that even the film elite hold it in such high regard and has even appeared on a previous Sight & Sound poll as one of the ten greatest films of all time, ranking among traditional highbrow films? Singin' in the Rain is not just a great musical but also a film with a great story. It is not as harsh a critique on Hollywood as Sunset Boulevard but who would have still believed the content of fan magazines to be genuine after this film. Singin' in the Rain has a cynical side as it pulls apart the Hollywood myth; beginning with Don Lockwood's back-story as to how he rose to fame, which the movie comically shows us is full of crap. ""Dignity, always dignity"" but not if you want to make it to the top but at the end of the day Singin' in the Rain is a movie for movie lovers which celebrates Hollywood as much as it makes fun of it.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1927 albeit a very colourful 1927. In 1952 Technicolor films were in their final years of production and would soon become a thing of the past. The movie is a tribute to MGM producer and songwriter Arthur Freed - head of the MGM Freed unit - the producers of some of the greatest film musicals of all time. Although the days of the studio system where coming to an end in the early 1950's as films from different studios started becoming homogenous and not containing unique aesthetics to each studio, the MGM musical still remained its own unique beast that no other studio could replicate. Likewise, the film studio in Singin' in the Rain is a fictional studio and not MGM itself, I guess that would have been too much of a self-endorsement.<br/><br/>The soundtrack itself has entered the pop culture lexicon for good reason. I've had no shortage of listening to my CD soundtrack; glorious corn and camp topped with beautiful orchestrations, all of which never leaves your head and contributing to making Singin' in the Rain one of the go-to anti-depressant films. Few other songs can lift my mood more than Moses Supposes or the film's title number: could there be a greater expression of joy? After all, it is in the title; he is singing in the rain; turning the dreary rain into carefree joy, finding joy in despair. As for Make 'em Laugh, even though it is a plagiarism of Cole Porter's Be a Clown from The Pirate (1948), I considering Make 'em Laugh is a superior rendition. There is also that disorienting fashion parade sequence which could be removed and have no effect on the plot but I do love me some 50's fluff. But they do save the best for last in the form of the Broadway Melody Ballet. A number of MGM musicals had a lengthy ballet sequence, and to say they outdid themselves here would be an understatement as Gene Kelly dressed as Harold Lloyd with the go-getter attitude of the 1920's celebrates a simple notion, ""gotta dance!"". The visually asserting array of bright colours and impressionistic backgrounds is aided by Cyd Charisse; what a talent, what a figure!<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain presents a light-hearted and comical look at what actors and studios went through during the transition to sound. Few other scenes in cinema are as entertaining as Lina Lomant's failure to understand sound recording technology. This scene not only showcases the problems with the technology in its early days by picking up unwanted sounds (complete also with the classic angry movie director) but it perfectly captures the relatable frustration that comes with filmmaking. I can tell you there is nothing more frustrating than out-of-sync sound. Likewise, the star's difficulty in adapting to talkies and being laughed at by audiences parallel the legend of audiences being in howls of laughter as actor John Gilbert's attempts to deliver dialogue on screen. Jean Hagan playing the dumb broad Lina Loment does a comedy act similar to Judy Holiday but in my view better than Holiday ever did.

","An absolute masterpiece, and easily, easily the highest rating. Gene Kelly's performance of 'Singin' in the Rain' has to be the greatest dance numbers ever performed on film, and I could watch it over and over again. He's a genius throughout this movie as both actor and director. It's just one fantastic number after another, including Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh', the two gentlemen and a 19-year- old Debbie Reynolds performing 'Good Morning' which includes that beautiful sofa sequence at the end, and Kelly dancing with Cyd Charisse in a stunning ""imagined sequence within an imagined sequence"", with beautiful modern art touches ‚Äì and many others. This film works on all levels ‚Äì a musical, of course, but also a romantic-comedy, and an ode to Hollywood's past. It makes you feel good not just because of the story, but because of the irrepressible joy in the performances, and because of you know you're seeing real artistry in the choreography and execution. They make it look smooth and easy, often making the most (so creatively!) out of an economy of space, but if you read the stories of the effort that went in, you'll appreciate it all the more. It's not for nothing that the cast of LaLaLand watched this movie every day on set for inspiration. Pure joy."

","Anybody who hasn't seen this, needs to do so. Part of film history (the story, that is), and not just for the famous scene with Gene Kelly actually singing in the rain. Great performances by Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and especially Jean Hagen (nominated for Best Actress by the Academy) are also included in this classic by director Stanley Donen. Dancers Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno (very briefly!) also appear in the ""Gotta Dance"" film within the film. It also received an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Score.<br/><br/>Kelly and O'Connor play vaudeville performing friends who eventually make it in Hollywood as an actor and a music director, respectively. Through a stroke of luck and his incredibly versatile stunt work in silent pictures, Kelly gets a chance to be an actor and is paired with a beautiful, if dimwitted, actress (Hagan) in several films.<br/><br/>The studio boss (Millard Mitchell, who gives a solid performance as well) has his publicity department print bogus stories about his two stars being romantically involved to sell more tickets. Kelly meets a young wannabe stage actress (Reynolds), who jumps out of cakes (and sings and dances) for a living while she struggles to find more serious acting roles.<br/><br/>Of course, Reynolds and Kelly fall in love. This complicates things with Hagan who, not only believes the papers (that it is she who's practically engaged to Kelly's character) but, has trouble adjusting to the advent of sound pictures, given her squeaky voice. O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" sequence is a classic, not to be missed, which rivals Kelly's titled routine.<br/><br/>Added to the National Film Registry in 1989. #10 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list. #16 on AFI's 100 Funniest Movies list. #16 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list.

","It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favorite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, Donald O'Connor & Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well. Even without the music, a movie about the advent of sound in cinema and the differences in acting and performance that came with it is an interesting an original topic to explore."

","This movie serves as a kind of meta commentary...as it is a musical about the making of a musical.

I can honestly say I've never heard the entire title track ""Singing in the Rain"" until watching the whole film and it was stuck in my head for weeks. All of the musical scenes were well choreographed, looked great in color, and were extremely well voiced by the actors and actresses.

The movie is funny and the singing just flows its not random. it was a good movie the middle/end was slow in my opinion. The scenes confused me and I wasn't sure if it was actually happening or if he was just imagining it. The ending of the movie was perfect though since the evil girl go exactly what she deserved.

","This is a musical, may I say anymore? If you enjoy musicals you will enjoy this film. I particularly do not so I had a rough time with this one. However, there were certain aspects that anyone can enjoy about this film. The grand chorus lines and just sheer size of some of the scenes is quite impressive, as well as the coloring. The plot is quite serious actually but Gene Kelly does a great job of adding comedy and boastfulness to the film. The music, not being my cup of tea, is still very great and if you are into large Broadway productions you will love this film. The mise-en-sense of the film is charming. I thought the choreography stood out a lot as well, it is a fun movie and if you like musicals you will love this film."

","I'm not usually one for musicals, but this film was actually pretty enjoyable. The story was interesting and making it about the change from silent to talking films was a good subject. It not only showed how people felt about it, but what it also meant for the actors/actress' and the movie business at the time. This was the perfect subject for the film as in this film they also show just how far sound and color have come from the age that is portrayed, putting on elaborate and colorful singing and dancing routines. Some of the routines did get a little carried away at times, but overall they weren't too frequent or overbearing and there was a pretty good balance of musical and story."

","I think some of the songs could have been cut. The dream-like sequence at the end didn't really seem to fit in, and also there are parts I think could have been cut out. The Good Morning song I guess makes sense (it was morning), but I think it could have been cut, for example.<br/><br/>Regardless, it is an excellent example of a comedy, and of a musical done well. I just don't like it when they begin dancing spontaneously, as it takes me out of the world within the movie. That's just me though.<br/><br/>The ending was fantastic as well, with the tension building up, and then the grand reveal behind the curtain, and everyone lives happily ever after.

","Singing in the Rain has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm 20 years old, and my mother raised me on the songs, but I had never seen the movie itself until I took a cinema class in college, and boy, was I missing out. The music and sound were incredible, as well as the tracking shots. It all has a kind of staged feel which I felt fit very well with the plot of the movie, since most of it DID take place on the stage. And, we have the introduction of dancing and musical numbers, which are always a great thing to throw in. Keeping in the trend of having the viewer feel like the people they are viewing, everything was lit very well, which is reminiscent of the stage lights that they had to stand under. Furthermore, the viewer is introduced to the type of problems that they might face if they were in show business during the transition from silent to sound: Worrying about one's voice, etc. I really think it's an incredible movie that doesn't get near enough attention."

","Singin' in the Rain is one of those movies I think of when I think ""classic"". I have a question; who can hate this movie? Just like Wizard of Oz, this movie is so full of life, so colorful, so upbeat, so happy, what's not to like? The songs are great, the characters are great, the art direction is great, everything is just great. This movie brings such a big smile to my face that I have to go to a surgeon to fix it. If you're ever feeling down, Singin' in the Rain is the perfect movie to watch. I love the story, and how it tells of the tragic time when movies went to sound and a lot of actors couldn't make the transition. It's like The Artist, but much happier. The acting is typical 1950s musical acting, and there's a lot of corniness to the whole thing, but that's what makes it hold up so well today. Just like Wizard of Oz, this is a movie most people see at a young age, and grow up loving it. It doesn't seem realistic, but this is classic Hollywood. We don't watch movies to see our own lives, we watch movies because they're the opposite of our terrible reality, and they allow us to escape for a short time. It may be a little silly at times, but it just shows how much fun making movies can be. Singin' in the Rain is a classic, and one of the greatest films of all time. It really is one of the most lovable classics in American cinema."

","I thought this movie was pretty good! I thought the different technical things that they used were new and different from some of the other movies, making it separate from other movies more.This movie was full of musical numbers and dancing scenes, they added new angles and interesting perspectives. They shot each individual dancing scene in a unique way, in a one of the scenes that they had a montage of scenes in a quick moment. One particular scene with Kathy and Don dancing on stage, the perspective and angle isn't consistent, it switches up from close up shots to scenes that are farther away. In the Singing in the Rain scene, the do a pan shot of him walking along sidewalk. The use of the Technicolor was very cool, and it worked for the movie and I think if certain scenes were not in color it would not show the same effects."
"hall895","8","1","2","26 November 2012"," A great movie that's great fun
","There are plenty of movies which may be a lot of fun but aren't really great movies. Singin' in the Rain is a great movie. And great fun. It is one of the most iconic movies ever and deservedly so. Even people who have never seen the whole movie know Gene Kelly splashing about in the rain. But this is a movie which is so much more than that one legendary musical number. For starters there are plenty of other musical numbers which are just as good as, or perhaps depending on your tastes, even better than Kelly's famous nighttime twirl through the rainy streets. But what makes the movie truly great is that it does not have to rely solely on the big song-and-dance numbers. This is a movie with a great story. So many musicals are just biding their time between songs. Not this one. There are actually compelling things going on between the songs. And funny things too. Add it all up and this is absolutely fabulous entertainment.<br/><br/>It's Kelly everyone remembers most but great credit must also go to his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. The three of them make such a great team, their Good Morning number is as good as it gets, just as much of a highlight as the title song. We know what a legendary dancer Kelly is but O'Connor and Reynolds more than hold their own. O'Connor even gets a showcase of his own with Make 'Em Laugh, a number which is as much acrobatics as dance. Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds are all terrific in their singing, their dancing and their acting. And yet perhaps the best performance is turned in by Jean Hagen. And Hagen doesn't do any singing or dancing at all. And that's the point. Hagen, a wonderfully talented actress, is playing a completely terrible actress who can't sing, can't dance, can't even talk. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Hagen absolutely nails it.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Hollywood at the dawn of the talking pictures era. Kelly and Hagen play Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, the most famous and popular screen couple of the time. But they are silent film stars, the transition to talkies will be quite painful. The biggest problem is Lina's voice which is indescribably bad, grating to the extreme. The movie has plenty of fun at her expense and milks lots of laughs out of the overall struggle of those working in film at the time to come to grips with this newfangled sound technology. How can Don Lockwood go forward in this new era if he's attached to the talentless dim-bulb Lina? Enter, thanks to a rather ingenious suggestion from Don's friend Cosmo Brown, young Kathy Selden. Kathy's got the talent and the charm Lina lacks and Reynolds plays the part of the wide-eyed girl caught up in the crazy world of Hollywood so beautifully. Don and Kathy could be a great pairing, on and off screen...if only Lina could be nudged out of the way.<br/><br/>There is a story here full of comic possibilities and the movie takes full advantage of it. O'Connor's character of Cosmo has a few clownish moments but nothing too far over-the top. No need for a lot of slapstick silliness. The movie's more subtle than that. Smarter too. And whereas many musicals struggle to weave the songs into the story everything fits together wonderfully here. The only real misstep comes near the end with a huge production number which unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to going on for far too long it is quite disconnected from the plot. It really seems like an indulgence for co-director Kelly. There was nobody who could tell him it didn't belong. It's performed very well, it just is out of place. And it stops the movie's momentum just as it should be building to a big finish. It's one musical number too far. But that should not detract from what is all in all a brilliantly conceived and performed movie. It may have slowed down a touch at the end but it still has its big finish, and a thoroughly satisfying finish at that. Such a fun, enjoyable, charming movie. Great entertainment. What a glorious feeling indeed."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","2","12 July 2012"," Perhaps the Greatest Musican Ever Made
","Singin' in the Rain (1952) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>If this isn't the greatest musical ever made it's certainly near the very top of the list. Set in 1927, a movie studio decides to pull the production on a silent picture and convert it to sound. The lead star (Gene Kelly) is fine with the idea but the only problem is that the leading lady (Jean Hagen) doesn't have a good speaking voice. After a disastrous preview screening, the idea gets launched that they should dub the actresses voice with that of someone who can sing and speak (Debbie Reynolds). SINGIN' IN THE RAIN just had its 60th Anniversary re-release and it was quite something getting to see it on the big screen but what's even more remarkable was the fact that the film made it this long. It's funny to know that the film was only a moderate success when it was first released and I wonder what the Kelly and company would have thought at the time if people would be gathering sixty years later to watch the film, which is certainly one of the most loved of all time. Even though everything in the film is a major success, I think it's fair to say that Kelly deserves most of the credit since he not only played the lead but he also co-directed, came up with the dances and helped with just about every part of the picture. The work Kelly does here is just remarkable and especially considering how many terrific moments there are with just the singing and dancing alone. The title track and dance is one of the most memorable, charming and joyous in film history but we also get classic takes with 'Make Em Laugh,' 'Good Morning' and the closing big number, a take on 'The Broadway Melody.' Not only are these sequences terrific but so is the main story as it works perfectly well as a throwback to the day when musicals really took off. The stuff dealing with Hollywood's transition from silent to sound rings especially true and leads to some terrific jokes and some very funny moments. Of course, it goes without saying but the entire cast is terrific with Kelly leading the way with a very strong performance in the lead. Reynolds is also very good as the virginal new star and Donald O'Connor gets some terrific moments with his laugh out loud funny performance. Hagen deserves a lot of credit for the high-pitched dumb blonde who can't do anything right. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is clearly one masterpiece that really lives up to its high reputation. It really doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, the magic lives on each repeat viewing because the dancing, the singing, the mood and the performances are simply so good that it's impossible not to get drawn into the material."

It was said that Kelly gave her a real hard time because she was not a dancer as he was. She could of fooled me. Both performed many forms of dance and did it well. It isn't easy to be synchronized as they were. They are both a triple threat. Not only were they memorizing lines but hundred of choreographed movements as well. Kelly's performance in the ""singingin the rain"" scene is one that has been talked about for time to come.

The colors were amazing which made this movie very interesting to watch. The love story was complicated but not so much that it didn't make sense. The thing that I most enjoyed were the dance routines. I have never seen dancing like that before. Even the minor characters could dance, like the ""make em laugh"" song.

Gene Kelly amazed me at his dancing abilities, as I had never seen any man dance like that before and Debbie Reynolds, who I learned was not a dancer, but in fact a gymnast and learned all her dancing on the set.

However, with that said, this film is incredible. It manages to pack everything of Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" into the film, great acting, great dialog, beautiful direction and cinematography (the colors, oh the colors) and on top of that it's probably the best musical ever put on film. Now everybody knows the songs aren't original but the dance numbers are great, even the ones that you would think were less prominent (i.e. Make 'em Laugh) are better than most musical's best numbers and Donald O'Connor really steals the show with this one in my opinion. The dance number that immediately comes to mind when you think of this film is Singin' In the Rain and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Gene Kelley is an incredible dancer and he'll have you mesmerized while you watch the scene. I watched this film in my History of American Cinema class and I have a hard time arguing against it being the best of the bunch."

","I enjoyed all the great dancing and acrobatics in Singin' in the Rain (1952). The dancing almost reminded me of an older version of break dancing. Especially in the ""Make 'em Laugh"" song when Cosmo runs up the wall, as well as other crazy stunts. The female dancing resembled that of the flapper styles from a few decades before the movie was made. The film was comedic and clever, with a balanced mix of impressive music and dance. When the song ""Beautiful Girls"" was performed, it reminded me of Buzby Berkely style of filming, with all the colors and patterns of the female background dancers. When Don performs ""Singin' in the Rain"", the camera motion is very fluid, and transitions itself around the dancing actor smoothly and unnoticeable. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but this film is definitely a classic."

","Self-referential art can be tedious. Although there are exceptions, it is generally a safe rule of thumb that any novel whose main character is a novelist should be left on the bookshop or library shelf. About conceptual works of art whose purpose is to make a meaningful statement about the purpose of works of art, the less said the better. And when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood the result is normally either introspective navel-gazing or smug self-congratulation.<br/><br/>There are, however, exceptions. The early fifties saw two great movies about the movie industry, one a tragedy (""Sunset Boulevard"" from 1950) and the other a comedy (""Singin' in the Rain"" from two years later). Remarkably, both films were inspired by the same actress, Norma Talmadge. Talmadge is today a largely forgotten figure; she was a huge star in the silent era of the 1910s and 1920s, but along with John Gilbert became one of the major casualties of the coming of sound in the late twenties. She made two ""talkies"", but neither was a success and her career came to an end in 1930. Part of the problem was her working-class New Jersey accent; American society is not as linguistically classless as some would like to believe. (Talmadge was still alive in 1952, and I often wonder what she made of these two films; in neither case is the character based on her portrayed in a very sympathetic way).<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is set in the Hollywood of 1927. The Talmadge figure is Lina Lamont, a highly popular silent film star working for the fictitious studio Monumental Pictures. Lina has a crush on her handsome co-star Don Lockwood and convinces herself that he is in love with her. In reality Don has little time for Lina who is vain, shallow and stupid. (She is also to prove bitchy and spiteful). When the first talking picture, ""The Jazz Singer"", proves an enormous success, the head of the studio decides that he will convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", into a talkie. (The film is a romance set during the French Revolution; Talmadge's final film, ""Du Barry, Woman of Passion"" was also set in eighteenth-century France). This, however, proves to be a problem, as Lina has a harsh and grating voice, and attempts to give her elocution lessons prove unsuccessful. A young actress, Kathy Selden, is hired to dub Lina's voice. The rest of the film deals with the growing romance between Don and Kathy and with Lina's sexual and professional jealousy of her young rival.<br/><br/>Mention ""Singin' in the Rain"" to anyone today and they will probably think of the sequence in which Gene Kelly performs the title song, a sequence which has become famous, even among those who have not seen the actual film. Even parodies of it, such as the one performed by the British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have become famous in their own right.<br/><br/>There is, however, more to this film than just one single scene. It is often compared with that other fine Gene Kelly musical from a year earlier, ""An American in Paris"". The two films, however, are quite different, and each has its own strengths. ""An American in Paris"" is certainly more visually imaginative, and I would also rank it higher in terms of its music. Although ""Singin' in the Rain"" has some well-known songs, including not only the title song but also the likes of Make 'Em Laugh"" and ""Good Morning"", I would not class these as highly as Gershwin's music used in the earlier film. Both films have a balletic sequence designed to show off Kelly's dance skills. In ""An American in Paris"" he dances with Leslie Caron, who plays his love-interest in that film, but here his partner is not his leading lady Debbie Reynolds but rather Cyd Charisse, who does not actually have an acting role. (At this stage of her career Reynolds was not regarded as a dancer).<br/><br/>In terms of plot and of humour, however, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is the better of the two films; the plot of ""An American in Paris"" consists of little more than a boy, a girl and a happy ending. The phrase ""musical comedy"" (like ""romantic comedy"") does not always imply that a work is particularly humorous; it is often used as a description for any musical play or film except for the minority (like ""Carousel"" or ""West Side Story"") which end tragically. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the few musical comedies which is worthy of the name. It is one of the few Hollywood films which actually dare to make fun of Hollywood itself. A lot of the humour derives from the difficulties the industry encountered during the early days of sound, not only actresses with dodgy voices- Jean Hagen's Lina is a great comic character- but also problems in hiding the ungainly and not very effective microphones and in synchronising the sound with the picture. One of the themes is the antagonism between stage and screen during this period- during the silent era, and even in the early years of the sound era, stage actors, particularly classically trained ones, despised the cinema which they saw as a vulgar pantomime. Here Kathy claims to be a stage actress, although it later turns out her experience has been rather limited. There is also a lot of physical comedy, especially in the scenes featuring Donald O'Connor as Don's friend Cosmo.<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" was a hit at the box office, but it was not a great success with the critics, unlike ""An American in Paris"", which won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1951. Over the years, however, its reputation has grown, and today it has come to be regarded as one of the great musicals, not only of its day but of all time. 9/10"

","Never knew that the movie ""Singin' in the Rain"" was not just any other musical movie, starring a singing and dancing Gene Kelly. The movie is actually being a great parody as well of Hollywood society, how all big Hollywood productions are very much alike, studio's, the actor's big star behavior and everything else surrounding- and involved with the industry.<br/><br/>The movie is set at the end of the silent movie era in 1927 and 1928, when the ""The Jazz Singer"" got released. This meant new opportunities for some studios and some actors but also meant the end of a lot of other actors and movie-makers, who were not suitable enough to work with the new sound medium for movies. This movie shows people from both these groups and also shows how the Hollywood-world works and how careers get made and ended in the blink of an eye. The movie is not too afraid to show this more evil and less glamorous side of the whole industry but of course at all times with a wink and fun and charm added to it.<br/><br/>Fore ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a real colorful and entertaining movie, that of course is still best known for its musical numbers. It has some of the best songs that the genre has to offer in it, including of course the well known title song of the movie, performed by Gene Kelly. It's one of those typical studio shot musical with some grand looking numbers in it, with lots of big sets and dancers involved. It also on the other hand has some smaller and more timid moments and it knows to create a well balance between these two musical styles. Cyd Charisse also makes a grand appearance and does what she did do best; dance, show of her legs and look greatly sensual, in a silent role.<br/><br/>It's a greatly entertaining movie to watch, both through its musical aspects and comedy parody references to the world of Hollywood.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Blueghost","10","1","2","5 October 2009"," Possibly my favorite film
","This may or may not be my final user review. I don't really know as I type this. Every character my fingers hits, every key-stroke, brings to me a new realization of my thoughts' worth on film. In that vein, I hope that what I've written has served those who've read my reviews to better guide them to quality entertainment, and hopefully with new insight.<br/><br/>But, to the film.<br/><br/>""Singing in the Rain"" has a special place in my heart. It's a window on an era of cinema that itself is another window on another era in cinema. We're seeing what the people of the 1950s thought of film some thirty to forty years before during its infancy.<br/><br/>But, the real charm of the film is that we have a dancer who is masculine in his poetry. That, and he carries himself (to borrow from the film) with ""dignity"". This is another icon of male that a lot of men looked up to when the film was first released. Gene Kelley didn't ogle women, nor mistreat them. He showed gentle power through grace and poetry. A thing that today would be considered effete, or perhaps too high brow for the common man.<br/><br/>But, even though we see Kelley giving us his smooth cultured delivery, we're also shown his comic side. He's a clown, but a smooth one. Even the most dignified have their comedic moments. He shows us guys how to court a cute young woman like Debbie Reynolds, and shows us that a woman of quality wants a man of quality. And quality doesn't come in the form of a fat bill fold, but the shedding of baser impulses, and embracing of the heart.<br/><br/>Then we have Cosmo, the a-sexual friend whose relegated to the realm of emasculated dudeness. He's the class clown who never grew up. Does he date? We don't know. But then again, does it matter? He seems happy and content to play second string to Kelley's Lockwood character, but shines himself as he brings us the former Vaudevillian turned Hollywood supporting star.<br/><br/>Then, there's Reynold's Kathy Selden character, who takes pot shots at the big boys from her humble station. She is elevated to professional performer status from her Catskills beginnings as a side show girl. She's beautiful and charming when she isn't being jealous of those who made it into ""the industry"", and is taken under the wing of Kelley's smitten character.<br/><br/>The plot thickens with Jean Haggen's Lina Lamont, the not-so-ditzy blonde with a nose for leverage. She may not know art, but she knows what she likes. And she likes getting the lime light, and it doesn't matter whose talent she has to exploit to get that light shining on her instead of those making her the starlet she's been made into.<br/><br/>There's the head of the studio, the high energy director, various supporting roles, and, of course, the musical numbers. Call me nuts, but I like a good musical. To me there's something reassuring about men and women being able to show their physical prowess to the creative notes conjured by a musical mind. To me that's the peak of expressionism. Why musicals have been unfairly attached to fringe and counter culture is beyond me. Sure, they're old and corny, but why attach a feminist quality to those characteristics?<br/><br/>The great thing about ""Singing in the Rain"" is that it's a musical comedy that formulaic, doesn't take itself very seriously, but is smashingly successful. The guy gets the girl in the end, and isn't that what it's all about?<br/><br/>""Singing in the Rain"" is good old fashioned Hollywood film. It truly is, in every sense of the word. It was done in the days before CGI and green/blue-screen techniques, has its own brand of SFX, has a lot of dazzling production numbers (again, to wow the audience in the days before model spaceships and CGI), and somehow manages to focus all of that on the haphazard and somewhat rocky (yet still sweet) flavored courtship between a man who wants to be a talented star, but isn't, and a woman who should, but is held back. The two eventually meet, and romantic magic is conjured.<br/><br/>And I guess that's why it's my favorite film. It has all the gags and good musical numbers from days of old, but it also tells a tale of the way love ought to turn out. The way it ought to be. And, in spite of all the Hollywood gloss, glitz and glamor, it stays focused on that single message.<br/><br/>There's of course Gene's famous dance number, which, truth be told, should resound with every red blooded male who's ever fallen for that one special lady. It should also give us guys hope that that special lady is out there, just waiting to inspire us so that we too can go splashing, and Singing, in, the Rain.<br/><br/>I loved films from my days as a boy. This film was, and still is, one of my inspirations for life. If I were to go back into the film industry, hopefully, if allowed, I would be able to go back in time and visit the MGM lot during its musical hey-day, and help create magnificent films like the one I just reviewed. Something with a lot of humor, pizazz, little violence, and gentle story about a man and a woman meeting one another. I think I've always felt that... in fact I'm pretty sure I always have.<br/><br/>With that, I'm going to end my series of reviews here for now. Thanks all, but they just don't make 'em like this anymore."

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is like a theatrical necklace, strung together with gems in the form of musical numbers and then crowned with a sparkling diamond in the middle: the unforgettably classic title track. The running thread in between them might be a little weak, but it's the jewels that that win out in the end.<br/><br/>Each musical number carries its own unique magnitude, breathing life, emotion, charm and romance into a lackluster plot. The story is about what happens when the motion picture business in the '20s develops the first talking picture (the appropriately referenced ""The Jazz Singer"" starring Al Jolson) and how it affects two of the business' biggest stars: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen)...and of course their quirky piano player Cosmo (played by physical humor extroadinaire Donald O'Connor). Underlying it all is Lockwood's love for a wannabe actress Kathy Selden played by Debbie Reynolds, a relationship built on one of the more preposterous Hollywood fantasies.<br/><br/>Because of the plot's unoriginality and the sometimes lengthy tangents the songs take you on, ""Singin' in the Rain"" is enjoyed by the scene. As a viewer, you pick your favorites and pay more attention to them, dismissing those that bore. O'Connor's humorous turn in ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is a surefire favorite as is ""Moses (Supposes)"" and of course ""Singin' in the Rain."" The choreography and the non-stop energy in these numbers makes them so fun and easy to watch. Other scenes like ""Broadway Rhythm Ballet"" fit the tastes of the dancing connoisseurs as Cyd Charisse steals you away from the film for a good 15 minutes with her incredible shape and grace. <br/><br/>There's also a good amount of gags and slapstick filler between numbers, but the numbers are what make ""Singin' in the Rain"" stand out. The title number is about the only one that perfectly accompanies the storyline. Don is so head over heels for Kathy that he could sing and dance carelessly out in the pouring rain. That's what makes the scene stick out as classic: most of the other numbers are not extensions of the storyline, they're detours from it, but ""Singin' in the Rain"" endures on this glorious number."

","When asked which musical film I remember best, few if any can compare to this all time memory maker. ""Singing in The Rain"" has it all. A simple but impressive story which winds itself through several decades of various films. Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a city hoofer who enjoys being a popular and noted 'silent' celebrity by everyone except Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who rebuffs him by saying about movies, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' His life long friend Cosmo Brown, played by (Donald O'Connor) is magically talented both singing and dancing which is nearly impossible for the obstacle in the picture, one Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When the studio discovers that silent pictures are obsolete, the director R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) launches a new course for his cast, one which does not include Lamont. The movie is filled with many dance routines, which includes perhaps the most remembered song and dance number in Hollywood. I remember it well. Excellent film for any generation. ****"
"kyle-cruse","10","1","2","28 August 2008"," Possibly the best movie musical of all time
","It's between ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" for the best movie musical, in my opinion. It's difficult to choose, but this might be it. This film proves to be so funny that it could make a great comedy on its own. However, the songs really add something to the story and now I can't imagine the film without them. In an Oscar-nominated performance, it is Jean Hagen that cracks me up the most and really steals the show. She can't sing and act, but she can certainly make an audience laugh. Watching the three main stars (Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds) sing ""Good Morning"" is one of my favorite moments of the film, not to mention Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" scene being one of the most famous moments on film. Donald O'Conner's ""Make 'em Laugh"" is one of the most unforgettable musical numbers anyone will ever see. No other musical in history has a great a combination of comedy and great songs as this one, in my own opinion. Considered one of the top ten films ever made, it's a personal favorite to me as well. Possibly better than ""The Sound of Music,"" but it's hard for me to make that call.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

The ability to incorporate history and romance seamlessly, is what made this movie riveting for me.<br/><br/>The music was tremendous. Kelly and O'connor collaborating on the song ""moses supposes"" was my favorite. Debbie Reynolds exudes charm and vivaciousness, while singing ""good mornin"" with her co-stars.

"snowy_paws","9","1","2","12 October 2006"," A musical about two lovers and their struggle through show business
","Singing in the Rain is an amazing movie that i recommend to everyone! Singing in the rain is about two actors who fall in love with each other. The main character, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), is already a big celebrity and he encounters a lady by landing in her car after an escape from a mob of fans. The lady driving the car is an aspiring actress named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Don falls for her at first sight, but Kathy argues with him and doesn't think he's all that great. She says that he isn't a true actor. She drops him off and he goes to an after party of his latest movie. Kathy ends up being one of the surprise dancers, and he tries to get her again, but it ends up Kathy throwing a cake into Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen)face. Lina Lamont works with Don in all their movies. Lina despises Kathy after that moment. After quite some time, the studio is making another movie for Don and Lina. The movies they've made have all been in the silent era. The studio already starts filming their next movie, until the R.F. Simpson, the studio owner/producer says that they must either change the movie to a sound movie or just shut the whole thing down. The studio decides to jump on the bandwagon and make a sound movie, because of the success of the Jazz Singer, and the demand for more talkies. The studio starts filming the movie into a talkie. The biggest problem with the talkie is that Lina's voice is absolutely terrible for the job, but they still film the movie. When the first screening is showed, everyone thinks the movie is a joke and is terrible. After the screening, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), and Kathy are at Don's house. The two friends are trying to cheer up Don, and then they ponder about ways to fix the movie. Cosmo comes up with a brilliant plan to make the movie into a musical. Don and Kathy thinks it's a brilliant idea, until they remember that Lina can't sing or speak for that matter. After some thought, Cosmo has a revelation and comes up with the idea that Kathy sings for Lina. The studio thinks it's a great idea and keeps it a secret. The plan is going well until Zelda Zanders (Rita Moreno) tattles on the plan, and Lina demands that the credits say it is her voice and give no credit to Kathy. The studio and Kathy agree but to just this film. After the premiere of the movie, (which is a success), Lina shocks everyone by saying that Kathy must dub in for Lina in all her movies. Everyone is furious and tells her it's not going to happen. The audience then asks for a speech and Lina irrationally decides to go out and present a speech. When she starts speaking people realize that it wasn't her voice in the movie and demand her to sing. Lina realizes the mistake she made and runs off stage and Simpson comes up with a plan, whispers it to Don and Cosmo, and tells Kathy to sing behind the second curtain for Lina. Kathy refuses until Don begs her to. Kathy agrees but never wants to see Don again. Lina goes back on stage. The conductor asks her which song to sing and in which key. Kathy whispers to Lina to tell the conductor ""Singing in the Rain"" in A-Flat. Kathy starts singing and Lina starts dubbing. Offstage Don, Cosmo, and Simpson pull the curtain so Kathy is revealed. Lina doesn't know this until Cosmo goes to where Kathy is and starts singing. Lina is humiliated and runs off. Kathy starts running away, but Don tells people to stop her and he sings to her and they live happily ever after."

","I've read the raves, but I don't understand them.  The dancing is rather tepid, the songs are fair, and Donald O'Connor must be an acquired taste. Gene Kelly's dancing with Cyd Charisse is great, but I would rank On the Town, It's Always Fair Weather, An American in Paris, and Brigadoon as far, far superior to this movie.  Check them out - if you loved Singin' in the Rain, these other movies will completely blow you away."
"lee_eisenberg","6","3","15","25 July 2005"," There is actually more to the movie than Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk.
","Obviously, everyone remembers Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) dancing down the street while it's raining. In case anyone's forgotten the plot, it's about the arrival of sound in Hollywood and how it destroyed some people's careers due to their voices. So, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - who has a scratchy voice - has to get dubbed by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) - who has a beautiful voice. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) provides some comic relief.<br/><br/>The idea that this innovation ruined some people's careers...that actually has some relevance to the present. Every time that there's some innovation, it shortens our attention spans. The radio, TV, even the Internet...they have all shortened our attention spans. Whereas once we had to use our imaginations about everything and/or go out and experience life a little more, we can now just do everything from home.<br/><br/>Oh, well. I guess that there's nothing that we can do about that. I guess that all that we can do is watch ""Singin' in the Rain"" and wait for Gene Kelly to explain ""what a glorious feeling"" it is. I wouldn't call it the world's greatest movie, but it is an important part of film history."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","3","29 March 2017"," One of the best musicals ever.
","This film is, for me, the second best musical film of all time, only being surpassed by ""The Sound of Music"". The story is based on a real fact: the rise of sound cinema and the consequences it has brought to an endless number of actors and actresses, whose bad voice or diction wouldn't allow their career to continue. The film stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen, who bring to life a love triangle that supports the entire film. The script is extraordinary and doesn't deserve critical, as well as the cast performance. Kelly and Reynolds solidified their stardom with this film, in all fairness, for they are amazing together and excellent when separated. Jean Hagen gives life to some of the film's most hilarious moments. As far as music and songs are concerned, they are truly beautiful and some of them are in the ear. It is not by chance that most of the songs in this film have gone to the history of cinema and have become as immortal as the movie itself."

","Singin' in the Rain sets the standard for musicals because it really owns what it is. Other musicals take themselves too seriously and make the musical number seem out of place. Others are too nonsensical and lose the audiences attention. Singin' in the Rain is perfectly balanced. The acting performances are great. Characters meant to be loved are lovable and those meant to be hated are despicable. The musical talent these actors possess is impressive as well. The choreography is wonderful and the singing is amazing. However some songs do go on too long and lose some of their splendor. This does not happen often though. There is also too little character development between the lead actor and actress making their romance a bit unbelievable. But that is forgiven because the nature of the film is meant to be jolly. This would be my number one recommendation to anyone who has never seen a musical."

Gene Kelly played his role exceptionally well as well as Debby Reynolds. Many of the songs I have heard before but never knew they were from this movie. Most of the songs are known by many people that have and have not seen the movie. The filming and editing in this movie is very good. Director's, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, used technicolor in the film and it worked. Scenes and settings were extremely colorful. One part that I did not like was the random, uncalled for, and kind of off topic scene that lasted too long toward the end of the movie. Without this scene, I look at this movie as fantastic and I highly recommend it to be watched more than once."

Each one had a certain characteristic to it that fit each scene well. And the colors in this film all look amazing. They're so vivid that your eyes will always be focused on the scene. And I must say the one scene where they are thinking of ideas with the studio president is without a doubt the best part of the movie.

I went into the film not expecting much comedy but came out laughing at certain scenes. Jean Hagen's character is funny the entire length of the movie and is a really underrated piece I believe.

","No wonder it has been universally acclaimed as the apotheosis of Hollywood musical in the golden era, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN conjures up an enticing historical premise of the significant sea change in the film industry, with THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the dawn of talkie which would forever change this scope of the burgeoning media.<br/><br/>Set in 1927, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are Monument Pictures' golden couple on screen in the silent films, yet in private Don despises the ditsy and talentless Lina, whose diva temperament and funny sheep voice is the studio's best kept secret. Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.<br/><br/>However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark. Six weeks before its official release, Don and Cosmo creatively advice to change the picture into a singing-and-dancing musical, renamed THE DANCING CAVALIER and asks Kathy to dub Lina, the last-minute plan saves the day, except for Lina's prestigious career as an actress.<br/><br/>Stretching from the titular song, the script cunningly grafts a cheery romance upon the nostalgia to a bygone silent era, from the opening flashbacks trace back Don and Cosmo's slapstick entertainment (also brilliantly contrasts Don and Lina's lovey-dovey public images and their personal incompatibility), until the long and elaborate set piece named Broadway MELODY BALLET, freshly revamps several music numbers from THE Broadway MELODY (1929) and Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (1935) as a fetching homage, which is not germane to the main narrative, but introduces dancer-turns-actress Cyd Charisse's vampiric moll to the limelight.<br/><br/>Kelly, the co-director and the leading star of the project, is swooningly deft in the iconic solo titular piece, and admirably, he also magnanimously leaves the stage for his co-stars to shine, O'Connor's MAKE 'EM LAUGH is la cr√®me de la cr√®me, his effortless agility makes the dangerous antics look ever so easy and winsome. Although billed as the female lead, Reynolds is less a spectacle especially lined up with Hagen, who is the only one in the cast nominated for an Oscar (the film's unjust snub by the Academy is another big scandal mars the award's credibility), fakes her comical tone and upstages everyone else with sheer deadpan amusement.<br/><br/>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a tested classic, a first-rate choreographic marvel, a less refined character development nevertheless, one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd- pleasing charm."

","Even though this movie was filmed long before my time, it was and always will be one of my favorite movies. The music and dance scenes are spectacular and done in style.

"robsta23","9","1","3","18 September 2015"," Fantastic Musical, But Not The Greatest
","You wouldn't normally expect greatness from a huge meta-film like this one; a movie about making movies seems self-indulgent. However, this film is not full of itself with the fact that it is about movies - it even addresses problems that sound provided in the early years of sound's use in the motion pictures. It seems that this reflection on cinema's early days of sound may be the reason it is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, though I disagree with this idea. While this is considered the greatest musical film of all time, I'd have to say Yankee Doodle Dandy definitely tops this one.<br/><br/>What is great about the story of this musical is it is easy enough for anybody to follow, which makes me think that this might be one of the first movies I show my children if I ever have any. The antagonist - Lina Lamont - isn't evil enough to crush a child's innocence, but a child would understand to dislike her while laughing at her ridiculous voice, making her not so ruthless of a villain.<br/><br/>This film has an interesting take on many aspects of Hollywood. It doesn't state whether or not we should consider film to be a high art since there is much commentary (especially at the beginning) on theatrical actors giving more input into their performances than silly faces projected on a screen. Also, the various numbers in the film are filmed with long takes, making it seem more like a theatrical musical than a film (with exceptions to the incredibly- filmed sequences ""Beautiful Girls"" and ""Broadway Melody""). Since it is hard to tell where the theater ends and the film begins, the film doesn't give one specific stance of film as an art but rather different points of view on the matter. I suppose this may be why the film is considered to be among the greatest movies ever, but as I have said in past reviews, ambiguity does not necessarily mean greatness. It has to be pulled off right in my opinion. I am not saying the movie is less than good, it is great! But is it really this masterpiece everybody says it is? It is a formulaic musical where the central couple ends up together at the conclusion as expected by the audience. Yes it has entertaining numbers such as ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" but do such numbers make this a masterpiece? This is a great film to watch with highly entertaining moments, but a self-indulgent film shouldn't automatically dictate greatness - stories about more ""everyday"" situations are much more powerful. Not all of us know the Hollywood life.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"

","""What a glorious feeling I'm happy again!"" That's the feeling I got watching this again on DVD-after 30 years of last seeing it. Gene Kelly's title number is sublime and deserves it's iconic status. Donald O'Connor deserves his place in film musical history by his ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number alone. (Never mind that the song is a partial steal from Cole Porter's ""Be a Clown"".) Young Debbie Reynolds does well with such polished hoofers. Jean Hagen is hilarious as the vain and egotistical movie star. The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, who's also the producer, are entertainingly performed. And the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen is just perfect not to mention the original screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green! Nothing more to say except, Singin' in the Rain is indeed perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made! P.S. Great commentary on the track of the DVD in which Ms. Reynolds intros various members of cast and crew and others making their comments. Oh, and it's a shame it was only nominated for two Oscars-none for Best Picture: Ms. Hagen for Best Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton for Scoring of a Musical Picture. At least Donald O'Connor got a Golden Globe (as Best Actor-Musical or Comedy) for it. The eventual winner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards for 1952 was The Greatest Show on Earth which I'm reviewing next..."
"llltdesq","8","1","3","28 July 2015"," Great film, with wonderful performances and a good script
","There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>This film has rightly become a classic, proving that the Academy Awards are quite fallible. A good case can be made that this was more deserving of a nomination for Picture than three of the five films nominated-including the eventual winner, The Greatest Show on Earth. That Jean Hagen lost out to Gloria Grahame can be chalked up to the fact that Grahame had three prominent supporting roles that year and won for the most dramatic of them in The Bad and the Beautiful. Hagen's turn was, in my opinion, the best of the year. Oh well.<br/><br/>This film is so well known that I doubt I need to discuss the plot much, so I'll give a brief outline. A silent film star and his leading lady have their careers jeopardized by the advent of sound and the reality that her voice isn't ready for prime time and would sink them and probably the studio. He cannot stand her, while she's convinced she's God's gift to the world. His love interest dubs her voice for the star's in order to save everyone.<br/><br/>Sounds clich√©d and dull. Without the songs and the performances, it would have been forgettable. But Gene Kelly as the star, Debbie Reynolds as his love, Donald O'Connor as his best friend and collaborator and the incomparable Hagen as Lina Lamont, horrid voice and all, as the iceberg to the studio's Titanic, elevate the story and make the film magnificently fun! Hagen steals every scene she's in. Lina is crass, vulgar, crude, obnoxious, arrogant, vain, self-centered, mean and dumb-and those are her good points. Watch for Rita Moreno in a small role as Zelda, Lina's friend.<br/><br/>Cyd Charisse has a significant dancing role in one of the major musical numbers and O'Connor has the funniest musical number in the film, with ""Make 'Em Laugh"". But the film belongs to Kelly and Reynolds, who shine in their leading roles. There's a chemistry between them which makes the whole movie believable.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD and Blu-Ray and is worth watching. Recommended."

","Singin' in the rain can be considered one of the first musicals released from a major Hollywood production company. Not only does Gene Kelly star in the film, but he also was one of the directors of the film, something that we as Americans see a lot nowadays with films, but was relatively rare back in the 50's. Due to scenes that included rain drops, and the ability for the camera to pick up the raindrops on film, this film is an excellent use of back-light lighting to get the desired effect.Another reason why everyone should at least watch this film, is because it is apart of the Nation Film Registry due to the fact that it is deemed culturally significant."

The passion for movie making and affection for silent film can be seen in the funny film clips within the film. The transition from silent to talking film was tough. It's sad, real, and funny when the director (film within the film) tries to get the performer to talk into the microphone. Best scene was seeing and hearing the film from the director's point of view; he struggled with new technology and we all can relate to that. Perhaps an editing weakness is that some dancing shots are too long and a few too short. Finally, with awe, wow, that's dancing at its very best, and they make it look fun."

Many profound critics, like Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, has declared it as the best Hollywood musical ever made. No wonder.<br/><br/>Great movies have a way of beating time. Their original audience is replaced by a new generation, but the positive reception stays the same. Curiously, ""Singin' in the Rain"" earned more praise as it got older. Though a success at the box office upon its release in 1952, people were late to give the praise it really deserved. It seemed that the increasing admiration continued with the following generations.

It's been a long, long while since Hollywood has made a musical like this one, hasn't it?<br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is a marvelous movie for many reasons, but watching it at this point in time highlights some things about it that has become a rarity in today's movies, making these things all the more treasured. Consider, for instance, its attention to a sense of movement. The sets are simple and the props are few, but one can tell that the makers of ""Singin' in the Rain"" have spent a whole lot of time and training to the people and their performances.

A lot of musicals end up being really corny and in a way this one was corny but in a good way. It was executed extremely well that everything just flowed in a way that pulled the viewer in and made them want to see what happened next. Another thing that really helped make the movie was the chemistry between all of the characters. It was very believable how feelings were betrayed between each of the characters and how it changed through out the movie.

","I'm not in to musicals. Never have been, most likely never will be. The only musical film I semi-enjoyed was Moulin Rouge. As for Singin' in the Rain, It's okay. I expected more from such a highly revered film. It is about 30 minutes of plot (an extremely weak one, at that) stretched out far past it's limits. It seems as though the plot was just a feeble device to string together a bunch of dance sequences - dance sequences that repeat the same moves over and over. Impressive, but repetitive. This movie is all show. I think Hollywood overestimates how interested people are in movies about music, or even movies about Hollywood. Maybe it was wrong for me to hope for anything deeper than surface-level gloss. But I did. And I was pretty disappointed."

","Singin' in the Rain is a comedy musical film starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, with Kelly also providing the choreography. It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to ""talkies.""<br/><br/>Hollywood, 1927: the silent-film romantic team of Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont is the toast of Tinseltown. While Lockwood and Lamont personify smoldering passions on screen, in real life the down-to-earth Lockwood can't stand the egotistical, brainless Lina. He prefers the company of aspiring actress Kathy Selden, whom he met while escaping his screaming fans. Watching these intrigues from the sidelines is Cosmo Brown, Don's best pal and on-set pianist. Cosmo is promoted to musical director of Monumental Pictures by studio head R.F. Simpson when the talking-picture revolution commences. That's all right for Cosmo, but how will talkies affect the upcoming Lockwood-Lamont vehicle ""The Dueling Cavalier""? Don, an accomplished song-and-dance man, should have no trouble adapting to the microphone. Lina, however, is another matter; put as charitably as possible, she has a voice that sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. The disastrous preview of the team's first talkie has the audience howling with derisive laughter. <br/><br/>Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience -- a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory.On the strength of the plot alone, concocted by the matchless writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Singin' in the Rain is a delight. But with the addition of MGM's catalog of Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown songs -- ""You Were Meant for Me,"" ""You Are My Lucky Star,"" ""The Broadway Melody,"" and of course the title song -- the film becomes one of the greatest Hollywood musicals ever made.Clever, incisive, and funny, Singin' in the Rain is a masterpiece of the classical Hollywood musical."

","This is one of the most purely exhilarating films you will see in a lifetime of movies, pure Hollywood royalty. You didn't need me to tell you though, so let's talk about something else.<br/><br/>Visually, the thing is as magnificent and minutely controlled as Kubrick's 2001, as vibrantly colored as The Red Shoes, with a weave of self-reference layered deep enough to make Peter Greenaway sit down and write a list about it. <br/><br/>Of course the whole idea behind the thing is that it is a movie about the makings of a movie, the one we have come to see. Warners pioneered this in the early 30's, and they had Busby Berkeley staging wonders, but this goes beyond.<br/><br/>Why the film amazes to this day, beyond its technical credentials, I think has all to do with the spontaneous engineering of the design. How it has been choreographed to dance around the burdens of a thinking mind and speak directly to the eye, the pull smoothed over so that it appears completely natural. I shudder to think what painstaking effort must have went into choreographing the lights and camera and individual performances, and then timing everything to flow at once.<br/><br/>It is a perfect accomplishment in how we're engaged to dance; first with the fictional space as though it were real, but gradually, getting to know the steps of the spell, coming to understand that we were only using the fictional to hover closer to what is real and matters. Love in our case, the glorious feeling.<br/><br/>Consider for example the scene where Don takes Kate to an empty studio lot and begins to arrange an illusion around her, movie lights, wind machine, painted horizon in the back, but all arranged to allow him to speak about a love that is true. They erupt in spontaneous dance, adding to the illusion arranged for us. It doesn't make a lick of sense why they would suddenly dance, but we absorb naturally because the spark is natural.<br/><br/>Consider how love for this woman transforms the entire film in production. The many times that characters avail themselves truly while framed inside a fiction, before a camera or in front of a screen. How the plot of The Jazz Singer is cleverly mirrored in the plot of a man pursuing his dream about dancing."

","In my own opinion if you want to make a musical about a musical you better be Mel Brooks. ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) is by no means a bad movie and the dancing and comedic feats of Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown are sure to delight anyone, but the this musical movie is about the making of musical movies and at times seems to trade of substance to add an extra dance number. If you love Musicals by all means this is the film for you, but if your like me and your indifferent about them I'd steer clear of this one. To me a good musical will incorporate the song/dance number into the actually plot, ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) often fails to do this. Now the scene where Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden finally meet up again and have a romantic duet in a studio on a Hollywood lot the film does a great job of incorporating the song into the plot. An example of where the movie fails to do this is during the number ""Moses Supposes"" where Don and Cosmo are at a professor of linguistics office and break out into this goofy little number for pure entertainment. Now I don't mind a funny goofy musical scene but at least make it matter!!! If you love musicals and have some time to waste then by all means enjoy the film; if not please look elsewhere because ""Singin' in the Rain"" is not for you."

Enough has been said about all of great scenes and song and dance numbers, but what about the Gene Kelly / Cyd Charisse scene? I never liked the piece and thought it totally stopped the pace of the film. The scene itself seems to have nothing to do with the picture and just drags on and on. I left the movie for many years and in watching it again my opinion of that scene only gets worse. I turned on many people to the film over the years, including my family. The first thing they said when the movie was over was, ""what was with that dream scene? Is just dragged on and on!"" I can only guess the director, Stanley Donnen either thought that somehow presented another view of the toughness of making it in Hollywood, or Gene Kelly used his star power to make sure that number stayed in the film as an ego trip. I would have much rather seen the deleted number with Debbie Reynolds singing to the billboard. Oh well, it's still a great movie. Though it meant something different to audiences who saw this picture only 20-30 years after the advent of talking pictures and who heard these songs in other movies, it still is good family entertainment."

Set in 1927, the year ""The Jazz Singer"" (and the Oscars) changed the movies forever, it is simultaneously an original musical, a period re-creation, and a good-humored satire of everything Early Hollywood-- from the stars' street clothes and PR-driven romances to styles of direction and the alleged differences between the Follies and the burlesque house (both of which supplied Silent-era sets and other rooms besides).<br/><br/>The screenwriters pack the script with references to, and outright impersonations of, period figures: Fairbanks, Gilbert, De Mille, Chaplin and Keaton (O'Connor does them both at once, while wearing a hat that is half of each), Harold Lloyd, Clara Bow, Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, Louise Brooks, Pola Negri, Elinor Glyn, Busby Berkeley, and many more. Kelly and O'Connor are amazingly versatile, but the best performance comes from Jean Hagen as the haughty star from Brooklyn whose career is being ruined by the new gadget, the microphone. And Cyd Charisse does some memorable dancing as a flapper with a Lulu haircut.<br/><br/>As if a quality script, music, dancing, singing, choreography, photography, costumes, sets, design, and period details weren't enough, SITR also manages to squeeze in several original and ingenious movies-within-the-movie (bits of a silent swashbuckler, a transitional clunker, and a hilarious ""demonstration Talkie""), and some Charleston and Black Bottom."
"bobbaxter","10","1","3","21 June 2006"," That's What They Said About the Horseless Carriage!
","""Singin' in the Rain"" is a great movie about change. The change it describes, of course, is Hollywood's shift from silent film to talkies in the late 1920s. Ironically, it was made during another period of change. In 1952, Hollywood was shifting from mostly black and white movies to mostly color and from standard format (1.33:1) to widescreen. ""Singin' in the Rain"" bridges the gap; it's shot in Technicolor in standard format.<br/><br/>A better title might have been ""Dancin' in the Rain"". Almost all of the musical numbers have their dance sequences. From Gene Kelly's tap duets with Donald O'Connor to his fantasy ballet with Cyd Charisse, the film is a study of the human body in motion.<br/><br/>In most musicals, the songs are written to fit the simple plot. In this one, a complex plot was constructed to fit songs that were over 20 years old, and it works. The film doesn't stand still during the musical numbers: the plot drives the songs and the songs drive the plot. The ""Broadway Ballet"" finale and the corny but hilarious ending are epilogue; the film's real climax is the scene where Don Lockwood (Kelly) dances along a rain-washed street. He has fallen in love with the girl of his dreams. The problem of Lina's voice has been solved. Everything that follows is inevitable.<br/><br/>Set in 1927, the plot revolves around silent star Don Lockwood, his on screen romance with Lina LaMont (Jean Hagen) and his off-screen romance with aspiring actress Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Mix the love triangle, the career-wrecking advent of talking pictures and comic relief man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) and stir liberally for a great screwball musical comedy.<br/><br/>The coming of sound destroyed the careers of many silent film stars. It was a form of entertainment-industry Darwinism. Those who didn't have good voices suddenly couldn't get work. Don is a wonderful song & dance man, but Lina's voice is sharp enough to cut steel. Until now, her job has been to look pretty and pantomime on the silent screen. As Cosmo puts it, ""She can't sing, she can't dance and she can't act. A triple threat."" Her well-rounded incompetence and her spoiled-brat attitude make her one of the greatest comedy villains of all time.<br/><br/>Most movies try to hide the tricks of the trade, but ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a movie about film-making. It revels in the secrets of movie-making and the technical foibles of early sound films. In one of its most memorable scenes, Don declares his love for Cathy on a movie set. In the process, he demonstrates some special effects machinery.<br/><br/>For the 50th anniversary edition, Warner Bros. (which now owns the rights to the movie) has put together a handsome 2-DVD package worthy of the film. The documentaries on disc 2 are all interesting. The easter eggs (on both discs) are even better. In fact, the egg on disc 1 is one of my all-time favorites."

","A man and a woman stand at the top of a stoop in the pouring rain. After they kiss and embrace, the man walks down the stairs and waves off his driver. The stage is now set for one of the most legendary sequences in cinema history.<br/><br/>MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952) has dazzled audiences for over 50 years. It's a movie about singing, dancing, and movie making. Gene Kelly (An American in Paris) stars as Don Lockwood, a silent film star who along with everyone else in the movie making industry is trying to make the transition from silent's to talkies in the 1920's. He is part of the duo Lockwood & Lamont, the other half being Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). The unseen member of the threesome is Don's right-hand man and best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor, Francis). <br/><br/>One night after a successful premier of the latest Lockwood & Lamont feature, Don finds himself in trouble with hardcore fans and jumps into a passing car. The driver, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, The Unsinkable Molly Brown), is startled to find out that it is Don Lockwood, and continues to hurl a barrage of insults to his profession, ""If you've seen one, you've seen the all,"". Later that night at the after party, Don finds Kathy is one of the dancers who ends up getting herself into quite a mess with Lina.<br/><br/>When the movie The Jazz Singer, the first full length talkie, debuts it's a smash hit. All the studios must make the change to compete. This brings production to a halt and the need for a new screenplay. Their current work in progress The Dueling Cavalier is a travesty and needs to be revamped. The only problem is Lina can't sing, dance, or act ""the triple threat"". Now they must find a way to make a winning picture.<br/><br/>Directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, Singin' in the Rain only received two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Score. This movie was ranked 10th all time on AFI's 100 Greatest Movie list. How could it only receive two nominations and no wins? Most likely it was due An American in Paris, released one year prior to Singin' in the Rain by MGM, winning a total of six Oscars and eight nominations.<br/><br/>Today's cinema has changed dramatically since Singin' in the Rain. Movies have incredible special effects, the cost has gone up considerably, and the values have changed. Kelly worked like a dog to make this movie all it could be and he did that and more. The movie is filled with color and sound using a well crafted style.<br/><br/>One of the most intense sequences in the film is the ""Make em' Laugh"" number performed by the incomparable O'Connor. He showcases his dancing abilities and acrobatic stunts. The scene involves Cosmo trying to cheer up Don. The only way he knows how is to make him laugh. The scene was so tiring that after filming O'Connor was in bed for three days straight. Reynolds also endured a lot on set trying to keep up with Kelly and O'Connor.<br/><br/>To truly become a masterpiece a film has to have survived through many years and Singin' in the Rain has done just that. It's truly a work of art that will be cherished for years to come."

Debbie Reynolds was only nineteen during the filming of this movie, Gene Kelly was somewhat of a tyrant, and Jean Hagen dubbed herself.

The only thing that keeps the movie from being a ""10"" in my book is the whole ""Broadway Melody.""  While it is very entertaining in itself; nevertheless, it made no sense in the grand scheme of the movie.  In other words, it seemed liked SUPERB filler...yet it is still seemed to be filler material. There is no excuse for any movie, no matter how good it is, to contain stuff with no relevance to the picture as a whole. Not that anybody will read any of this, but I thought Singin In The Rain was great!"

","Probably one of the better musical and dance movies ever.  If only stars like Gene Kelly existed today, with that much talent.  The best dance number of the movie however would have to be Make 'Em Laugh.  It's hilarious and impressive.  This is from a time when physical comedy was an art and this number showed it at its best.  The only part of the movie that I didn't enjoy was the Broadway musical number that was imagined up.

We see the glamorous lives of Hollywood stars, allowing us to feel like we are a part of the life of which so many moviegoers dream of. Gene Kelly, as always, charms the audience with his many talents, which are greatly complemented by Donald O'Connor's comedy stylings and Debbie Reynolds' beautiful voice and acting. For years this film has been treasured by audiences for the style, production value and just the pure enjoyment of the film and it would be a crime to miss such a jewel."

It's not a complete disaster, some lines are still pretty funny, but everything else is na√Øve to say the least - and I think it wasn't so good even in the fifties. <br/><br/>Talking' about the ""musical"" part... two songs are simply beautiful (""Make 'Em Laugh"" and, of course, the immortal ""Singin' in the rain""), the rest is just good, but not memorable; only when it comes to dancin', the movie shines. Still, some dancin' sequences don't fit with the rest of the movie: if you seen Michael Kidd's awesome work for ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (now THAT's a masterpiece that aged well), you can't help but notice it.<br/><br/>If you only watched this one, do yourself a favor and try Little Shop Of Horrors, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, West Side Story.

","Call me confused, but I have a hard time with this film. I appreciate the masterful singing and dancing in the film and can agree the vibrant colors were eye catching, but how is this the Greatest Musical of all time and the #5 movie overall according to AFI? I am truly baffled how this is rated so highly. The plot was tremendously weak, but that makes sense when you learn the songs were written before the movie. I thought the film was fun and well-paced until that Broadway ""Gotta Dance"" number hit. I feel like that sequence is playing on a constant loop in certain inner circles of hell to torture lost souls. It's honestly a violation of the 8th Amendment because watching it was ""cruel and unusual punishment"" for the viewer. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, but the whole film felt like a ego-trip for Gene Kelly. He was simply too much even if the title song was iconic. Count me out as a fan of this film along with many younger viewers. I teach a high school film class where we view 20 of the top films of all time. This film is routinely rated in the lower portion of the list by our class. I wish AFI would update their list so a different film could win the title o the Greatest Musical so I could show something else."

","I can't say this is one of my favorite movies. I'm not a huge fan of musicals so I did not have very high aspirations for this film. I thought that the plot would be a little more exciting so that caused me to loose focus and therefore ultimately not like the film. The only saving grace for this film was that the characters were moderately funny which made it relatively enjoyable and kept my interest until then end. The cinematic elements of this film were very strong but I think the most effective was the light and obviously, since this is a musical, the sound. The light really gave the film that movie studio look that the production staff was looking for. The movie sounded good overall and those who have a greater appreciation for music could certainly find a loathing for the way the sound was implemented in the film."

","Favorite Movie Quote: ""Whadda ya think I am? Dumb? - Or, something!?""<br/><br/>Of course, today, not a lot of people realize just how many Hollywood actors' careers were completely ruined back in 1927 by the coming of sound. Believe me, the number was not small.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, these famous actors of the Silent Era may have projected plenty of that wonderful thing called ""charisma"" onto the silver screen, but when it came to their voices (ugh!), they were atrocious!<br/><br/>Actors such as the super-dashing leading man, John Gilbert, with his laughable, high-pitched lisp, and the ultra-chic beauty, Barbara La Marr, with her horrendous Bronx honk, were literally laughed right off the screen when their voices were finally heard by movie-audiences all across the nation.<br/><br/>In Singin' In The Rain, actress Jean Hagen is absolutely priceless as Lena Lamont, the seductive superstar of silent films. I mean, Lena may have looked like a million bucks, but, whoa, when that babe opened her trap, man, she had a voice that could literally rupture eardrums from 50 paces. No kidding.<br/><br/>Hagen's ""Lena"" was a prime example of an actress whose career was, most surely, destined for the axe once ""Talkies"" took over in 1927.<br/><br/>All-In-All - Singin' In The Rain ranks right up there as one of the greatest and most entertaining Hollywood Musicals of all-time. Even if ""Musicals"" aren't your thing, you'll find it near impossible not to enjoy this high-energy, non-stop spectacle of song, dance, and comedy.<br/><br/>Singin' In The Rain is a fond recreation of that bygone movie-making era when the flourishing Hollywood film industry was making its shaky transition into the greatest sensation of all - Talking pictures.<br/><br/>The entire cast in this film are all absolutely first-rate, with everyone putting in a stellar performance from start to finish.<br/><br/>My favourite musical number was ""Broadway Melody""."

","Imagine you are strapped to a torture chair Mr. A pops up on a television screen and announces nonchalantly: ""Dear XYZ. This may be the last day you get to see your parents. You will have the movie 'Singing in the Rain' playing in front of you. At the end of the film, you choose your favorite number and scribble in down on a piece of paper."" If I were the victim, I would prefer dying. Anyone who has seen SITR will really face this dilemma. We have numbers ranging from the titular 'Gotta Dance' to the benign 'Good Morning', titillating 'Singing in the Rain', dazzling 'Beautiful Girls', hilarious 'Make Em Laugh', foot-thumping and naughty 'Fit as a Fiddle (And Ready for Love)', chirpy 'All I do is dream of you' and the poignant 'You were meant for me'. Selecting one would be to disregard the other numbers in this legendary, avant-garde spectacular, extravagant, joyous, spellbinding and sizzling, magnum opus par excellence! Singin in the Rain is a lustrous effort showcasing the making of a movie in changing times. Lamont (Hagen) and Lockwood (Gene) are silent-film's darling couple, revered and envied by fans and carnal, shameless paparazzi who write 'bananas' about the couple. The cameras flash as celebrities grace the red carpet, the first being a unhappy sexagenarian-or-so with a unusually happy and ditsy girl in her 20's (gold-digger alert), the second an impassive one that is supposedly gleeful and then enter the couple-of-the-moment, with Cosmo being ignored completely, smiling photogenically, slickly pushing away an intruding paparazzi. Lockwood then glibly fabricates a make-believe story, devoid of crushing reality, while contradictory events play on screen. The reality of the couple too is quite different. Lamont is an egocentric, deluded, diva with a screechy voice and uncultured manners, reviled by much of the crew, who now face the brunt when both have to star in a talkie. To Lockwood's side are his comical yet versatile partner Cosmo and his love Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), chirpy, sprightly lass. And the director, producer etc. while Lamont has her by-the-book lawyers. What follows are unforgettable, timeless musical numbers with effervescent colors, embracing both screen and stage.<br/><br/>What makes this movie such a bundle of crackling joy is its interminable will to entertain. It has a buoyant story to be, which is rare for musicals that normally falter in this facet; iconic, veteran performances, delectable dance routines (some are as sizzling as a sizzler heated to perfection), memorable music and taut direction. With every viewing, the viewer not only is enchanted by its timeless persistence but also taken aback by the depth of the film. British countdown voting 'Grease' as the best musical ever is a travesty. Grease was greasy, a movie that has a pungent '70-80s' odor with clumsy, non sequitor storyline. SITR however is a movie that transcends all times, and this is how musicals should be made- without compromises.<br/><br/>The musical aspect itself would've covered a 1000 word if I had the choice. This, clubbed with creamy, cr√®me de la cr√®me dance routines by Kelly, Donald, Debbie and extras transports the audience to a heavenly stadium. And everything is so faultlessly placed, each balancing the other. The first, Fit as a Fiddle, is more for the feet, 'All I do ¬Ö"" too flutters up the atmosphere. 'Make Em Laugh' is a comical treat, and really explores Donald's comical forte (The funny faces he makes are drop-to-the-floor funny!). Then we move on to 'Beautiful Girls"", a classy number, that is preceded by a dazzling montage on the burgeoning of musicals in the 20s; 'You Were¬Ö' is radiant, powerful, slender, 'Moses' again increases the pace (redundant though some may find it, it still seems refreshing, to keep the attention of the fidgety audience intact). 'GM' with its impromptu Hawaii interlude is quite a spectacle, while 'SITR' is legendary. Then, to top it all, we have 'Broadway Melody' a twelve minute clou du spectacle, with an enchanting, ethereal number by Charisse and Kelly. In fact, Kelly's lines are so expertly and gracefully executed I had a vicarious ecstasy within me. I would be delighted to see more movies of his.<br/><br/>The acting is stupendous across the board. And the Oscars and the Critics Circles should be ashamed for not recognizing the merit of this wonder. I'll enlist the performances in brief: 1) Gene: Marvelous, with shining comic-timing, he is the ultimate ladies' man and quite a gentleman too. Watch out for his chemistry with Debbie and his mis-chemistry with Jean. Favorite lines: ""Believe me; I don't like her half as much as I hate you. You REPTILE!"" ""What can I do to you, I'm just a shadow!"" are ROFTL ones.<br/><br/>2) Debbie: Na√Øve, bubbly and a girl-next door Kathy is so gently played by Debbie, shedding any grandiosity of an actress and adding a genteel quality to the film.<br/><br/>3) Donald: Robbed! Yeah, carrying a performance with such jovialness is hard, and incorporating silly faces without making the movie look silly is indeed Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>4) Jean Hagen: Probably the most distinctive aspect of the film apart from the dance-numbers is the hare-brained Lena Lamont, hysterically played by Hagen. Her delivery is impeccable, with perhaps the most memorable lines. (Including the scene with her speech therapist) 5) The rest fill up the minute crevices in the film. The surly director, Lamont's speech therapist (perhaps an aspiring but failed actress herself in the film) etc. solidify the movie.<br/><br/>The most alluring aspect is its replay value, as I've seen it four times in 3 days, not just being enticed by the flashing lights but being educated on the fiascos the poor actors of the 20s had to endure. Singing in the Rain is everything; the granddaddy of musicals. I'll take one step further and say it's one of the best movies in film history. Its efforts have paid indeed. And its infinitely better than that overrated Casablanca."

","If you are depressed, this is the film to watch to get you out of that dark mood, it is the best feel good film I have ever watched. It has become my favourite musical film because Gene Kelly is a genius with the dance routines and they are a work of art all on their own.<br/><br/>The film is about the era of silent movies where Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the most popular and successful silent movie stars. This all changes when talking pictures are introduced to the cinema goers and the film company has to keep up with the other studios by bringing out a talkie movie. In real life, this could be a kiss of death to any silent movie star whose voice didn't fit their image and who couldn't act in this new forum. This is true of Lina who has a very squeaky, high voice and Kathy Sheldon (Debbie Reynolds) is used as Lina's speaking and singing voice. Don falls in love with Kathy but Lina keeps getting in the way of their romance.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that Debbie Reynolds was just 19 when she filmed Singin in the Rain. She is just brilliant, I am annoyed to find out her voice was dubbed in some places as I think she has a beautiful voice and this should not have been done. She does make me laugh when she is acting out all the poses the silent movie stars make to Don who does that for his career.<br/><br/>Donald O'Connor as Cosmo is the best. The energy and animation he shows in Make em Laugh has me in awe. I got tired just from watching him perform around the room.<br/><br/>Whenever it is on, it does cheer me up and leaves a smile on my face for the rest of the day."

I defy anyone to watch him in full flow and not be in awe. The title song will lift your heart on the lowest of days and I personally, will never tire of it. A great cast supports Kelly and should be given credit. I remember the first time I heard Lena say ""What do they think we are, dumb or something!"". Sheer joy! Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor each contribute significantly and should be congratulated for their professionalism in the face of Gene Kelly's apparent tyranny.

"jem132","10","1","4","3 February 2007"," The Sum Of All Parts- A Musical Celebration!
","Perhaps the true greatness of Singin' In The Rain (1952) lies not solely in it's excellent musical numbers, but the clever plot and sparkling screenplay that the song-and-dance numbers are set to. Singin' In The Rain is a rare musical in that it is also an amazing, accomplished feat of film-making.<br/><br/>It is also amazing that this most fresh, witty and original of all musicals is, at it's most basic, a nostalgic mi sh-mash of Early Hollywood. Most components are copied- Kelly's legendary title number had already been rolled out in a creaky early talkie (with not much success) and the brilliant 'Good Mornin'' number is a re-hash of Kelly's dance with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers in Cover Girl's (1944) 'Make Way For Tomorrow' number. Previous stock footage of Kelly from 'The Three Musketeers'(1948) is used, and the Kelly/Reynolds relationship is very reminiscent of the March/Gaynor relationship (minus the drinking) in A Star Is Born (1937)- Kelly even resembling March in a number of scenes. It is remarkable that Singin' In The Rain did so well, as all but two of the musical numbers ('Moses Supposes, a simple, catchy, little ditty set to Kelly and O'Connor's toe-tapping, and 'Make Em Laugh', a rather blatant rip-off of the previous 'Be A Clown') were re-worked old MGM musical staples way past their use-by-date.<br/><br/>Yet this relentless copying and re-working is what makes the film the masterpiece it remains today. It works primarily as a celebration AND an affectionate send-up of early Hollywood. It's plot, revolving around the awkward transition of the film industry from silents to talkies, takes in many actual occurrences and insider-jokes to provide a truly wonderful portrait of late 1920's Hollywood. The screenplay is deceptively hilarious yet rich in detail- those who are not overly familiar with this period of history should do some research, as these sly pokes at early Hollywood are fascinating. The more you know about classic Hollywood, early talkies and the birth of the musical genre, the more you will appreciate this.<br/><br/>Many famous screen stars are parodied- from a heavily-accented European silent film star who dismisses the talkies as 'Vulgar!'(an obvious take on Pola Negri, who actress who didn't make the transition to sound) to the now-famous scene in Bebe Daniels' early musical Rio Rita (1929), where Bebe 'lightly taps' her leading man with a fan. Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen) heavy Brooklyn accent (both a copy of Judy Holliday's 'Born Yesterday' voice and a jibe at Clara Bow, whose honking tones coupled with her wild partying and mental instability ruined her career)and the over-sized blonde-white wig Lina must wear (actually the wig Norma Shearer famously wore in Marie Antoinette, an MGm film from 1938!) represent Kelly and Donen's subtle parodying of the era. Rita Moreno's 'Zip Girl', vamping it at a movie premiere, is a play at Miss Bow's 'It Girl' persona. Kelly's hilarious 'I love you, I love you!' dialog is a direct reference to failed silent matin√©e idol John Gilbert, who made a flop talkie debut in His Glorious Night (1929). Kelly and Donen do misrepresent history, as Gilbert's voice, evidenced from clips, was not all that effeminate, it was in fact a combination of an outdated image, horrendous dialog, L.B Mayer's vendetta to ruin him and his own personal insecurities that led to his downfall and premature death. However, Singin' opts for a more light-hearted focus in capturing the essence of the failings of many early sound films.<br/><br/>Aside from the history, the remarkable and captivating musical numbers are what viewers remember from the film. O'Connor's' 'Make Em Laugh' routine is a masterpiece of physicality, almost Chaplin-like in it's humor and appeal. Kelly's title number is nothing short of stunning and is justifiably one of the most memorable sequences in cinema. The Kelly/Reynolds number 'You Were Meant For Me' is both a a beautiful ballad and an ironic comment on the setting-up of the romantic musical number- a look at the artifice needed to create such an intimate moment.<br/><br/>The ballet sequence (added after the success of 'An American In Paris' a year earlier) merges traditional balletic movements with the jazz/blues rhythms of the 'Roaring Twenties', again evoking the era. Kelly's partner in this astonishing sequence, Cyd Charisse, sports a sexy green flapper dress and a 'Lulu'- a severe page-boy cut popularized by Louise Brooks in the brilliant silent Pandora's Box. Cyd's moll is accompanied by her coin-flipping gangster boyfriend, a bizarre creation who merges the looks of Peter Lorre in 'The Maltese Falcon', the scar of Muni's Tony Camonte in Scarface (1932) and the coin-flipping of George Raft from the same film. The 'Broadway Melody' ballet is a highlight of stylized dancing, a blazing array of color, sound and movement, a parade for Walter Plunkett's terrific costume design, and a journey through the musical, with Kelly dancing in revues and as Florenz Ziegfeld in a 'Follies' tribute.<br/><br/>In a word: Terrific."
"EUyeshima","10","1","4","24 January 2007"," The Forecast Is Only Bright and Sunny for This Unparalleled MGM Classic
","Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.<br/><br/>Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, ""The Dueling Cavalier"". Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ing√©nue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, ""The Dancing Cavalier"", with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.<br/><br/>While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute ""Broadway Melody Ballet"". Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in ""An American in Paris"" the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.<br/><br/>Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in ""Moses Supposes"" to the ebullient furniture prancing of ""Good Morning"" to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on ""Make 'Em Laugh"" to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic √©lan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.<br/><br/>The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, ""What a Glorious Feeling"" made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called ""Reel Sounds"" which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, ""Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM"", which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.<br/><br/>There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned ""Singin' in the Rain"". All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings."
"Chris_Docker","10","1","4","17 December 2006"," finest musical of all time
","What if you wanted a phrase to sum up elation in spite of difficulties? Then you illustrated it with songs, dance, a love story crossing different eras, you offered parallels in the business and personal world, and then underlined it all with a dig at a society that takes itself too seriously? Would it come become widely acknowledged as the finest musical of all time? Singin' in the Rain takes a lost art form, travelling back to the days of silent pictures. A matin√©e idol (played by Gene Kelly) is caught up in the transition, together with his buddy (Donald O'Connor), a co-star with a grating voice (Jean Hagen) and the girl of his dreams (Debbie Reynolds). Just as is often the case in real life, the lovers bond by accepting each other's worst side. She can't stand his pompousness but her image is shattered when she takes a lowly job and jumps out of a birthday cake. She seems the perfect 'star' but, apart from her whole opposition to the Hollywood industry, she has the jealousy of the real 'stars' to contend with.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain successfully re-creates the roaring twenties. By placing much of the story within the film studios themselves, there is easy access to backdrops of wildest imagination, providing constant visual contrasts - music-hall, western, action stunts, as well as forays into black-and-white. The aural contrasts are no less scintillating. The opening scene has Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor dancing to a jazzed-up title song, quickly cutting to the dreamy Lucky Star number for the opening credits, followed by the clamour and excitement of a red carpet interview. Parodies on silent film, dubbing for sound, and dialect coaches continue to grab attention from one moment to another.<br/><br/>This effervescent, all-American movie (together with An American in Paris) heralded a revolution in the American musical. Part of a counter-trend against popular film noir of the day (like Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep), Singin' in the Rain has been described as a 'great amalgam of realized style and stylized realism'. Even the ending, for all its emotional fulfilment, exalts successful caricature over 'serious' film making.<br/><br/>Although it had to overcome many difficulties in the making, it remains one of the most enduring, effervescent and exuberant of films. It spoofs not only the silent era but also many earlier movies from which most of its songs are taken. Finding true sincerity beneath such light-hearted irreverence is part of the task of the seemingly ill-matched lovers. Today, Singin' in the Rain may be bypassed by devotees of contemporary cinema, echoing O'Connor and Reynolds' characters quip: ""Why bother . . . You've seen one, you've seen them all."" Yet each year the film gains new converts."
"rc_brazil","10","1","4","17 December 2006"," The Greatest Musical Ever
","Or is it? I don't know. I first got interested in musicals when I saw Hepburn and Astaire in Funny Face (1957). My logical reaction was to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). The story is extremely smart and funny - two great silent stars having trouble to pass through to talkies, Lina Lamont is the great, special treat. My problem with it is that years went by and I continued to study musicals.<br/><br/>It seems to me that all numbers are recycled versions of other movies. The titled song first came up in Broadway Melody of 1929, and was quite popular in the 30's and 40's. And what can be said of Good Mornin'? I'm sorry! I know that for most people that song finishes up with Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds laughing out loud in a couch, but for me it's Rooney and Garland selling a song in Babes in Arms (1939). I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling only reminds me now of Robert Taylor, and Would You brings back the Jeanette MacDonald in San Francisco. As for Make Them Laugh, Freed himself was ashamed of that - I mean, could he more obviously have copied Cole Porter's classic Be A Clown? <br/><br/>In the end, Singin' in the Rain might be considered the greatest musical ever because of its extremely original story, but definitely not because of its musical numbers. I think that, at MGM in the 50's, that title might as well belong to The Band Wagon (1954), Minnelli's underrated masterpiece starring the greatest dancer of all time (Astaire - it's not an argument, Kelly will always be second best and everyone knows it) and Cyd Charisse (a much more interesting leading lady than Reynolds, who I always found annoying)."

","This might very well be true, at least in my opinion. I've seen this film twice in it's full length, and both times, I repeated the same words over and over again: ""THIS IS Unbelievable! HOW DID THEY DO THAT?!"" Singin' in the Rain is perfect; it is not only a spectacular school example of how a musical should be made, but is also the most romantic film I've ever seen; love is in the air when Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds interact. To focus on the ""smaller"" characters, I've never seen anything like Lina Lamont and Cosmo Brown; the mere line said by Julie Hagen, in that wonderful, unbelievable voice: ""What do they think I am? Dumb or something?""! And amazing Donald O'Connor as the hilarious Cosmo who dances up the walls and pulls stunt-tricks I'd never imagined; what would this movie be without him? So, on a rainy day, if you're feeling down, please get a hold of this movie. I am willing to bet you pretty big money that it'll make you feel much better!"

","It would be a waste of time for me to reissue the same old superlatives about the musical numbers, so I will have this to say about the film that has not been said before.<br/><br/>This film handles the transition from silent films to sound films. It has a very light-hearted attitude to this. It makes light of the fact that one leading lady can no longer function because she cannot sing and she speaks with a heavy regional accent. In reality, that woman was made redundant because of circumstances over which she had no control. And the termination of her career is about as funny as factory lay-offs. Such things, I am afraid were all too real. Jack Gilbert and Clara Bow were just two of the big stars dumped (there's no other word for it) by the Hollywood studios because their voices did not match their screen images. Emil Jannings and Vilma Banky were on the liners back to Europe because they struggled with their English. On this side of the Atlantic Mabel Poulton's star career was finished because she didn't talk posh enough for a gentile leading lady.<br/><br/>So next time you hear Lina Lamont's thick accent, just remember the real people whom Lina Lamont represents.<br/><br/>Not so funny now. Is it?"

","Gene Kelly--- dancing--- what else do you need? The acting is a bit rough and the dated feeling of the film are nice forms of ironic amusement, but at that time it must have been slightly 'hip'--- i really get into the pre-psychedelic montage scenes--- when you start to lose your sense of time in the film--- especially all the scenes that are excuses for dancing--- it is a funny way of presenting a story. If I had any children I would feel safe showing them this film. Porn and horror movies are a bad idea to show to little children. ---- A movie like this is entertaining for all people---- I like to think Don Lockwood is in a backstage love affair with a sarcastic and intelligent Lina Lamont--- and somehow she is respected for her class and charm--- while Kathy Selden is somehow an after thought for Don--- ---and did Kramer from Seinfeld get his name from Donald O'Connor's character---"
"alexandra-25","Null","1","4","9 February 2005"," Inspiering dance scenes.
","Musicals, are an MGM speciality. And because they are musicals, MGM were less concerned with acting ability. By not concentrating on acting ability, this permitted MGM to focus on the important stuff which made their musicals spectacular, such as colour,beautiful costumes,elaborate film sets, great songs, excellently sung - although from what I gather often dubbed - and not least of all the exquisite, and spectacular dancing from the likes of Gene Kelly in the classic; Singing in the Rain.<br/><br/>In Singing in the Rain,the dance scenes are full of energy, and are well choreographed. Though their styles of dancing are completely different, it seems that Kelly works hard at his dancing, whereas Astair's dancing looks effortless, and thus more flowing in the films in which he starred. But in favour of Kelly, he had to dance with Reynolds in a couple of scenes, who was an untrained dancer, unlike Astair's frequent dance partner in RKO's films, Rogers who was a trained dancer, which could've been to the advantage of Astair. By working with an untrained dancer, such as Reynolds, it could've contributed to the fact that Kelly's dance scenes with her lacked total synchronisation at times, especially the scene where they dance on the film set. However, other causes of the lack of synchronisation in the said dance scenes, could be due to the apparent fact that Kelly and Reynolds had disagreements whilst making Singing in the Rain; or it could be due to time constraints set by MGM, which did not permit the perfection of the said dance scenes.<br/><br/>If I could choose a favourate scene, it is that of Kelly executing; Singing in the Rain, which has become somewhat of a clich√© in the genre of musicals. Indeed, this classic dance scene has recently been adapted for a television advert, in which Kelly bursts into a break dance.<br/><br/>Overall a truly escapist film."

"brower8","10","1","4","2 July 2003"," the definitive musical
","A simple story that pokes fun at every clich√© about film stars and the studios for which they work, Singin' in the Rain has lost nothing over time. The dance scenes with are unbeatable, not that one would expect differently with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. The music, even if it isn't original (it all appears in earlier movies -- old ones at the time of this movie's creation) always fits. <br/><br/>The premise: the advent of sound in the new 'talking pictures' makes all silent movies obsolete as mass entertainment, and a high-budget project that ""Monumental Pictures"" has nearly completed would be a disaster at the box office unless it is turned into a sound movie. Technical difficulties, including the directional requirements of early microphones, the tendencies of microphones to pick up sounds like heart beats that distract from dialogue, and the poor co-ordination of sound and image create their own problems.<br/><br/>Even more, the silent-era actors have to relearn how to talk for best effect. With Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) it's almost a lark, and even the pedantics of voice lessons become a set up for a fine musical dance sequence. <br/><br/>The potential catastrophe is that Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) has a voice incorrigibly unsuited to sound pictures, a fact good for both comedy and dramatic tension. But she is the great star of the silent era, she has a big salary, overwhelming arrogance, and a big contract. Even worse, she leaves no question to the question that she poses at one point ""What do you think -- that I'm dumb or something""? The solution is to dub the voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) for dialogue and music without Lina ""Am I dumb or somethin'?"" Lamont knowing what's going on.<br/><br/>So the silent movie is given sound and is even extended with musical and dance numbers. But that's not the whole story, and the sockdolager ending has to be seen to believed. It works!<br/><br/>Unless one considers >The Wizard of Oz< a musical even though it is more an adventure story, this is the greatest movie musical of all times and is compelling cinema that everyone must see."

This is a 'movie',  a popcorn movie, that is filled frame by frame with fabulous performances, beautiful technicolor, and period songs that will be remembered forever.  Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, also its star, this movie musical was made on the coattails of Kelly's previous hit, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, which won best picture of 1951.  It was only meant to capitalize on that heavily honored favorite.  Not only did it capitalize, it transcended all expectations and has become one of America's most loved and important works of art.<br/><br/>The main trio of actors, Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and a young and cute Debbie Reynolds, are perfectly cast in what is really a perfect 'movie'.  Their characters work for Monumental Pictures, actually MGM, and the studio boss is ""L. F. Simpson"", representing MGM boss L. B. Mayer.  Silents rule the silver screen, but, this is 1927, and Warner Bros. has released THE JAZZ SINGER, the first ever talking picture.  It becomes the craze and ""Simpson"" wants to jump onto the bandwagon of sound as soon as possible.  With this premise, we see how studios changed gears and utilized the new 'talkie' technology. One problem: many of the actors and actresses looked great but did not sound fit for the new regime.  Jean Hagen symbolizes the countless actors who lost their jobs because of the new technology.  She can't sing a lick and is as dumb as a brick. (Her voice reminded me of ""Susan Alexander's"" from CITIZEN KANE)  Dialogue coaches are brought in and the studio system is revolutionized.  Not without some hilarious screenings of poorly synched sound pictures that almost has Kelly's career disappearing.<br/><br/>The musical numbers brilliantly relay the movie's story of loss and change, but there is never a sour note.  Two sequences stand out.  Kelly twirling in the rain, of course, and O'Connor's Chaplin-esque turn in a stunning virtuoso mix of dance and slapstick during ""Make 'em Laugh"".  Watch this sequence over and over.  You will not believe your eyes.  The grand ""Broadway Ballet"" scene is wonderful at giving us Busby Berkeley-type choreography and Technicolor illuminates the fake facades of a skeleton-like stage of New York City.  The switch from silence to sound is quietly told by the song and dance.  The writers even managed to get quite a few rips on the industry as a whole, especially the false relationships presented to the tabloid journalists to boost image.  This is ironic considering Louis B. Mayer condemned director Billy Wilder for his dark and bitter take on Hollywood just 2 years before in SUNSET BOULEVARD.<br/><br/>Don't miss SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  It ranks alongside the greatest ever made for a reason.  See for yourself (and crank up the sound and color) !"

","This was simply amazing.  When Roger Ebert mentioned that this was one of his favourites, I knew I had to see it.  I bought the DVD for a meager 10 dollars and watched it.  This was great.  Gene Kelly is just one hell of an amazing dancer.  No wonder he was such a ladies man.  He was very slick! There are so many great numbers in the movie aside from the title track ""singing in the rain"".  Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the love interest of Gene Kelly.  The plot of the movie is interesting.  It involves scandle and intrigue and romance.  However, the singing/dancing numbers stand out above all other musicals I have seen.  This movie left me feeling great (which I need from time to time).  I found my face fixed in a grin throughout the entire film.  Few movies have forced my face to contort that way without me realizing it.  Ah, if only there were a way I could go back to that magical time when film noir was more in fasion.

"jhclues","10","1","4","31 December 2001"," The Definitive Musical
","This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.<br/><br/>Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.'  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.<br/><br/>When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.<br/><br/>Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.<br/><br/>As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.  10/10."

I have more respect of him and like him even more. Now that is true talent for him to be able to do that. I know that he was a perfectionist but even then people know what they can and can't do.

Singing in the Rain is simply put perfect I can't think of any element I didn't like the singing, dancing humour and characters are all bright breezy and uplifting. The affectionate lampooning of 20's Hollywood is spot on and my favourite scene goes not to the the most famous piece of musical history but to Kelly's dignity always dignity speech with visual highlights of how he's character really made it as a star. I must have seen this movie about 20 times now and I can always sit through another screening and find a new favourite line or scene and that's the mark of something special.<br/><br/>I could go on but all I really need to add is just see it 10/10."

","Story of a silent film hearthrob's uneasy transition into stardom in the ""talkie"" era is spiced with the cream of N.H. Brown's MGM library crop.  The dance sequences are superb, featuring Charisse as the ""dream girl"".  But what really makes the film is the real chemistry and well-developed (within the limited time available) love story.  Comden and Green have provided a very nice script, and the photography and directing are excellent. <br/><br/>
The song ""Make 'em Laugh"" is a blatant rip-off of Cole Porter's ""Be A Clown"" (written for the Freed unit only a few years before), and all the other music is from the 30s, so this lack of originality is the film's only real fault."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","30 December 2019"," Pretty funny, but with the status of this being a classic I would not (yet?) agree
","""Singin' in the Rain"" is an American English-language movie from 1952, so this one is almost 70 years old now. It is a color film, which should be said because it really wasn't too common for the early 50s although I believe for non-dramas it was probably more often the case than for drama films. It runs for little over 100 minutes and the director here as well as the lead actor is Gene Kelly, well co-director. It was not his first directorial effort, but still an early project as the man in charge behind the camera. As for acting, he was pretty established already, an Oscar nominee. His film here managed two Oscar nominations and looking at how popular musicals were back then and how people still love this film considerably over half a century later, it is a bit surprising it is ""only"" two I'd say. One is for the score (expected sort of), the other is for actress Jean Hagen. And deservedly so I'd say. She was really the comedic highlight of the film and it is unusual to say something like that about what maybe can be best described as the main antagonist. I will talk a bit about her in detail later on. The Golden Globes gave a prestigious award to Donald O'Connor and I really like that because he gave my favorite male performance in this film (come on, it is clear he is much younger than Kelly's character, don't tell us early on before the flashback they are the same age) and his marvellous qualities as an entertainer really made the film so much better at times. The best example is relatively early still when we see all he can do with his face. Great expressions! Sadly the Oscars did not nominated him, maybe because his turn is more supporting really although he has a lot of screen time. And it was a bit of a category conflict. Still nice to see these two getting the biggest awards recognition because character-wise they are a key reason to watch this film. As for Gene Kelly, I have not seen too much from him really, but in this movie here he did not impress me too much. I rarely felt the sympathy for him where I really would have cheered him on, but then again maybe this is not even what the character was made for. It was more about cheering for Reynolds' to get the recognition she deserves. She was cute as a button no denying and the two I just mentioned also had a romance story in this film. But it is not a romance movie. It is not at the center of the film at all. They quickly get together without us seeing it, but I must say it felt not too credible with how much she apparently despises him (and his profession) early on. Reynolds died a little over three years ago (maybe you remember the tragedy that she died just one day after her daughter), but there is still one cast member alive and that is Rita Moreno, even if she really just plays a minor character who doesn't even have any lines I think. She was roughly 20 back then and now she is almost 90. But looks still really good for that.<br/><br/>Now I also want to say a lot about the music, which is really the heart and soul of the film. The score I mentioned already, but I also want to talk about a few specific songs. It's truly baffling how none of them weren't even nominated. Were they not eligible? Anyway, my favorite song is probably ""All I Do Is Dream of You"". I mean the title song is obviously really good and a classic too, but this one was the one I liked the most and it also played pretty early, still before Reynolds' character loses her initial job. As for the title song, I think I liked the Reynolds version more than the one by Kelly, even if the latter has a lot of charm too because it actually plays outside in the rain and boy was it a storm. But seeing Reynolds sing and Hagen in the front move her mouth was really among the most special moments of the entire film, already before the audience finds out what is actually happening. I still want to say that despite the mean things Hagen's character says and does, it is also not really too nice how they did not tell her that they got somebody performing as a voice actress for her and especially the girl who is dating the guy she loves apparently. And there is also a bit of a serious story to it because so many actors back then from the silent film industry vanished when sound took over, maybe also because their voice did not allow them to make the transition and still get cast. Anyway, I was talking about the songs: A third song I like and that I want to mention would be ""Good Morning"". Huge fun number. Speaking of fun, the opposite is also relevant here. I just mentioned one serious aspect already, but there is also some serious business to how this film can be seen from a historical perspective, not only because it is film on film, but also because it is really about one of the most interesting eras in filmmaking, namely when sound took over and ""The Jazz Singer"" being referenced on several occasions is just evidence of this. This is mostly fictionalized, but for me it also works as a historical movie. Now let me think what else I can say about this one. I definitely liked it overall. It made me smile and laugh on many occasions really. I will not give too many individual scenes or sequences, but basically everything including Hagen was great. The long scene with the guy who struggles to get her microphone in a spot where it is working steadily was a riot really, also because they let us hear her exactly the way they heard her and it wasn't even every other word we understood. Speak to the plant! Or a little later I think when the initial showing goes all kinds of wrong, there is a moment when we have Kelly's character throw away an item and we hear it crash down, something you never hear in a film unless it matters where it lands.<br/><br/>So there are really several perspectives from which this film is a success and worth seeing. I would not call it a triumph and maybe say that (according to imdb) this being almost among the top100 best films of all time is a bit much, but I was also sometimes close to giving it 4 stars out of 5, which would lift it into my top250 films of all time. One such moment would be the scene I already mentioned when we have the camera in a spot where we see Hagen's character on the stage and behind her (and behind the curtain) Reynolds' sing. This was really a great camera shot and angle. Other than that, I would say that maybe I appreciate this film also from other perspectives at least as much as I appreciate it for the musical component. For example I don't think this is really one of the best five musical movies ever made like many would say it is. Or maybe I need to watch it a few more times to think so. I don't know. But even if I was grateful to get the chance to see this on the big screen for the first time (and actually really for the first time because I have not seen it before), I don't intend to see it again soon. Like for the music, there were also segments that did not do too much for me. The best example was the really long Broadway song sequence (the one that features Moreno prominently) that than turns out to be just in the protagonist's mind. I mean it was super spectacular, maybe the biggest challenge performance-wise, but it felt like it had absolutely no connection with the film before and after that and was just included to make sure we won't forget who is the big star here, namely the director himself. Not to me though. Almost everybody from this relatively small key cast felt more impressive to me than Kelly in terms of the character and performance. Certainly a bit of a pity that some characters here did not grow too old at all. Hagen died 25 years later in her mid-50s from cancer. And cancer it was too that killed Millard Mitchell (R.F.) really briefly after this film came out and even more briefly after he won a Golden Globe for another film where he apparently managed the unusual feet to not be nominated for an Oscar after winning a Golden Globe for Supporting Actor. Never happened before. Okay, but now we are drifting a bit away. This film is pretty uplifting overall in my opinion and will entertain you well and make you smile a lot. With the key story, but also with minor moments and quotes like when one character tells another to call him a cab and he says something like ""you are a cab"". I just like plays on words and that is why I found this a lot funnier than I should have maybe. But I'm glad I did. ""Singin' in the Rain"" certainly gets a thumbs-up from me and I am off now to put my favorite songs from this one on my MP3 player. If you have not seen it yet, then go for it, certainly one of the better 1950s films."

","I have seen this film at least five times in my life, most recently in Aug 2019. The music and dance numbers hold up. My favorite being, Singin' in the rain, Good morning, and Gotta Dance. Donald O'Conner has a water like fluidity about his movements. Gene Kelly is strong in his style, athletic, with a soothing singing voice. I believe this was Debbie Reynolds film debut. She was 20 years old at the time. Guess how old Gene was? 40.
Which causes me to pause.....that's just creepy. Gene is old enough to be Debbie's Father. I know, I know, they are characters in a movie. It's a script, make-believe. Frankly I am fed up with it all. Nothing new, older men have dated and married younger women throughout time. It's still awkward. Examples are elderly man and Anna Nicole Smith. Hugh Hefner and all of his teenage girl friends. Yes, I am angry. Why can't I watch a couple on screen that is within five years of each other?"

","I was planning on heading to bed when I heard some friends going to see this flick. It was nearing midnight, but finals were over so I thought heck I'll give it a shot even though it's from 1952 and the TV quality was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Well, I managed to watch all the way through. I haven't seen too many movies from this era so my rating of 9/10 is not qualified, but I'll do my best.<br/><br/>But man, Gene Kelly can dance! He and O'Connor often break out into a quick-step, arm-swinging dance routine while swinging (this is a musical film, after all). It's quite impressive, and it was enough to keep me awake past midnight and up to almost 2 am. There's a romance element to it too, and it's very romantic and pleasing to watch and gives you that nice, warm feeling in your heart.<br/><br/>Interesting, watching this and how they just got sound incorporated into films back then and comparing this flick to a movie like, say, any Michael Bay film and the contrast is galactic."

","Having never seen Singin' in the Rain, I was not about to pass up the chance to see it on the big screen as part of TCM's collaboration with Fathom Events to bring such classics to theatres. I'm a young classic film fan, so I never had a chance to see these films as they were intended to be seen. Singin' in the Rain is one of those films that begs to be seen on 50-foot screen with surround sound. The 1952 film turns 65 this year and is just as pertinent now as it ever was. Starring Gene Kelly and his rapid-fire feet, alongside the recently departed Debbie Reynolds in the film that takes an inside look at making it in Hollywood, Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain was the most fun I could have possibly had on a Sunday afternoon. <br/><br/>The year is 1927, there are murmurs around the studio system that a film company has been toying with synchronous sound. For Monument Pictures, however, those murmurs go ignored as they are firmly focused on the stars making the studio prosper. On-screen couple Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are audience favorites of the silent screen. Although their relationship is strictly for the screen only, Monument Pictures has let it leak to the gossip columns that they are an off-screen couple as well, believing it would boost their already stellar ratings. Behind closed doors, however, Don can't stand Lina, and the dim-witted Lina thinks she and Don are truly engaged. The two have gotten used to the mobs of fans they encounter at every turn as each of their pictures proves more successful than the last. When The Jazz Singer, the first talkie is released, Monument Pictures must make some quick adjustments in order to keep up with the Hollywood evolution. When the technology proves too much to learn in too short a time span, studio heads think they might be sunk. The major problem facing the two stars is Lina's voice. Lina has a voice that makes one long for fingernails scratching along a chalkboard. If Lina is heard talking on screen, no one will likely come to a Lockwood-Lamont film ever again. Fortunately for the duo, Don's new love interest, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) has a fantastic voice, and as much as Don despises the idea, it is planned that she will record Lina's parts, dubbing Lina's voice, for one film only. When a jealous Lina intervenes and attempts to trap Kathy to permanently dubbing her voice, therefore ruining any career Kathy might have, Don won't have it. Plotting a daring and dangerous stunt that could ruin all careers involved, Don pulls off the ultimate sacrifice for Kathy. <br/><br/>The 2012 Best Picture winner, The Artist; a film that I happen to love, takes many cues from Singin' in the Rain. Several times throughout the film I was reminded by The Artist, and anytime a film can do that, at the very least, I will be a pleased audience member. Aside from Singin' in the Rain clearly influencing The Artist, the film is wonderful in its own right. With some of the most wonderful cinematography I have ever seen, and in glorious technicolor, Singin' in the Rain is a visually stunning masterpiece. I have never seen a better-written musical than Singin' in the Rain. The witty dialogue scattered throughout the film keeps one engaged even when there is no on-screen theatrics filling the screen. Gene Kelly is an actor in which I, like everyone else have heard about endlessly. I had not seen much of Kelly's work, however, with only a couple exceptions and I can promise that will change. His dancing is inspiring and completely captivating. I prefer the graceful flair of Fred Astaire, but Kelly has risen in my book after this film. The chemistry was perfect, the film was beautiful, and it is no wonder why Singin' in the Rain is being brought back for theatre screenings 65 years after its debut."

","This film possessed a positive, happy feeling thorough the songs and characterization. The songs were uplifting, and fit well withing each scene. The one critique i have with the entire movie would have to be the scene where their are and extreme amount of color and people dancing around. I don't think that scene was necessary, in my opinion. I love the use of technicolor, and the red and yellow accents used. It works in this film. The movie also includes some diagetic sounds. For example, the scene in the beginning where Don is starting to talk about his backstory, has a violin suddenly playing in the background while Don looks straight into the camera, and this makes the audience want to listen to what he is about to say."

","This movie is a good sample for me to see the big changing(silent film to sound film) for the movie production. It shows this generation changing in different ways. The first one is this changing offers more chance for those new movie actors who has an attractive voice. The second one is the changing on the movie editing. Because the editing for a sound movie is different from a silent movie. editor can use a lot of fantastic edit ways to shape a silent movie, such as thematic montage and classical cutting. But when they edit a sound movie, they have to pay attention to the sound track with the actions. It is a challenge that editing those shots in previous editing ways and also keeping the continuity of the sound track. So in this movie, I see a lot of long shot or so called ""sequence shot"". The third changing is the dialog. In the silent movie, this almost no dialog. That's why in this movie, when the actor said:"" I love you, I love you, I love you"", the audiences didn't like it. Then it changes the dialog. The new dialog becomes metrical and meaningful. This movie is a good movie because it shows the revolution for the movie production. And the result is this new technique helps to make movie production better."

","SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN is just a great circuit, musicals, comedies and romances. The film is full of songs, dance, color, a sort of rebellion and good cheer. Film witty caricatures and parodies panic during disturbing transitional period of silent to sound films in Hollywood in the late 1920s after the sound revolution prevails. Regardless of the lighter topics and cheerful atmosphere, the film is technically very demanding.<br/><br/>Most segments of the film appears to be light and airy, in fact, nothing was easy. All positions are impulsive and arrogant, and refers mainly based on conflicts, which are actually part of a rather amusing parody. The elements in this film can hardly be viewed individually, because it is all rather ""scattered"". Therefore, I can not boast scenario. Photography is really excellent, the scenery opens up space for song and dance. Each of the actors got some own space. It is interesting. They each show individually.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood was dominant. The movement and rhythm. Maybe a little too much gloss. Certainly his performance in the rain is unforgettable. Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown has an infectious relaxation. Quite comical character who was sentenced to ""fill in"" some gaps, because Mr. Kelly can not all arrive alone. Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden remained in a shadow. Probably because the filmmakers wanted to create the same effect as with Ms. Caron. Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont is the most important character. Parody on which the movie is based. Her acting performance will still remembered. The film full of dance and song there is a character that can not even sing nor dance, but still remains the biggest star.<br/><br/>Anyone who likes a little nostalgic dance and songs will love this movie."

","Now I am not really the biggest fan of musicals out there. In fact I usually hate them and cant stand watching them. This was a surprisingly good film that doesn't have to much to not like in it. From the beginning this movie is very funny and energetic. Cosmo was by far my favorite character in the movie because he is always funny and full of life. His song half way through the movie has to be my favorite song and favorite part of the movie. Now with all of this good it doesn't mean this movie is perfect. there is one scene in particular that I hate and that is the final sing and dance number. This song starts off good like the last but ends up dragging on to the point where I almost just wanted to turn the movie off and call it a quite's. Not only was it dragging on but the quality of that song was going down in my opinion as the song keeps going. But all and all I would probably recommend this movie to anyone."

","This film directed by Donen and Kelly is such a treat! And yes, Gene Kelly, who also stars in the film! The singing spans across many genres and styles, and the title song...there's no question as to why it's become common knowledge ""Singing in the rain, and we're happy again!"" and ""Good Mornin' "" (another song in the film). Because even if one hasn't heard or seen the film, they know the musical phrase. This film is beautifully shot, and with it's tracking shots, keeps us, the audience at just enough of a distance that we are engaged yet not dragged into the story. The goal of a musical wasn't to achieve realism, it is meant as a pleasantry to be enjoyed for it's artistic quality. While watching Singin In the Rain, I felt as though I was watching a Broadway show. The camera editing, keeping the audience at just the right angle at all points. Mainly, the music, all of the sound, the facial expressions, and the brilliant use of color. All of those factors contribute to make Singin In the Rain one of the great musicals of all time on film. At the time, the public had had enough after many terrible, poorly though out musicals had been released. Singin in the Rain helped save the genre from dying out entirely. In my opinion. Wonderful film!"

Gene Kelly is a truly amazing actor, singer and dancer. The choreography was very enjoyable in the movie. I found myself nonstop smiling while watching this movie. This movie had romance and a little bit of humor. I think a really great part about the movie is how they showed the history, of when the jazz singer came out, which was the first movie with sound and how they could incorporate sound in the movie they were making, to make it a hit. But went through some struggles to get sound on film at first. The scene and the song of Gene Kelly in the street singing is such a memorable scene and an iconic song."

"cherold","10","0","1","26 April 2016"," A movie where came together perfectly
","Singing in the Rain is one of the movies in which everything is virtually perfect. The screenplay is one of Green and Comden's best. The direction by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen is perfect. The musical numbers are fantastic, especially Make 'Em Laugh and Kelly's all-time best number (no, not the title number, which honestly I've never loved the way other people do, but the brilliant, balletic Broadway Melody). Kelly is charming, Donald O'Conner is breezily funny, Debbie Reynold's is a perfect girl-next door, and Jean Hagen is wildly funny as an awful person with a voice to match.<br/><br/>This is not to say that there is nothing to criticize. There is a tedious fashion show number that I wish could be retroactively excised and Hagen, as funny as she is, tends to look a bit too much like a comedic actress to be 100% believable as a screen goddess (she's very pretty but has the overly-expressive face of a comic). But these are such minor quibbles that for practical purposes, this is a perfect movie."

I usually don't take musicals seriously and the forced singing and dancing usually doesn't appeal to me. But in Singin' in the Rain the dancing and music goes well with the story line and progression of the movie. The comedy that also is included helps to lighting the movie up and gives it a second side that I enjoy other than just music and dancing. It also helps that Gene Kelly can actually sings the songs well. Another aspect of the movie that I enjoyed is the love triangle between Don, Lina, and Kathy. At first Don acts like he is together with Lina to just keep his fans happy but by the end of the movie he ends up with his true love Kathy."

The musical numbers were very catchy and engaging, and I found myself recognizing most of the songs without having seen the movie prior.

","If you are into musicals, this is the movie for you. Unless you live under a rock, you may be familiar with the song, Sinin' in the Rain, which of course comes from this movie. The on- screen romantic duo, Don and Lina try to pursue a romantic to their fans while behind screen, their relationship isn't what it seems to be. When movies start coming out in sound after the debut of The Jazz Singer, Don realizes that he can't have Lina speaking or singing in any of her films. He uses the beautiful voice of a musical singer named Kathy to cover up Lina's nasal sounding voice. Lina soon discovers what is going on and does anything to try to keep her face in film because she wants to be as successful as anyone else. I believe that this movie was easy to get into with all of the good music that was played."

Don was such a likable character, and Lina made for a very humorous addition to the cast. Cathy was likable from the beginning, and audiences could see the chemistry between Kathy and Don. It was nice to finally see them together, not only romantically, but in their careers as well. I also loved that it was a musical, but it felt like it could happen in every day life, just with a few songs and dance numbers thrown in.

","I remember enjoying it the first few times I watched it, but after this viewing I was a little indifferent to it. The acting, story, settings are all quite nice and well done, but it all seems too cheery for me. Everyone is too happy and cheerful- too artificial for me.<br/><br/>The trio's performance (Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds) worked well cohesively, and the chemistry between them is solid. They portray their characters with enthusiasm and are very convincing. Hagen as Lina does a fantastic job, and her high-pitched voice gets me every time. The constant swapping between who is singing for whom makes for a fun trivia. <br/><br/>The story is very self-reflective in that it shows how movies are made (while being a movie itself). It does a pretty good job at this, but of course only shows the workings of the top decision makers. Also, the self-reflectivity does not interfere with audience engagement as viewers are kept engaged by the romance line between Don and Kathy. As for the musical part, most of the song numbers are pretty entertaining and catchy, though some are a bit long. Also, there is one sequence which is set in the idea of a film Don has (a film within a film) that has no correlation to the narrative itself. So I did not really think that sequence was necessary, but I guess it served to further reinforce the American Dream ideology. <br/><br/>The settings are quite vibrant in colour which is nice, but for me adds to this artificiality of the film. Everything is too neat, too clean and pristine. Adding to that, the sound though is synchronized pretty well, is sometimes obvious that it was recorded separately. <br/><br/>Overall, a pretty fun film to watch, and which everyone should watch at least once."

Something other musicals struggle to do. There is no doubt that the actors in this were extremely talented, that is showed by some of the complex choreography, such as ""make em laugh"". The story itself was about a successful silent movie duo making the transition into the world of sound films. Jealously and desire play a pretty big part in this film, which make it entertaining to watch also. However, some of the dance routines were a bit too long for me. I am not questioning the skill of the actors and dancers, but at some points it became slightly difficult to just stare at people dancing for what seemed like forever, such as the Broadway Meleody Ballet. That was much too long for my taste. Other than that, I did enjoy this film, and I would consider it the trailblazer for musicals."

","Singin' in the Rain is one of my absolute favorite movies. It seems to occur at this point where absolute technically sound filmwork meets whimsy and flat-out fun. This is a very tough thing to achieve, considering the technical planning that goes into such choreography and camera-work (see: Make 'Em Laugh).<br/><br/>This film is so full of elaborate sequences (elaborate in their choreography, lighting, sets, dynamic elements of camera-work, sound, set, and props) and great dialogue that it's clear to any viewer how much work went into each component of Singin' in the Rain.<br/><br/>The movie only loses its over-the-top enjoyable qualities during one sequence toward the end. The ballet sequence seems ham-fisted, and goes on for far too long. I find myself wondering when they'll get back to the movie when it's going on, and I'm sure that's no filmmaker's intention for any part of a film.<br/><br/>Beside this, however, the movie is thoroughly captivating, not just enjoyable. The playful use of sound to emphasize it as a story element is apparent in scenes like Don Lockwood's (Gene Kelly) flop of a movie premiere, as well as one scene where he and Lina (Jean Hagen) struggle to act with a microphone. These scenes are not only humorous and fun but also speak to the strange transition that filmmaking underwent after the advent of sound in film.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is great for so many reasons. To be such an example of excellent filmmaking and also be so purely enjoyable is an incredible combination of things to get out of a movie, and this one has both, with so much more."

Donald O'Connor plays his life long friend who does a back-breaking number called ""Make 'em Laugh."" Jean Hagen is hilarious as Kelly's co-star whose high pitched voice becomes a technical problem for the talkies. Millard Mitchell plays the studio head who reluctantly embraces the idea of talking pictures due to the success of The Jazz Singer, so he decides that Kelly and Hagen's current film be a talking picture. Reynolds will factor in at the encouragement of Kelly to lend her voice over top of Hagen's. With inventive and glorious dance numbers including Kelly's wondrous title number where the storms of life fail to penetrate the expression or discovery of love at its most finest. This is a total celebration and expression of music and emotion. It also presents historical cinema shifting from one medium to another. It is a masterpiece that represents the very best from directors Stanley Doren and Gene Kelly. It is a dazzling and charming film full of joy and wonder. Score: 10 / 10"

","This movie is a classic and deserves all the credit it gets! I honestly could not believe what a wonderful film it was as I was watching it. The sets were mesmerizing and so beautiful. All of the colors were spectacular. I could honestly watch the movie without the sound just to see the dancing and the sets. That being said the singing was amazing and the lyrics were so thoughtful and funny. I've had this music stuck in my head since I watched it, but I love it. I could listen to the soundtrack of this film over and over again. The script was well written and the characters were believable and enjoyable to watch. I was honestly laughing throughout the whole film. It's the perfect film; a musical, a drama, a comedy, and a romance all wrapped into one. The casting for this film was perfect; Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Jean Hagen, and Debbie Reynolds were all funny, talented, and skilled actors who greatly added to this films success."

","Even though I am not a musical fan, i found this film enjoyable because of the up beat attitude that the characters have. the storyline is easy to follow and the film included music that can be up lifting. The acting was decent but the dancing and singing from the actors and actresses was tremendous. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor seemed as if they had been lifelong friends before the movie was made and that made that aspect of the movie believable. As a director, Gene Kelly did a beautiful job putting together the different aspects such as choreography, music, singing, and acting. the film is a classic musical that is rightfully considered one of the best movies of its gene."

","I am not a fan of musicals. I never have been, and I would not choose to watch one over any other genre (within reason). But, Singing in the Rain is the exception to the rule. It is by far the most watchable musical I have ever seen. The acting is excellent, the songs are catchy, and it has a generally heart-warming charm to it. This film is beautiful to look at. The shot composition is artistic, as well as the rich, colorful costumes and backgrounds. This film is shot with technicolor, and it is clear.

","I'm not much of a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of Singin' in the Rain! Most musicals I find either boring, forced, or both. Either the music and dancing is forced into the story or the story is forced into the music and dancing. Not with this film. It all flows together and packs quite a punch. The music and choreography are excellent and then when you add in the story, dialog and comedic elements you get a truly wonderful experience. The acting and comedic elements are intertwined with two story lines, the transition from silent films to talkies, but also evolving relationship between Don Lockwood and Kethy Selden. This a must see film!"

","I had always heard about the film Singin' in the Rain and had always heard about how it is a classic. So finally I sat down to watch it and I really enjoyed the film. I got very drawn in at the beginning of the movie because I thought it was a cool concept having a film about actors, especially during such a time a crisis as the period where silent films were switching to sound. I found the humor of the film to be very enjoyable and constant throughout, along with the very entertaining and catchy song queues with a matching amount of entertaining dances. I wasn't very surprised that I enjoyed the film because I do enjoy the occasional musical from time to time, but this has definitely become one of my favorites. I found the movie to be very good and entertaining from beginning to end. My only problem with the movie, which probably isn't a surprise, is about the one musical and dance number towards the end of the movie that just goes on longer than it should have. It was a cool scene with lots of interesting things going on; I just believe it wasn't very necessary and could have been much shorter. Overall though, I do agree that this movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed a musical."

Together they seem to find their voices through singing however as their bond grows and their film careers progress they're confronted by Lina who will go to any length to make sure she stays in the spot light.<br/><br/>I am not one to go out of my way to watch musicals however this film is an exception, the choreography, photography, acting and singing make this film a timeless classic that city feel anyone can enjoy."

","I don't like musicals. I should like musicals. I like music; I like movies. Why don't I like musicals? If I had a quick guess it would be because most musicals are made for people who don't like movies. They're made for the same type of people who enjoy high-octane action films. They're all sizzle without the steak. Singin' In the Rain is sizzle, it's steak, and it's a fully dressed baked potato as well. I don't like musicals, but I loved Singin' In the Rain.<br/><br/>Sure, the music was great, but the story was better.

It was at this moment I recognized why I don't like musicals.<br/><br/>This movie was funny, it was gorgeous to look at, and it was cleverly edited. I'm not sure Hollywood could make another film like this without turning it into a giant cast blockbuster of an event and as a result end up bombing at the box office.<br/><br/>I never thought that my favorite film of all-time would be a musical, and I'm still not 100% sold that it is, but it's certainly in the discussion."

","I'm not a big fan of musicals but I did like Singin' in the Rain a lot. I thought everything was great from the editing, lighting, sound, camera-work, acting, just everything about it was perfect! The movie is about a famous ""power couple"" Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are known for their great chemistry in movies and people think it is in real life also but the real life romance between the two was just for publicity. Well Lina likes Don but Don doesn't like Lina. Don's best friend Cosmo and him have come along way in their success and they don't want Lina to ruin it with her high pitched voice and dumb comments. Don and Lina were known for their silent films but when sound began to make its way into films, Lina's annoying voice would be heard and they wanted to make a musical but Lina could not sing very well at all. Don's new love interest Kathy sings for Lina and they put her voice and singing over Lina's so it sounds good. But when Lina found out it wasn't her voice she was furious. She threatened to sue the company if they took her out of the movie because she signed a contract so they kept her in it just not her voice. After the successful premiere of their musical, Lina went out to sing to the crowd with Kathy singing behind the curtain however, the curtain fell and everyone found out that Lina wasn't the real one singing. Both girls ran away in embarrassment but Don stopped Kathy and told the crowd she was the one with the beautiful voice not Lina. The movie ended with Don and Kathy kissing in front of the poster for their new movie called Singin' in the rain. I loved this movie from start to finish."

","'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favorite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you absolutely no time to be bored. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem, the leading lady can't sing and she can't act. Jean Hagen provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended ""Broadway Melody"" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story. All and all this film was great and is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!"

","I'm a musical fan, ever since I was a kid. I grew up with everything from Disney films like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and a plethora of Broadway productions I went to see in NYC. Yes, I know it's corny and unrealistic, but that was the point of the musical, hence why this was such a win-win for me.<br/><br/>First and foremost: it is just so, so fun. And quite funny! I've been meaning to watch this movie for ages and never got around to it, and now that I've finally seen it I was not disappointed. The characters were entertaining and well-acted, the humor was spot on, and had lovely photography with deep, saturated colors. My favorite scene had to be when the main character was dancing with the female lead in an imaginary sequence of their talky film; highly artistic and dynamic even for what was supposed to be just a small part of the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like the songs as much as I did, especially the movie's title number. Something about it makes me just so happy, and I can't put my finger on why but I was smiling the whole time. I do recall being on the Great Movie Ride in Disney World and it showed that one part and ever since it's been ingrained into my mind. So for that, I give it a well deserved 10 for nostalgia's sake."

","Singin' in the Rain directed by Gene Kelley in 1952 was the begging of the 'musical' era in film. The idea that sound was almost never used in film until it was found possible in the 30's is hilarious to us now. However, when musicals came about it became a way to make a story flow in a different way. The way they show the struggle of turning into sound through music is both iconic and brilliant. The script to this movie is full of comedy, romance, and of course song. Now that the film industry was really defining itself this is a wonderful example of just how far the film industry had come. The wide angled camera shots are also a key component to this movie. Being able to see so much really emphasizes the movies' meaning"

","Singin In The Rain directed by Gene Kelley and Stanley Donen is an excellent musical. Firstly, I must say that I am not Particularly a fan of musicals, However this film greatly exceeded my expectations. I was expecting constant singing throughout the film but this was not the case. The film actually has an extremely well written script. I would say this musical is way better than the Sound of Music. The films cinematography is uncanny, the choreography by the actors is stupendous and very impressive especially with the long takes during the tap dances.

","Singing in the Rain by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly is the best musical movie I've ever seen. I am really not a big fan of musicals and going into this one, I wasn't too excited. After the movie though I changed my view on it. It was fantastic throughout and it was finally good to see a movie in color. All the songs in the movie were good and I didn't know some of the songs were from this movie. ""Good Morning"" is a song we hear a lot these days and I had no idea that this where it came from. It was also a good feeling at the end of the movie to see Lena be embarrassed by everyone at the show. She had the snobby attitude and I just didn't like her at all. Her scratchy high pitch voice fit perfectly with her because it was annoying just like she was as a person. Her voice was awful and they did a good job of making the audience really hate her and favor Kathy."

","Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know¬Ö as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.<br/><br/>And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion‚Äînot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.<br/><br/>Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins."

The casting was spot on, creating one of the most believable set of characters in what many would call a ""caricature"" of life. A very energetic film, always keeping the audience engrossed by any means. The comedy is phenomenal, keeping the characters lively, and making the movie a pleasure to the eyes to see. The cinematography is wonderful, set design, hell everything is pot on.

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is just that, a musical about overcoming a storm of problems and serves as a great reboot of the musical genre of films. Even if you aren't a fan of these types of movies it is still possible to gather entertainment from this quirky flick. The songs aren't particularly memorable in any sense, besides for maybe two of them, ""Good Morning"" and ""Singin' in the Rain,"" (of course). While it does nothing different from musicals in our generation of films, it was underrated at the time of its release and harbored an aspect that similar musicals had lacked, a plot! Oh yes, a plot to glue everything together, while collective yet overdone, it operated efficiently and did its job of keeping the audiences attention. Looking back upon this movie retrospectively, it might be labeled as a classic, but it is nothing special."

Anyway, Singin' in the Rain is your typical cheesy, over-the-top love story but what makes the film stand out is the impeccable dancing numbers. Gene Kelly is a real genius when it comes to dance in my opinion and the film is worth a watch just to see the dance numbers alone.

This movie is more than a singing and dancing sensation however as it is the story of two silent film stars who must transition into the world of talking pictures. The transition is hilarious as the female lead, the glamorous Lina Lamont has a voice that could easily be compared to nails on a chalkboard. Gene Kelly, portraying the male lead Don Lockwood and his brilliant childhood friend Cosmo, played by the wonderful Donald O'Connor, come up with the brilliant idea to use the voice of the beautiful Kathy Selden, played by Debbie Reynolds, for Lina's in the movie. Of course Lina has been jealous of Kathy's involvement from the start and that's when the real fun begins. In addition to the hilarious storyline this picture includes some of the best dance moves I've ever seen and the singing talent is legendary.

","Personally not being a huge fan of musicals, I actually really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. The first enjoyable piece of this film is without a doubt the music itself. There were several songs such as ""Good Morning"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" that were catchy and are well known even today. I thought the acting was great with every character. I was especially impressed with Donald O'Connor's role of Cosmo. He was a phenomenal supporting actor and was extremely talented dancing, singing, and playing various instruments. This film also features basic elements such as a simple love story between Don and Kathy that evolves throughout the film. I also thought this film was pretty funny overall, especially the ending scene at the theater. Although the character Lina had an annoying voice, I thought she served well as the films main antagonist and provided a humorous role as well. Overall, I can clearly see why ""Singin' in the Rain"" is highly regarded as the greatest American musical. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone."

","I found this film very interesting and well liked because of the various techniques and colors Gene Kelly put into it. A lot of people get bored with musicals, but i think this film could also be characterized as a comedy.The lines and also the dancing was a fun part of the film. I loved how Kelly used such vibrant colors in some of the scenes, for example the scene of the Broadway show. In most of the film, you can see that Kelly uses 2 and 3 technicolor, for example, when John and Kathy are on the roof top, as Kathy is on the ladder. Also, in the short films that the actors in the movie are watching, you can see that tint is being used. Kelly uses a flashback technique in the beginning to focus on how John and Lena met. This movie was a lot better then I had anticipated it would be. The choreography was great and everything just fit in perfectly."

","‚ÄãSingin' in the Rain, directed by Stanley Lockwood and Gene Kelly may be a tad bit out of date now, but it is still a must see classic musical. It defines a period in film history when musicals were very positive as it was done purposely for audiences to be entertained and get away from the harsh realities of the outside world. The music is timeless with many people being able to know the songs without even seeing the actual movie. The choreography was excellently done and the acting should be commended. My only complaint with the film is that many of the songs did not have anything to do with furthering the plot, and that a lot of the scenes are outdated, but either way this movie is still arguably one of the best film musicals of all time. It is for that reason that this film is well- worth watching. ‚ÄãSingin' in the Rain is a musical comedy about film productions switching from silent films to ones with sound. Some actors in the movie have an easy time transitioning to sound like movie star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), while others have a pretty tough time like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Afraid that Lina might ruin the film production company's latest film with her incredibly displeasing-sounding voice, the company decides to use Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) voice instead for Lina. The performance by all the actors and actresses were outstanding in my opinion, but Jean Hagen stood out the most to me. Her voice did not sound that bad in real life. The fact that she made her voice sound like that to make the audience laugh at her and like her character even if she was an awful person in the film shows how well she played her character. Another performance I found very entertaining was Donald O'Connor's portrayal of Don's friend Cosmo. His performance was very comical and his dance numbers in the film were exceptional. ""Make 'em Laugh"" was one of my favorite songs in the whole movie because of how well O'Connor danced in it. These two performances in my opinion out-shined all the others in this film. ‚ÄãA key element to this film is its soundtrack. Like most musicals, the soundtrack obviously plays a pivotal part in it. What's so great about this film's soundtrack is that is able to stand the test of time even after sixty years of its release in theaters. Songs like ""Good Morning"", ""Make 'em Laugh"", and of course ""Singin' in the Rain"" are all classics. Most people who have never seen this movie can recognize at least one of these songs because they are still used in pop-culture today. The only issue I have with the soundtrack is that many other songs have nothing to do with the film's plot and they are there for more entertainment purposes. Songs like ""Moses Supposes"" have very little with the actually plot of the movie. Musicals now in recent history usually use their songs for plot purposes and it goes along with the film. This just shows how times in the film industry have changed. Back when this film was released the two main genres that people went to go watch were film-noirs and musicals. Film-noirs showed the corruption of society and were very much negative. Musicals were the polar opposites at the time as people went to go see them to be entertained and get away from all of the negative aspects. Singin' in the Rain does just that. It's very entertaining with not many serious topics at all discussed. I think that this might be my only issue because I myself am from a different generation of films where many films, even musicals, have more serious tones. Nonetheless, the soundtrack of this film is timeless and really represents the time period in which the film was released. ‚ÄãIn conclusion, I highly recommend watching Singin' in the Rain. Even if one is not a fan of musicals, they should watch it anyway for its nostalgia. A lot of the scenes are outdated as the effects are not the greatest and the lines are cheesy at points, but it is still a great movie to see. The performances by the cast were great and so was the soundtrack. It is hard not to finish watching this film without having the tune of at least one song from the film stuck in your head. ‚Äã"

Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well.

Some dancing scenes were a bit of a try-too-hard for me, and some scenes were kind of dramatic, but what do you expect from a musical? It was cute though, especially with how colorful and animated the cast was (you have to be, but these people were touching in a way). Everything was bright and cheerful. The sound was very clear, so some of the songs were able to get stuck in my head after a while, and I have no complaints about it.

","Singin' in the Rain is a very well done musical. The story and music is great of the three main characters trying to save one of their worst movies to date and turn it into a musical so people will enjoy it more then the cheesy drama it once was. The music is really exciting and all the songs were enjoyable and there was one song towards the end that ran a little longer then it needed to. The dancing is also great everyone is on point and I think Cosmo's solo song and dance was the best part of the film because it used the set pieces and comedy great. Overall, I really enjoyed Singin' in the Rain more than I thought I would and would watch it again. It gets an 8/10."

","Singin' in the Rain is an impressive film because it possesses an infectious glee. It's a film that sets out to be enjoyable and fun, and it does this so well it achieves a level of quality normally reserved for serious, austere films. It has a very jubilant nature that focuses on being entertaining, and I really admire its devotion to making its audience happy.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is a lighthearted musical comedy about a studio and it's actors dealing with a difficult transition to sound. The co-director Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a multi-talented actor struggling with growing doubts over his acting ability. After his first attempt at a drama with sound is an embarrassing failure, he and the character that is essentially his sidekick despite being more likable and talented than him, Cosmo Brown, along with love interest Kathy Seldon are able to salvage the film and inexplicably fly a convertible into the sky in the middle of a carnival. I had a hard time connecting with a musical. Not to say I didn't like it, it's just not my genre of choice.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, I feel like I just don't know enough about musicals to articulate my feelings about the film. I know it was good, and I know the actors were some seriously talented dancers, but I know nothing about dance. All I'm really sure of is that the movie was fun. I had a good time watching it. It was genuinely funny and Donald O'Conner was outstandingly charismatic and impressive in being able to stand out as the most skilled dancer and funniest character. Hopefully I can write something better for West Side Story."

","I usually don't watch musicals but this one was great. The dance routines had balance and grace. And the musical numbers were epic. It was great to find that the actors and actresses used their own voices while singing. I thought this movie was cute, cheesy word but there's no other way for me to describe it. It had to take so much work and time to get all of the dances down for this film. And not to mention COLOR! The film was so clear, it made me feel as if I was in the Pop Art era. All of the strong vibrant colors towards the end of the film was incredible. Though I did feel like the ending dance number was a bit too long, it had great scenes within a scene and I loved how it was a thought that the main character had. It goes to show you have wild ones imagination is. In all I just thought this film was great. Definitely recommended to anyone who's interested."

","I didn't think that I would like singing in the rain due to the fact that I am not a musical person. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. For being a person who doesn't normally like musicals I wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of singing that they placed throughout the movie. It was elegantly placed in the movie and was strategically placed so it flowed beautifully into the scene. Scenes with the music were also very dramatic and well thought out, such as the well known ""rain scene"". The only complaint that I would have about this movie is that the end scene tends to drag out a lot longer than it needed to. It felt like it took forever for them to get to the main point for the ending."

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is a wonderful film. It's beautifully shot, the songs are memorable and the dance choreography is fantastic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds have perfect chemistry together and are all terrific physical and comedic performers. It's really amazing to see them singing and dancing together and because the film maker knew how talented these people were, the editing during these scenes is sparse, allowing you to really admire everything with few cuts. I had seen the titular segment where Gene Kelly is ""singin' in the rain"" and still it contained so much joy that it felt fresh to me. That's an iconic moment that makes the movie worth seeing all by itself there are many other great segments, like the ""Make 'em Laugh"" sequence, where Donald O'Connor does an impromptu number, all on his own without a stunt double and ""Good Morning"" where we get to see the three leads together celebrating a breakthrough. You really get to see that these people were amazing physical performers and it makes you want to get up and practice their moves in the hopes that you could be as good. There's so much energy in the film that it's a real delight to see. It's sure to please you and make you smile, it's laugh-out-loud funny and I also enjoyed seeing the lighthearted insight on the world of filmmaking as the talkies started replacing the silent films. Even if you're not interested in musicals, it's hard to imagine someone not enjoying the movie. (Theatrical cut on the big screen, August 19, 2012)"

","I absolutely loved the musical Singin' In The Rain (1952). It was fantastic!!! This film was originally a MGM film produced by Arthur Freed. Freed was also an uncredited produced on The Wizard of Oz. I LOVED the color in this film. It was bright and vibrant. Singin' In The Rain was done in a 3 part Technicolor; shot in three strip black and white printed, printed with dye and then transferred onto a single strip of film. This film was truly amazing and is what I consider to be a classic. It was ranked number 5 on the list of greatest American films in 2007. The only part of the film that I truly didn't appreciate was the end when he was trying to explain his vision of the end of his musical to the producer. I feel like we could have still gotten the point of it if it were a whole lot shorter. Another aspect that I loved, besides the color, was the use of all the difference dances throughout the film. I notice that they used ballroom, tap, ballet, line and whole bunch more. Watching them dance was more entertaining than the actual plot at times! Overall, I think this is the best musical I have watched."

","I love musicals, so I was so excited to watch this film in class.<br/><br/>Singin in the Rain is a classic musical which is featured in color, starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. This film was also directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.<br/><br/>The movie is about silent film star Don Lockwood, who happens to drop in on an innocent bystander, Kathy Seldon while attending a premier of one of his movies one night. It was instant flames for Don, however you can tell that Kathy isn't as interested in him. In the end the guy got his girl, as in most typical love stories.<br/><br/>I think the co-star Donald O'Connor was much more interesting to watch, than Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. His comedic style was priceless. I loved watching his creativity in this film."

","This is the first time that I saw this movie and I have to say that it was absolutely wonderful. I loved the entire movie from the beginning to the end. There were a couple of drawn out scenes that could have been eliminated or shorten but overall it was great.<br/><br/>Although a comedy it had a dramatic meaning and plot of deceive, love and power. Gene Kelly played a magnificent character or Don Lockwood an actor trying to make it to the top. Jean Hagen plays the character for Lina Lamont, a woman that has the most annoying voice in Hollywood but has the stage presence that everyone loves. Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden, a soft spoken lovable woman that has an amazing voice and personality. Donald O'Connor plays Don's sidekick Cosmo Brown.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is a lot of different types of singing and dancing. It was greatly choreographed with incorporating so many different dance styles.<br/><br/>The camera use in this movie was fabulous. The camera angle and height was used all different ways to draw your attention further into the movie. They used the Aerial view in a lot of shots to capture the entire picture within the frame to give us an overall view of the shot.<br/><br/>The storyline of thinking fake love was real love, pretending to love to keep fame, finding real love, and recognizing real talent was all put together in a manner that keep my interest and made the movie, funny and intriguing while enjoyable to listen to."

","So yesterday I made wife (Russian) watch Singin' in the Rain with me. There are two kinds of classics: the many that now feel like a museum piece, the few golden that are timeless. Singin' in the Rain is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>The comedy is cleverly woven into the script, taking advantage of inherent opportunities afforded by the plot rather than ladling it over the surface like some kind of sauce. Jean Hagen, as the actress with a voice made for silent films, got more laughs from my 5-year-old daughter than any of the fart jokes from more recent cartoons. The musical numbers, of which there are so many, each manage to encapsulate a moment, and each is unique in style. Here we really get the benefit of a more mature Gene Kelly, who has had time to develop and evolve stylistically as a dancer. Donald O'Conner is at the top of his game--you can't help but be impressed with his athleticism and attention to detail. Debbie Reynold's has the perfect voice for the part and is so charming that you can't help but love her.<br/><br/>As great as all that is (which seems like way too much to fit into 1:43), that's not what makes the film. It's that everything flows so easily and seamlessly that you don't think about any of this while you're watching. You only stop to think about that when everything has finished.

That shows, how are we going down in providing quality films. The plot is pretty simple of introducing sound into movies. Its periodic and is yet so flamboyant with tap dances, music and love making space to make it a true musical. Music is what made this movie so very typical and outstanding, it's characters are so stereotypical and yet so humorous thats its so very easy to fall in love with. <br/><br/>Performances by each one is just so clean and engaging but Gene Kelly has provided an outstanding performance as Don Lockwood. Plot is simple but the way it was made will make anyone just be happy, there are no twists here, but there is beauty in the simple things that we see. The voice being dubbed, the introduction of microphone, each things makes a scene either cynical or comical and without taking anything overboard. Yes, there are too many songs and dances and yet I loved most of them, coz they are so very real. <br/><br/>Anyone would love Singing something In the Rain as Rain in itself is a romantic phenomenon and love sprouts from deep within at such times, I loved this film for its songs, its performances and just for making me feel so happy. <br/><br/>Technically, its cinematography, its editing lack their slick which we see these days, but its too very detailed in terms of dialogue and art direction, so it gives us the space to fall in love with it.<br/><br/>Recommended for sure, it's 4/5 for one of the best musicals ever."

Don meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) as he jumps into her car getting away from adoring fans. They meet again when she jumps out of a cake at a company party. Monumental's boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) is blindsided by the success of talking picture ""The Jazz Singer"" and he tries to jump start his entry with Don and Lina. Cosmo Brown becomes the new music director. It's a struggle to do something new and worst of all, it's a struggle for the self-obsessed and delusional Lina with the horrible voice. The first attempt ends in a laughable disaster. The trio decides to change it into a musical with Kathy dubbing for Lina.<br/><br/>The moment that Jean Hagen starts talking is the most hilarious thing. She's a real gut buster. Gene Kelly is a cad and a very likable one. Donald O'Connor is solid in being the nice guy second fiddle. His dancing is so energetic. Debbie Reynolds is completely adorable. The songs are incredible and so catchy. The dancing is iconic. Most importantly, the story is actually funny and compelling.

","When ""Singin' in the Rain"" won praises in 1952 for its salute to the beginning of the Hollywood sound era, the critics praised everybody involved with the film, from producer Arthur Freed and director Stanley Donen, all the way down to minor characters Madge Blake as a Louella Parsons like gossip columnist and Kathleen Freeman as a diction coach. Gene Kelly was praised for his graceful dancing even more so than the classic musicals he had already starred in, and Debbie Reynolds was saluted as a promising new leading lady who was perky enough to rise to the top yet established enough to hold her own with the veteran leading man. Ironically, it was Kelly's pal Donald O'Connor who went home with a Golden Globe, and Jean Hagen as a dizzy movie star whose voice killed her transition from silents to sound who received an Oscar Nomination.<br/><br/>Now referred to as one of the best movie musicals ever made (certainly in the top 10), this has been re-done for the Broadway and London stage (with mixed results) and imitated through spoofs on T.V. variety shows and in various modern movie musicals. Even ""Xanadou"", a 1980 cult flop which was Gene Kelly's last musical film role, made a reference to this in one of their musical numbers. But it is this movie which stands the test of time and retains its place of glory in the movie musical hall of fame. Of course, Kelly's performance of the title song remains its most famous moment, but how can you not be amazed by the ""Broadway Ballet"" production number which features a gorgeous Cyd Charisse as a silent movie vamp. Future ""West Side Story"" Oscar Winner Rita Moreno is instantly recognizable as a Clara Bow like cutie, and Millard Mitchell is imperious yet comical as the perplexed studio head.<br/><br/>This was released at a precarious time in MGM's history, just as the transition from Louis B. Mayer to Dore Schary was taking place behind the scenes. Television was taking off, too, and movie audiences had to be really intrigued to skip Lucy, Uncle Miltie or Red Skelton to go to the movies. Reviews across the board were fantastic, and to this day, people can still quote Hagen's nails-down-a-chalkboard lines such as ""What's wrong with the way I talk?"" and of course, ""Ta te tee to too."" There's a fabulous montage saluting the early years of talkie musicals, and if you see some of the rare ones released between 1929 and 1931, you can appreciate the detail which went into the creation of this number.<br/><br/>O'Connor really steals the scene when he breaks into ""Make Em' Laugh"" which almost sounds like Cole Porter's ""Be a Clown"" from ""The Pirate"" which ironically was originated by Gene. Debbie gets her chance to show her dancing skills when she joins O'Connor and Kelly for ""Good Morning"" which has been utilized for orange juice commercials recently. O'Connor and Kelly prove that graceful dancing can be comic in Kelly's montage over his transition from vaudeville hopeful to flickers wannabe to matin√É¬©e idol (""With dignity. Always dignity"", he repeats as flashbacks show otherwise) and ""Moses Supposes"".<br/><br/>While there were no musical superstars at MGM during the early age of sound (Broadway veteran Charles King comes closest thanks to ""Broadway Melody of 1929"" and a few other forgotten musical antiquities), other studios had teams and individual stars who come close to representing whom Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds play here. As for Hagen, there were a ton of forgotten silent stars whom she could be, but even if fictional, the reference to what was the major problem is hilarious, as is the revenge Kelly and O'Connor get on her in the conclusion and the discovery of Reynolds as a major musical talent."

","He sings, he acts, he dances, he directs.This Gene Kelly classic transformed how musical movies are produced in the 50's.

The performance of Gene Kelly in the song ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a treat to watch and is now considered iconic. The other roles have also been executed perfectly most notably the performance of a vain and talent-less star by Jean Hagen.Although the depiction of the motion picture industry could not have been less accurate, Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly's exuberant tap-dancing bravado combined with a paramount anthology makes this movie a must watch."

","Reflecting state-of-the-art quality in every filmmaking aspect, jam-packed with wonderful songs, amazing choreography & exquisite use of humour, and depicting the often frustrating process of getting accustomed to something completely new, Singin' in the Rain is the story of a silent film production company which, along with its cast, makes a difficult transition to sound.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm not really a fan of musicals. In fact, I despise live-action musicals but this film has so much charm, charisma & laughter that it manages to make itself work extremely well for the majority of its runtime. Directed by Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, the film is a hilarious ride from start to finish & puts on screen some of the most exhausting dance sequences ever filmed.<br/><br/>The technical aspects deserve a mention too as cinematography includes many moments of long single-takes, fluid camera movements & perfectly captured shots, editing concisely paces the whole story without ever letting any boredom to set in, although that Broadway sequence did feel out of place & unnecessary to me. And last but not the least, many of its songs are instantly catchy & memorable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds & Jean Hagen, and although Gene & Debbie no doubt share a great on-screen chemistry here, it's Donald O'Connor who ends up impressing the most for he was an absolute show-stealer in every scene and his highly energetic performance easily overshadowed everything else, including Gene Kelly's magnetic work both on & off the screen.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Singin' in the Rain is hailed by many as the greatest musical to come out from Hollywood & I wholeheartedly agree. It certainly has every ingredient that makes a movie great & despite my initial lack of excitement or expectations, it turned out to be such an incredibly fun, hilarious & enjoyable cinematic ride that I'm going to cherish it for a long time.

Every once in awhile, it's nice to have a reliable and unconflicted deuteragonist (the side kick or best friend character) behind the protagonist. Donald O'Connor turns in a remarkable performance, with several solo dances.<br/><br/>The film is so self-referential that the fourth wall is sort of perpetually broken throughout. I'm not certain if they ever actually commit to it.<br/><br/>But when Cosmo (who fills in as a screenwriter, audio recording jockey, etc. throughout) takes over for the conductor at the end of the film, it's a pretty direct nod to the audience that everything is off the rails.<br/><br/>He cracks some of the best jokes, and is the source of the majority of the humor.<br/><br/>At one point Don and Cosmo are speaking with the studio head.

Can I have it back?""<br/><br/>It wasn't his cigar to begin with! Hilarious, right?<br/><br/>To conclude this glowing review, I'll end with a quote from Don while he courts Kathy.

","Singing in the Rain is one of America's most iconic musicals. It captures audience through a mix of music, comedy, and a story we all can appreciate.

As a motion picture the movie truly portrays the idea that musicals don't just be long on Broadway and in the theater industry but there is also a sufficient place for them in Hollywood. I'm hard pressed to picture the on stage performance of singing in the rain being as good as the movie. The sound, color, and lighting aspects of the movie would be hard to replicate and even harder for audiences to recognize and enjoy if it were preformed live. Through use of film technology producers of singing in the rain proved that the ability to edit, use artificial light, and manipulate sound quality has advantages in more than just the average film genera's of that time. Aside from being an benchmark for musical film singing in the rain has a social significance about the underdog presented in a comedic manner. ""Stage Actress"" Kathy is a dancer who comes into contact with famous silent film actor Don Lockwood. He exposes her talent to his studio and because sound is being incorporated in films they request to use her voice dub over the horrendous voice of Don's co-star and avid admirer Lina Lamont, another famous silent film actor. Over the course of the film Lamont attempts to sabotage the relationship Lockwood and Kathy are developing while she fights to save her acting career intolerable voice.

","There are a lot of good things to say about this movie, the acting and characters, the colorful set and costumes, and of course the musical numbers. Being that I am a big musical fan I thought this movie was amazing and fun. Some people may find that when characters break out in song in the middle of a conversation it is unrealistic and weird, but that's exactly it! It is unrealistic and that is what makes it so much fun, it takes you into another world, one not like our own. It isn't real life and you can get lost in this world on the screen. Singin in the Rain is no different, while watching this movie it is hard not to get absorbed in the story, and you find yourself smiling and tapping your foot along to the music. A lot of the musical numbers are up beat and playful like ""Make them Laugh"" ""Good Morning"" and of course the famous ""Singin in the Rain"" Not only were the musical numbers great to listen to but they were amazing to watch, the color really popped off the screen. This movie was made with Technicolor and this was still new to the audience because a lot of movies were still being made in black and white at this time. So Singin in the Rain really took advantage of filming in color by making the sets full of color, and having very vibrant costumes.

","When I was much younger, I remember watching the first twenty minutes or so of this movie. Since then, my Dad would constantly make references to this movie, but because I never actually saw the whole thing, I didn't recognize where they were from until I saw it for my movie class a few weeks ago. I absolutely fell in love with it. I will admit, it was the first movie that we watched in class that I genuinely enjoyed, through and through. The music was perfect, the color was great, the acting was amazing, and the jokes were hilarious. The jokes are what really got me to love this movie. I'm almost always in the mood for a comedy, and wow....the whole class was laughing louder than I'd ever heard, and I was going right along with them. Overall, I would say that it was a nearly perfect musical."

","A film like Singin' in the Rain has such an iconic status for many reasons. The camera work is stunning, the directing is excellent, but what takes the cake are the actors and their choreography for the intricate musical numbers. I was blown away at how they moved so quickly and so elegantly. The film is also full of memorable moments, and the song where the title comes from was something special. It is because of this film that I became a fan of musicals, it is just that good. It truly is an iconic piece of American cinema, and you are doing yourself an injustice by not watching it at least once. Even if you are the manliest man in the land, there is a chance that you might enjoy this film, because it truly is that spectacular."

","Usually I'm never in the mood to watch a musical movie beside West side Story, but I must say Singing in The Rain caught me off guard. From the beginning I thought it was so funny and that was consistent all throughout the movie. Not only was the singing fun to watch but the dancing with also great. The movie looked so uniformed that it looked like a few long takes, and some dolly shots.There are so many scene where even the background adds to the visual performance. One of the most important things in this movie was bright colors. Prior to this movie color film wasn't around for that long, and too see how colorful the movie was and nice lite there is no wonder why this is one of the best visually looking films."

","I call this film not just a musical because it is so much more than that. It has its musical moment, but it takes the viewers through a big part of history in film. Actually the film tells you the way musicals were created and not through some musical piece to show it.<br/><br/>The actual story of this film is when sound came to movies... what a great invention to the film industry. Not everyone said that when it was created and became a needed thing for film not wanted. So the studios that have sound will be more popular what about the others. Well the film takes you through the struggles of adapting to sound and since it wasn't exactly a success at first something needed to be done.<br/><br/>The musical isn't just about singing in the rain it creates a whole different story about a famous actor who thinks he can act as a silent actor but is challenged when he has to use his actual voice. Also is challenged by a woman who said he isn't a real actor without sound, which begins a little love story that brings the audience through the back doors of Hollywood. Of course there are musical moments but it does help give the film a better atmosphere for the film and keep it up and a more positive setting for viewers."

","This movie has so many enchanting aspects from the charming witty humor, to the colorful abstractions and an adorable love story. This is one of my favorite films not only because it is a musical and I love stories told through song, but because it was one of the first movies to really experiment with abstract representations of what a character was going through, up until this time things seem so black and white (literally) but we have this song expressed in color and motion and shapes and even though it is not realistic in any way, the scene brings its point across to the audience ushering in a new wave of cinematography to play with inspiring lots of more unconventional approaches to story communication."

","I was never a fan of musicals, and did not have any desire to see this movie. However, once it started, I was hooked. Every aspect of this film was wonderful. Between the chemistry and quirkiness of the cast, there is no way anyone could not enjoy it. There was a perfect amount of seriousness offset by a lot of humor. Also, the bright colors really stuck out and made this film ten times better. The whole set in general was really outstanding. For the time it was made, I felt that the props and settings for all of the scenes were magnificent and ahead of its time.

","Hi, my name is Nick Altomare and recently I watched Singing in the Rain in my history of American cinema class at Hudson valley community college. This was the first comedy musical I ever watched. And I loved it. The use of dancing, singing and comedy is very entertaining. All the actors are professional and exhibit their skills very well. I like how this film was made and incorporates lots of different scenarios and scenes. The use of cameras at pre-determined locations makes for a steady flow and up close and personal feel.

It's a beautifully shot, beautifully choreographed film with tons of humor and warmth.<br/><br/>It's the cinematic equivalent of a bowl of chocolate ice cream; no matter how upset or tired you may be, this film will always perk you up. I cannot think of much else to say, because many more eloquent than I have analyzed this picture to the moon. But whether you dig film criticism or no, you're bound to love Singin' in the Rain."

","Given how much I love musicals, I really shouldn't have been surprised I dug this movie. Call it snobbery, but I rather was! I've had opportunities in the past to watch this before I actually sat down and did. That's years lost where I could have been rewatching!<br/><br/>This movie has everything I like in a musical. Incredible singing, and dance numbers that tie in beautifully to the plot being the chief thing I look for. I like the music numbers to mean something, and here they did. I found my face on the verge of breaking from how hard I was smiling and as soon as I finished the film, I was on youtube rewatching my favorite scenes. <br/><br/>I fell completely in love with the three lead characters and their relationships to one another. They are your classic story telling triumvirate, each adding something to the puzzle that the others couldn't. Good Morning was my favorite, not because of the song itself, but because I got to see these three let loose together and have fun. <br/><br/>It goes without saying how absolutely stunning the visuals were. The colors blew me away and the only film today that I think comes close to its beauty is Moulin Rouge. This film though had the room to play around with so much more color wise given how it was right on the edge of when color films were becoming the norm making it really stand out.<br/><br/>I'd rec this to anybody who loves musicals or feel good films. So glad I finally saw this."

","Singin in the Rain was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am 100% a musical person and they started the first ever musical out with a bang. Not only were the songs excellent but the acting was that much better. Obviously Don and Kathy's characters were portrayed excellently but I thought the actor that portrayed Cosmo Brown absolutely stole the entire movie. Him singing Make Em Laugh was the best part of the entire movie. I also thought that the actress that portrayed Lina did a great job or portraying a ditzy Hollywood lady (and I hope she isn't like that in real life!) Overall I thought this movie was fantastic and I can't wait to watch it again."

","I absolutely loved this film! The color was so vibrant and it added so much to the film because it helped make things over the top, as only musicals can do. The music was fantastic and the tap dancing (though a little too much at times) was also great! As a choir nerd myself, I love musicals of all kind and I had not seen this, but it was so much fun! I definitely found myself humming some of these tunes later through the week. The story was perfect for a musical, it was lighthearted and fun and you still had a bit of a problem to resolve, but nothing that couldn't be solved with music. The characters were all likable except for the really annoying Lina, played by Jean Hagen, who did a great job. The friendship between Cosmo and Don is palpable and the romance between Don and Kathy is sweet and both of these relationships add to the feel-good feel of the movie as a whole. The humor was also there, and though at times it was a bit cheesy it was part of what made the movie memorable. Perhaps not the best of films in other people's book, but it's a 10 in min."

","Ah, this movie. It makes me miss tap and ballroom dancing. I haven't seen it in ages, and I absolutely could have sworn that it was black and white, but I'm rather glad that it wasn't, as the color was amazing. A little over the top at some parts but, I understand that they're showing off a bit. However, I honestly don't think it'd be quite as spectacular if it weren't in color. Aside from the work of the camera around the choreography, I can't say I specifically like the filmmaking itself. But, I did enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>It's everything a musical should be: funny, witty, universally enjoyable story, historical context, and of course great songs. That's one of the reasons that I think musicals like this are so well remembered, because of the songs. They just stick in your head. I've always had a bit of a problem with movie musicals (90% of the time I'd rather see them on stage) but there's something about the ones from the early 50s that are just great, this one included."

When I see the film, I really believe that I would want to get into the beat and sing my heart out. I also like the way the actors did the dances, because they had to be choreographed nicely, and that was exactly what happened. The best part about the movie was when it was near the end. I love the way Don and Kathy did the last song of the film. Also, the last scene with the poster was very nice. I love the way the poster was done, and when I saw Don and Kathy kissing in the end, I loved it so much. Overall, this film is one of the best movies that I have ever seen!"

","Catchy songs, beautiful choreography, and a great cast to boot, Singin' in the Rain is by far a gem of it's time. Gene Kelly kills as Don and his teeth are so white! The romance in the film feels natural and real, and gives me plenty of warm-fuzzy feelings. Jean Hagen shines as a would-be antagonist, hilarious and beautiful and infuriating all at once. Together they form a colorful cast of characters, made for the big screen. The Technicolor of the film is stunning and brilliant. Despite some plot loopholes (Couldn't Lina still sue at the end?) I still thoroughly enjoyed this production. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of musical films."

","SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is quite possibly my favourite musical of all time, a glorious and sublime experience in movie-making which shines with sheer exuberance and, it has to be said, brilliance. Nobody puts a foot wrong - literally - in this colourful, song-packed outing which really offers career-best turns from the cast.<br/><br/>Of course, the film belongs to Gene Kelly, whose professionalism towers above all. The titular sequence is highly memorable, but then so are many others, and none of them a disappointment. This is the kind of musical you can't watch without your foot tapping away, the sort of film that Hollywood producers try to hark back to but fail miserably because they truly don't make 'em like this anymore.<br/><br/>The likes of Jackie Chan and other martial arts performers have cited Gene Kelly as a major influence on their work and it's clear to see how; the way Kelly moves, turns, and interacts with props, other performers, and scenery is just flawless. Even better, in some ways, is Donald O'Connor's solo number in which he performs the wall somersaults with dizzying splendour. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is the sort of film that finishes leaving you with the feeling like you want to watch it all over again."

"StevePulaski","10","0","2","4 November 2013"," What else can it do but make you laugh?
","I have a nudging feeling that Singin' in the Rain has gotten the reputation of being overly-corny and shamelessly frothy with age and those accusations have unfortunately lessened the impact of the picture. The film is very obvious in its emotions and obnoxiously sunny in its disposition and tone (don't consider these flaws or criticisms), but it's also a picture to laud for the professionalism of its cast and the inanely addicting melodies of its song and dance numbers.<br/><br/>The film concerns Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a popular and egotistical silent film star who is now feeling the switch from silent film to ""talkies,"" films that have actual sound. Lockword often works with his cheery and humorous friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) as well as the shallow and often incorrigible Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) in his films. After the success of 1927's The Jazz Singer (the first film with sound), Lockwood and Lamont's next picture, titled ""The Dueling Cavalier,"" is now a talkie but will need to overcome challenges. The most prominent challenge is Lamont's high-pitched, nearly-insufferable singing voice. Meanwhile, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an attractive and ambitious young actress. At first, they find each other to be irritating in their own ways. But Lockwood must learn to work with Kathy, once the crew discovers her presence may be necessary for the success of the project.<br/><br/>Such song and dance numbers from Singin' in the Rain need to be experienced and can't be done justice in a conversation or an analysis. If you've seen the film, would you rather discuss the hilarity of Cosmo's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number, involving the character zealously prancing around a stage, doing flips and crazy dances while singing perfectly on key, or view it for the umpteenth time? Would you rather analyze Don Lockwood's titular song and dance (while battling a high-fever and a bad cold), or would you rather see it again and maybe wonder how Kelly performed so well when he was so ill? Musicals are a challenge to review because no matter what words you use to describe it or how you about analyzing the picture and its musical numbers, you simply don't feel like you're doing justice to its quality. I often laud musicals very heavily on atmosphere, sets, and acting, and all of those features are unsurprisingly top-notch here. The element likely to be neglected here is the acting, as Singin' in the Rain feature many talented people performing in a way few could. Such performers needed to be of a certain quality and such actors needed to be up to the challenge of performing a dance with such militaristic precision and rigor.<br/><br/>To me, that's why Singin' in the Rain is the masterpiece that it is. The sets can only hurt your eyes with color for so long. The songs can only be fun to hum and sing for so long (I confess - I've been singing ""Moses Supposes"" for two weeks straight now and feel it ranks as one of the best songs ever in any musical that I have yet to see for its difficulty in pitch and tongue-twisting lyrics). What Singin' in the Rain has that secures its long term success is its outstanding cast of performers that, from the start, are committed to delivering material with such memorable, complex force. Never have I seen a musical so assisted and made successful based solely on the talent of its actors.<br/><br/>Starring: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Donald O'Connor. Directed by: Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen."
"FilmMuscle","9","0","1","23 September 2013"," The Audience are all singin' in the rain!
","Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserabl√©s being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. <br/><br/>Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clich√©d- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. <br/><br/>In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. <br/><br/>On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element."
"Heffernan99","8","0","1","10 August 2013"," Good humour by O'Connor, fabulous song sequences, Too many songs for the average person to enjoy.
","The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie."

The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners.

It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once."

You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message.

"katiehughes","10","0","2","10 May 2013"," An Overview
","Gene Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) has incredible cinematography, especially considering how early in the color era it was made. The whole movie has a very smooth, unedited feel, with long, smooth takes, especially in the dance numbers. It's almost as though the scenes were done in one take, as you would expect for a life-stage production of a musical! The acting by Jean Hagen (Lina) and Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) are my favorite parts of the film, however. They play such contrasting characters and each made their part so their own it's really something to see. Then you throw in the famous songs, ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Moses Supposes"" and ""Good Morning"", this musical is just fun waiting to be watched."

","I absolutely love musicals yet this was one I always heard about but never took the time to watch. I'm glad I finally saw it because I really enjoyed it. The music in it was amazing, I was humming the songs the entire day after watching. The dancing was phenomenal, obviously, with Gene Kelly being the star. The only complaint that I really had with this movie was the 15 minute dance routine that had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Visually it was stunning, but it was way too long. Other than that i loved every minute of it. It was extremely funny. I laughed multiple times during every scene. The comedic talent of all of the leads was amazing. I especially loved Jean Hagen's performance as Lina Lamont. She was the perfect villain. You really loved to hate her character. I really enjoyed this movie and cannot wait to watch it again."

","Honestly this was one of the most beautiful musicals I have ever seen. I would not consider myself a real musical fan but this was a very enjoyable movie. The colors and the imagery were brilliant, particularly one section had these amazing colors, as some sort of technicolor extravaganza that i thought had made a great scene. The acting is also top notch, with characters really coming to life. The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the plot was so ironically asinine it hurt. Now certainly in some ways it was a dig at the film industry but for the most part the plot of this movie was basically just designed to have a musical. Its a musical about being in a musical. Thats about as bad as it gets."

","Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 Arthur Freed Musical directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. Staring Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood and Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. I'm not a big musical person, but even i found myself enjoying this movie, of course i prefer the version of the title song used in A Clockwork Orange. It's a very fun movie to watch, even though it's incredibly corny and campy. Like most films of the time, there isn't a lot of camera work that stands out. There are a few shots that stuck with me, like the dream sequence of Don Lockwood's fantasy musical, and some of the early back story scenes, but all-in-all i won't look back on this movie for the camera angles. This movie brings its A- game in its music. The score for the movie is near perfect, with varying genres and perfectly executed choreography. I almost broke my foot trying to tap dance like Gene Kelly. Unfortunately, the quality of the dancing didn't transfer to the story. The story wasn't bad, i liked it, in fact i thought it had a pretty creative concept, but i was expecting a whole lot more coming from a movie which placed 5th on AFI's top 100 movies list. Still though, the movie succeeds, and not even all these flaws can stop the sun in my heart, cause i'm ready for love! 8/10"

","Singin' in the Rain has always been one of my favorite musicals. It is a automatic pick-me-up for me. The fun upbeat songs will instantly put you in a fabulous mood and the dancing makes you just want to get up and dance. Gene Kelly is so great in this movie, his character is hilarious and Kelly really brings him to life. The plot of the movie is really great too; there is never a dull moment in the film. Another things that really adds to this movie is all the bright colors. Everything in this movie is bright: the set, the costumes, even the makeup was a little on the bright side but I absolutely love it. I might be a little bias since I love musicals but I think for someone who does not like musicals this would be a great one to ease into, just because of its humor and happy messages."
"kylebristol12","10","0","2","24 April 2013"," ""Make 'Em Laugh!""
","""Singin' in the Rain"" is part musical, part comedy, and part romance, but it is always all of these things at the same time. The story follows Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a famous silent movie star, and his friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) as they brace for Hollywood's transition into the Age of Sound. This period in film history serves only as a backdrop for one of the most lavish films ever made. In addition to the comedy, what makes ""Singin' in the Rain"" so memorable is the dance numbers. Watching O'Connor flail around during ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is hilarious and nerve-wracking at the same time, and Gene Kelly's infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" epitomizes the film's spirit.<br/><br/>The ""Broadway Melody"" sequence that Gene Kelly pitches to producers toward the end of the film is often cited as a flaw for slowing the film's pace. This is just wrong. If the sequence had been omitted or cut in any way, the film would be less brilliant for it. Every aspect of this scene is a work of technical genius. Watching Kelly and dancer Cyd Charisse move across the pastel pink background, Charisse's sash blowing around her with amazing flourish, is one of the most incredible experiences I've had watching a movie. <br/><br/>""Singin' in the Rain"" is a perfect example of that kind of great film that unites its audience through pure, unfettered entertainment. It's loud, it's colorful, and it's funny as all hell. The film isn't just about love or the importance of doing the right thing, though it's characters are very much concerned with those things. The film itself - every song, every dance, every screaming fan chasing after Don Lockwood in his car - is about how movies can be magical experiences that remove us from our lives and force us to have fun for a little while. Even if we don't need it."

","I can tell why this movie is loved by so many people. Whether you like musicals or not, this movie is a whole lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie was perfect. The cinematography was excellent with many long fluid shots, the transitions between scenes were great, the story line was amazing, but the actors definitely take the cake for most spectacular. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds were fantastic in their performances. As triple threats, they both shine in singing, dancing, and acting, making it a truly enjoyable film to watch. However, my absolute favorite part of this film was Donald O'Connor. ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is easily one of the best scenes in the film. His ability to make singing and dancing look effortless is super impressive and makes for an unforgettable performance. After seeing him in this, I looked up what other films he was in so I could potentially watch them. This movies only flaw was the awkwardly place dance number towards the end of the film. You know the one...<br/><br/>As a big lover of live-action musicals, I really loved watching this. I enjoyed every second of it and plan on watching it many more times. I highly recommend this to anyone, regardless of ones movie taste. It's a really feel good movie that will make you smile and laugh. Excellent film!"

","This film was actually very good. I'm not a real fan of musicals but I actually enjoyed watching this one due to the time period and the color clarity. I'm not sure why but this film seemed very bright in color and the picture quality was very clear even during dark scenes such as when Don Lockwood was literally singing in the rain after he dropped off Kathy Selden at her house. I also found it to be very comical like during the scene where Don and Cosmo were messing around with the speech therapist helping Don. Overall I found Cosmo to be the funniest character in the whole film. He was very likable and cracked so many jokes that it was impossible to not find him funny. The sound was very good in this movie too, I actually find it kind of ironic that it is a movie about actors filming movies and learning how to speak in their films. You could hear how bad the sound quality was when they were trying to record Lina Lamonts voice for her film. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I believe it's the first time I've ever enjoyed a musical."

Such a great story and an incredible cast of characters just full of charisma. Don Lockwood played by Gene Kelly is a great main character and a very likable fella throughout the film as the events of his acting career unfold before the viewer. Cosmo was my favorite charter though and I'm sure many other would agree he plays the perfect part of comic relief without overdoing it. The movie is full of good laughs and heartwarming moments that anyone with a soul could enjoy (unless you are evil) and is a very memorable film. The use of color in this film is also very impressive and artistic in many scenes I really enjoyed the creative merging of color into black and white plus the vibrant clothing and props used.

","This was a really enjoyable movie, funny and with good characters. It wasn't at all what I imagined the plot to be. It was actually a lot more interesting. In Disney or Universal when I was probably 5, I have a picture of me taken under an umbrella next to a streetlight, with a background like in this movie. So I've always known that the movie contained a scene like that were they sang a song called, ""Singin' In The Rain"". I figured that would be the most memorable scene, but actually for me, it was the ""Make Them Laugh"" sequence performed by Donald O'Connor. I really liked how it was choreographed. Donald and Jean Hagen were my favorite actors in this film. The only part of this movie that confused me and I think it could have done without was the whole ""Gotta Dance"" sequence. It was really out of place and unnecessary. Or at the very least, too long. Maybe if they shortened it by like 5 minutes it would have been better. But that's the only thing I didn't like about it."

","Singing in the Rain falls in the genre of Romance and comedy. The musical is about a movie star Don Lockwood who was based in theatre and Vaudeville comedy before he got a lucky break and made it large. He meets an aspiring actress Kathy Selden and is drawn to her because of her forthrightness in her critique of his acting skills and later, falls in love with her. In order to make the rather difficult transition from silent movies to talkies, Don's production house needs to think out of the box as his co-superstar Lina Lamont is unable to adjust to the change. With the aid of Cosmo, his best friend who has been with him from the very start, and Kathy, the production house is able to turn an unsuccessful talkie into a buoyant musical.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie lies in the effervescent portrayal of the main characters. Don's 'dignified' flashback sequence, an enchanting and bittersweet love affair with the theatre, sets the tone for the movie. As the movie goes on, one cannot help but fall in love with the characters and the delectable manner in which the dialogue is constructed among them. Be it Don mocking Kathy at the after premiere party, his charming confession that leaves Kathy blushing or Lina threatening to sue Monumental, the acting is so genuine that the viewer is engaged all the time. Glimpses of how Hollywood works behind the scene adds to the exciting feeling of going to the movies in order to be charmed.<br/><br/>Gene Kelly portrays a superstar in this movie and certainly acts like one. He is brilliant in his role as the protagonist and puts in a charismatic performance. Donald O'Connor and Debie Reynolds are both adorable in the movie. Their inspired camaraderie and attempts to cheer Don up in times of trouble are beautifully done. Cosmo adds the spark to the scenes that liven them up and make them endearing. Kathy's innocence and impeccable affection for Don is charming. Jean Hagen is wonderful in her portrayal of Lina Lamont. In scenes with the diction coach, on set of the new talkie, her scheming to get rid of Kathy and the final premiere of the movie, she evokes such a wide array of emotions. You feel pity for her cacophonous voice at one time and loathe her for her nefarious plotting at the end.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie lies in its musical numbers and sequences: Make em laugh, Singing in the Rain, Good Morning, Beautiful girl, Moses Supposes, Broadway Melody. All of them are sprightly and refreshing. Each of these numbers is an awe-inspiring and captivating work in itself. They portray unfettered emotions capturing joy, surprise, love and hope.<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie, I felt as if a spell had been cast on me that left me enchanted. Musicals can have this effect and Singing in the Rain is definitely one of the best that I've seen."
"weezeralfalfa","10","0","2","21 February 2013"," a review of how this film fits into the careers of the stars.
","You don't need a 500+ person to tell you that this film is a classic in terms of the abundance and quality of the music, dancing and comedy, So, I'd like to fill my space with insights into the stars' overall relations and how certain key performances relate to their previous and subsequent films.<br/><br/>It's the only film that paired two of the greatest male musical comedy entertainers of that era: Gene Kelly and Don O'Connor. We might wonder why they weren't paired again? Although Gene was a well established MGM star, this was Don's first musical outside his home studio of Universal. He would do another MGM musical the next year: ""I Love Melvin"". Debbie Reynolds again was the romantic lead. Clearly, this film was not given the royal treatment of the present film and is much shorter. But, it gives us an opportunity to see what Don and Debbie could do without Gene and Cyd(quite a lot of fun,too!) Reportedly, working with Gene on the present film was rather a traumatic experience for both Don and Debbie, especially the latter. Gene's extreme perfectionism and egoism was legendary. Nonetheless, nearly all his costars, especially Debbie, improved their dancing and acting by working with him. However, neither Don nor Debbie was anxious to do another film with Gene, and neither did.<br/><br/>Debbie was actually an anomaly in Gene's '50s musical comedies. In every other of his last 5 Hollywood musicals beginning in '51, his first choice as his leading lady and main female dance partner was Cyd Charisse. Cyd had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, mostly as a cameo dance specialist. Gene wanted her to costar in ""An American in Paris"" the previous year, but a pregnancy ruled that out. Of course, she was a conspicuous dance specialist in the present film. She was his leading lady in the much less commercially successful ""Brigadoon"" and ""It's Always Fair Weather"", but declined this role in Gene's last Hollywood musical: ""Les Girls"", as did ""An American in Paris"" costar Leslie Caron. I think they rightly smelled a turkey.<br/><br/>I'd like to talk about Don's famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" solo performance, having seen nearly all his Hollywood musicals. Although there are certainly original features to this madcap performance, you might be interested to know that a number of the main features can be recognized in several of his previous Universal films, from '45-'51. Thus, in ""Top Man"", Don and Peggy Ryan dance with cloth dummies in one scene. In ""Something in the Wind"", he does the bit behind the couch, although without the dummy.In ""Feudin', Fightin'and Fussin'"", he does the terminal plunge through a papery wall after dancing. In ""Double Crossbones"", we see his jumping up on a wall, followed by a backwards flip. Even the tune was essentially recycled from the ""Be a Clown"" Gene Kelly-Judy Garland performance in ""The Pirate""<br/><br/>Having also seen nearly all of Gene's Hollywood musical comedies, I'd like to comment on the relation of some of his past and future performances to this film. Back in '44, he costarred in a color film with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers, called ""Cover Girl"". Several features of that film have often lead to it being dubbed 'the poor man's ""Singing in the Rain' "". Phil takes the place of Don, as the odd man out in the central romance, but nonetheless an intimate friend of the romantic couple. Rita takes the place of Debbie, being a stage dancer and singer. This threesome do a street dance of joy, sometimes arm in arm, twice, including the parting scene. This somewhat resembles the ""Good Morning"" and threesome ""Singing in the Rain"" scenes in the present film. Also, Gene does a solo street dance with his shadow, somewhat foreshadowing his ""Singing in the Rain"" solo street dance in this film. However, there is a critical mood difference. That 'Alter-Ego' dance was inspired by frustration and apprehension about his future relationship with Rita's character, not by the elation of a new found love, as in the present film.<br/><br/>As regards his future films, we see Gene's joyful ""Singing in the Rain"" solo as a model for functionally equivalent solos in his next two musicals: ""It's Always Fair Weather"" and ""Brigadoon"", in the form of the ""I Like Myself"" and ""Almost Like Being in Love"" dances. I find the former performance, done on roller skates, his most challenging and interesting dance. Don, who didn't do solo dances in this context in his prior Universal musicals, did a functionally similar new love-inspired performance in the first portion of his long ""I Wanna Wander"" performance in MGM's ""I Love Melvin"", and his classy ""A Man Chases a Girl"" dance performance in Fox's ""There's No Business Like Show Business"". His equivalent solo dance in Fox's ""Call Me Madam"" was, like Gene's previous dances in ""Cover Girl"" and ""On the Town"", born out of romantic frustration, but seemed like a dance of enthusiasm, because he got drunk from his frustration! Even MGM's Fred Astaire got in on this trend with his classic new love -inspired ceiling and wall ""You're All the World to Me"" dance in ""Royal Wedding"", the previous year, and his solo ""Seeing is Believing"" levitation dance on a high building in ""The Belle of New York"", released the same year as ""Singing in the Rain"", and unfortunately overshadowed by it."

One of my favorite scenes was the dreamlike one in which the woman with the very long white dress flowing danced and the man danced around her and her dress, the camera movements and the choreography not just in that scene but the entire film were awe inspiring. It made you feel like a kid, kind of brought out that sappy youthfulness which was alright.

"alejandrothedirector","10","0","2","13 November 2012"," One of my favorite movie musicals!
","I was never a big fan of musicals as a kid. They often lagged forever and I never really listened to the lyrics. I got very bored, very fast. Then in my junior year of high school, my friends pushed me at the last minute to audition for my school's production of Cabaret and I ended up getting a small role. I started to fall in love with the genre and the following year, I landed the male lead (Professor Henry Higgins) in their production of a show that's considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady. The experience changed me and really made me appreciate the process that goes into making one.<br/><br/>The first time I watched ""Singin' in the Rain"" was for an assignment. I could not believe what I had been missing. Everyone knows the famous title sequence where Gene Kelly, Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds are walking towards the camera in yellow slickers and holding umbrellas as well as singing the title song. This may seem cheesy for many and may be a huge turn off if all you know about the film is this and Gene Kelly's infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" number. It's so iconic that I practically walked into the scene when I went on The Great Movie Ride in Disneyworld. This is the musical that works for people who aren't even a big fans of musicals.<br/><br/>What is it that makes this film so great? The level of talent that the three leads possessed back then is more than the biggest stars in Hollywood today. Gene Kelly plays the likable and charming Don Lockwood in a role that was basically made for him. He effortlessly makes song and dance look like anyone can do it, but Kelly has been dancing since childhood. He is not a show off however; the first thing I wanted to do (and I'm sure everyone wants to do but never actually does) after seeing the film is sign up for tap dancing lessons. He and Donald O' Connor make dancing look like it's the greatest job in the world, such as in their ""Moses Supposes"" number. O' Connor provides a lot of comic relief and is a likable personality all his own. Many people underestimate his big ""Make Em' Laugh"" song which is one of the better numbers in the film.<br/><br/>This brings me to my next point: there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. I'll repeat that: there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Each number with it's fusion of song, dance and innovative creativity is never boring to watch. The same rules apply for the scenes, Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen have created several little witty moments and gags which are associated with the genre of musicals. The big rule with musicals is that you have to accept how unrealistic they are and Singin' in the Rain is no exception but even so, most audiences will embrace this. For example, the unscripted facial expressions of Cosmo Brown. Big kudos also go to actress Jean Hagen who plays the villainess Lina Lamont. Although an unlikable character, Hagen succeeds at making her very humorous.<br/><br/>There's a reason this film is considered to be one of the greatest of all time, but to understand the magic of why it is you'll have to see it for yourself."

I don really like musicals, especially modern ones (like the TV show glee), but Singin' in the Rain is different and I don't really think of it as musical (yes I know it is).

The scene when Donald O'Connor dances in the rain, a beautiful scene. Gene Kelly is unbelievably talented, never realized he was a director, along with being an incredible dancer and actor. The photographer did a great job at capturing the color within each scene, although the singing in the rain scene had little color, the color that was present seemed to glow with exponential value.

I loved the dance that Donald O'Connor did in the beginning, it was an awesome stunt piece dance that had a very Charlie Chaplin style to it. The chemistry between Kelly and O'Connor was awesome, I was very convinced and amused the whole time. I thought that Reynolds and Kelly had a lot of good chemistry even though they didn't have much of a good relationship off set. I thought also for not being a dancer Reynolds was awesome!"

","Singin' in the Rain, 1952<br/><br/>Let me begin this by saying I'm not into musicals. I don't care for watching dancing in film or listening to gleeful songs throughout movies. I get bored by this easily, and often I feel like the songs unnecessarily drag on. That being said, Singin' in the Rain is my exception.<br/><br/>In this up tempo, feel-good musical film about the transition from Old to New Hollywood, leading man Gene Kelly puts on an absolutely incredible performance. It's hard to believe that Kelly performed that unforgettable title number (""Singin in the Rain"", obviously) in the midst of a 103 degree fever. Donald O'Connor also gives an outstanding and comical performance, while also giving us some memorable numbers. And Debbie Reynolds...Who could imagine that the beautiful starlet who put on such a show throughout the film with her wonderful voice, had been quoted years later saying this had been the most difficult experience in her life aside from surviving childbirth? Well, she was no dancer. But it's so easy to look past that in this incredible movie. I found myself rooting for her character the whole time, in spite of that nasty, annoying Lina Lamont lady (Jean Hagen). <br/><br/>But it was much more than just the acting, singing, and dancing that made this movie what it really is. The gorgeous, well-crafted sets of Old Hollywood, the Monumental Pictures studio, the rainy city street, etc. are just phenomenally done and simply cannot go unnoticed while watching this. And my favorite aspect to this film, possibly, is the amazing color. The brightness and vividness that emits from the picture while watching it is just superb. It really makes the film that much more enjoyable to view. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Once again, I repeat that I am not a fan of musicals. But this certainly is an exception. This movie is just great.

","This was one of the best films I had seen in a while. The combination of bright color, diversity of characters, and the array of talented singers and dancers made it a fun and comical production. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) was my favorite of the characters. Hit witty comments and hilarious performance of ""Make Them Laugh"" made him standout although he technically wasn't a main character. The budding romance of Don and Kathy can be seen from the very beginning as a sort of Screwball Comedy way of making them poke fun of each other at first but slowly put aside their differences and fall in love. I loved how, especially in the beginning, they sort of make fun of the materialistic norms of Hollywood. The public's obsession with ""power couples"" and the idea of Lockwood and Lamont as a household name. But as the movie goes on Don starts to lose interest in following the Hollywood norms and becomes more interested in giving the love of his life, Kathy Seldon, some credit for her amazing talents as an actress and singer."

","Singing in the Rain definitely met every expectation I had and then some. I hadn't heard much about the movie, but the name was very familiar and anything I had heard about the movie was very positive. In the beginning it was a little slow, but as soon as the singing and the dancing started I couldn't not stop smiling, I enjoyed every moment of it. The color of course was amazing, especially compared to all the black and white movies I have been seeing. But the talent of the actors is what makes this movie. Gene Lockwood and Donald O'Connor are a great pair together as they dance many duets, never missing a beat and always staying on key. I found their tap dancing to be amazing. The singing also blew me away; Gene Lockwood Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are triple threats as the acted, sung, and danced their hearts out. I never thought I would enjoy a musical and was kind of nervous to have to review this movie, but I must say this has to be one of the best movies I have ever see, it really blows me away.

","Singin' in the Rain is by far my favorite musical of all times. it's just one of those movies you could watch over and over. it does have some of my favorite musical numbers including ""fit as a fiddle"" and ""in the morning"" just to name a couple. i really like all of the acting, and i am really impressed by Jean Hagens role as Lina Lemont, the most annoying silent actress you will ever hear, there is definitely a reason she is a SILENT actress. and of course Gene Kelly is awesome as always, he is a very talented guy in his acting, dancing AND singing. and all around a very suave, likable guy. and I've just found a commercial using the famous singing in the rain scene in an ad for a Volkswagen GTI (one of my favorite cars), so that's just another reason for me to love this movie all the more."

","I enjoyed this film. Its very lighthearted and fun, providing 100 minutes of non-stop entertainment. The film also surpassed my expectations, because I generally do not like old films and comedies. But this one keep me entertained during it's whole run.<br/><br/>The film's plot takes place during the transition from silent films to talking pictures, the protagonist is a successful Hollywood actor who meets an upstart. Later the two fall in love, in a traditional clich√É¬©. However, the film is not locked in the plot, which instead serves only as a scaffold to place the many spectacular musical pieces of the film. So the lack of originality and complexity in the plot or in terms of the main characters do not hurt the film as much as it could.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this musical is highly enjoyable for all audiences despite the fact it is a 60 year old film. It held well with time, differently from Casablanca, for instance, which I found rather mediocre."
"tony-wigfall55","10","0","2","6 September 2012"," My second all time favourite film
","I don't think I have the words to describe how wonderful this film is. It starts off being a parody of silent film and then looks at the transition into talkies. There is some semblance of truth to this as there are reports out there where either studio bosses or directors are reported to have said "" so and so can speak"". Donald O'Connor gives his best ever performance I think in this film and the quality of the whole team just shines through. I saw this first many years ago and have watched it many times since and it does not lose that magic that denotes a great film. The great moment of course is the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence which is just magnificent but then the denouement at the end where ""Cathy"" is revealed as the singer is just joyous. Sit down relax and enjoy. This is movie making at its absolute best!"

","This is movie magic, now I don't particularly like musicals. But this is one of the great ones with some great and memorable musical numbers. The singing and dancing is spot on and it's a real treat to watch. Just about ever scene in this movie is memorable. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in the theater today thanks to TCM. There was a lot of old couples and their daughter in the theater and it was nice to enjoy this movie with the older audiences. It sort of felt like I traveled back in time to the 50's for 2 hours. Gene Kelly is just amazing and has the right to be called the triple threat, he can dance, he can sing and he can act. Well more so in the first two areas. Donald O'Connor brings so much energy to this movie. Debbie Reynolds is just spot on in this and she is one of the few actresses I have respect for. The story is unique and fun, it's about a actor and actresses playing actor and actress and it's a musical within a musical. The humor in this is just sweet and yet it really works. It got me laughing a few times. This is a magical experience and it's a film that all film lovers should watch.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Musicals used to be one of the most popular Genres of all time with classic hits like Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Clamity Jane and Fiddler on the roof. But, like in every Genre, there is always one that rules the roost...<br/><br/>This is my review on Singing In The Rain.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this;<br/><br/>It's the roaring twenties and the silent era of film dominates public entertainment. At this time, Don Lockwood is the most famous man in the film industry staring in hundreds of popular silent films along side his love interest Lina Lamont. When the first ever talking picture is released, directors and producers are forced to leave the era behind and begin making ""talkies"". Things turn out for the worst when Don's first vocal film is a disaster which would lead to his downfall. However, his best friends Cosmo Brown and Kathy Selden decide to turn things around and persuade Don to transfer the film into a musical before the film ruins his career.<br/><br/>There's no other phrase for it; Singing in the rain is a masterpiece. Trying to pick faults in this film is like trying to pick faults in a perfect diamond- There is none!<br/><br/>So what makes the film so good?<br/><br/>Lets start with the acting. Acting legend Gene Kelly stars as the main character, Don, and his performance is WAY above average. This is the film that turned his career around and there is good reason for this. The way he smiles, the way he laughs- what ever he does you buy the character. His part is quite hard to play and Gene gets the emotions of the character spot on. He also is a fantastic singer, but I will get onto that later. However, while Gene is brilliant, the actor who steals the show is Donald O'Connor's Cosmo Brown. NEVER have I laughed so much at an actor's performance in all my life. There is not a man on earth who can play the part of Cosmo Brown like Donald. You often find yourself looking at I'm even when he is not speaking in case he is making some hysterical facial expression. How he never brakes into i cink of laughing is beyond comprehension, but Cosmo Brown has to be one of the greatest characters in movie history. Finally, Kathy Selden is played by the lovely Debbie Reynolds. Her performance is great, though there isn't as much to say about it as the two actors i mentioned above.<br/><br/>The plot is actually really good for a musical. Musicals are usually pretty basic films with light hearted plots, which is fine, but Singing in the rain delivers more than that. Singing in the rain is definitely great for young children as the plot is easy to follow and there is a lot of funny material in the film to keep them entertained. This is the film children should be watching instead of films that have adult material which children seem to like these days. The film is also great for casual viewers who love music and romance and if you are one of these people, you will be greatly impressed. The film, however, really stands out for die hard film fans as is has all the things above plus a little more. There are lots of references to films before it's time like Lovey Mary and even Citizen Kane. The man plot even revolves around The Jazz Singer, the very first talking film. They could have easily just said that the vocal films are coming into fashion, but this film takes it one step further and actually addresses the actual film that started it all which relates the film to the real world.<br/><br/>The film's greatest feature is it's musical numbers. The music in this film surpasses the music of the modern age by FAR. Each song is lively, innocent, funny and heartwarming and you actually feel the love and emotion that went into writing these marvellous songs. I am only going to address some of the songs cause I would rather you go into the film and be surprised. ""Make 'um laugh"" (sang by Donald) is the funniest song of the film, which really relates to the title. It consists of Donald pulling of a serious of stunts and I still cant fathom how he did them. You see him bouncing off wall and flirting with an old doll. Garenteed laugh. May favourite song in the whole film the theme song, Singing in the rain. Every time your hear the tune you are instantly prepared to have your heart filled with Joy at the brilliant lyrics. The love song by Gene, which is debatably his best scene in all his acting career. The icon of him hanging happily onto a lamppost is one of the most famous movie symbols of all time- and with good reason! <br/><br/>It's time to wrap the review up. Singing in the rain is so wonderful that words cannot sum it up in one single review. The romance is great, the songs are perfect, the plot is intriguing and the acting is amongst the best in history. This is the film i'll be watching again and again. This is the film I will be sharing with my children. This is one of the best movies ever made!<br/><br/>I'm definitely giving Singing in the rain a 10/10"

","I'm a huge Gene Kelly fan and I've loved this movie since i was a kid. I'm not particularly fond of musicals at all, but the plot in this one far outshines the fact they sing. The classic story of an evil lady trying to sabotage an innocent girl is almost always an entertaining story. The whole script was just so well written from every stage of the movie, from the flashbacks in the beginning, to the end, and even some of the song lyrics, every things perfect. What i love most about this movie is the fact that it blends comedy so well with the fact that its also a musical. First and foremost, it's a love story with twists and turns and such, and secondly, they sing. I mean, i have to admit some songs were catchy and the choreography was phenomenal, i just find most musicals something hard to relate to."

","First things first: it pains me to give this movie a good review. For years I have been adamantly against musical films, often considering them a sort of cop-out for a real film. I suppose this movie served as a sort of awakening. I went into the viewing with contempt, but was soon truly enveloped in the happenings on screen. Above all, I have to credit the movie's choreography. The musical acts and accompanying dance routines were so well thought out and deeply intricate, being unimpressed is an apparent impossibility. The songs both added emotion and also made the film a bit more lighthearted at times. Gene Kelly delivers a remarkable performance, as do his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds."

","I hate musicals! I absolutely can not stand them! I loathe them!<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is different though. Most importantly, it has music that I actually want to listen to. Most musicals are bogged down with love songs that I don't care to hear, or songs just written to elongate the running time. I never once said, ""Oh Jeeze, they're singing again?""<br/><br/>It's a clever concept that was done very well. It's like the Artist, but better! It was so cheerful and the colors blew my mind.<br/><br/>Even the dancing in most musicals is cringe worthy. In ""Singin'"", it actually inspired me to learn to dance. (For about a day, but those catchy songs were stuck in my head for at least two weeks after that.)<br/><br/>I could really get into musicals if they were all like this one. Please God, help man make more musicals like Singin' in the Rain."

","Let me start off by saying, I am not a big fan of musicals. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, and Grease as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment. With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain. I love it. It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again. Gene Kelly is simply too cool. He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance moves. Especially the bizarre,dance number at the end was Fantastic. Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works. He is sofunny. His Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today. He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes it all come together. It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one. I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow."

","Between 1930's and 1950's, musicals were considered the poison of the movie industry. This movie, however, was one of the best musicals released in the 20th century. This one included many feelings of happiness and compassion and was very entertaining to watch. With lots of color as well as some of the wits shown by some of the many characters, especially the end,this movie has lived up to the height and made it to the top of best movies of all time.

"dave13-1","9","0","2","30 April 2012"," Best musical ever. Thanks MGM.
","This movie was recently chosen by British critics as the best musical ever made, and not by accident. The song and dance numbers are elaborately staged and full of energy, the production design is gorgeous and everything looks colorful and lit up brightly in classic MGM fashion with lots of high key lighting effects. No detail was spared and no expense either, on costumes, set pieces. It just looks phenomenal. <br/><br/>Also - rare for a musical comedy - the plot is actually worthy of being followed. So many musicals have just enough plot to string the audience along between songs, but this one has a clever, funny story line that plunges briskly ahead, tracking the ups and downs of the coming of sound to the movies. It could have been done as a comedy without the songs and still been a great movie, and how many musicals can say that?<br/><br/>More than anything, though, the musical numbers actually fit into the emotional background of the story. Yes, cast members start singing or jigging and music appears from no discernible source - pretty standard for the era - but the numbers are a joyous expression of friendship, a means to express ideas, to mock, to revel in the moment. So many musicals have to contrive reasons to put in song and dance numbers, and sometimes don't even bother with logic and just throw them in anyway. Here, no musical number fails to fit logically or character-wise. <br/><br/>This movie is a triumph. Watch it once a year forever."
"richardlancemot","9","0","2","21 April 2012"," Loved this musical!
","This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.<br/><br/>Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.<br/><br/>Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like ""Singin' in the Rain."" There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (""She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!"") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (""Fit as a Fiddle,"" ""Good Mornin'"").<br/><br/>Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to ""You Were Meant for Me."" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.<br/><br/>Great stuff! If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it! PS: In the ""rent-this-too"" category, if you've seen and love ""Singin' in the Rain,"" check out ""The Band Wagon."" It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"

","Let me start out by saying that I absolutely loved his upbeat film! From the beginning, it is obvious that the underlying theme to this film is the ever-popular love story. However, Singin' in the Rain is a modern, colorful film with more to it. When their original movie that they are making goes down the drain, characters Dan and Cathy find a way to bring it to the top. Lena is downright dumb and hilarious at the same time. Her voice is anything but ordinary, which fits right in with this original movie. And so the film ends with the perfect demise of the enemy, Lena, and a show of modern dance, song and images.

The songs were great and the audio with the movie sounded crisp and clear. The shots were great especially during the songs because the photographer had to follow the dancers around which can be difficult to do smoothly. The photography excellence can be seen the best during the song ""Make 'em laugh"" where the camera follows the actor throughout the dance and as he jumps on top of a piano and such. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheery funny movie, even if you hate musicals you'll still enjoy ""Singing in the Rain"" it's just that great!"

","Singin' in the Rain takes us back to the late 1920s, when the film industry was abandoning silent films in favor of talkies. In a way I found this film informational because it does a very good job at describing what life was like for an actor back then. To many this film is known as one of the best musicals of its time, however I feel as if a lot of that has to do with time at witch is was released. Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly did a fantastic job at explaining the transformation of silent films to musicals, well after the genre had become established, but more than a decade before it began to run out of steam. It also was one of the few movies available at the time that used Technicolor, which in my opinion did a fantastic job at emphasizing every source of color in the film. These factors along with an excellent variety of characters, a number of interesting settings, and unique concept of showing the world the true Hollywood are what made this film so enjoyable."

","Well I'm not a fan of musicals, because as the movie goes on it becomes boring and irritating. However, this movie was a bit different, I actually enjoyed it. This was an old time musical which I expected to be boring and never to end. This movie wasn't like that all, it was full of vibrant colors, great comedy, and bold characters; which whom had versatile acts. I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to the very end. Everything just fell in place; I wasn't confused or stuck on what was happening. Like most musicals I watch, I become confuse and lost into what I'm watching. Maybe because I become so overwhelmed with the singing, I forget what's going on in the movie, Lol. Although this movie was a musical, I actually enjoyed it and thought all the songs that were sung were pretty catchy."
"NineFelines","9","0","2","2 April 2012"," Wow.
","Being somewhat ambivalent about musicals and having a general tendency not to watch movies which debuted before I was born, I had no real knowledge of this movie other than its existence. I also was only peripherally familiar with Technicolor and wasn't aware it was really any different than any other color film technology. Now that I have seen both, it is easy to understand why this movie is so famous.<br/><br/>Yes, to those of us who are less able to appreciate the intricacies of some of the extended dance scenes, they can seem too long, but this is a small criticism which is easily washed away by the deluge of all the other excellent qualities the movie possesses. The acting is, of course, superb, but I think I was struck most by how humorous and clever the writing is. The music and singing are also exceptional. Every time someone says ""Good morning!"", I am reminded of Debbie Reynolds' particular way of singing the words. The vibrancy of the color saturation due to the Technicolor process lends the movie an almost dream-like quality that fits so well, I cannot imagine it any other way. The camera work is so fluid it sometimes seems the actors are dancing with, not just for the camera. The costumes and sets are great and done is such a way that the movie has aged well; it doesn't seem to be a movie made over 60 years ago."

","Although I admittedly am not too big a fan of musicals, I was able to find plenty of entertainment in ""Singin' In The Rain"". The dancing was skillful and impressive to watch, and there were plenty of funny moments that kept me laughing and tied to the film. One of my favorite moments from the film is when Don Lockwood is talking about his past in show business, and he always says something that directly contradicts whatever comes up on the screen. There were plenty of other funny moments in the film that I enjoyed as well. The only complaint I would have about this film is that I thought that one of the musical bits was a little too long (The bit where Don describes his character's entrance to Broadway), but again, I usually end up walking away when ANY musical bits come on in other movies."

While watching it, it was alright but overall I did not really care for it. I cannot really place my finger on it, maybe I was not really all that interested in the dancing but something set me off to it. I really enjoyed Donald O'Connors role and I enjoyed his performance. It made me look him up and want to watch more movies with him in it, and to me? If a movie can provoke a person to watch something new and find some type of joy in it, than it did its job.

","How can you not consider Singin In The Rain to NOT be one of the best musical film that has ever been made, or ever will be made?? The three lead actors were absolutely fantastic, and perfectly cast. Gene Kelly never danced better, Debbie Reynolds gave one of her greatest and probably most underrated performances, and Donald O'Connor was never slicker and more witty. The chemistry between the three leads is perfect, Gene and Debbie exude growing love. You feel a REAL friendship between Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown. This chemistry is one of the reasons why this film works so well; can you see Howard Keel dancing in the rain as originally planned? Or someone else besides Debbie popping out of a cake. The music is the best and the dancing is SECOND TO NONE. The most famous obviously is Gene Kelly splashing around in puddles; and is the second most recognizable moment is screen history (first is Scarlett O'Hara's silhouette in front of Tara-with that classic score behind her.) I LOVE Debbie Reynolds, so I really enjoyed ""All I Do Is Dream Of You."" But my favorite number by far is ""Good Mornin'"" and this is why: it is the only number to include all three leads.<br/><br/>Can't get any better than this!"

","Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in ""The Nanny"" (1993).<br/><br/>Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film."

","I'll admit I'm biased against musicals; I just have a hard time suspending my disbelief when I see a group of people burst into pitch-perfect song and well-choreographed dance. I know, I know, I can willingly accept a movie that happened a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, but I can't accept a musical that takes place right here right now? Anyway, I happened upon it during a business trip, and with nothing better to do, I popped it into my DVD player and had my mind changed.<br/><br/>What I liked most about it were the musical numbers. As I watched them, they impressed me because these weren't simple numbers, and a lot of them featured extended takes, so kudos to the performers for making them so fun to watch.<br/><br/>I also like the humor in the film; I didn't know much about the film except that it was a musical, so would the non-musical parts be comedic, dramatic, tragic, what? I can tell that it was predominantly a comedy, although it had its dramatic moments. The funniest scene I remember took place when a silent film was being filmed, and it was a romantic scene, yet the actors in it were insulting each other, hilarious!<br/><br/>All in all, a nice family film to sit down to, my only complaint is that there is one musical number that runs a little too long and doesn't really contribute anything to the plot, in my opinion."

After seeing this movie, I started to understand all the references that I've seen in the past about this movie that I didn't picked up on the first time around. The movie was very exciting and has lots of energy. This movie also gave you a better understanding of how silent films were starting to become outdated compared to the new talk films and problems it caused for actors and film directors. The plot of the film centered around that theme. I also like the sense of realism that they included with Gene Kelly performance when he was walking and singing in the rain and then the cop showed up. The one part I didn't like in the movie was the long dance scene where they show Gene Kelly going to the big city. Although I'm not a big fan of musicals I like this movie."

Each number is masterfully executed and the numbers are done in the best style. They build up and keep getting better, rather than giving all the great stuff first. Kelly is a superb actor/dancer/singer/co-director and is what makes this film such an enjoyable movie to watch. Stanley Donen helps out plenty though and is great with the musical stuff. The choreography remains just as strong today. Compare this next to Chicago, the Oscar-winning musical a half-century later and see how much more powerful the choreography and cinematography is over that one."
"Bigt29","Null","0","1","21 November 2011"," A few thoughts on Singing in the Rain
","I'm not a fan of all musicals. I mostly like only comedies. If a musical seems too corny to me it's a huge turn off. This, although was corny in ways, ended up being a great movie. It really gave hope to all those waitresses working in Hollywood trying to make something of themselves. Hard work pays off and this movie shows it. It also pointed out something that could have actually happened if it had not been brought to the public's attention through this movie and that is: people not getting credited for their talent. I'm sure that it probably does happen here and there, but I'm hoping it's not nearly as bad as it could have been. I think somebody getting credit for someone else's talent is one of the crappiest things that can happen. I'm glad that they made this movie so early and that they incorporated that dirty trick in it. That sort of stuff can potentially ruin a talented actor/signer/writer/comedian's career.<br/><br/>I thought the music in this movie was a little on the corny side, but in a good way. This movie was funny. I could relate how stressed the director was getting to the actor not speaking into the microphone. I don't know why they made such a big deal about her voice though. It wasn't that bad. I also don't know why they didn't just have her do her own voice over's backstage and then sync it to the movie (before they made it a musical of course, because she was a bad signer). This might sound strange, but did anybody else want to be friends with Cosmo? He seemed like a funny person to hang out with. Both of the guys were awesome at dancing, I didn't realize tap dancing could be so cool. Their dancing was way different then the shoulder leaning two stepping crap dancers are doing today. This movie was good, I suggest you watch it. It's for sure a classic."

An array of songs, a top notch cast (led by Gene Kelly), a script that contains romantic and exciting writing, and the picture and color of the movie is vivid and beautiful. Yes there are some holes here and there, and the plot is ""cheesy"" and silly but that's what a musical is. Cheesy, hammed up, with everyone singing and dancing. Not my take for a good movie, but Singin in the Rain was I must admit a good musical.

","Who doesn't love singing, nobody, that's who. This is a movie that you can really smile to. I love this movie mainly because even when something horrible happens it is quickly resolved and leaves the viewer feeling content. So about the music, its phenomenal, every song is either extremely uplifting or seriously thought provoking. My personal favorite is ""Make 'em laugh"" even though its not the main character its still the best and funniest number in the movie. I love when the curtain is pulled back at the end and all is revealed, it gives you such a good feeling to know the bad guy gets what she deserves in the end.

","I am not a big fan of Musicals when it comes to movies. They always come off as cheesy and very bland. But, ""Singing In The Rain"" is a magnificent musical. For those who are unsure about this genre of film, this movie will change your mind. It is the first colored film we have watched in my History of American Cinema class, and also the first musical we watched and I loved it. The dancing blew my mind. Donald O'Connor's character, in my opinion, was the best and made the movie more exciting. His crazy dancing, and off the wall personality was so entertaining and put a smile on my face. The other character who made me laugh was Jean Hagen's needy character. Her part in the movie just made it that more enjoyable because it goes to show that not every ""hollywood glamor"" girl is perfect for every roll. It also shows that an ordinary girl like Debbie Reynold's character, does have a shot in the big world! The singing, and dancing were phenomenal. I love the scene with O'Connor and Gene Kelly dancing around the speech teacher!"

","I typically like musicals to some extent, but I can't say they are always my favorite thing to watch. I usually don't wake up in the morning and say ""I'm going to watch a musical today"". However in the film Singing in the Rain I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Growing up with sound I tend to like hearing people's voices. So that I can decipher the tone of voice used and etc. I found this film to pleasantly humorous and yes there were some scenes that I thought could have been shorter, but over all I thought the film was executed nicely. I liked the interactions with the characters and the plot line. I almost fell over after hearing Lina talk! The story line to me was well developed and easy to follow along. I thought the singing in the rain scene was outstanding and I also enjoyed the scene where Cosmo sings and dances! It was a phenomenal long shot and the scene itself was lively. One other scene that I found very impressive was the scene where a woman is dressed in white. She has a very long piece of fabric attached to her garment. I don't know why I found this seen so interesting, considering all she did was walk and move around, but the fabric was suspended in the air for the entire scene. It was simplistic, but beautiful and I can only imagine having to be the woman in that scene. The film kept me entertained and I didn't mind that it was a musical."

It was a great comedy, a great musical, and a great love story perfectly intertwined. The cast was flawless. Gene Kelly's leading man was perfect. I could write forever about how charming, funny, and likable he was, but simply put he was just perfect. Debbie Reynolds also turned in a stellar performance, and Don O'Conner's character, Cosmo Brown, stole the show. When he was on screed I literally could not take my eyes off of him. His great dancing, quick jokes, and boyish exuberance were mesmerizing. This film was so entertaining and fun to watch that my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner.

","This film was certainly not my first foray into the realm of musicals, but it is easy to see why this film garnered such critical acclaim upon its release. Everything aspect of this film is top notch. The fact that it is a musical that plays on the first sound films being released and the whole slew of trouble that ensued makes it even better. This brings me to my next point, humor. This film is genuinely funny, and not just as a student, but as a viewer as well. The writing is sharp and witty, albeit a bit sentimental for my taste. From the films opening scene on the red carpet, as a viewer there is no mistaking that this movie is going to be great. Gene Kelly's acting, singing, and of course dancing, is superb to say the least, and is made even better by the cast around him. The music in the film was a bit slow for my taste, but it is understandable considering this film is supposed to be set in the 1920's. I feel as though there is not much I can say that has not been said already by many others about what a high caliber film this is. Jean Hagen as the nasally and pompous Lina Lemont made me want to cringe every time she entered the scene. While I understand that it is a movie, nonetheless, I can't imagine that role did not stick with her for a while. What I mean to say is, I'm sure that people berated her on the street because of her performance. But I digress.. The overall feel, or mis-en-scene of the film is great, from the costumes to the set and production design, all the way down to the minor details like the microphones in the flower pot. It just goes to show that something as simple as sound in films, which assuredly we all take for granted every day, had at best, rocky beginnings to get to the point where it is today. Not to sound overly clich√É¬©, but this film is a timeless classic that I would highly recommend to others."

That being said, this movie has not changed my opinion about musicals, they just are not my thing. And that is because this movie was not like most of the musicals I have seen before, this one was dialogue that was forced into song, it was dance and song numbers that conversations led into. The lead actor, Gene Kelly is amazing. His performance throughout the movie is very solid. But, the person who steals the whole movie without having the biggest part by far is Donald O'Connor. His performance during the ""Make 'em Laugh"" song makes everyone else in the movie look like a bunch of amateurs. I have never before been impressed by someone's dancing before in my life until this movie and that part of it."

","""Singin' in the Rain"" makes you complete forget about how oppressive Gene Kelly was during the making of this film. I love how bright and colorful the sets were, as well as the characters. The songs are also incredibly memorable; 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Make 'Em Laugh,"" and 'Moses Supposes,' to name a few, are going to be stuck in your head for days later. Donald O'Conner is probably my favorite actor in the movie, mostly because of his attitude and delivery. He's keeps the beat, executes some fantastic moves, and, for guy who admitted to being afraid of messing up around Kelly, he certainly seems like one of the happiest and care-free characters in the movie. I actually think he reminds me of Stephen Stucker, the bizarre actor of ""Airplane!"" fame."

","Then you'd should check out Singing in the Rain. It's simply put a wonderful movie to watch. Even if you're like me (believe I really hate musicals) and find the dance numbers and songs all quite absurd and cheesy, this movie is still very entertaining nonetheless, including many sight gags and one liners throughout the pieces. This movie is something more of a comedy movie, with singing and dancing. How does one not find the scenes they made of their movie ""The Dancing Cavalier"" absolutely hilarious? Maybe one who isn't a fan of The Jazz Singer, which they not only make fun throughout the movie, they insult it by name. Quite brave, if you ask me. The one complaint I have (again because I have an apprehension towards them) is when they're dancing in his dream, and it's very colorful, about how he wanted to be on Broadway. I can't remember the name or anything, but it went on a bit too long and I started to get exhausted from it. Thankfully the whole dancing thing cuts back right after. So, if you're not a big musical fan, but you like comedies, and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it."

","Did you read the summary I wrote? I HATE musicals. Hate them so very much. I'd rather be inflicted with some sort of pain than sit through an entire musical film. Singin' in the Rain had quite the opposite effect though. I LOVED this movie. Musical or not, it was largely entertaining and hilarious all the way through. Gene Kelly is superb in his role as Don Lockwood, as he is charismatic, funny, and charming- as is his partner, Cosmo. I loved this movie for many reasons, but above all I think it was the overall look of the film. Some similar films of the same time period (where the sidewalk ends, I'm looking at you) just didn't have the same technology or feel I suppose. When I started watching Singin' in the Rain, I had no idea it debuted in 1952. In fact, I though it was much newer than that because of the amazingly crisp Technicolor technology. This movie looks smoother and clearer than many movies made in the 70's 80's and 90's. It was that good. I was, and still am, blown away by the amazing picture quality this movie possesses. I cannot say enough good things about this film. The ONLY detraction. I do mean ONLY, is that some of the musical scores carried on a little bit longer than I had cared for, but I was never bored. I only say this, because, as mentioned before, I am not a fan of musicals; just this one. Funny, suspenseful, entertaining (especially the stunts and dances). This movie was amazing. I loved it and recommend it to anybody. 9 out of 10, I loved it and so will you. Go see it!"

"dimplet","8","0","1","11 October 2011"," Best 1930s musical ever made
","Singin' in the Rain is the best musical ever made, according to the MGM publicity department. Except, perhaps, for Oklahoma!, Guys and Dolls, The King and I, Carousel, the Sound of Music, The Music Man, West Side Story or My Fair Lady. <br/><br/>And then there are those who say Meet Me in St. Louis or Hello, Dolly! were the best musicals ever made, which is true, if those are the only movies they have ever seen in their lives. <br/><br/>The big problem is that Singin' in the Rain is not a modern musical, one in which the music expresses the inner thoughts of the characters, that advances the plot, and that is not performed by actors playing actors or musicians, performing on stage. <br/><br/>MGM never really got the hang of producing artistically great, modern musicals. They were never able to fully integrate a great plot with great music and dancing. The plot was usually a weak skeleton to hold the musical numbers together. The musical numbers often written earlier, and the writers had to strain to find an excuse to tack them on to the story line; An American in Paris is a prime example. Even the title song Singin' in the Rain had already been recycled many times by MGM. MGM spared no expense on the lavish song and dance numbers, and figured that was good enough reason for people to pay admission. <br/><br/>MGM's musicals are mostly fluff, although perhaps the world's most magical fluff. These are stress-free shows, lacking depth, thought provoking controversy, or social message. They tend to be modified revues, the earliest form of film musical. Yet the beginning of the modern musical had already appeared on Broadway in the 1920s with Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Show Boat. It was first filmed in 1936, and its theme was the evils of racial discrimination. <br/><br/>Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein later teamed up to produce Oklahoma! on Broadway in 1942, and then on film in 1955. Hammerstein, whose grandfather had been an opera impresario, brought much greater artistic sophistication to musicals, strongly linking the story and lyrics. <br/><br/>Ultimately, it is difficult to name one ""greatest"" musical because they are unique and appeal to different audiences. However, if you establish the criteria of strongest story, strongest writing, most memorable music, best dancing and most lavish sets, I think there is a clear winner: My Fair Lady. What gives it the edge is that the screenplay is based faithfully on Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw, who was the 20th century's Shakespeare (aka, Edward De Vere). (Guys and Dolls, and The Music Man would be strong runners up in my book.)<br/><br/>And which studio made My Fair Lady? MGM? Heck, no! It was Warner Bros., the rebel, non-conformist studio -- the antithesis of MGM. <br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is a fun musical, and one you can watch several times before getting sick of it. It is certainly important, and a must see for film literacy, not to mention commercial literacy, such as the old Donald O'Connor athlete's foot ads. <br/><br/>What Singin' in the Rain really is, is the world's best 1930s musical, which happens to be when it was set.<br/><br/>Or, on second thought, the second best. The best 1930s musical was Top Hat, by a mile."

","I can't gainsay this classic musical its status as one of Hollywood's very best, although I do have one or two issues with it which stop me giving it an even higher mark. On the plentiful plus side are the wonderful dance numbers, particularly the iconic title piece, but also Donald O'Connor's brilliant solo ""Make 'em Laugh"", the golly-gosh niceness of ""Good Morning"" and of course the celebrated ""Broadway Melody"" finale, the often overlooked very witty and funny screenplay which brilliantly satirises the traumatic transition time in Hollywood from ""Silents"" to ""Talkies"" and some fine acting performances, if not by the leads.<br/><br/>I admit to something of a problem with Kelly, he's no great singer and his lantern-jawed acting often distinctly smells of ham, but a great choreographer and dancer he undoubtedly was and he's never better than here. I did find Debbie Reynolds too young and winsome for her part as Kelly's love interest and it's a pity her character's initial feistiness is watered down as the film progresses, but her personality still shines through more than enough. Donald O'Connor I do like in his supporting part as Kelly's side-kick, even if he does seem at times to be a mini-me Danny Kaye, but it's Jean Hagen who steals the acting plaudits with her sub Judy Halliday routine as the screechy, back- stabbing Lina Lamont - you'll be saying ""I caint stain 'im"" for hours afterwards.<br/><br/>The film is bright, colourful, musical but most of all very funny and can deservedly be celebrated as one of the best musicals ever made."

A gem, and one of the very few musicals I've enjoyed.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is about Hollywood, and how it had to change from silent to sound. It's a cool premise that works very well. We follow Don Lockwood, a silent film star, played perfectly by Gene Kelly, with charisma and plenty of smiles. His opening scene, highlighting his road to fame, is hilarious. His ""relationship"" with Lina is equally funny, as they alternate through time liking and being repulsed by each other. Jean Hagen is really funny as the ditsy starlet, with that legendary voice and her head in the clouds. While we're talking about actors, I can't forget Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, friend to Don, and star of the legendary Make 'Em Laugh.<br/><br/>The film is bright and cheery,and it puts you in a good mood. The plot moves quickly, and the numbers are not too far apart or back to back. And they're great. Some amazing tap dancing (and rain dancing) are mesmerizing, and there are no weak acts. The songs themselves are easy to get into and catchy. The time to prepare for such acts must've been dizzying, especially since some songs don't change the camera often.<br/><br/>The film wraps up nicely, with a good ending. Strong from start to finish, Singin' in the Rain deserves its praise and holds up very well today. Even one who doesn't like musicals will enjoy Singin' in the Rain. 8.8/10"

A depiction of the transition from silent films to those with sound ""Singin' in the Rain"" displays the world of late 1920's early 1930's Hollywood in a comedic way and is an amusing film for it. The film employs a variety of dances and music from various genres' ranging from Latin beat to Jazz, including the Charleston and samba dancing. Dance and musical numbers are often used as a means of stressing a point that would often be made as straightforward dialogue in traditional movies. Instead of stressing a point characters chose to perform a song and dance that displays their feelings or opinions of a situation. It is not unlike the exaggerated motions of those who acted in silent films. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is in all ways a classic.

In my opinion, Debbie Reynolds (Cathy) is not the best dancer. She is not as tight with her movements and doesn't flow as well as her partner. However, what makes this film so captivating IS the singing and dancing. It incorporates many various types of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet and even a bit of ballroom, swing and salsa.

The film is very well put together and seamlessly moves from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best scene, was when Cosmo set out to make Don laugh in the song and dance number, ""Make Him Laugh"". As the scene unfolds, you see the true comedy is in the accidental funny moments (although fully on purpose on behalf of the cast) as Cosmo uses improvisation to whip up some complex moves, such as running up the side of a wall and flipping off of it, and of course, some much welcomed laughs too."

I hate to focus on the negative as there are so many positives but I feel that the only thing keeping it from being a perfect film was the extended sequence of the musical within the musical with the ""Gotta Dance"" routine. The interactions between Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor absolutely made the picture and as Kelly goes off on his own the film loses it's plot and it's heart. As an audience member I had fallen in love with Reynolds' and O'Connor's characters and being without them for such a lengthy period just felt wrong.

","Singin' in the Rain (1952) is a comedy and musical film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Gene Kelly also stars in this film along with Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen.<br/><br/>This film is about a silent film star (Gene Kelly) who is very well known to everyone in the town. He was always partnered with the same female star (Jean Hagen) who had great looks, but had a terrible voice. During the film Kelly meets a dancer (Debbie Reynolds) and he criticizes her because she wasn't in films. Later in the film, the studio tries to transform into a musical studio, and Kelly uses Reynolds' beautiful voice over Jean Hagen's character voice. Hagen does not like her and she tries to take over the film studio.<br/><br/>I liked the opening flashback in the beginning of this film that showed how Kelly met Donald O'Connor's character and how Kelly's character got partnered up with Hagen's character."

The main reason I respect this film so much is because along with all of the singing and dancing there was a story line I could follow and stay interested in. A big reason I don't like musicals is because nobody runs through the streets singing and dancing in real life without being committed to a mental institution. The best part of the movie was when Cosmo was doing his comical routine on the movie set. In my opinion Donald O'Conner stole the show with that performance but he was my favorite character through out the movie.

Singin' In The Rain 2. Make 'Em Laugh 3. Good Morning 4. All I Do Is Dream Of You 5. Would You. There you have it. Singin' In The Rain is a wonderful movie that will leave you smiling. Best movie ever made? No. But it sure comes close. It's certainly better than all modern day musicals. Nobody can dance like Gene Kelly. His moves in this movie are harder than they look."

","Add me to the list of those who have nothing negative to say about this film - all the building blocks fitted together to make a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts. Even the songs all fit perfectly, notwithstandinng that a number of them (including the title song) were NOT written for the film.<br/><br/>The story neatly fits a number of things together - the passage of a couple of vaudeville hoofers into the movie business, the birth of sound and the problems it brought, and a love story (and the threats posed to it by outside pressures).<br/><br/>The musical sequences are all first rate, although pride of place must go to the utter joyousness communicated by the title song's routine.<br/><br/>Kelly was never better as a leading man, Donald O'Connor was a perfect second banana, Debbie Reynolds was cuteness personified, and Jean Hagen was absolutely brilliant - funny and malevolent - as the screechy voiced Lina Lamont. But all the supporting players were excellent.<br/><br/>The Hollywood musical never bettered this film."

","Gene Kelly is a marvelous actor, and an even better dancer. This film was as delightful as it could be, considering I don't generally go in for musicals. But the dancing was divine (I especially liked the interlude with the lovely Cyd Charisse). What really made this flick for me was Donald O'Connor. He was amazing. His goofy expressions, his lightning fast quips, and his own impressive dancing skills were marvelous. Debbie Reynolds was okay, but Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont was a splendid scream. The movie had me laughing out loud often, and I was held rapt by the dancing. The songs were delightful (I know I'm saying that word too much, but it fits), and it was great fun all around to watch. It's a little overly sweet, but it's supposed to be. Very charming, 9/10. Thanks for reading."
"brandon_lee420","9","0","1","27 March 2010"," Never expected it to be awesome!
","Singin' In the Rain sounds like a boring old musical that is an awful film like The Sound Of Music (which was sh*t by the way) and I had been led up to believing this until the age of twelve. I wasn't too keen on watching a couple of old fools singing and dancing throughout the whole film because the idea did not excite or interest me in anyway. The song Singin' In The Rain has been used in a lot of animations and films, particularly in television, because it has quite catchy lyrics and that classic lamp post dance. When I borrowed this film from a local library for a three week loan, I didn't get to watch it until the 20th day and by then I still didn't want to watch it. This film maybe my worst prediction in excitement in a film. The film had me hooked from start to finish and I consider this the greatest musical ever made because it has music, drama, action, laughs, thrills, and a sense of mystery. The acting from Gene Kelly (Don Lockwood) and Donald O'Connor (Cosmo Brown) made acting for what it is now and I am proud to say that. They both were amazing and funny, especially Donald O'Connnor. Debbie Reynolds (Kathy Seldon)was the best female actress in the film. Jean Hagen (Lina Lamont) was terrible because her voice is too scream-like and her acting is dumb even though it's meant to be like that. It is very hard to like her! There was one problem which stopped me from giving this film a perfect ten and that is that the film does not have as much singing as I would have liked. There was too less music but the songs were beautifully written and sung. Since the film did not have too much music it did make way for more non-music time and that's is a great combination of skill.<br/><br/>In 1927, the former stunt Don Lockwood becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend Cosmo Brown forming a romantic pair with the actress Lina Lamont. In the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures, Don accidentally meets the aspirant actress Kathy Selden while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her. Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.<br/><br/>The film will with a doubt amaze old music lovers and just MIGHT make the kids sing ""What a glorious feelin...."" because it surely had me doing just that. My dad smacked me because I sang it out loud in the middle of the night. The neighbors had some complaints as well. I cannot stress how far this movie is a masterpiece and how it should be watched by audiences old and young alike. Do not miss out on something that you rarely see now a days. I guarantee you, it will have some sort of impact on you. MIGHT! 9-10 - NEAR PERFECT!"

","This film is set in a time where silent films are being converted to talkies. And the trouble lies in the fact that the successful duo, Lamont and Lakewood, have a woman (Jean Hagen) whose voice is more or less awful. How can they continue to be successful and open their mouths? <br/><br/>I had some concerns with this film. Gene Kelly gets all the credit, but his little buddy is clearly the better dancer, especially during his long comedy scene. Sure, Kelly has more talking time, but the other guy gets the short end of the stick (so much so that I cannot even recall his name). Also, Lena's voice is made out to be bad, but it really wasn't that awful. Judy Holliday has roughly the same voice in ""Born Yesterday"" and no one complains. I'm not sure why this is called ""Singin' in the Rain"", as that's just one scene... it could just as easily have been called ""The Dueling Cavalier"". Oh well.<br/><br/>The humor of converting silents to talkies is pretty great, more or less the highlight of the film. The strategic use of hidden microphones, and how the sound can get out of sync. The film as a whole is good and has some nice dance sequences if that's what you're into, but this part was really want made it memorable. This will go down as one of the greatest films in MGM history, and someday maybe it will get a retroactive ""Best Picture"" Oscar."
"gkeith_1","10","0","1","11 February 2010"," Awesome musical.
","15/10.<br/><br/>My observations about this movie: Great dancing!!! My favorite the triple tap dance with Donald, Debbie and Gene: ""Good Morning, Good Morning!"", all dressed up in grays and light blues. I loved Debbie's blue high heeled tap shoes. They were just divine. This show-stopper was very powerful, lightning-fast-paced and highly energetic, and even done in the wee hours of that morning. When the three danced down the steps, and over the sofa, was totally awesome. The characters were deciding to turn ""The Dueling Cavalier"" into a musical.<br/><br/>I love musicals, and I always stand up for them. This was one of the greatest. Singing and dancing are my favorites, as you know.<br/><br/>I liked seeing Kathleen Freeman as the voice coach. The coach didn't quite succeed with the stubborn and air-headed Lina Lamont, however. We believe that Lina is really dumb, too, and Lina convinces us that education was never her cup of tea.<br/><br/>Gene was great acting the cad movie heartthrob, even though a negative character. I don't like it when he played this side of the character, being all selfish, boastful and thinking he was God's gift to women. Even in ""The Pirate"", he plays a smarmy so-and-so who is too fresh for Judy Garland's sensibilities, and such a jerk there again.<br/><br/>I better like Gene playing the wonderful human being, of course with a great set of tap dancing feet. Gene's ""Singin' In the Rain"" number in this movie is highly lauded, dancing around the lamppost and getting pneumonia during the filming, but it is my second favorite dance in the film after ""Good Morning!"" Other movies where I like Gene's characters are ""On the Town"" and ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"".<br/><br/>My third favorite ""dance"" is with Donald and the cloth dummy. Too bad Donald didn't get a romantic part in this movie, like he did in ""Call Me Madam"", when he is interested in the Princess Royal and dances with her (Vera-Ellen / I thought, ""Miss Turnstiles""!!, from ""On the Town""!!). In ""Singin' In the Rain"", in the scene where Donald dodges all the two-by-fours and workmen traveling, I feel that this is a marvel in choreography and adaptation to props in the way. The fake hallway on the wall is excellent, as is the wall where Donald jumps through.<br/><br/>Debbie Reynolds was excellent. She was quite an energetic tap dancer, and a good singer.<br/><br/>Finally, retrogressing to the beginning, I like the early part where Donald and Gene are children and then dance partners, musicians and singers in Vaudeville.<br/><br/>15/10, actually, I repeat."

","Sometimes I am too happy while walking on the streets and it feels just like dancing that dance without the umbrella of course! The movie is a classic and it's one of my three favorite musicals: Singing in the rain, West Side Story, and Sound of Music.<br/><br/>There are some funny scenes that are so pure with no complications and can make you laugh long like for instance the one when Kelly and O'Connor make fun of the phonetics instructor and the scene when O'Connor sings make'm laugh. And of course, at the end when Lina Lamont is singing and doing that silly move with her hands. The movie is just one of the unforgettable classics."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","1","2 November 2009"," Better than classic
","That film is one of these classics we all know about but we most of us have never seen, in full or in parts. And that was my case. That film of 1952 looks back at the great shift in the cinema from silent movies to talkies and the drama it may have represented for some artists who could not adapt. This film adds to that some nasty aspects of that change, of silent films (and that has not really changed), how everything is artificial and nothing but a glossy appearance. Those actors and actresses love one another in so bizarre ways at times, and they have to cope with producers and directors. But the film is funny because so many elements are shown as ironical, humorous or just plain hilarious, not to mention some cruelty here and there. Then the plot is sentimental and even romantic with a complete rift between a fake mediatic love affair and another secret and deep love that is no affair at all but a passion. The film amplifies that rift by giving to the mediatic mistress the voice of a goat and her impossibility or rather unwillingness to train herself into some kind of drinkable vocal sound, drinkable for the audience. So the studio invents dubbing and the actress is dumb enough to want to speak to her audience who liked the voice on the screen so much. The shock is so hard that they require a song and then the dubbing has to be revealed and that is the end of a career that gets silent and mute because it should have stayed silent and mute, but vanity requires adulation and worship and then a voice has to be put on the nice face and it is the discovery of the lie, of the illusion and the public never takes it with a grain of salt when they discover they have been fooled. That film is famous for one song though it is a singing and dancing treat from beginning to end, an allusion to the career of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and some others, but with a touch of realism in the behavior of these Hollywood people. And that touch is the best fun of the film: vanity has no limits and vainer than I you die. A real treat of entertainment and an important page in the huge history book of the cinema.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr√©teil, CEGID"

If there is one thing I am slightly negative about ""Singin' in the Rain"", it is that the horrible woman is so horrible and has a very irritating voice.<br/><br/>In this film, we meet the film star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and his (sort of) fianc√©e Lina Lamont. Trying to escape hordes of fans aware of his fame and desperate for an autograph, he finds himself in a woman stranger's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is quite impertinent about the way he is behaving, partly because she does not watch films and does not realize Don Lockwood is famous. He tries to explain to her he is an ""actor"" and basically she replies, ""I'm an actress, but I act on the stage."" She tries as quickly as possible to deposit Don out of her car, who has already decided he is in love with her and not Lina. We meet his friend Cosmo Brown, who is very close to Don and for the characters mentioned above, there is later plenty to be dancing and singing about..!<br/><br/>Highly recommended to whole families of people who like musicals, absolutely fantastic dancing, quite funny films and romance films.

Unlike most musicals, this one has a terrific story about Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies. Kelly, Reynolds, and O'Connor have great chemistry. Mitchell is marvelous as the studio head while Hagen's performance is a comic gem. Kelly and Donen are in peak form behind the camera. The musical highlights include ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" ""Good Morning,"" ""All I Do is Dream of You,"" and ""Moses.""

Some find it pointless and embarrassing. I find it amazing choreography and skill. <br/><br/>Moses Supposes is a song that many people find crude and insulting, (due to the ending, when Cosmo/O'Connor and Don/Kelly dump all sorts of things over the teacher) Yes. I was slightly confused with the ending of that song, but when I thought about it, I realized that it was worth it. The talent that was required for that number...and for every number...<br/><br/>I would HIGHLY recommend this film.

I reckon Donald O'Connor is a genius. His cartoon like antics in the song, betray the skill and poise needed for such a feat. He not only danced, acrobated and timed his way though it, he did it with joy too. It's a make you feel good film, full of escapism and during the dream sequence eroticism too?

","Singin' in the Rain is a true classic that is by far the finest movie musical to ever be released.<br/><br/>The story of Singin' in the Rain takes place back in the late 1920s, just a few years before the Great Depression. The story is set in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and follows Don Lockwood, a highly famous silent film actor. At this time in Hollywood movies have begun making the change to talking pictures, and just like everyone else Don is having to make the change to making pictures with sound; of course his career is put into jeopardy when everyone finally takes notice that Don's romantic co-star for years, Lina Lamont, has a voice that is like nails on a chalk board. Don is in real trouble, and in a move to try and save his career he comes up with the idea to turn his and Lina's next film into a musical, and Don's friend Cosmo Brown convinces Don to dub over Lina's voice with that of Don's girlfriend, Kathy Selden.<br/><br/>Singin' in the Rain is just genuinely one of the most positive films in movie history, there is no way you can come away from this film without a smile on your face. The musical numbers are perfectly staged, ranging from the awe inspiring Broadway Melody to the title song Singin' in the Rain. Of course what keeps driving the film and allows it to transcend generations is the romance between Don and Kathy, which is one of the most heartwarming relationships I have ever seen in the history of film, but what truly allows the romance to come off so well is the terrific acting by Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, which brings to mind another strong point of the film, the acting. The acting is superb, ranging from the great Gene Kelly as Don, or the hilarious Donald O'Conner as Cosmo Brown, the cast is very well rounded and helps keep the film moving at a terrific pace and allows you to truly grow an attachment to these characters.<br/><br/>This is just truly a terrific film, which is not just the best movie musical ever made, but just might possibly be one of the greatest romantic comedies as well.<br/><br/>I give Singin' in the Rain a terrific 10 out of 10!"

Suddenly what seemed like a corny old musical for a different generation became lively, engrossing, fun and kind of magical.<br/><br/>The overall story is about a film studio in 1927 that is in trouble because their big new film, their first ""talkie"" (sound) movie, sounds terrible. Their biggest problem is that the star actress (from silent pictures) has a voice that's pretty painful to hear. However, they find an innovative way to solve the problem ... but it's not without its own problems! <br/><br/>At the heart of the movie is a romance between the studio's lead actor (Gene Kelly) and a new actress (Debbie Reynolds). It's complicated by quite a few things, but like the rest of the film, it's lighthearted and funny. <br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of musicals or dance movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed both in this movie. The music is tuneful and is kind of a substitute for talking and self-expression; it's not done just to insert singing.<br/><br/>As for the dancing ... well, I never appreciated Gene Kelly's remarkable physical prowess until I saw this movie. As mentioned earlier, one really should see this movie on a large screen to appreciate how intense his and his sidekick (the character Cosmo) physical movements are. Their dancing was spectacular and fun to watch. Like the singing, it was also nicely integrated into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie was a lot of fun to watch and should appeal to just about everyone.

","No movie studio made better musicals than MGM during the 1940's and 1950's but the golden crown in their musical stable was definitely 1952's SINGIN IN THE RAIN, an instant classic that was an affectionate look at a difficult time of transition in Hollywood...the advent of talkie films taking over for silent films. Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a silent film star who has made several films with the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), both of whom are thrown for a loop when ""The Jazz Singer"" is released and is a smash hit. The studio then decides to turn their latest silent feature, ""The Dueling Cavalier"" into a musical but there is one huge problem: Lina has a speaking and singing voice like nails on a chalkboard. Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), a young chorus girl with lofty theatrical ambitions who agrees to dub Lina's vocals for the film and falls for Don in the process, much to the chagrin of Lina, who believes the fan magazine stories that Don is in love with her. This simple yet clever story provides the backdrop for MGM's greatest triumph which became an instant classic upon release. Kelly is charming and charismatic as Lockwood and works well with Donald O'Connor, who plays his best friend Cosmo Brown. Debbie Reynolds, 18 years old at the time, is completely winning as Kathy and Jean Hagen earned the film's only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her brilliant comic turn as Lina Lamont, the glamorous, vein glamour queen whose ego far outweighs her talent. Musical highlights include two dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor, ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses"" which allow the viewer to compare and contrast the different but equally dazzling dance styles of these two artists; O'Connor's hysterical solo, ""Make Em Laugh"", Kelly and Reynolds' lovely pas de deux, ""You were Meant for Me"", and of course, Kelly's title tune, which is practically Hollywood folklore now. And notice must also be taken of ""Broadway Ballet"" a 20-minute fantasy/production number which features a special appearance by the divinely long-legged Cyd Charisse. No true lover of movie musicals should miss this one...it's simply, sensational."

Jean Regan's egomaniacal whiner is classic as is Donald O' Connor's happy friend and Debbie Reynolds gutsy ing√©nue. His ""Make 'em Laugh"", done while a set is going up, over and around the construction, is a sight to see. All the numbers are pure fun, especially the creamy title sequence which captures the euphoria of finding that special person and ""Good Morning"", which is that perfect morning after number with the coach jump. The movie itself is an effective peck on the cheek of the old films, particularly musicals. This is also the best meta-movie ever made or, at least, the most fun."

That innovation turned the film industry up-side-down, as studios hastily but ineptly scrambled to give audiences a taste of this new cinematic toy. Some of the funniest bits are when actors, with bulky mics stuffed in their clothes make loud brushing noises as they embrace, or the sound goes in and out, or you can literally hear the actor's heart beating! They also had no idea how to script dialog, and the resulting overdone melodramatic corn is hilarious too. ""Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! I love you! I love you! I love you!"" Delightfully idiotic nonsense. Also some actors' careers disappeared, because they had bizarre voices or accents. This is represented by Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who makes a hilarious, nasal-voiced villainous.<br/><br/>Classic routines by Donald O'Connor (Make 'em Laugh), and Gene Kelly (Singin' in the Rain), plus wonderful singing by Debbie Reynolds, and you have one of, if not the best, musical ever made. My only nitpicking objection is the ""Broadway Melody"" routine goes on too long, and seems disconnected from the rest of the movie--perhaps included only to give Kelly an extra opportunity to dance.<br/><br/>That minor excess aside, this movie remains one of the fun movies to recite lines from and to watch and enjoy again and again."

","Definitely the best movie of all time in terms of music and dance. It is difficult how anybody cannot enjoy this classic movie. By the end of the movie, you will be singing along.The movie begins with the silent era coming to an end. The main star, Don Lockwood, is at his movie premiere and from there on out the musical sensation begins. The movie is definitely top notch in choreography, music, and pays a lot of homage to the early musical directors of the 1930s. A lot of the different camera techniques, as the overview head, were taken from the early directors. Also a lot of the characters in the movie are based on a real life counterpart. The Gene Kelley scene were he lays out his most famous 3 minutes in history is definitely memorable. The fact that supporting actor Cosmo brings comic relief to this movie will be a warm hearted affair for all. My deaf aunt even enjoyed this movie."

I usually find nits to pick in even the best of films, but I can't think of a thing I would change about Singin' In The Rain. 50 minutes into this film is what one could argue is the greatest tap-dance number ever filmed (apologies and a nod to the Nicholas Brothers), with Kelly and O'Connor defying the laws of physics and the limitations of the human anatomy with almost every move. It's no accident that That's Entertainment includes more than one sequence from this great movie; for sheer entertainment value, it will never be surpassed."

","Plot in a nutshell - The roaring 20s are coming to an end, and with it is the end of the silent era of film, for a new form of film entertainment is at hand: the talking picture, inspired by the success of ""The Jazz Singer"". Just as silent screen stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are about to make a new film ""The Cavalier"", Don - who with each passing film is growing ever more weary of the ego-maniacal and delusional Lina - meets sweet virginal ing√©nue Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds, AKA: Princess Leia's Mom), who aspires to be an actress in her own right. Don meets Kathy while running away from his adoring fans and hitches a ride with her en route to a post-party premiere while she's en route to work. Secretly a fan of his films but wishing not to appear to be a gushing fan girl, Kathy claims to be a stage actress and comments that she doesn't find film work to be all that professional or dignified as there is no sound or words, merely melodramatic gestures, which Don, who worked his way up long and hard from humble beginnings with his sardonic childhood piano playing friend Cosmo (Don O'Connor), finds insulting. Kathy is later humiliated when Don finds out that she's actually working as a song & dance girl at the very Grove where his party is being held, where she makes her grand entrance from a giant fake cake, her embarrassment fueling Don's smug amusement. When Don starts grilling Kathy about her ""profession"", she tries to hit him with a pie, but ends up hitting his obnoxious screen partner Lina instead, which costs Kathy her job when Lina complains about it to the management. Don's frustration is pushed to critical mass by this, and finds he can't stop thinking about Kathy, feeling both guilty about her misfortune and his own confidence undermined by her words. Don later finds Kathy working as an extra for a musical number for another project at the studio where he works, Kathy's true fan girl colors are exposed, but in old school Hollywood fashion, Don & Kathy fall in love.<br/><br/>Following this, Don's new film, ""The Cavalier"" is besieged with problems as the studio tries to convert it into a sound picture (many of them taken from real life problems encountered during the sound conversion). When the film is given its initial test screening, the film is booed and mocked, as the audience beholds the now hammy, melodramatic acting of Don and Lina as well as Lina's glass shattering squeak of a voice. This serves as a blow to Don's pride and he figures that Kathy was right before, that he never was an actor, just a show-boater. Kathy and Cosmo encourage Don not to give up and, recognizing his skill with song and dance, suggest turning ""The Cavalier"" into a musical, with Kathy dubbing Lina's speaking & singing voice. Lina eventually finds out and is none too pleased, and tries to ruin both Don's relationship with Kathy and Kathy's career, with Lina wisely utilizing her contract to manipulate the studio head R.F. Simpson and insisting that Kathy be uncredited her for work while continuing to be her uncredited ""voice"" otherwise, Lina could sue the studio for contract violations. The newly musicalized film, reworked to have the hero fantasizing he's in the old time instead of being there, opens to be a rousing success, and Kathy & Don find out about Lina's wicked deed just after the film ends. Kathy is devastated, but just when all hope appears to be lost, Lina's ego gets the better of her as she makes her own speech for the first time, which confuses the audience as to how Lina could have such a beautiful voice on screen but a squeaky voice in person. Lina then insists that Kathy sing behind the scene to her lip sync, which Don encourages, annoying a disheartened Kathy who tries to disown him, but then, just as the sing/sync gets underway, Don, Cosmo and RF gleefully pull the curtain up, exposing the deception. Lina is finished, Kathy is now on top, and Kathy & Don live happily ever after.<br/><br/>A bit long winded but still an engagingly bright musical comedy in the old school Hollywood musical tradition. Debbie Reynolds is adorable as the golden hearted Kathy. Don't miss the title song number."

Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a very popular silent actor. He has a fake relationship with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) for publicity purposes. When the Hollywood is struck with sound, there is a problem.... and Don puts his career on the rocks when he falls in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).

That honor went to ""With A Song in My Heart,"" a musical drama based on the life of singer Jane Froman.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Singin' in the Rain"" deals with the advent of talking pictures and its ramifications on the silent stars of that time. We know that actor John Gilbert, a matin√©e idol of the silents, had his career ruined when talkies came in.<br/><br/>Such shall be the fate of Lena LaMonte, hilariously played by the late Jean Hagen in a well-deserved performance which landed her a best supporting actress nomination.<br/><br/>Our hero, Gene Kelly, plays opposite. Lena. To say that he despises her is to put it mildly. Gene really loves Debbie Reynolds who he meets in a very funny scene in this film.<br/><br/>Donald O'Connor shines in this film. His rendition of ""Make Me Laugh,"" while he literally walks on walls is memorable and terrific. The guy was a real class act.<br/><br/>The problem is what to do with Lena? Her scratchy voice reminded me so much of Judy Holliday in her award winning ""Born Yesterday."" The scene where it is shown that Debbie has been singing for Lena is a riot.

"buster-crashtestdummy","Null","0","5","22 September 2005"," It's magnificent, but it's not a movie.
","Witnessing the charge of the doomed Light Brigade against Russian artillery, the French general Rene Bosquet famously remarked: ""C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre"" - ""It's magnificent, but it's not war"". After watching 'Singin' in the Rain' again yesterday, I'm strangely left with a similar feeling ¬ñ it's magnificent, but it's not really a movie, is it? That is to say, although it is on the outset even a movie about movies, about Hollywood and about the making of movies, it's not really cinematic. 'Singin' in the Rain', for all its spectacle, just doesn't do what great movies, in my mind, do and ought to do ¬ñ namely, tell a story in a way that is specific to the movie as a form. Of course, the dancing is wonderful, but it strikes me as being a beefed-up Broadway show put on the screen.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love this movie. I absolutely adore it. It's like a birthday party with cake and soda for two hours straight. So, this isn't really offered as negative criticism, at least I don't think so, because I really don't want to speak badly about something wonderful. It's more a kind of puzzlement.<br/><br/>What is the specifically cinematic anyway? Well, it's hard to say, as it could be a lot of things, but let's look briefly at one possibility. If you look at Bergman, for instance, (yes, an unfair comparison if ever there was one), you'll find the cinematic in an exploration of the unification of photography and theatre ¬ñ the two antithetic sources of cinema. Yes, if you want to play Hegelian, you could say that there is dialectic here. Theatre is the theses ¬ñ it's all about the forward movement of the plot in time, it's action-packed, it's a temporal art form. The action is viewed at a distance. We know characters by their actions. The antithesis is photography. Here we have slices of time, extrapolated from movement and frozen in single moments. Photography makes close-ups possible. It allows a different way of knowing people. It lets us look for an essence, a timelessness in them, by way of the exploration of portraits. The synthesis of these two forms is the cinema, realized at it's height by Bergman in movies like 'Scenes from a Marriage', and perhaps above all 'Cries and Whispers'. Perhaps it reaches it's peak (or perhaps it goes too far and turns back on itself) in the relatively unknown 'Karin's Face', which consist of a series of photographs, a montage.<br/><br/>The cinematic could be a lot of other things as well, of course. In Fellini it is produced by the way the scenes are linked and cut. But I won't go further with this now.<br/><br/>Anyway, Singin in the Rain, despite taking movies as it's very theme, never becomes cinematic. It never moves beyond the theatre. There are hardly a close-up of a face throughout the movie. Those that are there seems either just not important, like the one of Gene Kelly in the beginning, or actually attempts to turn the face into another comical prop by treating it as a plastic instrument, distorting it, actually removing human personality from it ¬ñ I'm referring to the, admittedly side-splittingly hilarious, funny faces made by Donald O'Connor.<br/><br/>Well, I don't know¬Ö I could be way off the mark here, it was just something that occurred to me. In any event, I'm still rating it a 10, because, cinematic or not, it's still magnificent... whatever it is."

","""Singin' in the Rain"" is #10 on AFI's list of the 100 best American films. When I first saw this placement, I was a little iffy. A musical over ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Star Wars"", and ""Psycho""? I was not convinced. Then i SAW the film, and I realized why it places so high. Movies are made to entertain and make the viewer feel good, and ""Singin'"" might do this better than any movie ever made. It's not the great songs, the dances that accompany them, or even the gloriously positive ending (""She's the star of the picture!"") that makes the viewer feel so good when watching this film. There seems to be a certain something, a certain, well, happiness, to the whole film. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen definitely did what they set out to do when they made this. Filled with bright colors, unforgettable moments, and utterly touching, human characters, ""Singin'"" is the perfect antidote for films like ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""Rollerball""-films which make the viewer feel upset upon finishing them.

","Many people consider this to be the best musical film that has ever been made, or ever will be made.  I'm one of them.  The three leads were absolutely perfect.  Gene Kelly never danced better, Debbie Reynolds gave one of her greatest and probably most underrated performances, and Donald O'Connor was never slicker and more witty.  The chemistry between the three leads is perfect, Gene and Debbie exude growing love.  You feel a REAL friendship between Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown.  This chemistry is one of the reasons why this film works so well; can you see Howard Keel dancing in the rain as originally planned?  Or someone else besides Debbie popping out of a cake.  The music is the best and the dancing is SECOND TO NONE.  The most famous obviously is Gene Kelly splashing around in puddles; and is the second most recognizable moment is screen history (first is Scarlett O'Hara's silhouette in front of Tara-with that classic score behind her.) I LOVE Debbie Reynolds, so I really enjoyed ""All I Do Is Dream Of You.""  But my favorite number by far is ""Good Mornin'"" and this is why: it is the only number to include all three leads.  Plus, it's fun to imitate.  This is my favorite film after the Star Wars Trilogy.  If not for George Lucas, I'd have missed so many classic films, I have to give him thanks.  If he never hired Carrie Fisher for Star Wars, I'd have never paid any attention to her mother.  Debbie Reynolds is truly a classic work.  I'm glad I started paying attention.  Thanks George."

I can't help but say however, that although the film is good and well worth seeing, it is vastly, vastly overrated as far as the praise and notoriety it has received down through the years. The satire on old time Hollywood is not fully realized, leaving us with what is essentially a thinly strung together collection of set pieces, one of which really comes out of left field and has not a whole lot to do with the main plot . Just like he did in ""An American In Paris, another vastly overrated classic, Gene Kelly's dynamic Broadway sequence is a long detour from what we are expecting as far as a cohesive and flowing storyline. It is this kind of dance sequence that prompted his ""invitation to the dance"" some years after, a film that didn't allow plot and dialogue to get in the way of artistic dancing. Another flaw in Singin' in the Rain is the unauthenticity of some of the musical numbers as far as what the standard was in 1930. As good and as entertaining as the film is, flaws aside, in no way does it hold a candle to the REAL greatest musical ever made, ""Kiss me Kate."""
