","I am sorry for all the readers, but I don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.<br/><br/>A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.<br/><br/>Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.<br/><br/>You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. Much more."
"DICK STEEL","7","254","376","9 May 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Angels & Demons
","Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.<br/><br/>So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.<br/><br/>Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.<br/><br/>Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular."
"neil-476","5","107","153","21 May 2009"," Pull the other one
","I usually try not to spoiler: in this case I shall do so wholeheartedly. Don't read on if it bothers you.<br/><br/>First I must comment on The Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Angels And Demons,(the movie) is a vague sequel (albeit the book precedes the Da Vinci book). While Da Vinci was hardly deathless prose, it told an interesting, unusual story at breakneck pace in an easy-to-follow manner. It was pacey and entertaining. It sold shedloads, and deservedly so. The movie adaptation was faithful, but lost the novel's immediacy: it still had broad appeal and did well at the box office, hence this sequel.<br/><br/>So to Angels And Demons (where I haven't read the book). In the run up to the Cardinals' voting in Conclave for a new Pope, four of them are kidnapped. Despite reservations about Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, hardly pro-Catholicism in Da Vinci) the Vatican consults him. He figures out that this is the work of the Illuminati, a secret group dating back to the Renaissance, who seek revenge for the Vatican wiping out many of them in the 16th century for their pro-science, anti-Catholic views. Together with a lady scientist whose research generated an antimatter bomb stolen by the Illuminati, intended to wipe the Vatican off the map, Langdon engages in a clue-laden race against time, looking for the missing cardinals and the bomb. He is helped by Ewan MacGregor's Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Camerlengo is acting Pope until the Conclave comes up with a new one - a functional rather than authoritarian position) and hindered by Stellan Skarsgard's head of Vatican police. Armin Mueller-Stahl is a Cardinal who may have his own agenda. There is further jeopardy from the fact that the Illuminati have probably infiltrated the Vatican at the highest level.<br/><br/>So far, so not-very-spoilery. Much action, racing around, convoluted clues etc., key factors which made Da Vinci so successful, albeit with a noticeably less credible plot. We even have have a couple of likely suspects - Starsgard's unhelpful police chief and Mueller-Stahl's cagey Cardinal.<br/><br/>Now for the rest of the plot. Three Cardinals are killed, but the fourth is saved. The bomb is recovered. However, there is insufficient time for it to be defused. McKenna takes it up in a news helicopter, and bails out. The bomb detonates, the shock wave causes relatively little damage, but McKenna's gesture in saving the Vatican and thousands of lives means he is certain to be voted in as Pope by popular acclaim. Of course, he turns out to be the villain, having murdered the old Pope and arranged the whole thing. Thank you, Robert Langdon, the end.<br/><br/>This pleased me in one respect - while the film still had you believing that the Illuminati existed, I wondered why they would leave a series of clues pointing to where the bomb was? Of course, as it was all McKenna's masterplan, he wanted the bomb found.<br/><br/>But then I started thinking about this masterplan. Let me list the parts of it (McKenna never does the standard explanatory monologue, you're left to figure it out yourself): <br/><br/>1. Steal antimatter; <br/><br/>2. Make antimatter bomb; <br/><br/>3. Poison Pope; <br/><br/>4. Recruit professional killer to kidnap and kill Cardinals; <br/><br/>5. Create trail based on incredibly complex clues from poem in priceless 16th century book in Vatican archive):<br/><br/>6. Rely on Langdon solving clues in time; <br/><br/>7. Make car bomb to blow up professional killer; <br/><br/>8. Rely on helicopter being nearby once bomb is recovered; <br/><br/>9. Rely on there being sufficient time to get helicopter, fly it high enough to avoid total destruction (despite nobody having the slightest idea exactly what effects of antimatter bomb might be), bail out, get to ground safely; <br/><br/>10. Rely on hero factor being sufficient to result in being elected as Pope.<br/><br/>The rationale (I think) was that, as Pope, he could prevent the Catholic Church living happily with science.<br/><br/>As a plan, I thought that this was risibly implausible. I happily suspend disbelief and willingly did so while the hunt was on, but the revelation of who the baddie was (and, therefore, what his plan must have been) was, to be frank, utterly idiotic - so idiotic, in fact, that it devalued the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There was some other stuff which made me scoff with derision:<br/><br/>McKenna is branded on the chest: a large glowing brand, maybe 20 cm square, is applied forcefully to his chest for upwards of 5 seconds, following which it is dropped to the floor where is sets the carpet smouldering. Yet this doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest - he races through tunnels and flies helicopters with nary a whimper (he does hold it as if it's a bit tender later on, though).<br/><br/>Earlier in the film McKenna tells a story about his military service which ends with him explaining that's where he learned to fly helicopters. It would have been a good deal less clumsy if he had simply whipped out a sign and hung it round his neck reading ""I'm going to be flying a helicopter later in this movie."" <br/><br/>Langdon rewinds the security video stored on the police chief's computer. The computer makes the noise of an audio tape being rewound across the replay heads! <br/><br/>My favourite bit was when the girl scientist tears a page out of a priceless 16th century book (the page which carries the all-important clues to finding the Cardinals and the bomb, in the form of a poem in English printed in watermarks in the paper!), not because it was an inherently good bit, but because I was immensely tickled at the gasp of horror coming from a lady in the audience.<br/><br/>This film was mistitled. It should have been called ""Angels, Demons, And Complete And Utter B*ll*cks."""
"lavatch","Null","156","229","12 June 2009"," 10 Reasons Why This Film Took a Belly Flop in the Tiber River
","It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel ""Angels and Demons"" could misfire as badly as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.<br/><br/>(1) In the film, there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. <br/><br/>(2) The breathtaking locations in Rome, as described in the novel, were not realized visually in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock film footage. The great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the ""Ecstasy of St. Teresa"" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at all.<br/><br/>(3) The most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.<br/><br/>(4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN, was cut out of the screenplay.<br/><br/>(5) There were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.<br/><br/>(6) There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in ""The Godfather"" films, but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis.<br/><br/>(7) The College of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl. This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel.<br/><br/>(8) The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church.<br/><br/>(9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. <br/><br/>(10) As a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.<br/><br/>In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber."
"EchoMaRinE","8","46","64","25 July 2009"," worth watching but could have been done better
","This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better."
"iofred","4","42","59","15 May 2009"," Why God why
","Why did they not follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. My wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.<br/><br/>Reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) Story-line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existent<br/><br/>All-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time, when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)<br/><br/>Really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations"
"ddrcoaster","7","105","159","15 May 2009"," Why are People Bashing this Movie?
","I go to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well. Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film, but faster paced, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable. If there is one thing that I didn't like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (don't want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what I saw."
"ocknights71","7","96","146","15 May 2009"," Book>Movie
","I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.<br/><br/>The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. And if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing that I was looking forward to.<br/><br/>Overall, Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer. But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans."
"thos40","1","52","76","13 July 2009"," Almost as bad as Independence Day
","The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly."
"lhana-1","3","48","72","15 May 2009"," Book -vs- Movie
","Personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the ""different"" outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it lacked in plot.<br/><br/>For someone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.<br/><br/>With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand."
"Rafacus","8","206","347","15 May 2009"," Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.
","Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.<br/><br/>With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.<br/><br/>Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.<br/><br/>The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.<br/><br/>Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.<br/><br/>If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks."
"BabyDanner","4","26","38","17 May 2009"," Not at all impressed
","I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about. Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10"
"TJ-Deen","7","196","344","12 May 2009"," Despite its obvious flaws, A&D is surprisingly good.
","Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.<br/><br/>The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter. <br/><br/>The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way. <br/><br/>The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets. <br/><br/>However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost). <br/><br/>While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder. <br/><br/>A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

","I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.<br/><br/>There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.<br/><br/>Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.<br/><br/>This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie."

Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.<br/><br/>This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.<br/><br/>Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.<br/><br/>It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.<br/><br/>Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.<br/><br/>Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci"

","Firstly I loved the book, more so than the more popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons ever again.<br/><br/>The film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.<br/><br/>From the very start of the film I was disappointed, in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (can't remember the name) and then requests Langdon to come, using the super fast plane... In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... In the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.<br/><br/>Leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot... (err I think I got this right, but I was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...<br/><br/>There was no love interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasn't at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. In the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo. The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoria.<br/><br/>In all one of the worse films I have seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!"

","Angels and Demons is not too bad, it comes in a form of entertainment. It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels & Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.<br/><br/>The story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.<br/><br/>Overall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this. Those who like thrillers, this one may suit. This is supposed to be a fictional thriller which is not to be taken seriously."

A girl that's almost useless, and the main character whose outrageous guesses turn out to be correct. <br/><br/>The odd technical details, like an antimatter that lingers around for 24 hours (in reality, it disappears in a flash), or that a battery that cannot be charged until it is totally depleted, irritates the viewers.<br/><br/>The movie is very predictable, except for the last few bits.

","Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first thirty minutes, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled. It is an expensive picture, burnished and foreboding, however it's about as intrinsically satisfying as junk food--and just as bad for you. NO STARS from ****"

If the bio-matter is going to blow up the whole city then why haven't detectives investigated who broke into the lab, then track that guy down, and recover the bio-matter bomb? It seems that the whole vatican police force is angry with the Hanks character, so why would he even bother staying and trying to help?<br/><br/>Why does the Hanks character fumble around looking for the earth, fire, water, air statues for hints to finding dead priests and answers to how they were killed instead of just trying to find the bomb and save the city?<br/><br/>The power going out in the airtight book vault was hilarious. There would be enough air in that room for them to breathe for a week, but they were gasping for air almost immediately. Those books were supposed to be priceless, yet they used the bookcase to try to break out, then of course the the power came back on.<br/><br/>The bomb seemed to be described to be more powerful than a nuclear bomb so taking it up a couple thousand feet in a helicopter would only make it more effective in destroying the city. There's no auto-pilot in choppers and nobody ever parachutes out of them. Also wouldn't everyone with any common sense take cover from the expected bomb blast?

","Haven't read any Dan Brown, so had no pre-conceptions about the movie, although I had seen its ""The Da Vinci Code"" predecessor, while my wife, who has read the novel, says that the film is true to it. To me though it did look very like ""Da Vinci Code 2"", not unnaturally given that most of the original component parts were there again - obviously Brown as writer, Howard as director, Hanks as star, Zimmer as resident composer etc etc.<br/><br/>I must admit though that it came across to me as a preposterous, empty, only occasionally flashy thriller. The hope of the writer, no doubt was that by basing the sources on ancient lore and setting the action in modern day locations, this heft would give credence to the events on the screen, but it's all too unbelievable for words.<br/><br/>Hanks' character, it seems, has the uncanny ability to decipher ultra-complicated arcane clues in minutes (he has one hour between the scheduled executions of pope-aspiring cardinals, which are the prelude to the big-bang anti-matter cataclysm, set for midnight) only to race around a darkened and crowded Rome to unerringly arrive just after the deed has already been done! He does however divine enough to eventually save the last of the scheduled victims and of course be on hand to save Vatican City from destruction at which point we learn it wasn't about the mysterious Illuminati Group's 400-years-in-the-making grand revenge against The Vatican but about papal legate Ewan McGregor's fiendish plot to assume the papacy himself...<br/><br/>I'm aware of the novel's massive popularity (which will propel the film to world-wide success, no doubt, like ""The Da Vinci Code"" before it) but really the plot holes here are bigger than the Grand Canyon. Like when the Italian police, with Hanks and female sidekick scientist in tow, run into a seeming dead-end in one of the chosen churches, promptly abandon our would-be Holmes and Watson, who then, naturally discover a secret passage from the church to the Vatican. There's loads of stuff like this in the film and though director Howard tries to ratchet up the tension with clock graphics ticking down the minutes to midnight and employing Hans Zimmer's pounding, sub-Orff music to propel us to the next big-scene, it just gets crazier and crazier, to the frankly deranged conclusion of MacGregor's errant priest saving the Vatican by piloting a helicopter (handy he was in the Italian air-force as a young man!) up to safety, where the anti-matter explosion occurs relatively harmlessly before parachuting back to earth to be proclaimed a hero. But no, a twist as transparent as glass reveals the truth and normality is resumed on the ashes of MacGregor's ambitions.<br/><br/>It must be hard to act such tosh convincingly and I'm not sure anyone succeeds. Hanks hovers between stolid and stodgy while MacGregor's accent makes regular return trips to and from Ireland as the film progresses. There are some spectacular special effects, notably the creation of the anti-matter ""God-particle"" at the start and the pyrotechnics above the Vatican at the conclusion. In between there's poor continuity, for which the constantly interjected exposition fails to compensate and too much forced action set-pieces where Hanks might as well be running about with a big ""S"" on his chest so intuitive and death-defying is his character.<br/><br/>Anyway, Rome And Vatican City looked wonderful as they always do, but other than make me want to go back there sometime soon, this blockbuster left me cold and scratching my head about what all the fuss was about. Best just to accept it as a Harry Potter-type phenomenon, where with a sure-fire audience of the millions who've read the book, the film had to be made. The fact is though that it didn't and in my opinion shouldn't..."

","I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, I had no expectations.<br/><br/>'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.<br/><br/>The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet.

Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.<br/><br/>The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres."

","Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly, but something has gone very wrong.<br/><br/>Howard has always been a decent workman director. While he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel/sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. In addition none of his films have been downright awful. (Note I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic.) Whats more Howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind), star driven costume drama (Far and Away), star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash).<br/><br/>Angels and Demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. Scenes are too dark, camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. This makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled.<br/><br/>Dan Brown gets picked on a lot but I found The Da Vinci Code a fun readable romp (so sue me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.<br/><br/>Angels and Demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a CGI back lot. The entire film is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.<br/><br/>While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me), Demons and Angels story consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican doesn't need any help on that one.<br/><br/>Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europe's Large Hadron Collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This begs more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati haven't quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet. Instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style. They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. A true character study (Okay you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charms.<br/><br/>On the plus side Stellan Skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area."

","Ron Howard's movie does not do justice to a pretty good novel. I was very disappointed by his cutting major characters and themes of the book. The movie does not go into any detail about the major theme of the book and why the villain did what he did. So many changes were made it is arguable as to whether or not the movie is based on Mr. Brown's book or just borrowed a few ideas from it. Anyone who enjoyed the novel will be disheartened by all the changes that make the movie confusing rather intriguing. The movie starts out with a scene slightly similar to one that takes place much further on in the book. The head of the scientific research center, who was a major character in the book, is completely eliminated. The British writer and camera person are not in the movie at all and I don't recall them mentioning the relationship between the female star and the murdered scientist who had 2 careers that seemed to be at odds but are a major reason for his anti - matter research. Nor do they even point out the real cause for the pope being killed."
"IndependentThoughtAlarm","4","8","12","14 June 2009"," Angels & Demons (Ron Howard, 2009)
","OK, everyone. Here's how it goes. Robert Langdon is smart. He knows history and symbols. There is a threat against the Vatican. OK? Following me so far? The threat is from the Illuminati, an organization of scientists vowing revenge on the Catholic Church. Alright? They've kidnapped four cardinals who are supposed to be in the running for Pope. Get it? OK, and the sexy scientist Vittoria Vetra is the expert who knows how to manage the bomb they're threatening the Vatican with. Yeah, OK, as long as you understand, we can get on with the movie. But we'll remind you of all of this in about 10 minutes in case you forget. <br/><br/>This may as well have been flashing on the screen for the entirety of Angels & Demons. On the surface, this doesn't seem like the kind of film that would attract brain dead idiots, but it seems that writers David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman didn't want to take the chance that some mentally challenged 11 year old might get lost in the story. This is my biggest qualm with Angels & Demons, an already mediocre film dragged down to fiery depths of cinematic hell by a completely incompetent script. OK, maybe that's a little extreme, but I couldn't pass up the chance to say ""fiery depths of cinematic hell"", now could I? <br/><br/>One example of the spoon-feeding nature of the script is the power outage idea. A camera has a live video feed of the bomb, and it's somewhere inside the Vatican. Security decides to turn off select power grids bits at a time so that they could see where to check for the bomb should the camera go dark. This seems easy enough to remember, right? Well, turns out it isn't. Every time the characters are in a room and the lights go out, some side character must remind everyone that security is turning off power at random. They really should have abandoned all hope of a four-walled narrative early on and had Tom Hanks turn to the camera every now and then and say ""Alright, so let me get you up to speed here..."" <br/><br/>And Robert Langdon. What a great character. Not only does he know everything that could possibly help him in his quest to rescue the four cardinals and stop the terrorist, but he talks about nothing else! I could count on one hand the amount of lines Tom Hanks reads that isn't a historical fact about Italy, the Illuminati, the Catholic Church, or something along the lines of ""It should be here!"", ""We have to go there!"", ""They must be planning to..."" or other cut and paste exclamations. <br/><br/>But it's a good thing that the good guy, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, is there for guidance. Man, he's such a hero. A real saint. The perfect man for the job. Or, is he? SHOCK! TWIST! Run for the hills, because the suspicious-looking good guy who fits into the plot in nearly no significant way other than to be revealed to secretly have been the mastermind behind the whole plot is...the mastermind behind the whole plot! EEEEKK! But that means that the even more suspicious looking guy who everyone suspects is secretly the villain is...not secretly the villain! Gosh, if only they had given us a chance to figure it out... <br/><br/>Other minor things. Some good, some bad. Good: they got rid of what would have been a ridiculously contrived romantic subplot. The explosion at the end looked pretty. The bad: whose bright idea (pardon the pun) was it to have the light shine into the camera and nearly blind the audience whenever a character is running around with a flashlight? Why is it that two people of Italian origin in Italy, alone, speak English to each other sometimes, but Italian other times? I wouldn't mind if they spoke English the entire time, but the flip-flopping drove me crazy! Don't even get me started on the hilariously obvious and incredibly poorly written (so poorly written it stood out amongst the rest of the poorly written film) speeches about faith vs science. Yeesh. <br/><br/>Really, what a mediocre film. Pretty blandly directed, awful writing, and a phoned-in performance by Tom Hanks. Throw in an incredibly suspenseful ""will Robert Langdon die in the middle of the movie?!"" scene, a useless female sidekick and no real reason to care what happens to anyone and you can top off what should have been a huge disappointment, but really was just what most of us had expected. Oh, well. They can't all be gems."

","Angels & Demons, in relation to The Da Vinci Code, is respectively like turning in a C paper instead turning in a D paper. Better, but still not good. In terms of the sequels' improvement, the acting is decent all around, although nothing stands out. ""It's a thriller"" say Ron Howard. His definition of a thriller, at least how he displays it in Angels & Demons, seems to include the words boring, talky, and overlong. Good thrillers are short on words, long on action and convey plot points, locations, and identities visually. In Angels & Demons, Howard lays out a map, shows us Robert Langdon's destination, tells us how he's going to get there, and then shows us, in long sequences, what we were just told. Doing so bores the audience; why do we want to see something happen when we we've just been told the same information? There is no element of surprise or suspense. Howard also shows us Robert Langdon begging for entrance to Vatican Archives, walking into the archives, with a sign clearly marking them, and then flashes ""Vatican Archives"" on the screen. Almost every major location, all of which were made clear in the dialogue and/or the visuals, is told to us with little white subscript. Howard's direction in Angels & Demons is the opposite of Hitchcock's; Instead of wringing suspense from the story, he sucks it out in his attempt to explain the convoluted narrative. Angles & Demons, like most commercial 'thrillers,' is predictable. It is obvious that the crux of the story, that the Illuminati have hidden anti-matter that will explode upon colliding with matter, (at-you guessed it-midnight!), will not come to pass and everything will be all right in the end. You don't have to read the book to know that some Cardinals will die (watch the trailer) and that Vatican City will remain standing. The narrative's believability starts on thin ice and ultimately, with the final twist (the good guy is really behind everything!) falls through. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Ron Howard's film spends most of its time talking to the audience. With such a historically derivative film, much needs to be explained, but no one goes to a movie theater to be lectured at. A least there's a plot? Well, in essence, Angels & Demons is a repetitive gimmick; Robert Langdon looks at a symbol or statue, explains the complicated meaning he quickly derives from his glance, and then hurriedly whisks off to his next location. Repeat. At least Langdon got rid of his mullet."

The average person who will see this movie obviously enjoyed the complexity of the book as I would hazard a guess that they read it themselves! The book already had a winning formula, why in the world did they choose to throw that away? Why can we not allow the story to teach about Vatican protocol, why can we not describe the history of the locations that are being visited in greater depth than a quick line shot out of Langdon's mouth about Bernini's sculptures (and a few very quick references to locals).<br/><br/>It seems such a shame that films have to play to such a low expectation of education and enlightenment, and that is a true tragedy."

","Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.<br/><br/>Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead. <br/><br/>Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors). <br/><br/>The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.<br/><br/>Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?). Then again, no one ever expected the film to change their views on the religion vs. science debate, right?"

","I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong it hurts.

Stop playing to the dumb audience, please. There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. A little research, all I'm asking. But then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. So basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself."
"mexicospidergreen","7","20","37","16 May 2009"," True to his word, Ron Howard has definitely topped Da Vinci Code
","Can Robert Langdon save the Catholic Church and prevent Vatican City from destruction? The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley. For those who want mindless and heart pounding entertainment, this is a neatly crafted action thriller, with twists and turns headed every direction. Be sure to take a chill pill after this film is done because it was really that suspenseful. The supporting cast including the very underrated Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgård all had deserving roles, and it was neat to see Ewan back on the screen (he's been gone far too long.) Bottom line, though it can't compare with the book, it's still terrific entertainment, and if you liked Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard has a big surprise for you."
"birdseed-11","4","4","5","29 March 2010"," portrays Catholics as imbeciles
","The only thing that successfully carried over from the book to the movie is the complete misunderstanding of Catholicism. The Vatican is not like corporate America. While that model is easy for Americans and atheists to digest, it is simply not true. I know a lot of priests and bishops. They aren't against science. I think we learned our lesson with Galileo, Darwin, etc. and don't argue about it too much anymore. (And as much as science will understand, there will always be a need for God.) The only thing that was vaguely Catholic, other than the settings and costumes, was the very end when the Cardinal thanks Langdon and explains that Langdon was called by God, even though he wasn't a believer, to get this straightened out. That was the Catholic attitude. The rest of it was Hollywood.<br/><br/>Other instances of non-Catholic behavior: In St. Peter's square when the ""stem cell research"" supporter is yelling at the nun that ""You are condemning sick people to death."" and she replies ""Man is not God."". That is not the problem Catholics have with stem cell research. The issue is ""You have to kill babies to have enough stem cells to do your research."" This is not the forum for a science or religious debate so I won't go into it. I'm just saying ""Man is not God"" is not the main argument Catholics make against stem cell research.<br/><br/>Catholics don't believe in suicide. The end scene when McKenna self-immolates is completely ridiculous. No priest would think he is going to heaven just because he said a little prayer just before he killed himself. That's just ignorant.<br/><br/>Even the supporting statements of Catholicism are very limited. When the head of Vatican security confronts Langdon with ""my church comforts the sick and dying and feeds the poor. What does your church do? Oh yeah, you don't have one."" He makes it sound like Catholicism is like joining the United Way. It's not. There are many more rewards than that. Those acts are just the fruits of our faith. Real Catholicism is about following the will of God, having a loving heart, trying to be like Jesus, and having the peace and joy of knowing that all will be well because you are following God's plan for you. From that we go out and comfort the sick and feed the poor, and many other ministries.<br/><br/>I thought the movie clipped along at a pretty good pace and the riddles were imaginatively portrayed. But the film bounced from scene to scene a little too fast in an attempt to create a frenetic pace. And the death scenes were unnecessarily gruesome. I can't recommend this movie."

"yris2002","7","22","43","13 June 2009"," Congratulations to Ron Howard!
","No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.<br/><br/>Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.<br/><br/>Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.<br/><br/>The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story."
"ackstasis","7","18","34","8 June 2009"," ""Open the doors, and tell the world the truth""
","Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.<br/><br/>Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance. All flaws aside, I can certainly see future generations enjoying 'Angels and Demons' for its preposterous sense of fun."

","First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. <br/><br/>Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in Da Vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. However the BIG TWIST is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub-plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria getting together. <br/><br/>The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. that's okay for a film like this. <br/><br/>i'd give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment"
"Doylenf","7","9","15","19 May 2009"," Brilliant suspense thriller with some spectacular photography...
","Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.<br/><br/>The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.<br/><br/>The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.<br/><br/>AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.<br/><br/>It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.<br/><br/>One of the best action thrillers of the year, highly entertaining and full of gripping suspense."

","Monty Python used to do a comedy sketch in the 1970's called ""The Bishop"", in which a crime-fighting clergyman would try to foil the pernicious plots and dastardly deeds of various criminal masterminds. The joke was that ""The Bishop"" would always arrive ten seconds too late to save the victim and would then hilariously lament, ""We was . . . too late."" <br/><br/>If you've seen that skit, then you've seen this movie. Super-Hero Symbologist (now there's a phrase you don't hear every day) Robert Langdon is pulled into a bizarro plot involving antimatter, flaming monks, and a centuries old cult trying to wipe out the Catholic Church. Langon spends the entire movie zooming around Vatican City in various sports-cars, helicopters, and police caravans only to see his mysterious shadowy foe emerge victorious time and time again because he was . . . too late.<br/><br/>Not a horrible movie to be sure, but we have come to expect far more from people as gifted as Ron Howard and Tom Hanks.

"AndrePhilidor","6","6","9","16 May 2009"," Beautiful sets, senseless script.
","I continue to marvel at the art of motion pictures. The scenes inside the Vatican are enormously impressive and beautiful. I can't imagine the Catholic Church granting permission to film this anti-religious movie within such Holy sites, so the movie sets to recreate the interior scenes are amazingly authentic. Having visited the Vatican, I am impressed. The crowd scenes in St. Peter's square are also convincing though I can't believe hiring all those extras. If these are stock footage scenes, they blend seamlessly into the film.<br/><br/>So that leaves the enormously far-fetched plot. (I had not read the book.) So many holes and implausibilities leave the viewer perplexed and completely unsatisfied. Great detective stories, a la Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie, at least conclude with revelations that explain a convoluted plot. Not Angels and Demons. Leaving the theater, you wonder why. But only for a few minutes, as it is not worth the effort.<br/><br/>E.g., why go to the effort to steal a container of anti-matter from CERN, evading tight high tech security and murdering a scientist, all for the purpose of planting a bomb in the Vatican. Wouldn't just a load of common explosives, much more easily attainable, have achieved the same goal??? Oh, OK, it is a matter of volume. Sorry, that just doesn't fly.<br/><br/>A well made movie.

"jaredmobarak","6","6","9","14 May 2009"," Faith is a gift I've yet to receive  Angels and Demons
","Author Dan Brown has a writing style that suits mainstream America. The guy is a consummate fixture on bestseller lists and frankly he deserves it. I read The Da Vinci Code and it was a page-turner; I remember not being able to put it down as new discoveries were made and the intricate plot unraveled. However, when the movie version came out, I was very under-whelmed by what Ron Howard did. He took all the excitement out of the novel by painting a film by the numbers, literally taking the page to screen. Unfortunately, what works internally by reading doesn't usually work visually. As a result, I decided to go into the prequel novel adaptation—made into film sequel—Angels and Demons without prior knowledge to the story at hand. It definitely gave me a more pleasurable experience, allowing me to enjoy it for what it was, a summer blockbuster thriller and nothing more.<br/><br/>At its core, this is simple storytelling. You have a man at the top of his field, Robert Langdon, who can literally walk into a room and see everything symbolic and its historical meaning within seconds. As a result, any minute detail needed to progress the plot can be made feasible in the context that Langdon knows everything about anything. His never-ceasing-to-amaze mind allows the impossible to be done. That said, I felt preached to and talked down to a lot less here than with Da Vinci. Howard decides to go forward without any exposition, (if you saw the first film you know Langdon's backstory, no need to rehash again), and delve right into the action. Within ten minutes, Tom Hanks' symbologist is in the Vatican, up to speed, and seemingly more invested than the Papal police with the case. The incident concerns the kidnapping—with threat of murder—of the top four candidates for the Pope, a position vacated by the dying Vatican leader fourteen days previous. Oh, and there's a little something about some stolen antimatter that poses the chance of destroying the Vatican and part of Rome with a cataclysmic explosion.<br/><br/>I'll tell the truth and say that the outcome is pretty obvious, especially when Howard and the filmmakers make so many people out to seem like the bad guys, causing you to know that it must not be them, but instead the ones you would never guess. Angels and Demons is the kind of film you check your brain at the door with, going along for the ride and potentially learning something on the way. Langdon's wealth of knowledge not only remarkably makes him the one man on Earth that can decipher the mystery at hand, but also allows the audience to possibly absorb some religious and cultural history. It all happens at breakneck speed, the viewer never able to take a breath and think about people's motivations. The pace is so fast that you are whisked away, following one step behind the characters as they go from one church to the other. Does Langdon speaking his thoughts out loud constantly, coming across as a pompous know-it-all, get old? You betcha. But what other way could we see how he solves things? There isn't; and that is why literary adaptations aren't always great. They are two separate mediums that utilize different facets of your brain. You can't expect a direct translation to work; one needs to reinterpret with the vehicle's attributes in mind. Filmmakers must take the story and make it their own, not just copy, shoot, and print. Howard isn't a bad director, it's just a shame he mostly takes ""for hire"" type jobs.<br/><br/>The film is not without its merits, however. The special effects are nice, especially the antimatter climax, and the blood and gore adequate to get the audience going—there is nothing like an eyeball sitting on the floor to get you into a story. Hanks is good as Langdon, working his brain and acting smart. It's perfect casting; I just wonder if it's a character that has any redeeming qualities other than the fact he knows everything and can save the world from crazy conspiracies that occur randomly in the world. My favorites, though, were McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss. Mueller-Stahl has a very intriguing role, tricking us into believing he has nefarious ideas and interest in stealing the Papacy in one moment and appearing to be the most righteous and pious of the bunch the next. He is a wild card that keeps you guessing, becoming the one enigma that I couldn't quite pin down throughout. As for McGregor, you can figure out early on what his motivations are, but he plays the part so well. His monologue about church and science being at war is brilliant and his twists and turns during the film always completed skillfully.<br/><br/>In the end, though, Angels and Demons is your standard summer film—mindless entertainment with a pseudo-intellectual bent that seeks to titillate more than stimulate the mind. There is some humor as well as some likable characters all on the trail to prevent a bomb like none we've seen; an event that would all but wipe out the entire Catholic Church in one fell swoop. There may be few surprises and occurrences that make you shake your head at the contrived absurdity of it all, but Howard and company also give us a puzzle's solution through deductive reasoning and research. Perhaps the Robert Langdon saga will teach kids that it is okay to be booksmart, its OK to devote your life to academia, because maybe, just maybe, you will write a book that the government gets wind of, about a topic that is exactly like the one which a current unsolved case is built around, allowing you to work side by side with a beautiful woman and show that you can kick ass and play the hero despite your pale complexion and aversion from leaving the indoors. Us nerds can all dream  right?"

To make it worse the characters keep repeating to each other what they are doing or what they are going to do, and then they do it, and sometimes they talk about what they did afterward, this is a very helpful feature in a film for those who like to talk to each other throughout the entire movie, however I find this very tiring.

"Simon_Says_Movies","7","7","11","26 May 2009"," More streamline but still not as clever as the book
","It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.<br/><br/>Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.<br/><br/>Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.<br/><br/>Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"penncare","3","25","52","16 May 2009"," Angels and Demons is a disappointing movie.
","I can see why the Vatican didn't have any objections to this film. The reason is because it was so badly adapted and poorly put together that they knew it would get bad reviews on its own. The church didn't need to interfere in this one. I guess Dan Brown really needed the money. Otherwise I can't see how anyone would allow their work to be bastardized this badly.<br/><br/>In the closing credits, it says something to the effect of ""based on the adaption of."" What it should have said was ""based on the very loose, poor adaptation and the location is the only thing we have in common of."" The movie was so dissimilar to the novel in storyline and characters that I wondered if I was in the wrong theater. Clearly the directors took massive amounts of liberty in shooting the film. I fully recognize that you cannot adapt a Dan Brown novel 100% into a 2 hour movie (like Santa delivering all of the presents in one night) but the liberties they took went too far and strayed very far from the book. Ewan Mcgregor who is a fine actor was not the right person for the role of Carmalengo. Vittoria Vetra was not fully developed and a very critical element was left out of the movie. I think what annoyed me the most about the movie is the four preferiti plot line. In the attempt to be politically correct and story-wise expedient, they fail tremendously to deliver on this story-line.<br/><br/>If I didn't read the novel ahead of time, I probably would have been kinder in my score but since I did, I really tried to like the movie and was excited for its release. It was just disappointing. The only liberty which I approved of was changing the assassin from being a Muslim to a non-Muslim. There seems to be too many movies where Muslims are evil and this change does not affect the movie at all.<br/><br/>I generally judge a movie based on whether I would pay full price, matinée price, Netflix/video rental or don't bother at all. Angels and Demons is a Netflix/video rental at best because the movie disappointed on so many accounts."

","A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.<br/><br/>Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.<br/><br/>Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist. Maybe Dan Brown has seen way too many classical art."

","This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because ""Angels and Demons is worth it."" Two of the four had read the book. Of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent Angels and Demons.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how very confused I am.. I don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They, pretty much, take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious, British dude. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack). They take out the press dude following them around. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take out the Camerlengo's grand scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. They take out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal.<br/><br/>Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details, the movie is acted HORRIBLY. One must admit, though, there were some good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SCREW THIS MOVIE FOR RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT."

","I must begin this review by stating that I have not read this novel. However, I suspect that it's source material is one of this film's greatest aids as the strongest aspect of it is definitely the story.<br/><br/>The plot involves a plan to murder four Vatican cardinals and effectively destroy the Catholic Church. Robert Langdon follows a path of clues in an effort to save the cardinals and the Church. This story sets itself up for constant intensity as you know that there are always lives on the line. It also takes place in just about 12 hours with very urgent pacing, making the narrative even more of a ticking clock.<br/><br/>In addition, I enjoy Langdon's knowledge and how he is able to piece together the clues and follow the path. It's interesting and you constantly want to know more.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful and involved story, the picture also boasts impressive performances from its cast. I have yet to discover a bad Tom Hanks performance, and here he brings a definite sense of knowledge and urgency. Meanwhile, Stellan Skarsgård and Ewan McGregor bring necessary depth to their characters as you find out that they are not what they appear to be.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score is loud and epic. It adds gravity and weight to some of the film's most important moments and lightens up for the rare quiet moments.<br/><br/>Ron Howard directs the piece with a very large scope and tries his hardest to make the story seem large and important. Given how intense most of the film is, this is a wise decision that really helps the audience understand how vital everything is. It's a double-edged sword, however, as Howard's direction is also the biggest flaw of the movie. It doesn't occur often, but there are some scenes which should be quieter and more reserved, but which come off as overly bombastic due to his frenetic direction. This only happens in perhaps two scenes, though.<br/><br/>All in all, I greatly enjoy this film. I find it interesting and intense throughout, and the involved plotline is always moving. As a work of entertainment, I definitely recommend it."

","I absolutely love the book, and because of this fact I am unbelievably disappointed by the film. Apart from maybe the film Congo, this is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen. The Script feels like it was written by 20 people and pasted together at the end quickly. So many plot holes it is untrue. No real character backgrounds to speak of, the film centres around Tom Hanks who gives a rather desperate performance and I couldn't help feel that he was trying to emulate Nicholas Cage's role in National Treasure, but failing miserably. If it were not for the fact that I had read the book, I wouldn't really have a clue who any of the characters were, or why they were doing what they were doing. But hey, that's just my opinion - some may like it!"
"mcsheehey","6","10","18","19 June 2009"," A Solid Thriller
","While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.<br/><br/>From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.<br/><br/>Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece."

","I should have known you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Religion, science, worlds end, moment of creation, ancient secret societies... Ron Howard stays faithful to his cues, but ultimately the downfall of this movie lies solely in plot and writing. Today, audiences can suspend disbelief if they go into a theater with such intention, but that was the magic behind The Da Vinci Code, wasn't it? We walked out of the theater with a sense of ""what if?"" despite having been ready for a movie that was supposed to be unbelievable. Angels and Demons fails on this note because the plot is childish and absurd, in no way a justice to its paperback counterpart. It seemed rushed, despite being too long, and many a minute were wasted on meaningless dialog that could have otherwise been used to develop characters whose interactions were arbitrary, to say the least. There is, though ill-fated, an attempt made for a Langdon/Sophie relationship here... which in itself was just pathetically copycat material. And to make matters worse, characters who exist long enough and seem to finally be taking a decisive role suddenly are either killed or shooed away for more haywire plot development. And when I say haywire, I mean insanely over-the-top ridiculousness. It's sporadic and even a bit desperate to capture the essence its predecessor left behind, and in the end it just doesn't compare. Wait for the DVD folks."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","9","16","18 May 2009"," A superior film to The Da Vinci Code...
","I haven't read any of Dan Brown's novels, so when seeing the movies based on his books, I went into them without knowing what they'd be like. I hadn't seen The Da Vinci code at the cinema, but instead watched it on DVD. It didn't hold my interest enough to really pay that much attention to it. When it was on TV recently, in preparation for the cinematic release of Angels & Demons, I watched The Da Vinci Code again. It still wasn't that great, but at least I managed to pay more attention to it. This time around, with Angels & Demons, I decided to go see the film at the cinema (or, more accurately, someone wanted to see the film and I was just going along with them).<br/><br/>I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons was just a better-told film. It wasn't as slow-paced, plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Even in this film's slower moments, it kept me interested. That was due, in large part, to Ron Howard's direction. In lesser hands, the film probably would have been deathly dull, but Howard manages to keep your eyes transfixed to the screen, even when there's a very talky scene happening. The rest of the credit for the film's success goes to the actors. Tom Hanks seems much more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around. He's a likable enough character (even if he does remain somewhat mysterious), but Hanks makes him a character where you actually *care* about what happens to him. I never saw what the big deal was with his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title in this film need not fear, as his hairdo's shorter now.<br/><br/>The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor is Langdon's female counterpart. This time he's paired with the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (much more well-cast than Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu in the first film). Ayelet Zurer is far more fitting a partner for Hanks's Langdon. Not only is she much more well-suited to the role, but both characters are on more equal footing. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with Langdon (and as Tom Hanks himself said on the radio recently, like every beautiful particle physicist, she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone). It's a bit of a shame, then, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them on screen together so much in the beginning of the movie, I must say that I was disappointed that they split up for what seemed like quite a long time during the middle. The chemistry between the two actors is immediately evident, and you can tell they're at ease/comfortable with one another (even if their characters tend to differ on their approach to certain things, though this allows for some amusing moments between them). The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor does really well in the role of Camerlengo Patrick McKenna. Like Hanks, he made me like his character for the majority of the time, and I think the movie benefited from this. He definitely gave a solid performance, and I thought McGregor owned the last third of the film. While there are other rather important characters in the movie, I felt these main three mentioned above were the most memorable. It's a shame Ian McKellen was absent (as he was the one bright spot of the The Da Vinci Code). Unfortunately, the Assassin (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) wasn't nearly as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film. Stellan Skarsgård (who I didn't particularly like in the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who shares quite a memorable scene with Tom Hanks at one point).<br/><br/>This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are also several gruesome scenes. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie is quite a memorable one that I didn't see coming, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading more than a few subtitles, you should enjoy this film (Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense). Angels & Demons doesn't take itself too seriously (which is a plus, given the far-fetched circumstances), and is rarely dull. Apart from finally finding out just what exactly ""anti-matter"" is, the other thing I learned from this film was that being a Symbologist wouldn't be a bad job, especially when you get to hang with a beautiful enigmatic Italian scientist...if only it were actually a job!"
"rasmus_persson90","6","9","16","14 May 2009"," I had expected more...
","I was actually a bit disappointed of the film. I have recently read the book and the film missed many important points.<br/><br/>Here are some things that I found a bit odd according to the book: As someone mentioned earlier was Leonardo Vetra (who had another name in the film) found in a different way than in the book. Only three of the four cardinals were killed, The Assassin died in car bomb and Maximilian Kohler, the executive director of CERN, wasn't mentioned at all. <br/><br/>It's probably really hard to screen a so fantastic book as Angels and Demons is, but I had expected more."

","The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.<br/><br/>So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.<br/><br/>The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.<br/><br/>Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one."

","It's now been three years since Tom Hanks as Dr. Robert Langdon solved the mystery of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that Audrey Tautou from The DaVinci Code is their descendant. You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.<br/><br/>But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.<br/><br/>So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.<br/><br/>Better this sequel just not have been made."

","I am not a fan of the Da Vinci Code brand of story. We are fascinated by the idea of betrayal and everything not being what it seems. These stories are complete baloney for any learned student of story telling. That being said they are harmless fun. Angels and Demons is a fun film, an adventure film with absurdities to be sure but no one is meant to take the film as fact. I don't wish to rate the controversy surrounding Angels and Demons because it isn't what the picture is.<br/><br/>Angels and Demons is a well made picture. It takes the flaws of the Da Vinci Code adaptation and solves them. Ron Howard's task is to make us swallow this ludicrous premise with a degree of realism. I am amazed by how well staged this picture is. There is a sense of realism in even the most absurd. Hanks solves puzzles in seconds but it is easier to believe here than Da Vinci. With this sense of realism Angels and Demons is an effective ride with style. We aren't plagued down by looking at the flaws.<br/><br/>Angels and Demons greatest strength is that it respects the Catholic Church. Any criticism of the film is unfounded and will only cement this as a bona fide blockbuster. Despite the fact that the film is silly it does follow the Catholic customs with some accuracy. Despite the fact that the Catholics have boycotted this film it is very respectful of them. Howard is smart to make this a sequel to Da Vinci Code despite the fact that it is chronologically out of place. Showing Langdon as the only hope against a threat greater than themselves.<br/><br/>We also have a much better cast than I think this film would get. Hanks is the star here but Angels and Demons is more of an ensemble film than anyone could have thought of. Stellan Skarsgard and Ewan McGregor actually give stronger performances than Hanks.<br/><br/>The sense of urgency is what makes this picture flow. Sure Hanks goes on his little spiels but they are for a reason. For one thing I didn't really care if Christ had a spawn and there really wasn't a race to find out the truth. The idea of a terrorist threat intertwined with a conclave makes this work especially with Howard. ROn Howard is not someone whom I see making a picture like this. Angels and Demons is genuinely suspenseful and very exciting."

I thought how could they possible make the movie any worse than the last one, but boy was I wrong! They changed everything in the movie and completely destroyed the plot and meaning behind the book.

"Faizan","4","57","144","6 May 2009"," Ponderous, long wild goose chase
","Angels and Demons is a very long, very boring wild goose chase. It is peppered with theological mumbo jumbo and conspiracy theory fluff. This stuff should be fun like the Indiana Jones films, but here it's stuffy and uptight. Blame not just director Ron Howard for his ponderous serving, so generic you can almost smell the packaging the film comes out of, but the writers of this mess too (David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman).<br/><br/>While watching, you realize that the film has very little actual dialogue. The characters talk to one another, but it is all in the form of meaningless trivia. ""The Illuminati were"", ""So Raphael's second painting was"", ""You mean what Bernini really meant with that sculpture is"" and so on. It does nothing except provide endless layers of exposition. This is the film being clever with history, art, religion and everything in between. It wants to serve a big helping of unknown 'facts' that will tease audience members brain cells, but has more of the opposite effect. <br/><br/>The film lingers with moments of extreme sensationalism. The Pope has died, a voting is underway, but the secret Illuminati strike with a bomb threat (anti-matter stolen from the LHC project) in Vatican City. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called upon for his expert knowledge of this cult group and to try and help unravel the mystery. Hans Zimmer's score has all of the expected papal choral chants to wake you up in time for the next stagey murder scene, but everything in between just doesn't sustain. There is something so bland, so sedate, so mechanical about the film and its exploits that I was reminded how helpful, even necessary the presence of Ian McKellen's role was in helping to drive the thrill of conspiracy theories in the much better The Da Vinci Code, preventing it from being as pedantic as this film.<br/><br/>The summer movie season used to mean simplistic movie fun, but now it means movie world ridiculousness and this is what Angels and Demons promises and delivers, in huge amounts. Hanks, with the second incredulous attempt as the Professor, has started to remind me of one of those behind the counter managers at McDonald's who likes to get his hands dirty from time to time, annoying us with his everyman attitude. His character might have gotten a new (and better) hair stylist, but I couldn't buy him as an academic, much less a religious skeptic, a point this film tries to make more than once. If this film and its principle character are strangely self aware of their religious stand, it is possibly as a response to the hue and cry made by the general public when its prequel Da Vinci Code (actually the sequel in chronological form) was released, but here it is stagey and unchecked. Not helping with believability is the fact that every garbed Cardinal or Priest is shown as a creep in hiding, and when you first see husky voiced, red robed Armin Mueller-Stahl, you can't help but roll your eyes."

","So first things first..<br/><br/>Angels and Demons is a much better and very different film than the Da- Vinci code.<br/><br/>Following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and over the top action sequences.<br/><br/>In this respect Angels and Demons almost feels old fashioned.It offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion Vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is CERN's large hadron collider facility.<br/><br/>Hanks is Hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in Da-Vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic Cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time I was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.<br/><br/>My only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. But that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..<br/><br/>Speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.<br/><br/>overall I would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general."

The symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), who had her powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter research stolen, are invited by the Vatican police to help them in their investigation. They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter.

My daughter read the novel and told me that the adaptation is also frustrating. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Anjos e Demônios"" (""Angels and Demons"")"

","A few years ago there was The Davinci Code. In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.<br/><br/>All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 fractured stories"
"ivisuals","3","12","24","16 May 2009"," Implausible from the start...
","Angels and Demons is a completely plot driven film. No chemistry between any of the characters. A bit of clever dialogue here and there. But when you're a plot driven film with a finite time, you better get that time right. When a finite amount of time is determined (as it is in this movie), you better make sure that it's believable that the characters can get from point a to point b in the amount of time. Angels and Demons rarely gets that time right. That Hanks character discovers pathways, entrances and exits throughout Rome and the Vatican that no one knows about is pretty ridiculous. Everyone living through the explosion of anti-matter is also completely ridiculous. And lastly, using the old premise of ""the butler did it"" becomes really lame. Substitute orphan for butler and you have your criminal."
"yanusnl","1","6","10","30 May 2011"," The most awful filming of a book ever!
","This was by far the most awful, nail curling film i have seen in quite a while. I wanted to throw my laptop through the window while watching, I wanted to surgically remove my brains so that I do not have to live with the memory of having watched this film. <br/><br/>Saying this, it is obviously is have read the book before i watched the movie. because, there are more than 50 (I counted) things that do not match the book. In fact I think there are more things incorrect than correct according to the book. <br/><br/>This is THE perfect example of a film butchered by Hollywood. <br/><br/>I wanted to say Ron Howard is the most terrible director mankind has ever known. But I can't. He directed Cindarella Man and A Beautiful Mind, which both are really good movies. But he sure slaughtered and butchered this one. I simply do not believe Ron Howard read Dan Brown's book before making this film, he probably only read a summary on the internet. <br/><br/>There are simply too many things wrong with this film to mention every one of them, but I will give it a go. <br/><br/>1. Where is Mr. Phillipe????? 2. Vittoria Vetra did not discover the body of her father 3. In the movie this isn't even her father 4. where is the ultrasonic jet that flew Langdon to Geneva (he didn't even visit Geneva in the film) 5. There are three fighting scenes cut out (the one in the fountain, the one in San Angelo and the one in the 'fire' church where Langdon gets stuck behind the tomb) 6. Robert Langdon did not flew with the Camerlengo in the chopper (of course in the book he did) 7. THE FOURTH CARDINAL WAS NOT MURDERED?!?! 8. Not only that, he is elected for Pope, what the hell is that about? 9. In the book, there were trouble with the number of police men that could be used. While in the movie, the Vatican police, the Carabinieri and even S.W.A.T. teams are all over the place. <br/><br/>I think you catch my drift here. <br/><br/>It would have been better if Ron Howard simply used another name for the movie, contacted Dan Brown that he used fractions of his book and that's it. This, by far, nowhere near a filming of a book. I am really p*ssed of about the fact that I just gave up 2 hours of my life to watch this worthless piece of junk film, knowing I will never get those two hours back. <br/><br/>I even feel bad for Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor that they starred in this film, because they are both great actors and should not be in a useless film like this. <br/><br/>So my tip to you is, if you read the book but didn't watch the movie, DO NOT WATCH IT! If you didn't read the book and didn't watch the movie, you perhaps can watch it, but still I doubt the fact you will give it higher than a 6. <br/><br/>This was my review and I hope I will stop people from watching this film by heaving them read this review. <br/><br/>Jan M Eindhoven Netherlands"

A&D uses no reenactments. <br/><br/>It was a good thriller, really, and I enjoyed every minute, but it just wasn't as good as the Davinci code in my opinion. It would help if you have been to Rome, are familiar with Italian art and architecture (from the late Roman period to the late Renaissance will suffice), and it wouldn't hurt if you were Catholic as well... <br/><br/>Otherwise, I have to say that for 50ish, Tom Hanks has a pretty good bod, and his sidekick is the spitting image of Nigela Lawson - I kept expecting her to look into the camera and describe what she wanted for lunch in sensuous adjectives."

The problem is the viewer is lead around by the nose with facile explanations where anything can mean anything. It is like when a statue points East. It seems that he should go East but wait the statue used to point West. He needs to find a statue of the angel of peace but when Langdon finds a statue of a dove he declares that it is the statue he seeks.<br/><br/>The plot would never get off the ground except for two killers who seem to have super human powers. The first one knows exactly what everyone will do and exactly where they will be. He uses this power to enact outrageous murder plots. The other has the power to prevent people from protecting themselves while he is killing them. Policemen come up to him guns drawn and they stare at him while he shoots them. He pulls a gun out of another policeman's hand, tells him everything is alright and then shoots him. Policemen on high alert walk by him and he shoots them in the back.

","I was in the process of reading the book as this movie came out, and had not yet finished with the book...now that i'm done with the book, I can now I feel, write a proper review.<br/><br/>There were things I liked about the book more than the movie and vice versa. The changing of Vittoria's character into more of a support scientist didn't truthfully bother me. I liked that her character in both movie and book as a smart female, but I understand the decision to nix the romantic plot, and her father being changed into ""research associate."" Her revenge driven romantic interest wasn't at all missed by me. Also, for the time constraints of the movie, it wouldn't have properly been laid out.<br/><br/>I did however, prefer the ""hassassin"" of the book to the surprisingly minor character he seemed to appear as in the movie. Somehow I couldn't be frightened or intimidated by the ""bookwormish"" appearing ""hassassin"" vs. unstoppable buff killing machine the book offered us.<br/><br/>No complaints on Hank's front. He still remains one of my favorite actors, and seems to have more comfortably slipped into the shoes of Robert Langdon than seen in the DVC.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor was perfect in the role of the Camerlengo. He was exactly as I pictured the character in the book. <br/><br/>The basic story is kept in tact and follows pretty faithfully to the book, a mystery, a forgotten path needing to be uncovered, murdered Cardinals, etc. I was wondering though, why the decision to save the final Cardinal? <br/><br/>I'm on the fence about the helicopter escape from the book vs. the helicopter escape in the movie, but I kind of liked the idea about not suspecting a thing about McGregor until almost the last minute. I do however wonder why he chose self-immolation so rapidly after entering the Sistine Chapel, before even anyone could verbalize an accusation, it's as if in a nano-second he knew. Perhaps his own guilt overwhelming him? <br/><br/>The cinematography is astounding, really beautifully done. And the use of statues, paintings, and other works of art is gorgeous. (Although yes, I know a lot were sets.) Clever book = clever movie, however changed it was. It was slow starting...but so was the book. <br/><br/>I do however wonder why the decision to make this a sequel to DVC instead of a Prequel such as the book was. I was confused (as I still was reading the book when I saw this, and the book made no mention of any ""previous events from last year"", as was referred to in the movie, as the reason for Langdon's rejection from access to the Vatican archives. Did they not think the audience could put 2 and 2 together to figure out that this series of events could possibly be beforehand.<br/><br/>Of course the movie was seemingly endlessly debated in the row behind me where a bunch of American Eagle wearing tweens were having they're own running commentary throughout, but I learned to tune them out.<br/><br/>Not a bad film. 7/10"

"hondask-1","1","4","6","21 September 2009"," Sorely Disappointing... Only good thing is Tom Hanks' hair.
","Ever since I heard they were making this movie at the beginning of The DaVinci Code I was extremely excited for it. So excited in fact that when the DVD was released in Europe a full 2 1/2 months earlier than it is to be in the US I went through the trouble of having it shipped overseas. From the VERY BEGINNING I was disappointed! Langdon was not contacted in person by the Vatican, he was contacted over the phone by CERN director, who wasn't even in the movie at all which is hilarious because he's the one that is supposed to record the confession of the Chamberlengo. Before that, Vittoria Vetra wasn't even at CERN when her adopted father, Dr. Vetra, was murdered (in his study, not in the lab) and he eye used to get into the dark matter lab. The movie didn't even mention that Dr. Vetra WAS Vittoria's father of any kind. Continuing further out, Vittoria is supposed to be kidnapped by the Assassin when they both go in to rescue the Cardnial from the fire.<br/><br/>There are many MANY other problems between book and movie, and I admit that sometimes there are differences, but whoever wrote the story for the movie must have read the book upside down! I noticed that the culprit may have been trying to hide the original messages that come from the book. The idea of the war between science and religion, they tried to dumb it down, maybe to not offend anyone, maybe because the writers were too religious to be effective and unbiased. I am aggravated I went through so much work to get this movie early and in my honest opinion, Sony Pictures needs to try again with this. I don't care if the movie is 3 hours instead of 2 1/2, GET THE STORY RIGHT! They did so well with The DaVinci Code, what happened here? My recommendation? Read the book again, leave the movie alone."

","Agreed: poor performance by Vittoria Vetra, and rather quick-solving of all puzzles, or clues. But still, I don't agree that Angels and Demons was one of the ""let-downs"" of this year. It was good! Perfect symbols or Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Good pace, good performance by Camerlengo and Robert Langdon, good sound effects and music, good sound editing, brilliant cinematography and direction, good editing, a little-hard-to-understand-for-the-layman script but still, how much simpler could it be made? Angels and Demons story follows as such: a pope dies, and somewhere in CERN, a father and daughter create the OPPOSITE or matter, that is ANTIMATTER, which is highly dangerous if it comes in contact with anything that is MATTER, even AIR. So when a Pope in the Vatican has died, and the father who made antimatter is murdered, one thing is obvious: the age-old group of Scientists, Illuminati, have risen again, to take revenge against those who refuted them years ago: the catholic church. And what better time than when a new pope is to be chosen? With the antimatter stolen, Vittoria knows one thing: it can take out the whole of Vatican City if set off. And soon enough, four favorite cardinals are kidnapped, and to be executed one by one every hour. Can the symbologist, Robert Langdon, hand in hand with Vittoria, stop the murders, and stop the ANTIMATTER before it sets off? And who is behind this all? Surely no one can be trusted.<br/><br/>This film is one of the highlights of 2009. Go watch it. If you've read the book, you won't love it as much as you'll love it if you HAVEN'T read the book.

"aufwiedersehenpet","9","6","11","16 May 2009"," Completely surpassed my expectations
","First, let me begin by illustrating my standpoint. I am a massive fan of Dan Browns novels and the Da Vinci Code movie. I have always looked upon Angels and Demons as the better novel however. I was therefore very concerned before seeing the movie that what I looked upon as crucial details had been changed. Namely, the omission of Max Kohler. The change in the Camerlengo's nationality from Italian to Irish, along with a change of name, the fact that a Cardnal was saved, and especially the fact that the CERN scientist murdered was not Vittoria's father Leonardo, instead being A.N. Other research scientist.<br/><br/>So when I went to see the movie, although excited, I prepared myself to be disappointed. How wrong I was. All of the changes, apart from the change in name/nationality of the Camerlengo, worked incredibly well in the context of the film and allowed the movie to flow very well. Indeed to include all of the novel would probably involve a film about five hours long, clearly not practical.<br/><br/>There was only one part of the original novel that I disliked due to it's implausibility and that was Langdon jumping from a helicopter over a thousand feet in the air, using a piece of tarp as a makeshift parachute. This has been omitted from the film, much to my pleasure.<br/><br/>In short, these changes are what makes this work as a movie. The film is fast paced, and has a very tense atmos.The casting is first class, especially Ewan MacGregor and Stellan Skarsgard. Ron Howards direction, yet again is a true work of art. Thats said, I still feel that The Da Vinci Code movie overtakes A&D in terms of grandness and screen presence overall.<br/><br/>The scenery was fantastic and the replica's of the Vatican are flawless and if you did not know, you would would swear this movie was filmed in the Holy See. Hans Zimmerman's musical score included several re-workings of Da Vinci Code tracks which work very well in giving the two films a feeling of togetherness. In fact Zimmermans 'Chevaliers de Sangreal' could find it's place as Robert Langdon's 'James Bond Theme'.<br/><br/>The next piece of the puzzle is 'The Lost Symbol', Brown's next Langdon novel, which I have already ordered for it's September release. The movie appears to be pencilled in for 2012 and I hope it goes ahead.<br/><br/>I plan to see this film again quite a few times before the end of it's run. Roll on the Blu Ray release! Bravo once again Howard, Hanks et al."
"phaneendrakumar","8","8","16","29 May 2009"," Good adaptation of the novel.
","Angels & Demons has partially lived up to the expectations and hype that it has created among the movie going community in last one year's time. It started on a high note and maintained the pace well enough to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat, till the last 20 minutes. Director Ron Howard missed it in the last 20 minutes and you have that odd after-taste once the movie is finished.<br/><br/>The movie started with the death of the Pope and is followed by the theft of a canister containing Anti-matter. From there, a Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon takes over. The story is well written by Dan Brown, which never lost the attention of the reader in its novel form. Akiva Goldsman did a fine job in adapting the story as a screenplay. There was enough of wit thrown in extremely fast paced story making sure that you will not get bored.<br/><br/>The good point that is to be noted is Ron Howard has learned from his past mistakes of adapting the Dan Brown novels. Davinci Code was a slow paced movie and it really never kept the viewer riveted to the plot. Also, in trying to stick to the novel, it made fun of itself at points. But, Angels & Demons has lot of deviations from the original novel which resulted in a better movie. Actually, Davinci Code was a failure as a movie. You will enjoy the movie only if you have already read the book. But, A&D can be enjoyed by people who haven't read the book also.<br/><br/>Vettoria Vetra was one thing I hated in the movie. The actress who did that role is relatively unknown and as expected, Ayelet Zurer could not make her presence felt anywhere in the movie. I still wish Ron has opted for Monica Belluci.<br/><br/>Go watch the movie, if you like fast paced thrillers with a plot twist at the end."

This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks? The storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax.

","After the ridiculous amount of hype that surrounded the release of The Da Vinci Code it was only a matter of time before Dan Browns ""other"" Robert Langdon novel got the big screen treatment with Ron Howard returning as director and Tom Hanks (sans mullet) playing the said Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>This time Robert Langdon finds himself embroiled in another church cover up when the Illuminati rise from the underground and attempt to destroy the Catholic church and the only man capable in the entire world, of stopping this event, is of course Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is fine as Robert Langdon and kudos for him for being brave enough to wear Speedos in todays critical era and to say some of his lines in such a straight and serious manner without sniggering. The rest of the cast were fine, although Ewan McGregors Irish accent faltered on many occasions.<br/><br/>The plot, like the novel, has enough twists and turns to keep the audience engrossed and some of the set pieces, especially the ""fire"" scene are very unsettling to watch. There was a good mix of suspense and action to break up all the talking and trips to the Vatican Archives (which was not anything like I pictured them to be when I read the book!)<br/><br/>The sets were gorgeous to look at - replica or not the locations were impressive.<br/><br/>No matter how intelligent this movie, or indeed any of Dan Browns novels claim to be, what they essentially boil down to is a grown up treasure hunt, with an intelligent man, sprouting exposition which, when read appears incredulous, but when spoken on the big screen, is at times down right laughable, in the chase to find this particular movies ""holy grail"". <br/><br/>I would give the movie 8/10 but perhaps that is being overly generous. It is a very entertaining movie granted, but the entire success of Robert Langdons mission depended solely on the fact that in 400 years not one of the cleaning ladies in Vatican City moved any of the conveniently placed statues which so helpfully (literally) pointed out the way in every church - either that or the Illuminati where in charge of the cleaning. <br/><br/>Dan Brown is given a lot of criticism for his writing. He is not going to be remembered amongst the great modern writers, but what he good at is tapping into all the clichés and tricks used to keep the reader hooked, with constant cliff-hangers and interesting snippets of fiction portrayed as fact and like him or loath him - it works. <br/><br/>Angels and Demons is a very watchable movie and the fact that these types of movies are still very profitable is probably a conspiracy Da Vinci would be proud of"

","Pointing out that Ron Howard is incapable of making a good film is too ordinary and obvious a thing to say. This time he got a cinematographer that at least frames things well.<br/><br/>You don't have to read me to learn that this thing is dull in all the ways that even the Nic Cage Treasure Hunt movies solve well enough.<br/><br/>But what I find fascinating is that the story — quite apart from the movie — is pretty well engineered. Its not a particularly good story, just that the targets and shifts seem to be more than competent.<br/><br/>Think how he has faked us out. We start with possibly the most standard of genre assumptions: the Church is a conspirator, suppressing the truth, the real truth. The treasure hunt through clues is really a search of the truth. It is the detective story turned into a thriller by adding malevolent power. The device is common, and uniquely American because it plays on the notion of noir, where unlikely coincidences are manipulated by watchers.<br/><br/>Brown in fact used this very idea in his first film, and we are primed to see it repeated. And he starts predictably, with a secret conspiracy layered over the Church, powerfully doing some sort of ""Seven"" inspired ritual killings. These of course also come from the detective genre, providing some cosmological order for the detective to discover and foil. We have a woman, who we suspect — because she is a brainiac —will provide some essential insight. And so we go puttering along in the genre track.<br/><br/>At the end, we have a twist. Now twists are so normal that we would feel cheated without one. But this twist is not a twist within the story, it is a twist that surrounds the very nature of the story, and defuses the whole notion of power and conspiracy that drives the thing. Here's what struck me; you know how when a revealing twist occurs and you have to go back and reinterpret all you know? Well in this case, what is dynamically changed is the very reason for the story. Without a consistent all powerful conspiratorial church that speaks through secret symbols, there is no agency that Mr Hanks' character can have. Unsettling, and a bit clever. Is it enough to recommend? No.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.<br/><br/>Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!"" <br/><br/>It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero."

","There is a saying: You snooze, you lose. In this case, you snooze, you come out better because at least you get a nap and not a head ache. This is terrible. It isn't anti-Catholic. It is just dumb and apart from some nice shots of the Vatican, absolutely worthless. Tom Hanks was so cute and had so much going for him. Now all I want is for him to go away and find a movie that Ron Howard has absolutely, positively nothing whatsoever to do with. Save your money, your time and a few brain cells. This one is a stinker. Of course it does have one very obvious virtue, everything that anyone associated with it does in the future will look a whole lot better by comparison. Anything would be better. A test signal would be better."

","If you truly wish to experience Angles and Demons read the book. The film is a long, tedious and disappointing history lesson. It lacks the drama and tension compressed in the page turning book. The cast cannot be blamed as they are at the mercy of a Punch and Judy script adaptation. Tom Hank's take on Robert Langdon is dull and uninspired; by the end of the film you are left wondering who is Robert Langdon? The Robert Langdon we see is a rambling bland man who cares a lot about absolutely nothing! He likes symbols, I get it, but love of symbols isn't enough to fly you to Rome and start dodging bullets! what is his motivation apart from ego? There is simply no depth to his character. What are supposed to be tense moments fall flat to the point that you don't care if a character is drowning, being burnt alive or branded with a hot iron rod.<br/><br/>Howard's Direction is over the top, his attempts to create atmosphere do nothing but make the scene look forces and overly CGI'd.<br/><br/>Save yourself two hours of life, go to the book store and buy the Dan Brown version. The journey on the way will be more thrilling than the film."

"katyani007","1","19","50","16 May 2009"," Pretty lousy movie with jerky camera movement
","There have been many comments on this movie so I need not say a lot. My chief complain is the jerky camera movement and close up shots. It appears that Hollywood directors are struggling to be able to provide a fast paced action filled drama in this age of short viewer attention spans, video games and the internet. So what do they do? They create an illusion of this by making the camera jerk a lot so that you get dizzy while watching the movie. The camera is also too close to the actors, almost like in their face.<br/><br/>As some of the commentators have mentioned the movie is nothing but a grown up treasure hunt. There is no character development, no realities of everyday existence, no deliberation on the interpersonal conflicts or bonds that may develop. Is this movie a mirror of our society?"

","Angels and Demons is one of my favorite books, so naturally I expected quite a lot from this film, and it totally lived up to my expectations. The thrill of watching this movie is not one that I often feel when watching movies. I would definitely say that this is in the top 5 movies I have ever watched.<br/><br/>Angels and Demons is basically about a Havard religious symbologist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who is trying to help save the Vatican from an old enemy (The Illuminati) who is going to blow the Vatican up (with Anti-Matter) at midnight on the night of conclave and kill 4 Cardinals. He teams up with Vittoria Vetra and some Swiss Guard members, and tries to follow the ancient Path of Illumination which is where the murders of the 4 preferiti Cardinals is going to take place. At the same time he is trying to figure out where the anti-matter canister is and save the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>The movie varies from the book a bit (like Kohler and Rocher don't appear, but the character ""Richter"" is basically a combination of the two of them), but the basic plot is the same.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed watching this movie and I am definitely going to get the DVD when it comes out. I totally recommend anyone to watch this movie."
"Dragonsouls","9","6","12","15 May 2009"," Better as a movie, rather then a book!
","I went to the Midnight showing Thursday night with a curiosity I haven't felt since the DaVinci code. Although the DaVinci code is a better book than film, Angels and Demons is just the opposite, directed and paced perfectly with a blend of action, mystery, and academic researching. Unlike Ron Howard's take on DaVinci code, this story was better in film form because it was concentrated and compressed superbly in the Screenplay.<br/><br/>The acting by Tom Hanks was light years ahead of his performance in DaVinci. He had some emotion behind his work, and the direction helps the actors too. Everyone was great here, especially Ewan McGregor playing an Scottish version of the Camerlengo perfectly, and straight out of the book! He was soft spoken and powerful at the same time. Supporting cast was decent enough, including a bigger formidable menace in the villain who was far more intimidating then Silas was.<br/><br/>I loved the cinematography, and it's the best in cinema history although limited in large exterior shots, besides St. Peter's square. The set combined with real locales made this film seem like a vacation to Rome.<br/><br/>As for the academic research, I can honestly say this film is accurate in my mind, being fascinated by the material. It's based on many facts and some theory and so it is easy to decide for yourself what the truth is. And what is probably just Dan Brown's theory. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a serious movie goer. It's a 2 1/2 hour film that feels less then that, a 9/10 score.<br/><br/>(Minor Spoilers) *Fans of the books: Be prepared for some twists!"

"janyeap","7","6","12","14 May 2009"," Fun, but short of the chilling thrills and suspense from Dan Brown's book
","Whoa, it's the return of Tom Hanks' Harvard University religious symbologist to the big screen, a little older perhaps, but... hey, wait a minute, isn't this film supposed to be a prequel to the $750 million box-office-""Da Vinci Code"" ? Still, Tom Hanks, as Professor Robert Langdon, is not failing to bring his audience on a roller coaster ride, less thrilling and less chilling than I had expected, having read the book. Sure, it hasn't miss out the church intrigue, evil and mysterious cults, murders, violence and the greed for power to wet the audience's appetite. Events flow rapidly as Professor Langdon pieces together the abundance of puzzles to bring some tension and some suspense... all for good fun for the screening crowd and keeping the readers of Dan Brown's novel rather miffed with the unsuspecting changes from novel's contents. Refreshingly new in some way, perhaps, but the events do lose their energized, tantalizing, and mystifying appeals as Professor Langdon search his brains for clues and answers.<br/><br/>The film's opening is remarkably crafted to open up the story's theme - science vs religion. Hey, the juxtaposition of science and church, after all, is really nothing new! And when Professor Langdon lays his eyes on the Illuminati ambigram, shown by a Vatican visitor, he is ready for Rome. Yep, a dead Pope... and the four Preferiti candidates in Rome are missing. But, will the Professor be able to find the Path of the Illumination? Yep, be ready for your imagination to be stimulated. Oh yes, be prepared to unravel the mind-blowing conspiracies involving the 'Four Alters of Science' - Earth, Air, Fire and Water, and expect to be rocked out of your senses to learn about the many unexplained and mystifying 'Illuminati"" symbols, vital to Professor Langdon in his quest to find the missing cardinals. Yep, a killer, from the mysterious ancient Illuminati secret brotherhood, is in Rome, on a vengeful quest against the Vatican's denial of science! And a highly powerful weapon of destruction, called the antimatter, is ticking close to midnight for the Vatican City's Armageddon fate. Can the symbologist save the Preferiti in time before the votes of the conclave are accounted? Can he save the Vatican City? The names of John Milton, Copernicus, and Raphael, are not spared in the Professor's race for clues. And expect to have fun, exploring some of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's celebrated creations... except everything is being rendered so visually fast to hinder the growth of one's fascination with Langdon's logic applications. I was expecting the version from Ron Howard, David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman to provoke and heighten my awe, disbelief, and admiration, as I follow Langdon's adventure. It failed!. Sure, there's nothing wrong for scriptwriters to take liberty with changes to their original sources. However, it can be rather discerning for the Dan Brown book fans to find their most memorable book moments are lost in the adaptation. No doubt, there are some new surprises to the story, but these fail to wet my emotional appetite to intensity. And the changes have reduced my shock and awe reactions. Unlike the book, it fails to lure me into wanting to revisit Rome. While Dan Brown's Rome reeks with compelling mystery and excitement, Director Howard's Rome is mostly dark, creepy, and unrelenting.<br/><br/>While the plot and subplots do capture some of Dan Brown's amazing twists and turns, rattling my brain's nerve tissues, it was Langdon's race against time that actually chills. Poor Langdon, he just can't avoid encountering deadly barriers! Oops, the story is not without the book's unconventional female protagonist, joining the Professor on his wild, 'wild-goose' chase to smoke out the villain's moves. Ayelet Zurer's antimatter scientist, Vittoria Vetra , may be watchable, but her Vittoria lacks excitement and curiosity, and, without the fascinating spirit, curiosity and energy of the book's character. Zurer's Vetra seems rather cold, prim, uninteresting, and her presence pretty irrelevant... not what I have expected Vittoria to be from the book's description - ""lithe and graceful, unmistakably Italian - not overly beautiful, but... exude a raw sensuality."" Besides, there's not one once of chemistry between Zurer's character and Tom Hank's in the film.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Ewan McGregor's Carmerlengo. He whisks in and out of sight without much ado, and yet, his presence is so astoundingly compelling. McGregor succeeds in bringing the unpredictable and charming Carmelengo directly from the book to the screen, with such absolute and immense exactness of characteristics of the novel's Carmelengo! My kudos to him! Stellan Skarsgard as Commander Richter does not disappoint. And Nikolai Lie Kaas's Assassin? He looks rather lame and passive, not the Dan Brown's mysterious, evil, and creepy Hassassin I was looking for. Of course, it's nice to see a film with a cast of international actors.... if only some of their characters don't look so awkward in their interactions. And while I miss the humor Dan Brown injected into his media characters, I am glad that this film is not missing out on how media folks can be so easily duped! I do miss the book's Agatha Christie-like style with which Dan Brown confuses and challenges one with inter-weaving and easy-to-miss clues and hints to keep one's brain cells moving helter-skelter before the final riddle is solved. Also, Ron Howard's film has not achieved in drawing me directly into the events as if I was there on the scenes. That said, I still wouldn't miss seeing Ron Howard's attempt to turn the book's 572-pages to life on screen in 138 minutes! The film may be scanty in its offering of memorable thrills and chilling suspense, it does, no doubt, give a very impressive visual observation of the lavishly and stylistically captured landlocked sovereign city-state with all the pomp and colorful ceremony, and... its enviable collection of some of the most famous and magnificent paintings, sculptures and architecture in the world."

","Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.<br/><br/>The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain! The Italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but I really applauded Ewan MacGregor portrayal: his inner faith and calm is really impressive.<br/><br/>I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. At last, I am not sure it helps to add new converts into Christianism. With all the gold and man presence displayed, any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers."
"woute","4","4","7","1 June 2009"," My movie recension for English
","Recension: Angels & Demons<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He directed also the famous TV-series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci Code,The Green Mile, Forrest Gump,) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,).<br/><br/>In the begin I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano). Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN. It was nice that they could film on location in the CERN.<br/><br/>Then movie goes on, They are spectacular car races in Rome. An I also like the part in Chirstian Archives very much when they destroy the work of Galileo, it was funny. It was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get on<br/><br/>I found It very stupid that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. In the book He is the real Son of the pope.<br/><br/>When I should give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti. The worst acting was from the assassin, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was underachieving, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous.<br/><br/>I think the whole movie is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some many stupid changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10."

","I had my doubts about seeing this film because of several bad reviews I had read. But I have to say that after seeing it, I dare say that it was a good adaptation from the book.<br/><br/>I read the book twice, last time, was a few weeks ago. And I found several of the plots a little bit corny and boring. However, the main plot and the characters were very good as well as all the twists.<br/><br/>The film starts a little bit slow, but it doesn't matter because they explain very well the conclave and what has happened in the Vatican.<br/><br/>I am very happy and pleased that they left the reporters out of the movie, since I thought they got a little bit unrealistic at some point.<br/><br/>I liked the portrayal of Vittoria Vetra, very much in character in the movie, more serious and more professional and she was even dressed in the proper clothes. I even found Ayelet Zurer to have more chemistry with Tom Hanks than Audrey Tatou in The Da Vinci Code a few years ago.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't agree was that they didn't address the true relationship from the Pope and the camerlengo. It would've been a great dramatic ending."
"Costa456","8","4","7","19 May 2009"," Surpasses Da Vinci Code by far
","I went to see this film on opening night, not expecting much because I was somewhat disappointed with Da Vinci Code. I had read both books and already after with DVC's outcome, I was nervous with Angels and Demons.<br/><br/>Let me just start off by saying that I think they should have gotten a new script writer rather than Akiva Goldsman. Seriously, he did a bad job of adapting DVC so why bring him back? It pleased me tho to see David Koepp who is more of an action script writer than anything. In the first 15 minutes of the film, you can tell that the tone is different from DVC and is a little more fast paced. The acting is somewhat a little better and so is the dialog(I'm assuming thats Koepps input). The story has been tweaked which bothered me but not to an extent where I wanted to walk out.After the first hour, I was already saying to myself that this film FAR SURPASSES Da Vinci Code. Ron Howards directing is sharper and the score of the film really makes your adrenaline spike with the thrilling scenes.<br/><br/>Ewans portrayal of the Cameralngo was really good and the rest of the cast did what was expected of them. The cinematography was excellent and all the sets were superb. The story itself was pretty good although it could have been so much better. All in all, the film was a pretty good adaptation although I think they should really get a new script writer"
"alexmail-2","8","4","7","16 May 2009"," Exceeds The Da Vinci Code in every way.
","As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons.<br/><br/>Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson.<br/><br/>Acting wise everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of any of the actors. He might even deserve a nomination come March, but doubtful. He had me convinced right until the very end. He's Dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the Church needs to put their past behind them. The minor actors also do very good jobs.<br/><br/>Technically and Visually the movie is much improved. The Cinematography is much...much better, and the Visual Effects are superb. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job, taking you through a tour of Rome.<br/><br/>Pacing wise, Ron Howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving, and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing Christianity. The movie also makes you feel like more is at stake. In our feeble minds discovering whether or not Jesus had children, is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason I think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score. I cannot say enough about the score. It was epic at times, like something from Lord of the Rings, but then sometimes it felt like a Bourne Movie, which is a nice mix.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched. The chances of the Carmelengo being someone of Ewan McGregors age are highly improbable, and the chances of a Cardinal with an adopted son getting elected Pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing, which has yet to be created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003...<br/><br/>Overall Angels and Demons is much tighter knitt, faster paced, more exciting, and more important movie than the Da Vinci Code. This is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one."
"Coneydogg","Null","16","42","23 May 2009"," Awful... quintessential definition of stale thriller
","Unfortunately, Angels and Demons is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema this year. (And I paid to see Pink Panther 2 for some reason) Was the book this bad? Could this movie have possibly been any worse? This movie was so uninteresting that I was tempted to get up and walk out, but I was still curious if they were going to actually find a conclusive end to their story. I'm sorry I stayed.<br/><br/>This movie is the quintessential definition of stale thriller. Very stale. I kind of feel sorry for Tom Hanks. He's too great of an actor and too much of a legend to be staring in a movie that's this bad. Hey Tom, next time don't sign a multiple picture contract. He had to have been signed BEFORE Da Vinci Code because even he must know how bad that turned out. Why do another? Word of mouth will smash this movie. This movie is just too dumb to succeed but, then again, there's the Tyler Perry rule that says even trash can generate gold."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","7","15","17 May 2009"," The book was banal, the film is marvellous
","That film had been expected for a long time because we knew the book and we had found the book slightly easy on some details and on the end. Luckily the director did some house-cleaning and got rid of the details of unbelievable absurdity like running around in Rome alone with no police help whatsoever and especially the end: to fall from the top of the sky directly into the river without a parachute, and survive. It also got the sentimental part out since it really brought nothing to the film and even made it weak. Then the film is better than the book. What are the stakes? The first stake is that of science: science does not aim at the truth because the truth is not rational. Science only aims at discovering some natural processes, trying to understand and reproduce them into a model of some kind, or even producing some natural element artificially. But that is not the truth about the existence of this world because, big band or not, the beginning of things has either to be negated and then we live in something that has no origin and will have no end. Question: Where does it come from? Or it has to be stated and then the question is: How did nothing produce something? This of course gives that nothing an existence and even an essence since that nothing has produced the present universe in which we are living, and us men at the same time. The second stake is about the human species. Is the ever-developing science of our world the result of an evolution of our species, hence of its capabilities that would be growing, or is it the cause of an evolution, that is selected by natural and social selection, of the human species that would grow new possibilities along with the new scientific knowledge and power it accumulates. That stake is far from being solved with some who want to believe that the intellectual and mental powers of man are inbred, are inborn, meaning then that homo sapiens has always had these capabilities; and those who see an evolution and explain the ever-growing capabilities of man as the result of his adaptability and flexibility, i.e. his purely material potential in the number of cells and the organization of these cells into organs, especially the brain, is always better used and more used than before, each step in his knowledge pushing him into restructuring his own use of his own cells, of his own organs, of his own body. What is inbred in him is in no way one particular capability in any field at all, even walking, but the potential to develop capabilities from the flexible organism he is. He did not have the inborn capability to use a language, but he had the structural ability to invent a language on the basis of the material need to communicate in order to rationalize the life of his social order based on transmitting knowledge to younger generations. The third stake that appears very clearly in the film is the nature of religion. The film manages to get away from the easy and superficial exposing denunciation of the anti-scientific obsession of the Catholic church. It shows how the ""purga"", the crackdown onto scientists in the sixteenth century from the church gave birth to a terrorist order that aimed at destroying the church. Here the film is short because it also produced the free mason movement, or at least gave it a new momentum and that movement is the ferment of the democratic development of history, not the terroristic destruction and negation of the church and even religion. The film shows very well that the reactionary trend in the church does not come so much from the top of its hierarchy as from some middle men who more or less infiltrated into the hierarchy and try to defend their privileges and their narrow-minded conceptions against the hierarchy itself. Note along this line protestant churches not having any hierarchy gives the whole power of the church to the middle men and some are extremely active in the anti-science, anti-democracy and anti-evolution, not to speak of their anti-freedom campaigns. The vision advocated by the film is that religion is – at least – a human invention necessary to organize and guide millions if not billions of people who need guidance in the narrow straits of life. That guidance can only be enlightened if it comes from a distant enough top of a hierarchy that is able to hear, listen to and feed on what the various levels of it can say, think, produce, advocate too. And that is the best part of it. The future of humanity is in the alliance of three different trends in our world: religious wisdom provided it accepts debates; academic and intellectual knowledge and research provided they accept the concept of relative-ness; and science(s) provided they accept they do not control the universe but only use it to produce the better-off future of humanity. And they all have to unite against two dangers: the criminals who want to appropriate inventions and knowledge for their own profit and politicians who are always trying to hijack the power this knowledge represents and provides in order to impose their own sectarian and fundamentalistic absolute and unethical power. In one word, this film is outstanding.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","Every time a new pope is selected the Vatican blows smoke in the air and it seems as though every time Dan Brown is ready to make another couple million, he blows smoke up an audience's ass. ""Angels and Demons"", sequel to the equally controversial ""The Davinci Code"", will no doubt come under fire from Catholics and movie fans alike, yet still be a license to print money somehow. It's tedious, one-dimensional, bland, and the action (if you even want to call it that) is not only boring but it's also ugly. And as for Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard, well, you don't hear much about either one slumming for a paycheck but it looks as though ""Davinci"" has started a trend.   <br/><br/>Hanks reprises his role as symbologist Robert Langdon, this time called to Rome by the Vatican to investigate the re-appearance of the secret scientific sect called the Illuminati. They have captured 4 Cardinals and are threatening to blow up the Vatican with anti-matter (basically much more lethal bomb). It turns into a race-against-time scenario when Langdon and physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) find out that the Illuminati appear to be killing the cardinals at the four alters of science. But are the Illuminati really behind this? They are aided by the Swiss Guard (led by Stellan Skarsgard). While this is all going on, the pope has recently died and the other Cardinals have been sequestered to pick a new one. Overseeing it all is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).   <br/><br/>Think ""Davinci Code"" without the big reveal in the middle. The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, is just a lot of running around. Langdon uses his theological knowledge to ridiculously make everything his compass. A pointing statue means go that way. A dot on a map here makes a cross so that must be the next place they have to go. C'moooooon! As they race from point A to B, director Ron Howard's rapid camera and Hans Zimmer's pounding musical score are poor substitutes for the plot's lack of thrills. There isn't much action. A one-sided shoot-out where an assassin basically just picks people off, some gruesome deaths (including two where characters are burned alive), none of it entertaining. Howard does a nice job of panning the camera along the various monuments and architecture of Rome but he can't save this tedious plot that completely jumps the shark in the third act with an obvious and hooey-filled conclusion.   <br/><br/>Hanks is a pro at comedy and drama but he gets next to none of those things here. Instead he's a stuffed-suit without the slightest hint of personality, spewing out knowledge but never anything worth caring about. McGregor gets a nice speech about the religion vs. science debate, which he knocks out of the park, and Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Mueller Stahl both offer some menacing intrigue but these characters suffer from a script that relies heavily on contrived plot conventions over interesting characters.<br/><br/>The movie deserves some defense from the Catholics. Leave it alone. It's garbage. People know it's garbage before they even enter the theater. In fact, why even go to the theater? These stories may offer some guilty pleasures about Church secrets and conspiracies but in all honesty you can barely even call them stories. ""Angels and Demons"" is the last in the Robert Langdon series that I know of, and with any luck, it will stay that way."
"lopcar1993","5","8","18","30 June 2009"," A die hard fan is please and here's why
","This movie is not like the book, and it doesn't pretend to be. No this film is meant to give you a whole new adventure and perspective of Langdon's first adventure. Angels & Demons was an awesome book it was earth shattering in the way it told Langdon's powerful rise from a world renowned symbologist to literary hero.<br/><br/>The source material for this film is not as popular as the one for the DaVinci Code, and that's is the main reason this film wasn't as well received by fans as the first, but this adventure is all the more better and has much of the things that the first film had to leave out as to tell the story. Like twice the suspense, twice the action and twice the fun. All In Angles & Demons delivers what the should have, a fun and action packed adventure.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives another amazing performance as the hard working and extremely intelligent symbologist that never seems to get a real day off, this film shows us an older and more reverent Robert Langdon, it shows us that Langdon has gone trough much change since his first adventure in Paris and London. We get to see Langdon become a full fledged hero instead of just some teacher trying to clear his name of murder. Now we have Langdon do what he does best, solving a 500 year old riddle and stopping an ancient secret society from destroying the Vatican.<br/><br/>This film is not fast paced as the trailer makes it to appear, it's a very mild paced film with some very fast and sweeping moments that you have to come back a second time just to see those parts again. But if you give this film a chance I know it will please you, I know there's no changing the minds some of the die hard fans but for those that have read the novel and are willing to give the film adaption a shot I can promise you, form being a fan of the novel myself that this film will not disappoint, it'll give you what you came for and a little more.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons is near- perfect and will have to go down as one of the best films of 2009 and is perfect summer entrainment for all people. And it delivers."

","This is absolutely one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible. Ridiculous plot, stupid ""twists,"" bad acting, Howard's directing is contrived and banal, with hokey dialogue. Since the source material is just stupid and vapid, what do you expect? Those seeking escapist fare look for something else, anything else, this makes ""17 Again"" look like ""Gone with the Wind."" This movie fails on every level, with the pacing kept at a manic pace so that you don't have time to think about the laughable plot. A movie should be true to the world it is in; this movie is not. Only the streets of Rome give any interest and some nice Bernini sculpture takes your eyes away from this tripe bag of garbage. What a waste of money and talent. Of course it will take in some $, but don't be fooled, this movie will make you howl in disbelief."
"tturwitz78","Null","17","47","18 May 2009"," A demonic waste of time and resources
","In short: this film simply does not work. It fails to engage and involve on every level. There is not a hint of character development, and the one-dimensional characters are little more than generic transporters of a weak and diluted plot.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible not to compare with the book when trying to understand why this movie fails so badly. The book may not be great literature, and it also suffers from a weak plot and poor character development (though nowhere near as badly as the film), but it still manages to be exactly what it sets out to be: page turning entertainment. The book is highly readable entertainment whereas the movie is, for lack of a better word, boring. Fast paced, but nonetheless boring.<br/><br/>We've seen it before: a fast paced story with lots of physical activity does not equal real action. On some level, we need to understand the characters and what drives them in order to get involved with the action. Furthermore, we need to be able to follow the story, and the action must make sense in this story, and carry it somewhere. Who hasn't already seen lots of fights, car chases and explosions? On their own, they are nothing new or exciting. It is only when we understand who is fighting/chasing whom, and why, that the action becomes meaningful and interesting. Story action is so much more than just elaborate stunts and CGI. It is about producing curiosity, dispensing information, character development and providing surprise. In Angels & Demons, we get none of that. We get to watch Tom Hanks jumping from one clue and its conclusion to the next at breathtaking speed, but it produces as much excitement as having last years lotto numbers read out at double speed.<br/><br/>There is a huge difference between a fast paced STORY and just fast pace...<br/><br/>In essence, watching Angels & Demons is similar to watching someone you don't know play a computer game.<br/><br/>Spare yourself the experience and save the money."

"classicalsteve","9","6","13","13 June 2009"," Outstanding Film That May Help Americans Learn About Relgious and Art History: Slightly Better than Howard's ""Da Vinci Code""
","There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.<br/><br/>The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.<br/><br/>And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.<br/><br/>Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.<br/><br/>The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.<br/><br/>Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD. If this is the best way for Americans to learn about their European cultural heritage, via an action movie, then so be it."
"vip_ebriega","7","6","13","30 May 2009"," Fast and exciting. a slight improvement over THE DA VINCI CODE.
","My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.<br/><br/>I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after ""exposing"" the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to ""The Path of Illumination"", the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.<br/><br/>I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.<br/><br/>With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"rogerdarlington","Null","6","13","18 May 2009"," an entertaining piece of hokum
","Three years after the Dan Brown novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" appeared as a film which took a staggering $760 million, another of his books receives the large screen treatment. Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.<br/><br/>Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide. It's a miracle that it works at all, but if you have faith, I confess that it's really quite an entertaining piece of hokum."

So, if somebody would please graciously hack that film into something with just the albino, I'd be satisfied; the film would no doubt be much more exciting than seeing the main character find evidence and clues in everything he finds; oh yeah, so what about this film?

","Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it. The best and to the point description of the film belongs to the official Vatican.newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which wrote it is a ""harmless entertainment which hardly affects the genius and mystery of Christianity"". I can't agree more."
"overcranked","6","3","5","15 July 2009"," Definitely better than The Di Vinci Code, but still lacking
","Angels and Demons is another movie adapted from one of Dan Brown's best selling novels. Like The Di Vinci Code before it, Angels and Demons pits symbology expert Professor Robert Langdon against a thought to be extinct society. Once again the Catholic church is targeted for humiliation and destruction. Instead of revealing a giant cover-up by the church, Robert Langdon unravels the reason behind four church officials being kidnapped and has to find them before they are murdered publicly one by one.<br/><br/>This story feels very familiar yes, but just as with the books I enjoyed this movie more than The Di Vinci Code. The story is more fantastic than the other one, although still grounded deep in historical facts and accurate knowledge of the workings of the church and government agencies that get involved. This element of the story is what draws people to these movies and the books that they are based off of. There is nothing like it out there. Most movies are far over the top of realism so that you can escape into the world on screen, but with Angels and Demons you feel like you are watching news coverage of an actual event taking place. You can easily put yourself into the shoes of the characters and have the adventure with them.<br/><br/>This face is probably the saving grace of this movie, because the acting sure isn't the greatest out there. While Tom Hanks has made some great movies ( we have all seen Forrest Gump and Apollo 13 ) this really isn't his best work. While it could have been the director mucking things up; I really think someone with his level of experience should be able to overcome such hurdles and turn out something on a higher scale than this.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed myself throughout the movie, even knowing the story and the ending. This definitely is more of a rental though. Seeing it in the theater did nothing to enhance the experience for me. I would much rather be comfortably in bed or on the couch watching this than pay the expense of the movie theater.<br/><br/>So, the final verdict is wait for the dollar theater or to rent Angels and Demons.

Now, I did not expect the movie to be completely like the book, and I of course knew some minor details would have to be taken out, but come on! It is like they took the book, ripped the pages apart and just scrambled the film back on random. There were such moments in the book that I was looking forward to that had just been taken out and tossed out the window. The start was different, the middle was different, the story was different.. Even the characters were different. There were some quotes that I actually got chills from while reading the book, and to be honest, it's a freaking book. It's not supposed to give me those sensations. A movie maybe, but a book? No no. But since I did get this sensation of awe, I was sure it would be multiplied by a tenfold in the movie. <br/><br/>I got chills once. And that was when it said the title at the start of the movie.

","Angels and Demons (2009)<br/><br/>An Awesome Trip to Christian Rome--Nevermind the Plot!<br/><br/>The plot? The plot zips along with an almost hilarious series of cliffhangers and twists of identity, but maybe necessarily. That's the kind of movie it is. It's a great ride, so hear me out.<br/><br/>The main scientist characters (yes Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks, though they give his character another name, and his rather dull female sidekick) need to solve a terrible mystery as the world awaits a new pope and a high tech bomb ticks away. There are underground chases and shootings, lots of fire and murder, and an inevitable helicopter scene (listen for the foreshadowing on that one). The hero becomes a villain, the villainous old men become passively agreeable (I never knew the cardinals were such a clubby lot, did you?), and the secondary villain gets his comeuppance without much fanfare or grief.<br/><br/>None of this, none of this, matters. Not really. This whole plot idea, not bad not good, is just a way to tour Rome and its Christian era art, especially Bernini. For that alone, it's worth it, and try to catch it in a theater, because the visuals are a treat. The camera-work isn't groundbreaking, but it's alive and gorgeous, thanks to Salvatore Totino (who also provided the one saving grace for the earlier and otherwise disappointing The Da Vinci Code). One scene after another has the camera moving (and moving, and moving) through chamber after church after street after piazza. The light, the art, the set design, and the ambiance (lots of flashlights needed) are great all along. There's even a vision of heaven, sort of, that would make Barberini happy (though without the bees, inside joke).<br/><br/>And what about the plot, with antimatter and the predictable Vatican intrigue? It is serviceable. Or better yet, it's perfect because it makes us take the Roman tour as fast as possible without being distracted by silly things like character or emotional depth. The acting isn't bad at all, led by dependable Ewan McGregor, who doesn't get a chance to take off his clothes (it might be on the editing room floor--let's wait for the director's cut someday, like in six weeks). Too bad the script is puerile--he has to give a speech about how science and religion are buddies, and then another about how science is the enemy of religion. Yes, a duplicitous priest. But that's part of the fun. All the old wrinkled men playing old wrinkled cardinals are fine enough, too.<br/><br/>Ron Howard directs the way he always directs--with the highest level of conventional craft. He knows how to make a movie move, edited tightly, and with visual panache. For those who can overlook the forced and sometimes preachy or teachy script, it might resemble a great movie. <br/><br/>But to me it's not a great movie. It's a great city. And I'll take Angels and Demons in its glib velocity because I can't get to Rome myself. In fact, I could watch it again today just for the ride. And that last scene, when they pull the curtain away and there we are behind the most famous balcony in the world, the light of the day pouring in and countless thousands of people cheering? Even an atheist can appreciate the aura of power and joy and absolute worldly hope of religion. A surprising tear jerker ending. That's good movie-making."

","Angels and Demons provided, well, ""angel"" and ""demon"" moments. Overall, while the movie's ""angel"" moments were worth the price of admission, it lacked a consistent flow as this Ron Howard directed film unevenly spewed the story of Robert Langdon and his defense against the secret brotherhood: The Illuminati.<br/><br/>The movie, like most Hollywood blockbusters, was heavy on plot, temperature-raising moments, and intricate details within the setting. I found these aspects of the film to be exceptional. The cat and mouse chase of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the unfolding conspiracy theories, the twists and turns of the Papal conclave along with the Swiss Guard provided an engaging and visceral experience. However, the attempts at developing the character of Langdon were vomit producing, at best. His horrid array of boring facts about every stationary historical item and attempts on comedic one-liners were unbelieving and silly. Furthermore, he was inconsistent in the level of angst he displayed over his situation. In one moment, we see Langdon calmly dealing with the incredible news of the Illuminati's involvement and the next, anxiously running to attempt to reach the Path of Illumination before the killer.<br/><br/>Based on the hard-to-believe plot, the attempt at creating dialogue about faith between Cardinal Strauss, the Camerlengo and Robert Langdon were unnecessary. Although director Howard is attempting to deepen this action-laced movie, it was a feeble attempt and one that was not appreciated. Furthermore, if anyone still believes every fact behind the conspiracy theories of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, let's get real! Dan Brown, the author of both ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons,"" developed history-laden conspiracy theories that have little to no factual backing. He ""lacks a principled approach to history, science and religion, and therefore spreads lies and half-truths that have been circulating in the occult world for the last hundred years,"" writes Dr. Ted Baehr, chairman of The Christian Film and Television Commission and publisher of online website MOVIEGUIDE.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has directed several blockbusters including Dan Brown's first novel-turned- movie The Da Vinci Code, Cinderella Man, A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13. Howard's movies typically display a rich and vibrant setting and context upon which to tell a story. He accomplishes this in Angels and Demons. However, unlike some of his previous movies, I find the characters of Langdon, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), and Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) to be shallow and one-dimensional. Ewan McGregor, playing the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, however, pulls an exceptional and deep portrayal of a complex character.<br/><br/>Because Angels and Demons provides more ""angel"" moments than ""demon"" ones, this movie is worth seeing despite the inefficiencies. Just don't expect anything more than an action- packed, complex thriller."

Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me.

"deathscythe_42","8","3","5","22 May 2009"," Not perfect but very entertaining, exciting, and suspenseful
","As a huge fan of the book, I was really excited to see this movie. I read both this and The Da Vinci Code (which actually follows Angels & Demons) before the movie of The Da Vinci Code came out, and while the latter was the one that everyone was crazy about and was the really controversial one, I thought it was a disappointment compared to Angels & Demons, and while it was still a very good book, I wasn't all that impressed with the movie version, and I found myself thinking ""I hope they make a movie of Angels & Demons, I bet that'll be a lot better."" Well, looks like I got my wish! And I must say that while it inevitably did not QUITE live up to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than The Da Vinci Code, and on its own I thought that, though not without its flaws, it was a very well done film.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the introduction of the film. They did a good job of presenting the two sides of the story, Religion and then Science, and then pulling you into the story. After that, the movie slowed down for just a little bit. It basically followed the same pattern as the book, it introduced the story and characters, and for a while had quite a bit of plot development to really build up what was going on. This was the main part that I thought could have been done a little better in the film. Not that it was done badly. The plot was presented well, and it was definitely interesting, but I felt like it just lacked a little bit of that cinematic feeling, it's hard to say what they could have added to it to make it better but I just felt like they could have made the plot events punch a little harder.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't drag for very long. Just like the book does, after the story is developed, it starts to pick up momentum very quickly and keeps you interested. I felt that they did a great job of giving you that suspenseful, time-is-running-out, race-against-the-clock feeling, the action is intense but not over the top, and the film stays tense and suspenseful until almost the very end.<br/><br/>The ending didn't quite have as powerful of an impact on me as it did in the book, but that may just be because i had already read it and already knew the story. Though I had pictured them doing it a little differently, it was still presented well, and one particular shot near the end I thought was quite spectacular (not gonna give away any spoilers though).<br/><br/>overall, other aspects of the movie were also quite solid. Good performances all-around (though probably none that will win any Oscars), great score from Hanz Zimmer, a few good chuckles of comedic relief here and there, etc.<br/><br/>All in all, though it has room for improvement and is not perfect by any means, this is a very entertaining, exciting and suspenseful film, and a very solid adaptation of the book. a few plot points where changed but otherwise it stays very true to the book and was very fun to see unfold on screen."
"amayitajr","9","3","5","22 May 2009"," Angels and Demons deserves the classic ""Two Thumbs up"" and its unfair that has a rate below of 8.
","Angels and demons is one of the greatest mystery movie I've ever seen in my life, it has a great suspense, great action, and of course disturbing deaths that will freak out anybody. I am writing this comment because is a crime to put this movie a rate below of 8. Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor, are a excellent working group. I didn't grade with a 10 angels and demons for a simple reason; the performance of Nikolaj Lie Kaas,The assassin, is very average for a movie as this. But anyway this is a very enjoyable Movie. Maybe critics didn't liked this movie, but as the Pink Panther 2 (even are very different genres), this is a movie for public, not for critics. If you watch the really grade of angels and Demons is 7.2, which is quite different from 6.9, the actual grade. Angels and Demons is more than just actors. The set its incredible, all the churches and the places that Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vettra went were just outstanding. My congrats to the people of special effects in this movie, its very disturbing the suicide of the carmelengo and the deaths of three of four cardinals are very scary. Finally to the people who are going to watch this movie: ENJOY IT!"
"paulboros","7","3","5","18 May 2009"," It all depends on if you read the book.
","If you did not, this movie is pretty good. Well paced, well- explained with timely exposition, well cast and well plotted. No dangling loose ends. Highly entertaining.<br/><br/>The problems are only for the people who did read it<br/><br/>****LAST CHANCE TO AVOID SPOILERS******* Ron Howard (One of my favorite Directors) appears to have made way too many arbitrary changes that don't advance the plot. Here they are in the order that they occurred to me while watching the film.<br/><br/>1st, CERN does not bring in Langdon, the Vatican does. This cuts out the entire CERN Director 11th Hour Samaritan plot line. The first brand is not actually a brand but a fax copy of the Illuminati ambigram. I can argue this either way due to time constraints but I did not like it. 2nd, Olivetti is no longer the Swiss Guard commander for reasons that make no sense at all. This makes Richter the new Swiss Guard commander with Olivetti in a support role. The film lists this as part of the jurisdiction nightmare that is Vatican City. Since Olivetti dies on schedule, this makes no sense to me. Richter could still have done his part. But without the CERN director Richter takes that role in trying to unmask the Camerlengo with a new character taking Richters place as the second person to die as an Illuminatus in the Papal office.<br/><br/>Since the director is no longer in the film this has to be done by someone. Might as well be Richter. 2nd a. It is made clear that the events unfolding are after the DaVinci Code not prior as it was written. Again I am sure that this was to avoid confusion to the people who had not read the book. 3rd, Changing the professional killer from an ASSASSIN from the Middle East with Misogyny issues to a paid professional actually worked for me. Right up until this paid killer actually takes a vehicle, prepared by his employer, which is supposed to have his final payment. No way would that happen. A hired hit man has to worry about his employer as well as the authorities. Someone who did that job for a living would not just walk into that lame trap especially after all the other payments had been EFT to his Isle of Man Account. If I am not mistaken, the Isle of Man is a tax shelter that has very strict banking laws about giving account info to anyone. Cops included. Since this guy is no longer a misogynist that takes away the entire Vittoria has been kidnapped for immoral purpose plot. This takes away Langdon's more personalized reason for wanting to find the Temple of Illumination. Okay that means we never hear about Yoga or that Landon never gets his carnal reward by having hot, wild, intense sex with a Yoga Mistress. For personal reasons, I will say that is something not to be missed if the opportunity is available, BELIEVE ME. Also, no fight between the Assassin and Langdon & Vittoria. I wanted to see it. 4th, Langdon saves the fourth preferiti, Cardinal Baggia. I will refer back to this because it allows a major change. One that serves no purpose that I can tell. 5th, they removed all reference to the Illuminati Diamond. They changed the 6th Brand into a set of crossed keys to indicate the Papacy. Why? This change served no purpose. 6th, as a direct result of the 4th change, we get a condensed version of the Camarlengo's divine revelation of where the Antimatter is. Again I believe this to be a time constraint versus Plot pacing. Could be argued either way. 7th, Langdon does not get into the helicopter with the Camarlengo. This COMPLETELY removes the saved by possible divine intervention sub-plot. One of the things that I truly wanted to see in this film was Langdon's Fall and Survival. This is where the filmmaker lost me. That scene is pivotal to this story. The Camarlengo is SEEN using a parachute rather than the appearance of Divine Intervention which also negatively impacts the story, in my opinion. 8th, Instead of an audio recording of the conversation between the Director and the Camarlengo, we get video from Richter's office. I won't quibble about this except to say I preferred the scene as it was written in the Sistine Chapel. 9th, We don't get to hear the Camarlengo defend his actions to the entire College of Cardinals. Granted we do see him try to justify himself to Richter so I guess the exposition is in there but because of the way it was done we lose the entire Pope as actual parent to the Camarlengo due to artificial Insemination of his former Nun mother sub-plot. AS stated in the book, the use of artificial means meant that the Pope was still celibate and therefore not in violation of church law. I can only assume that this was removed to keep the peace with the Catholics since they don't seem to be very reasonable on this issue. This is just my opinion and is not meant to offend but merely clarify. Reasonable people can disagree without reducing their opponents to evil caricature. A direct result of this revelation to the Camarlengo was his self-immolation. Instead we have a priest who is running from authorities and decides to kill himself. I prefer the book version. 10th, in a direct result of 4th change, Cardinal Baggia is elected Pope instead of the Great Elector cardinal. No reason given. No reason for this change that I can see. Totally arbitrary and without purpose. Mr. Howard and Mr. Hanks had me until the helicopter and from then on I was extremely disappointed in how the story plays out. I am truly sorry that these changes were made and will continue to prefer the book."

","If anyone thinks this mess of a movie and its poor presentation is a quality film then they are just fooling themselves. It's OK to praise a quality director (which he used to be... what the heck happened, Ron?) but at least let his latest effort earn that praise. It doesn't make you a true movie connoisseur to rave about an idiotic movie just because huge names are attached. It makes you a pathetic follower who can't use his or her own head and feelings to decide what is good. Forget the individual award nominations that are based on reputation. This movie is just flat out bad even if it is Ron Howard pointing the camera at Tom Hanks. They need to break up and go their separate ways because their collaboration peaked on Apollo 13 and is now destroyed in flames by Da Vinci and this terrible sequel.<br/><br/>Skip the movie and get the same thing from one of those crazy Tom Cruise anti-Christian interviews. Bizarre context mixed with a lot of head scratching. Preposterous movie that never let's you go with any flow or enjoy the movie on any level."
"nickyxmas","3","10","27","27 May 2009"," Lighting up the Ridiculous
","Before we start this action packed, edge of your seat review of Angels and Demons I am going to take a little time out to explain to you what a film review is, the origins of film criticism and why knowing this will help you understand the subsequent paragraphs. Now you might be thinking, this is a little long winded I want to get to the action, I can pick up on the theory as I go along Well if you are thinking this, and I wouldn't blame you, I wouldn't recommend you see Angels and Demons! <br/><br/>Let me attempt a brief overview of where we are before we hit the main review (Ron Howard, David Koepp take note). Following on from the critically panned but box office success of The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown's novel Angels and Demons reunites Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in another religion come politics come art history romp against time. There done! Having read both Dan Brown novels, Angels and Demons is by far the more entertaining book and should on all counts be a better film, which to be fair it is However this is like saying being crucified upright is better than being crucified upside down – there really isn't much in it and either way it is going to be pretty miserable.<br/><br/>One of the many criticisms thrown at The Da Vinci Code was the film's inability to balance the historical storytelling with the modern day action, which in the end slowed the narrative to a plodding lethargic bus ride of a movie. Ron Howard has obviously listened to his critics; by stripping a lot of unnecessary narrative from the book the overall film seems much lighter on its feet, which in general is a good thing. Langdon jumps in cars and runs around Rome with a map in this one! However and here is my big concern the dialogue is appalling. We still have the tour book commentary from the know-it-all Langdon, who doesn't talk to people he lectures them. The plot twists are inevitable and completely ludicrous and don't even get me started on Ewan McGregor's accent or ability to fly helicopters. If you thought Sean Connery's Irish accent was bad in The Untouchables MY GOD! The joy of discovery is totally lost in this film with over explanation after over explanation completely bombing any finer detail out what could have been a decent if not particularly clever plot.<br/><br/>Condescending, unsophisticated and ultimately ridiculous The Vatican must be wondering what it was so worried about. This film isn't anti-Catholic it is anti-intelligent."
"vcengen","7","4","8","20 August 2009"," The movie and the book must be evaluated separately
","Two days ago, I've finished reading the Dan Brown's novel and right after I've watched the movie.<br/><br/>First of all: Do not ever do like this! :) (I'm talking not only for ""Angels & Demons"" but for all novel adaptations.)<br/><br/>Because the novel will cloud your judgement about the movie. Yes, I totally agree with the comments saying ""the movie is way different than the book"" but it is impossible to adapt a whole book for a certain amount of time. Therefore changes are inevitable.<br/><br/>Considering that, I might say that the movie is an above average Hollywood production with lots of action and mystery. My point is 6.5/10.<br/><br/>Like I wrote, I can understand changes but why did they change some names of characters? (Like Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca - Camerlengo Patrick McKenna or Cpt.Rocher-Cpt.Richter) That was the only thing I couldn't understand."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","26 July 2009"," The injection of pace and energy makes it much better than the first film even if it is only ""reasonably good""
","The Pope has died and the four favourites to replace him have been kidnapped by someone who threatens to kill them one by one. Meanwhile a canister of anti-matter (the ""God particle"") has been stolen from the CERN project – a canister that is not only highly destructive if used incorrectly but also will becoming increasingly unstable and eventually cause great destruction at midnight. Those behind these crimes claim to be the Illuminati, the organisation of science that was thought to have long since been destroyed. The nature of the mystery and the pressure of time causes the Vatican to turn to measures they would not have considered in any other situation – bringing in Professor Robert Langdon to lead the race against time.<br/><br/>The sequel to the Da Vinci Code was not something that particularly appealed to me given that I struggled to care or even stay awake through that first film. Angels & Demons though manages to address some of the key problems with the first film – although it cannot address them all because of the source material. What I mean is that it cannot make the plot into something that seems less silly than normal and the storyline does feel a little daft at times. What helps both the film and the plot is the biggest and best improvement that the makers have made – the pace. Where the first film was full of seriousness and worthy to the point of tedium, this film has energy and pace to it that makes the whole thing seem a lot more interesting than it is.<br/><br/>We race from clue to clue, we have action sequences and so on and the speed to it helps cover up the weaknesses in the plot, with talking minimised to what is required to have the next running sequence. This is a bit weaker than one would have hoped though, because it does give the film a very episodic feel at times – with a talky bit, then speeding cars and action, then a bit more talking and then more running. Despite this though, it does work pretty well as long it is doesn't hang around too long between action parts and doesn't spend too long on serious religious imagery. When it does do this it flags surprisingly quickly and does start to feel a little heavy but Howard wisely keeps this from happening too often, making it more accessible and with the air of a more enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The cast work with this well enough. Hanks spends more of this film doing a traditional ""action hero"" type role with lots of shouting and less theorising – perhaps to the annoyance of some but it is what the film calls for. McGregor is so-so here, his accent is odd and his character clear but he is another star in the film so taken as such by me. Zurer fills the Tatu role with not a lot to do or offer beyond her easy looks. Skarsgård, Mueller-Stahl and others give their usual performances to good stead but this is never an actors film so much as that of Howard. As director he doesn't exhilarate but he is a professional man with a lot of resources so he makes the film look good and uses the camera well to provide pace – hardly Bourne stuff but still good.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons is an OK film, which may not sound like praise but it does represent a real improvement on the dreadfully dull first film. It has the same core problems but the pace covers a lot of other sins and makes the film feel more engaging and exciting than it probably should have done. I'm not sure I want a third film in this mould but this sequel at least manages to raise itself to be ""reasonably good"", for which it (sadly) deserves mention."
"FilmOtaku","5","4","8","23 June 2009"," Adequate & Dull
","You just can't keep a good symbologist down, apparently, no matter how hard the religious ne'er-do-wells try. Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is back to decoding religious symbols in an attempt to save the world, or some aspect of it at the very least. This time he is helping the Vatican decode a plot hatched by the Illuminati against the Catholic Church (timed with the Pope's death) as retribution for the church's mistreatment of the secret society centuries ago. Now they are wreaking their revenge by threatening the lives of four cardinals, and ultimately, blowing up Vatican City with a nifty little stolen gadget called anti- matter and it's up to Langdon to find and solve the clues in a four hour time span. <br/><br/>With all due respect to the millions of people who read this book and went nuts for it, there was absolutely nothing about this story that I found interesting. Though I actually really enjoyed reading The Da Vinci Code (and this is the first and last time I'll compare the two novels/movies) and had high hopes for this book, when I tried reading Angels and Demons I couldn't get through the first 30 pages without giving up because I found it to be incredibly boring. I can barely even keep my eyes open reading the synopsis I wrote about the movie and that's my own writing. I didn't buy that they were working urgently (it seemed like an hour was more like a ""movie hour"" of about an hour and a half at least) and found the developments and ""twists"" so obvious that I entertained myself by pretending I was as smart as Langdon and could figure out the riddles just because the camera pointed out the answer to me. (""Of course it's under the floor – one of the three dozen angels' arrows is pointing right at the spot!"") And speaking of predictability, I was once again intellectually offended by a filmmaker forcing several possible villains down my throat in a bid to be suspenseful. Honestly, good writing and direction is all you need, not five people giving furtive sidelong glances like the shifty-eyed dog on The Simpsons.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was decent, though certainly not inspired. Tom Hanks always seems very natural in his films, and I was pleased to see one of my favorite contemporary actors, the under-valued Stellan Skarsgard in the film. Once again, however, the female lead (Ayelet Zurer) was completely ineffectual and Ewan McGregor simply chewed scenery without a lot of panache. I also don't know when Armin Mueller-Stahl become completely unintelligible, but I couldn't tell you most of what he said in the film because I couldn't understand a word he said.<br/><br/>Having completely bagged on the story and an elderly German actor, I do now have to admit that the movie was actually somewhat easy to watch, if only in an ""I don't feel like I'm completely wasting my time"" way, the same way I will watch a Lifetime Movie Network flick to fall asleep. Realizing this sounds fairly negative, one has to look at Ron Howard's films in general: They are always easy to watch but not challenging, and adequate but not exciting. Unless someone is really interested in a subject matter that he covers, I think that his films tend to be the culinary equivalent of a Little Debbie snack cake. They are good when you're hungry, but other things are so much better; yet, you know what you're getting into when you take a bite. I really enjoyed Frost/Nixon after seeing it, but I'm also a history nerd, and the interesting thing about that movie was after seeing all of the other Best Picture nominees of last year, it quickly fell to a definite last place in the running for me. On a definite positive note, however, I can say that, whether the locations were simulated or not, as an art and architecture lover I thought the location shots were great, and my experience was further enhanced by my parents leaning over occasionally to whisper, ""We were there!""<br/><br/>I can't completely pan Angels and Demons, but I also don't have a lot of good things to say about it either. The best thing I can truly say about it is that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, which is sometimes all you can ask for in a summer popcorn flick."
"sker_paul","1","4","8","23 June 2009"," What a Shame!
","Potentially I think if the film was set out and directed as the book portrays, this film could have been one of the best and most exciting films ever made. Unfortunately the film looks as if the directors and producers bought the cliff notes from the library and made the film on that. <br/><br/>To be honest i am actually half way through the book and managed to get hold of a copy of the film and gave in to watching it. Luckily I stopped watching the film after 15mins so I still don't know how the story ends and will carry on reading the book. Within 5 minutes of the film I had got as far as I am in the book.<br/><br/>When you read a book you can imagine exactly how it would look like if it were made into a film but within the first 5 minutes every perception I had was completely changed. The first part of the book is extremely important when Langdon goes to CERN meeting Kohler and Ms Vetra being none the wiser about her father. IT SETS THE SCENE!! and they have missed all off it. <br/><br/>I would love to see a remake of the film but I'm sure its very unlikely. I would be happy if they completely re-made the character Robert Langdon with an unknown actor and started again from scratch because, although I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code (film), for the sheer brilliance of the book I think someone could have done a lot better with it and potentially made one of the most interesting and exciting set of films within recent years. Dan Brown should feel hard done here (although I'm sure he's isn't short of a few quid after the book release), if the film had the right directors behind it and followed the book more thoroughly, Dan Brown would be sitting on a gold mine."
"saiyanhajime","8","4","8","28 May 2009"," anti religion? no... but still a bloody good film!
","The Da Vinci Code was a poor film, but this is a great one. Angels and Demons, I thought, was the better book. Whilst The Da Vinci Code sat faffing about with weak theories presented as facts, Angels and Demons got on with a story. I think the action packed adventure across Rome of Angels and Demons translated better onto the screen.<br/><br/>I can't help thinking that this film Is getting a lot of negativity for no real reason. Many people seem to have missed part of the plot... The story shows that not only the Catholic Church have become corrupt, but the Illuminati representing science have too. You could interpret the story to to be about man's flaws. This film is in no way anti-God/religion/Catholicism, it's unbiased.<br/><br/>So if you're religious and put off this film, frankly I think you should give it a go.

Of course with the flop which was ""The Da Vinci Code"" I was naturally pessimistic about Angels and Demons the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the Fisherman's ring being destroyed and the Pope's funeral. For the first 15-20 minutes of the movie definitely starts off on a down beat but as soon Robert Langdon arrives in Vatican City things start to pick up, for me, the next part of the movie is action packed and -even though I'd already read the story and so already knew what was going to happen- it was most definitely edge-of-the-seat-stuff. The last bit of the movie where all the bits and pieces are put together for both the characters and the viewer is thankfully not as action-packed. You definitely can't go into the movie expecting to just have a easy ride, you need your brains in gear to fully understand everything and to get all the points in the end because otherwise the movie will seem like just a load of sub-stories brought together into some obscure storyline.<br/><br/>People who feel that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was a let down and ruined a perfectly brilliant and best selling novel by one of the top authors of our time will be very glad to hear that ""Angels and Demons"" does in fact do fantastic justice to a brilliant book."

I did love the scene when the ""Mastermind"" of the events takes his life, it was dark, chilling and decisive (although, again - rushed.) There are also some things truncated from the novel that might have benefited the transition from prose to filmic adaptation; if only to balance how greatly the story suffers from excluding the themes in the novel I have repeatedly mentioned.<br/><br/>Just like The Da Vinci Code, the film falls above average in terms of overall execution, and Ron Howard has enough versatility to create beautiful shots, riveting action scenes but ANGELS AND DEMONS is bogged down with some slow scenes that may probably only effective as introspection on a novel's page. The last issue I have is the pretentious operatic motifs by Hans Zimmer within the score; I like the ""main Da Vinci Code theme"" and some of his subtler, slowly pulsating suspense movements that he does best.<br/><br/>ANGELS AND DEMONS as a movie is very, very watchable - but as early as now, I can say it might also be forgettable.<br/><br/>8/10"

The writers had a hard task of transferring this to the big screen, and while they could not get every single detail in, they do stick with the main source of the plot, so it is still a decent enough movie.

I found myself wishing for his presence in the movie.<br/><br/>(2) The LHC project of the Vetra and her partner/priest?? was by no means a secret project, as portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>(3) The movie didn't make it clear how the Illuminati symbol played into the movie, making me wonder it's relation. In the book, it was clear that the symbol had been branded on Vetra's chest, but in the movie no such thing was shown clearly.<br/><br/>(4) In the book, St. Peter's Square is said to be devoid of much media or bystanders, but in the movie the whole square is filled from the very beginning of conclave with dozens of news teams and a plethora of worshipers.<br/><br/>(5) Where was Gunther Glick? Come on!<br/><br/>(6) There were no fight scenes between Langdon and the Hassasin, nor was the Hassasin portrayed as very evil, as he was in the book. He has three fights with the Hassasin, which, after reading the book, I was really looking forward to seeing them come alive in the movie. However, they were completely left out and instead of Vittoria killing the Hassassin, his car blew up? Yeah, I didn't get how that tied in or who blew it up. Another unnecessary point of change.<br/><br/>(7) Vittoria was never taken hostage.<br/><br/>(8) Commander Richter (whoever that was) is the scapegoat for the carmelangos' plans, unlike Kohler in the book. I didn't really get how this played in at all, and I had no clue who Commander Richter was anyway.<br/><br/>(9) There was no love connection between Langdon and Vetra. Come on! This could have been portrayed so amazingly in the movie, but they choose to leave it out?! What were they thinking?<br/><br/>(10) Langdon doesn't go up in the helicopter, nor does he find the incriminating video from Kohler or even from Commander Richter.<br/><br/>(11) The coolest symbol of all is not included, but instead is..... keys? What?<br/><br/>(12) The ending is different, the carlemango's death is different, the elected pope is different (apparently the last cardinal of the preferiti is saved by Langdon).<br/><br/>(13) This is out of order, but the scene between Langdon and the Hassasin was totally left out. This was a really important fight and an important part of the book, I thought, and it was totally left out.<br/><br/>Some of these differences might seem insignificant, but in my view they really changed the plot for the worse. As is often with remakes of good books, the movies can't hold up to the great plots of the book. I think in this case, the book was a lot better than the movie. For that reason, and some others having to do with the constant action, confusion caused by the ""new plot"" of the movie among others, (5/10)."

","Angels and Demons is a decent sequel with some flaws which I'll get into later from director Ron Howard whose admirable in making this movie based on a popular book by Dan Brown. Tom Hanks returns as symbolist Robert Langdon who finds himself in another race against time to save four kidnapped Cardinals and somehow prevent a terrorist attack against the Vatican by a legendary secret brotherhood thought to have been extinct known as the Illuminati. Hanks is good as always in the role of Langdon who would give Nicolas Cage's Benjamin Gates from National Treasure a run for his money decoding ancient scriptures. The rest of the cast including Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are good as the supporting characters. The film does have a fast pace but some flaws with character development, and a predictable twist near the end I sort of saw coming weighed it down a bit. I still thought the movie was decent though. The action is well executed but there are many moments when it's just go, go ,go, go, go, with not a whole lot of time in between to get to know the characters more. Overall with it obvious plot twist and other flaws aside Angels and Demons isn't that bad of a movie. It could've been better but if you're a fan of the Davinci Code than chances are you'll enjoy this one just as much. This film has action, drama, some suspense, and little humor with good performances by the cast especially Tom Hanks who makes this sequel worth watching at least once."

","I'm glad I didn't get to spend a lot to watch Ron Howard's Angels &  Demons in the big screen, or else I would have to garrote myself. I'm  stingy that way: A fair price for a fair quality, good enough for a  principle. Nevertheless, the movie is one heck of a cuss word buffet,  which reminds me again to NEVER watch book-based flicks.  Apparently, there are many inconsolable twists in the film version,  that for a non-reader, it would be confusing at best. The stupid  impression is that everything happens in 24 hours and Howard cannot  compress it into 90 minutes or so. Gazillion characters. Too much  crowds. Flit there, flit here.  The genius description of the branding is altered by the passable  visuals. Dammit, I'm supposed to be grossed out but all I get is,  ""That's it?"" The only part fitting is the toasting of Cardinal Guidera  at Santa Maria della Vittoria. Crackling fire. Howling old man. Check.  The greatest antithesis though is the Hassassin. He's not that scary  enough. And setting me to swallow myself whole is the mad lack of  madness of the mad camerlengo played by Ewan McGregor."

","Each and every person I speak to about this movie turns out to be someone who has had the time to read the novel by Dan Brown of the same name on which this movie is based. And each person gives a report about the movie and at the end of it says only one thing - ""The novel is far better."" And before I say anything about the movie, there is this comment that I would like to make about the people who, not only about this movie but also about other movies based on popular novels, have to say - ""The novel is much better."" Once in our Science class we were cheerfully told not to add buffaloes to sheep. (To illustrate a concept called dimensional analysis.) The relevance here is that it is very unfair to any movie to keep uplifting the novel and lower the level of appreciation for a movie.<br/><br/>How do you compare the two media? One medium has the luxury of spreading all that there is to know across 600 pages and maybe even more of pages that are printed in small font-size. This same medium has the luxury of spending as much time as possible to develop the characters and give them dimensions that the readers can identify with. If the author decides to introduce something bordering on being crap, he has all the pages in the world pouring out necessary text to make it sound convincing to the common reader. What can a movie do? Each second of a movie has some thousand dollars of expenditure behind it. The length has to be limited. What will a movie maker do? He cannot deliver your novel on the screen word-to-word. I do not believe in the comparison. It is lame and meaningless to me and hence I do not like to hear the phrase - ""The novel is better."" Yes, it is lame for me to hear text and reader imagination being compared to the difficulty of direction, scripting, visual effects, sound, etc. working to in sync to tell a story.<br/><br/>Now, coming to the movie Angels and Demons, it obviously changes the story so that it may fit into the time limits of a movie. I ask the question - ""Is there anything believable about the plot of the movie?"" No. There is hardly anything that is quite believable. But does that make it a bad movie? The answer is again a no. Surprisingly, in spite of sheer lack of believability this movie entertains and excites. And especially for the person who has not had the chance to see the Vatican, gives a wonderful tour of the city. The photography is damn amazing. It gives a wonderful portrayal of a city filled with beautiful structures that are symbols of the vast history of that land.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' character has not great dimensions to it. There really was no challenge for an actor of his caliber in the movie. After all the hard work and concentration he had to do in all his other movies, here is a role that really did not demand the actor to use his skills to the fullest. He probably did it because he enjoyed playing the role in The Da Vinci Code. The other members of the cast do their jobs well. There are some short comings in the script time to time where things get a little too absurd but the movie pulls on somehow.<br/><br/>The sheer speed of the story is too much. And it is this speed that takes out a lot of believability from the movie. But then, there are so many other movies that break this law by showing a race against time. So, why condemn this one? Just because it is based on a popular book that seems to have too many hardcore fans? Don't get me wrong! All I am trying to say is the the movie does a good job in giving you an overall idea of the plot. Sure, it may not develop its characters for that would compromise on the excitement and urgency of the situation. But what about the photography? The Sound? The effects? They are all well done.<br/><br/>On a personal level, I myself would love to see a lot of changes to the movie perhaps to make the plot more real. But then the movie would contend to satisfy critics and loses its viewers. Overall, a good watch!"
"gay_panzygrl","5","2","3","27 May 2009"," A Right Mix-Up
","Well, who thought there could be a worse hash of a Dan Brown book made? the Da Vinci code now looks like an accurate representation of it's book compared to Angels and Demons. <br/><br/>Firstly I want to state that the middle chunk of the film with the chasing on the Path of Illumination, is a fair, if not great piece of work; small things like the Vatican Police entering the archives as opposed to Vittoria can be looked over, but the beginning and end- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?<br/><br/>It was annoying enough to see Vittoria find her father dead, but how come he wasn't called Leonardo? what was the reason for changing a name? I understand that films usually have to cut content in order to not make a film too long but a name is hardly of consequence. Also there should be no research team involved, and what happened to Maximillian Kohler? I'm surprised the story made sense without him.<br/><br/>after these atrocities things got better and it was a most exciting story.<br/><br/>But allowing Cardinal Baggia to survive was yet another plot change, as much as I want the man to survive he isn't meant to. Also how did he know where he was being held? for instance he wouldn't recognise castle ST Angelo and Il Passeto hadn't been used for years (apart from the camerlengo) and when he was driven away he would have been tied up and not able to see.<br/><br/>so In finality I must say that the film is great in parts and I would see it again, if only to give visual aid to characters better represented in books, but the ending and beginning were a real mix-up."
"seaview1","7","2","3","25 May 2009"," Angels and Demons-An Improvement
","Dan Brown's phenomenal bestseller, The DaVinci Code was made into an equally successful film adaptation. Angels and Demons, while actually a prequel to that book, has been adapted into a movie sequel, and the results are certainly more promising. Director Ron Howard and actor Tom Hanks reteam for a better telling of intrigue, murder, and suspense amid a historic and religious setting. Essentially an almost real-time thriller which jumps from ancient landmark to landmark, this film actually works pretty well within its own confines and is thus a satisfying entertainment without getting sidetracked on the holy mission of revelatory discovery and truth that its predecessor got tangled in.<br/><br/>A scientific breakthrough in a Swiss laboratory generates powerful, anti-matter particles. When a mysterious group steals this deadly material, they threaten Vatican City with annihilation. The plot thickens when four Cardinals, in consideration to succeed the recently deceased Pope, are kidnapped and threatened with hourly execution at a holy site. Despite his purely scientific, empirical measure of the world, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks with a normal hairdo this time) is whisked from Harvard campus to Vatican City where he is joined by Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) whose lab created the stolen particles. Together, they attempt to locate the Cardinals and the anti-matter particles. We meet the Vatican Police guard and their protocols and protectiveness over not only the church and its members, but its archives which are at the heart of Langdon's quest for clues. The Pope's assistant, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), the Vatican Guard Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard), and elder Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) participate in the investigation. History (according to Dan Brown) has it that in 1668, four scientists or free-thinkers known as the Illuminati were kidnapped, branded and executed by the church. Now a darker version of the Illuminati is ready to exact an 'eye-for-an-eye' revenge on the church, and they intend to finish the job with one big bang of anti-matter. The clues lead to the four elements of fire, water, air and earth, and perhaps more. What do these have to with actual church locations? Complicating the proceedings is a mysterious assassin who carries out the lethal agenda with unerring accuracy even as Langdon, Dr. Vetra, and the police attempt to prevent further bloodshed. Should Vatican City be evacuated as thousands of people hold a vigil for the new Pope? Can everyone be trusted even in the most sensitive and elite of holy circles? These questions are raised as Langdon desperately searches for answers to save the Vatican.<br/><br/>Having not read the original novel, I feel the film does work on its own which is more than can be said of its predecessor which got lost in self importance and confusing exposition. Screenwriters David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Spiderman) and Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) have tried to streamline and condense Brown's immense, detailed novel into a serviceable story, which focuses on a race against time and is a pretty decent mystery without having the 'holier than thou' agenda. References are made to Langdon's previous adventure with The DaVinci Code, but the film wisely stays on course almost in actual-time so that the suspense level is ratcheted up progressively until the potentially explosive climax.<br/><br/>There are some shortcomings to the film. There is a lot of material covered here so it seems a bit episodic, and plot details that beg for a more patient explanation are raced over. The characters are not sufficiently fleshed out to give more meaning to what happens later. All we get are some brief notes of each person's background to go forward; that is a missed opportunity. Perhaps Dan Brown's book did not give much in the way of detailed history for his players, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from trying to make a stronger, more emotional connection. Further, elements of the plot strain credibility, and you need to make a leap of faith so to speak to accept some pretty amazing coincidences and key events. In particular, the climax is full of major surprises and a stunning turn of events that require a suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Production values are impressive particularly in the art direction and visual effects to recreate Vatican City (since permission for location shooting was denied). The camera work shows great fluidity, and seldom have visuals been more kinetic as in this film or for that matter any other recent adventure/mystery. This helps in the pacing and overall flow of the story.<br/><br/>It's nice for a change to see male and female leads working together without resorting to the obligatory romance. Here, it's strictly business. In fact the film plays almost like a chapter of TV's 24 or The X Files which may determine whether the plot twists and turns are surprising or satisfyingly fresh to the uninitiated viewer. If you have seen The Godfather III, the storyline conspiracies may also seem a bit familiar. Still, you get the feeling that Howard and Hanks have gotten the hang of things this time around. What you get is a moderately interesting mystery in an elaborate, big budget setting. The visuals are impressive but the story itself is nothing special to write home about."
"aharmas","8","2","3","25 May 2009"," Duality
","Tom Hanks returns, at least in typical Hollywood adaptation chronology, as the scientist who likes to stir a little controversy by adding a bit of theology to his adventures. In ""Angels and Demons"" he is searching for the clues that will help him save a few lives at the Vatican's request.<br/><br/>There is a tug of war between what traditions expect from the church followers and how science is reshaping everyone's understanding and perspective of what how the universe has got this far. There is not much of a back story this time, if you don't count the Galileo piece. Howard dives into the action and directs with a more self assured hand, with plenty of help from two very charismatic stars, and a terrific supporting performance by McGregor, as the priest who can open more than a few doors in this place.<br/><br/>Intrigue is at the heart of the film, mysticism takes a backseat to the debate that originates from the coexistence of science and faith. The screenplay gives everyone a chance to present and make a point, and by the end of the adventure, we might have a very pleased audience."

","Having not read any of the books but already having a pretty good general knowledge of the Da Vinci Code and having watched the film adaptation of the Da Vinci Code, I didn't know what to expect for Angels & Demons. I mean, many people are familiar with the rumours surrounding the idea of a 'Code' created / discovered by Leonardo Da Vinci. So I thought, what could Angels & Demons possibly be based on? Well it was surprising. The link to contemporary and current affairs was truly outstanding and the way in which current experiments in Astronomy / Physics were combined with possible objections / issues the church would have if these were to go smoothly.<br/><br/>Personally, I preferred the Da Vinci Code, merely because it was something most people could easily relate to and the way in which Langdon found his clues were believable. Many people I went to watch this movie with thought the clues were just 'coming too easy' to Langdon this time and they were quite typical e.g. 'The Angels are pointing to where it is hidden!' <br/><br/>Despite all of that, it is one of those films you don't mind watching again to gain your own extra clues and similar to the Da Vinci Code, one you can lose the plot with if you don't listen extremely carefully to the revelations."

The film was too long in Act one, I fell asleep for 5 minutes of it, and eventually awoke to Hanks coming into Rome. I give Hanks an A+ for all the dialog his character, our kindly Harvard Professor, had to spout out in relation to the historical, or is it hysterical?, relevance of the Catholic Church, in relation to electing a new Pope with some of his brethren having to go through some twists and turns. When the film finally ended, and the fires had died down, I kept thinking, ""there by the grace of God, go I...""

"moviemanMA","7","2","3","23 May 2009"," A little less controversy still makes a fun movie
","Ron Howard made a splash three years ago with his adaptation of Dan Brown's best seller The Da Vinci Code. The Catholic Church and countless religious groups protested the films release, only to make it one of the highest grossing films of 2006. It only made sense that Howard would take the helm of Brown's other book, Angels & Demons.<br/><br/>Now, I have not read either of Brown's books so I cannot give a comparison to the films. I did however really enjoy The Da Vinci Code and looked forward to Angels & Demons with great anticipation.<br/><br/>After watching it, I felt close to the same as I did with Da Vinci: satisfied. I won't say that this film is better or worse than the previous one because it isn't really. I'd say it's right on par and there is no reason why people shouldn't see it.<br/><br/>The story follows Professor Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks who reprises his role from the previous film. He is called upon by the Vatican police to help them locate four missing cardinals. Simultaneously, a group of scientists create, without going into details, something that can blowup, only to have some of it stolen. The two stories are linked and Langdon must sort it all out. What makes matters worse is the Pope has just passes and a new one must be chosen, ideally one of the four kidnapped cardinals.<br/><br/>The group who is responsible is an underground cult called the Illuminati, people who were hunted down by the Church for their beliefs in science. They say they will kill the cardinals and that the device they stole will detonate by midnight, wiping out Vatican City and part of Rome. <br/><br/>Langdon and Vittoria Vetra (Ayele Zurer), one of the lead scientists involved with the explosives, race around Vatican City and Rome to find the cardinals and the device before time runs out. Howard takes us on a labyrinthian ride through archives, catacombs, and churches to try and stop the Illuminati from destroying Vatican City.<br/><br/>Puzzles, symbols, and history take up most of this film, culminating in a thrilling journey that will have you guessing until the very end. Hanks will keep you engaged with the story and his supporting cast is not so bad either with Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skargard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl.<br/><br/>Unlike Da Vinci, this isn't nearly as controversial and is more a work of fiction. There is a message being sent that science and religion should work hand in hand and whether or not faith is something you earn or learn, but it really downplays the story and that is the best part. There is a pointless monologue that McGregor's character gives to the conclave in the Sistine Chapel. What he should be saying at that time isn't said and he goes on about religion and science, at a time when he should be worrying about the bomb that is about to go off and so forth.<br/><br/>There were times when I thought certain characters knew more about something than they should have (like Vittoria). I also would have liked a little more background on Langdon. They touched upon it but I think more would have been nice. Some parts of the story that were a bit too ridiculous as well (a portion of the ending made me think ""Are you kidding me?""). All that said, I thought the story with all of its twists and turns was enjoyable. It isn't perfect, but it kept my attention, which is exactly what Howard was intending to do."

Ron Howard direction and Tom Hanks performance was equal to Da Vinci Code. The movie has good action, great sound effects and a lot of eye candy. The 140 minutes went by fast. Like most sequels the uniqueness of the first movie is all ready out of the hat. The uniqueness is lost the second time around. Do not go to the movie thinking this will be the best movie ever, it is not. If you go thinking this will be fun, you will be right. I give this movie 9 out of 10. . I am a fan of Ron Howard and Tom Hanks movies and wish if they have to state their political views that they would give both sides of the issue.

Man can and dose miss up religion not Jesus."
"Fenfoz","5","2","3","22 May 2009"," Another Failed Attempt
","Angels and Demons seems to be yet another failed attempt at converting a Dan Brown novel to the big screen. I am going to add myself to the growing ranks of people who are all stating that the film is not as good as the book , which is a premise I had fully accepted before I even sat in my seat in the cinema. However after watching the film I have realized that making this film was bound to fail as there too much to squeeze into 120 Hollywood minutes.<br/><br/>I expected the essence of the book to be extracted such as the story of CERN and the creation of ant-matter unfortunately this was dealt with in roughly about 10 minutes, of which 5 minutes consisted of long panning shots of the Large Hydron Collider. This is a glaring omission as the creation of anti-matter and the history of CERN creates the backdrop to the science versus religion debate which is what drives the film. <br/><br/>Where the film falls down the worst is that it completely fails to capture the excitement of Robert Langdon trying to discover the Illuminatis path to enlightenment which is an amazing cryptic puzzle spread right across Rome. Instead we are faced with Tom Hanks running from statue to statue shouting at people followed closed by Vittoria Vetra, who is possibly the most one dimensional character I have seen played in a long time she basically had no need to be in the film, her character was that badly written.<br/><br/>All in all the film is entertaining to watch but will not be remembered and is definitely not a classic. However if you have read the book you will be disappointed so hopefully it will be the last time we will see Robert Langdon symbologist on our big screens."

","First and foremost Angels & Demons has lots missing from the book where pages upon pages seem to have been left on the script floor and for good reason otherwise it would have stretched into a 4 hour movie! And soon becomes apparent this where director Ron Howard seems to have changed tactics from the first offering of the Dan Brown franchise in that the Da Vinci code left you constantly confused at times as this doesn't and he serves up an action paced average thriller. The story centres around Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) who is summoned by the Vatican (after the sudden death of the pope) to solve a new threat involving a small problem of anti-matter which gets stolen from the infamous CERN by an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati who along the way have kidnapped four cardinals.<br/><br/>Teaming up with Langdon to play this cat and mouse game is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) who thought would have been a bit of a love interest for Langdon...but no thankfully Howard doesn't allow for this.<br/><br/>The other main character in the film is Irish speaking Patrick Mckenna played by Ewan McGregor who appears as the villain from a long way off but McGregor does giving a convincing performance in this role.<br/><br/>So as Langdon and Vetra rush from cathedral to cathedral solving the puzzles in the eight hour time-frame before the anti-matter explodes wiping out the entire city and it is here that Ron Howard gives the film its best bits with stunning sets of Rome and it is quite easily to see that this is where most of the budget as been spent.<br/><br/>There are two problems with the end of the film which appear very unbelievable as you will see for yourself if you choose to watch it.<br/><br/>I think Ron Howard sold stick to make first rate films such as Apollo Thirteen and Frost\Nixon and next time leave the Dan Brown novels at home because it is to clear to see it hasn't worked with the first two outings.<br/><br/>To summarise then if you want be entertained for two and a bit hours by an average thriller then please go and watch A&D but don't expect the book version and remember as with all great novels....they do not always make great films."

I visited Rome only a month ago and the movie did convey the atmosphere of the churches etc. soundtrack is to die for, absolutely marvelous<br/><br/>I read few comments that the movie is dull, too much of a talk?? what did you expect, a car chase and killings all the time?<br/><br/>well, if there are any faults in the movie, they are the novel's faults such as bending the historical truths etc. and there's something so illogical: symbolist, art historian and expert for Italian art such as R.

","I think after the first one, this is just disappointing. The Da Vinci Code introduced the Chevaliers de Sangreal, the premise of clues hidden within the church, and an Christian-like alternative to National Treasure. Albeit controversial, still interesting. The second one doesn't incite any emotional bearing whatsoever. Any good action film like James Bond or National Treasure, in movieland -you gotta change paces and move from town to town -globe trotter! This premise is set within the Vatican, which I find boring. I half expected Anne Hathaway's boyfriend to appear.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Tom Hanks' acting is less than superior. His voice is low, rich in a bad way -like very sticky molasses that's trailing mud. His eyebrows furrowed at everything. The writing was just awful. Everyone knows movies are usually scripted, but you don't notice it when you're watching it. But this one -as the lines are delivered -it's so blatant that those lines are written.<br/><br/>The twist at the end wasn't very good, as it wasn't dramatic or revealed in an OMG-way.<br/><br/>Cinematography -too much looking at them run, or looking at where they're running. Overview shots of city scenery was good though.<br/><br/>The only thing I enjoyed was that they included the concept of the Illuminati, which wasn't developed 'cuz you'll realize it's all bogus anyway. I loved the particle accelerator creating antimatter since they've been trying to do that for years, and if it was reality -may i say HOLY S***.<br/><br/>PS -Peeved that Langdon just HAD to be stationed at the cliché Harvard University.<br/><br/>All in all, nothing overly enjoyable, since you pretty much know what's going to happen. The story isn't developed well, nor do the actors make it interesting. I expect better from Tom Hanks and Ron Howard."

","This movie does not make any sense. It is a bad idea from the beginning to turn a book like 'Angels and Demons' by Dan Brown into a movie, because its actual subject is way too complex to be reflected in a dumb thriller. The real intention of the book is not developed in the movie at all, and it even dares to brutally change the facts of the real story. Not worth a minute of your time if you have read the book, although you might be entertained by this TV sort of superficial thriller if you haven't."

"TaylorYee94","10","1","1","20 May 2019"," God is not flawed, men are.
","I'm born and raised Catholic for a long time even though I do not go to church these days. Dan Brown is considered the man who constantly attacks Catholic Church, so I was a little reluctant to watch it at first, but my friend really wanted to. Overall conclusion, God is not flawed, men are (also the line from the movie). Rather than attacking faith and God, it criticizes the Catholic's secrecy and ambiguity just the right amount. Prof. Langdon still respects the Cardinal's faith and collaborates.<br/><br/>Done with my opinion the main theme, I am now gonna talk about this movie in more detail.
Good:<br/><br/>1. Setting, music and sound, camera work are all brilliant.
The first thing that comes to my mind after the movie is that I really want to visit Rome and study the relationship of Renaissance art and Catholicism. Camera from the above to view the whole Vatican works phenomenal and makes the journey of Langdon and Vittoria look even sacred. BGM increases the suspense and kudos to Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>2. Clear explanation and interpretation of symbols throughout Langdon and Vittoria's investigation.
The book is even more complicated and thick, really massively thick. It is not easy to compress long book to short movies, but this movie does a great job, storytelling and explaining details with the aid of visuals which book could not provide.<br/><br/>3. Twist at the end!! Perfection.
This movie fools me at the end when I am relaxed and waiting for resolution. It was unexpected hit, so the intensity was increased.<br/><br/>Bad :<br/><br/>The narrative of background history of antimatter is too long at the beginning.
This almost changes the genre of movie to science fiction leaving the audience in the confusion."

"hanne-torkaas","6","1","1","16 August 2016"," Not like the book!
","The film is OK I guess if you have not read the book. But I have, and the differences annoys me.<br/><br/>Here are all the differences I remember:<br/><br/>Langdon is contacted directly by the leader of CERN, Max Kohler. He is not even in the film, even though he is quite a significant character. The first victim is Vittoria Vetra's father, Leonardo Vetra, not her assistant. He is branded with the Illuminati ambigram.<br/><br/>Olivetti is the head of the Swiss guard and Rocher (Richter in the film) is his second in command. Why change names from the book??? Also Camerlengo Patrick McKenna is named Carlo Ventresca in the book, and he does not know (until much later) that the late pope is his father. The Camerlengo kills the pope because he gets to know that the pope had a child, but did not know that the child was himself.<br/><br/>The one who knows about the pope's secret son is cardinal Mortati (named Strauss in the movie).<br/><br/>Langdon is alone in the Archives when the air is about to run out.<br/><br/>Langdon saves himself in the church set on fire with the help of his Mickey mouse watch when he is trapped under a sarcophagus.<br/><br/>The last preferiti Baggia did also die in the book. The Hasassin (yes, ""Hasassin"", of Middle Eastern origin) tries to drown Langdon in the fountain, and he survives with the help of the air tube. <br/><br/>Langdon had to find the clue to the Illumination church himself cause Baggia is dead. The reason he needed to get there was because Vittoria was kidnapped by the hasassin and he believed her to be with him. There is love in the air between Robert and Vittoria in the book. Robert and vittoria kills the Hasassin. You never get the feeling of how sick and disturbed the Hasassin really is in the film.<br/><br/>In the book we now believe that Max Kohler is the bad guy who is now soon to land in the Vatican to kill the camerlengo. Swiss Guards, Robert and Vittoria storm in to see the camerlengo branded with the 5th Illuminati brand, the diamond that contains all 4 elements in an ambigram. Kohler gets shot (Richter/Rocher in the film), Rocher storms in (he is switched with another cardinal in the film). Kohler hands over the film recorded from his wheelchair to Langdon.<br/><br/>The media's involvement is very different as well. Few TV-stations cover the events. The Hasassin gives info about the events to one of the stations, and they start to hunt a good story. Later this TV team is used to film all the shocking events inside St Peters Church. The camerlengo uses the TV team to make a great speech that makes people come together to pray all over the world (important in the book!).<br/><br/>In the book Vittoria can not fix the battery for the antimatter container in Rome, she has to take it back to CERN.<br/><br/>Langdon enters the helicopter with the camerlengo. The camerlengo bails with the only parachute, and Langdon saves himself with jumping out with some tarp landing in the water.<br/><br/>In the end, there are actually two new popes elected: The camerlengo before he dies as his name is shouted out loud, and the high elector.<br/><br/>There is probably even more..."

"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","1","7 December 2013"," I thought it was a reasonably good adaptation of the book, until the last 20 minutes or so......
","*WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE BOOK AND THE FILM*<br/><br/>I read the Angels & Demons book fairly recently and found it a gripping read. Naturally, I went into watching the film Angels & Demons with reasonable expectations - I didn't expect the film to be as good as the book if I'm being honest, but I at least expected it to stick close to the original source material and that was my biggest gripe with this film; <br/><br/>The majority of the film was tense and exciting and stuck fairly close to the original Dan Brown book. There were some things that were included in the book that were omitted from the film, but these minor details didn't bother me too much as they weren't relevant to the overall plot. One thing I didn't like about the film version of A & D was how some of the characters were depicted; In the book, there was a constant playful 'sexual tension' between Langdon and Vittoria that was completely absent in this film. Also the character of Olivetti came across as arrogant and argumentative in the book which made his character interesting and actually gave him a 'character'. In the film, Olivetti shows none of these traits and just seems to be compliant all the time - his character was just flat in the film and I think it's a stretch to say that he even had a character. I felt sympathy for his character when he died in the book, but couldn't care less when he died in the film. It also seems that the filmmaker's couldn't care less when Olivetti died as well as this is just shown briefly as the camera pans past him and nothing more is said on the matter. I found that this particular scene was poorly handled considering he was a central character for most of the film. Also Langdon & Vittoria had no chemistry in the film, but as I mentioned above there was definitely some 'sexual tension' between them in the book which meant that you're constantly running the 'Will they or won't they scenario through your head'? That being said, the flat characters weren't the biggest problem, but it was the last 20 minutes that really turned this into a shambles.<br/><br/>The turning point for me was the scene where the Camerlengo is exposed as the person responsible for masterminding the killings of the 4 cardinals. In the book, this was a tense scene involving Langdon and the Camerlengo both going up in the helicopter in which the Camerlengo confesses to Langdon that he was behind the kidnapping of the cardinals before parachuting out of the helicopter leaving Langdon and the anti matter on the helicopter. This left me as a reader in suspense wondering what Langdon would do next. So what happens in the film? The Camerlengo goes up in the helicopter on his own and the helicopter explodes leaving the audience to believe that he kills himself, but he parachutes out of the plane before it explodes. What rubbish. This for me was one of the worst scenes in the film. Why didn't they have Langdon & the Camerlengo in the helicopter together as they did in the book? This was a tense scene in the book and would have been a tense scene in the film.<br/><br/>A couple of final points; the kidnapping of Vittoria was ignored as well (again another tense part in the book). For me, the worst aspect of this film was the ending. In the book, the Camerlengo and Langdon fight it out when Langdon works out where the Camerlengo had taken Vittoria to, but in the film they just had the Camerlengo set fire to himself when all of the Vatican discover the truth. What a cop out! To say that I was a bit disappointed with this adaption would be an understatement. I felt really angry when the film ended due to the fact that they created a tense and engaging film for the most part which stayed fairly close to the book and then ruined it by creating a poorly handled plot twist and then changed the ending of the film. I could have forgiven the filmmakers for changing the ending if they'd made it better than the book, but they didn't and that's what has made me so angry. The only reason I gave this 5/10 is because for the most part it was good. If only they'd have handled the final 20 minutes better."

Even continuities were all wrong. They had the probably people playing certain characters which left gaps in the plot.<br/><br/>I see the morale behind the book as giving people faith in both science and religion, and one is not the same without the other. The message given with this film is that the anti-matter is bad and they must get rid of it. Awful.<br/><br/>Ewan Mcgregor is one of my favourite actors and it is a shame to see the director didn't work with his emotions more in this. Many of the actors actually unperformed which is a shame.<br/><br/>The only decent part i thought was at the end. But even that was all wrong!

"iyanola-1","2","1","1","19 May 2010"," An appalling travesty
","Firstly - if you don't want a film compared to the book, don't advertise it in reference to the book and perhaps call it a different name. If you elect to stake the films reputation on the book that inspired it, you had better approach the process accordingly. So, given this movie was made and launched on the book, I feel wholly justified in comparing the two and consequently wanting to slash the movie to ribbons. <br/><br/>I tried to watch this film objectively given that the novel is a roller-coaster thrill ride - whether you approve of the subject matter or not, a great read is a great read, and when you accept the challenge of translating a book to film, a good idea is to have read and embraced the book before you start. Having done so, a director, producer or writer would understand the very essence that above all must be brought to the screen. Sadly this film fails in almost every respect. Why would we need to waste valuable minutes at the start of the film watching Langdon (Tom Hanks) in a swimming pool - IMDb trivia section tells us that Hanks had to undergo strenuous training for that scene....why? it is of absolutely no importance to the film whatsoever and so it continues from such an early point. The whole thrill of the book is a race against time - so instead of a wedge shaped super aircraft to get Langdon from swimming pool to Vatican City in 90 minutes, we get a ""Papal Jet"" to take a leisurely waltz across ""The Pond"" to Rome where, still fresh as a daisy, Langdon ""rockets"" into and through muffled dialogue. It has been asserted that the ""budget"" was weighted on scenery at the cost of characters, well, in my opinion at a far higher cost than that. How can so many key characters be arbitrarily slashed, amalgamated or diluted from the plot and replaced with nothing but convenience. The entire pacing of the film is off, where there should be more there is less or nothing, and where there should be less or nothing there is meaningless padding and pointless time wasting. There are no valid relationships, no chemistry its all just bland and moribund. I wanted so much for this film, if ever there was a book crying out, no, screaming for ""Blockbuster movie"", this was it. This is not a piece of work that Ron Howard et al can possibly be proud of. It is nothing more than a shame."
"riddion","5","1","1","22 May 2009"," Very good but too much of the novel was removed
","I must say that I liked this movie. I liked the book also. I thought the book was better than the Da Vinci code with one exception. Silas was a much more interesting antagonist than the assassin in Angels & Demons. To follow the story of Silas was very interesting, I thought.<br/><br/>Back to this movie, I thought the changes made was justified and made sense in the movie. <br/><br/>One element that I sorely missed was one of the major motives of the main villain. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book please read no further and skip to the next paragraph. I missed that the camerlengo was the pope's son, and that the camerlengo's misunderstanding that the pope had fathered a child through sex was truly sacrilege and his big motivation for doing what he did. The camerlengo's appearance as a Christ figure after the antimatter annihilates was also something that I missed.<br/><br/>Spoiler over. It was great to see all the sights in Rome, having previously been there last year on vacation. But I wished that Howard would slow down a little in his pacing of the movie so the movie wouldn't go by so fast. <br/><br/>So despite the changes made and the things that I missed I thought it was a excellent movie that was well written and well executed. A movie that I will definitely see again, probably twice."
"FiveRebelSeven","8","1","1","20 May 2009"," Fast paced, exciting, worthy adaptation of a great book.
","I went into this movie a little apprehensive because The Da Vinci Code film left a lot to be desired and since I had read Angels & Demons, I knew this latest film would have a lot to live up to. That being said, I thought that Ron Howard did a much better job this time. It wasn't 100% loyal to the book but the few changes that were made were arguably for the better. The pacing of this movie was a lot better. It was exciting from start to end and unlike in The Da Vinci Code, the dialogue actually kept me on the edge of my seat with anticipation of where it was all going. The score was outstanding! It gracefully shifted from dark and ominous during the dialogue scenes to explosive and thrilling during the ""Path of Illumination"" scenes. The entire production of this film was a lot more tight, refined, and exciting. It's a true testament to the film when both my girlfriend (who did not read either Langdon novels or see The Da Vinci Code film) and myself (who read both books and saw T.D.V.C.) both had a great time watching this movie. The scene in the Vatican Archives with Langdon trapped was thrilling and the murders of the preferiti were all done perfectly. Hanks' depiction of Langdon was spot-on and his ability to decipher the clues along the ""Path of Illumination"" while doing so at a frenetic pace were truly believable. The end was a little bit forced but to those who did not read the book, they will be surprised. Kudos to Howard and Hanks for elevating their game a notch on this one."
"alex06-1","6","1","1","20 May 2009"," The ending is the only disappointment in an otherwise improved sequel
","Angels & Demons is the sequel to the 2006 box office phenomenon The Da Vinci Code. You know, that one movie back in the day that had the Vatican ready to declare a crusade on Hollywood, that same movie that brought atheists together saying that their time had at last come, the same movie that was preparing to change the foundations of Christianity as we knew it... Then the movie came out and everyone who was ready for that defining moment put their clubs and spears behind their backs and said, ""Never mind."" The wide number of historic inaccuracies and many smaller problems caused the movie to be looked down upon by critics, but Ron Howard sure didn't care, he was walking away with $508 million.<br/><br/>Yeah I saw The Da Vinci Code, it's a pretty okayish time waster, but it doesn't really live up to the ambition of its setting. Of course it was supposed to be offensive on the philosophic level, but the amazing number of historic inaccuracies had me offended as a history studier instead of what Christian I was (I was only raised Catholic like Mr. Langdon.) My folks were going out to see it one morning and they invited me along, so I decided, ""What the heck? Why not?"" So how does this sequel turn out? Well it's actually a whole lot better than it's predecessor, but I don't know if I would consider it to be enough to be atonement for how The Da Vinci Code was.<br/><br/>Like I said before, I had plenty of problems with The Da Vinci Code (I haven't read the book so I can't say anything about its faithfulness to the book or not.) I had problems with the historic accuracy that it didn't even seem to try and follow, I had problems with the pacing, I had problems with the safe route that the movie took when it could have been a lot more. It's one of those movies that had amazing production values, but the movie itself just didn't take off the ground to be the world changer it was hyped up to be. I was a bit indifferent about the upcoming Angels & Demons, but I heard the movie was supposed to be better than The Da Vinci Code, so I can now tell you if Mr. Howard is just whoring in on success or actually performing penance for his last sin.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons takes place sometime after The Da Vinci Code, Professor Robert Langdon is now called on by the Vatican for his help, as four cardinals have been kidnapped by an ancient brotherhood called the Illuminati. It is up to him to travel to the Vatican and not only save them, but also stop a time bomb that threatens to destroy all the Vatican. He must work with Vittoria Vetra. He enlists the help of Camerlengo Patrick McKenna to ensure that the Swiss Guard is capable of saving the Cardinals every hour and ultimately retrieving the bomb. The story itself is pretty decent overall and it even has a message at a point near the end for faithful and unfaithful alike, but whether or not it will actually be seen is dependent on what your taste in movies is like.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons features a nice cast of actors just like its predecessor from Tom Hanks to even minor characters. The movie even has production values about on par with The Da Vinci Code, same locals, Hans Zimmer returns for the musical score, though the movie certainly isn't without its faults. Just like in The Da Vinci Code, the movie suffers from what I like to call, ""accuracy problems"". These problems include the fact that it takes a lot of its facts for granted, Angels & Demons is based on the idea that an Antimatter bomb will destroy an entire city, enough to destroy the Vatican, but in reality... * Whispers * It's pretty friggin harmless... There's also the fact that the Illuminati really isn't as big of an organization as the movie says it was. In fact it never had anything to do with the Catholic Church to begin with. Just like The Da Vinci Code, it tends to take liberties with history, but it does so to a very lesser degree so the offense is hardly that measurable. The way the movie plays out overall is that it's much faster paced than The Da Vinci Code, it observes logic more than its first movie, and can be more enjoyable but it still loses a point for its rather weak ending and defeat for the main villain (omitted for spoilers.) To sum up Angels & Demons, I'd say it depends on what kind of person you are if you want to see it or not. If you liked The Da Vinci Code, then you'll probably have already seen it yesterday if not already having plans to see it soon. If you were living under a rock back in 2006 and never got around to seeing the movie, then I'd say Angels & Demons is more worth a rent when it hits your local Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. It's actually a pretty good movie altogether, just not a particularly great one. Who knows, maybe when the next movie comes out, Ron Howard will make something particularly good."

","I felt this movie was done well, but far different to the book. I understand that they have to trim some of the fat, so that the film is not 4 hours long. But to completely change the storyline to some extent frustrated me throughout. Dan Brown writes his books so well that you can imagine his story on the big screen, being whisked scene to scene. I feel they could have put more content in the film and kept to the book far more. So if you are a big Dan Brown fan, this film may disappoint.<br/><br/>However if you haven't read the book, this will be a great watch. It has been shot and directed well, and all the cast gave a great performance. definitely one for the thriller/action fans!"

","Possible spoiler alert.<br/><br/>I had given up on this movie by the third time the Prof. was frantically (with no suspense, enjoyment, etc. for the audience) rushing around looking for angels pointing. I realize the plot has him in a huge hurry, but other similar characters in movies were in huge hurries too, and those movie was still made such that the search and solving the mystery were enjoyable. It somewhat recovered itself near the end with a few twists of ""good guy to bad guy"" and vice versa. It gives some people something to think about, unless they're tired of the whole ""we need to unite against a common enemy"" idea that's being recycled and overused in films today."
"evdokya-bt","2","6","15","22 May 2009"," One might have higher expectations even from a summer flick...
","The critically-rejected super production with a budget equaling the one of a small African country is a typical creation of the entertainment industry called Hollywood. It's hollow, emotionally-empty, lacking in intensity, hypocrite and obviously made by people who think that if you have money for fancy FX, you have no use for a story, decent dialogue, catchy plot line, character development and good editing. Your average TV show enjoys a better focus on the above mentioned details. The plot is so alembicated that it crosses the line into nonsensical at points, the dialogue is both dull and chunky and the whole movie is nothing but a collection of action scenes cascading so quickly it doesn't so much as let the viewer the time to breathe and digest what's going on. But maybe that is just an advertising device since if you had the time to really take a look at what's happening on screen you might notice the plot holes the size of Grand Canyon, the sheer stupidity of some lines (something like ""the angels are pointing that way so this is where the bad guy hid the bomb""), the downright awful acting and Ron Howard's bad bordering on stranger directing. Speaking of which, Howard might be no Tony Scott, but still one might expect more from him than to just assume a good way to make his work more dynamic is through such rapid and chaotic camera moves that after a while the viewer starts feeling dizzy at first then nauseating.<br/><br/>While I suppose the absurd intricacies of story can't be blamed entirely on the movie's makers, are those truly to blame for the actors' complete unwillingness to do their job and at least try to act?! For the 50 millions dollars Tom Hanks supposedly garnished for this flick, he could have at least done what all those many, many movie goers earning like 0,01 % of that sum do on an average working day: try their best. I've never been a fan of him, his two Oscars always seeming more of a fashion to me than anything else, but in both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, he was almost ridiculous with his woody, smirking and annoying on screen presence. His part in these two movies resumes to showing up on set and cashing a check. That's all. Unfortunately for the entire (mis)cast, Angels and Demons doesn't have a Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen to save face. Ewan McGregor, by far the best actor in this motion picture, does try but only ends up giving the impression that he has decided it's really not worth it and resigns himself to playing his part with all the seriousness and the aplomb of a soap opera actor.<br/><br/>Now onto the feminine lead I know Ayulet Zurer has been slammed because of the producers' audacity to cast an Israeli actress for the part of an Italian. That would have been nothing indeed, if Zurer, who is, by no means, lacking in talent, wouldn't have joined the whole non acting trend of the cast. Though given the part, I doubt she could have done much more. She plays a stereotypical Hollywood movie scientist: hot but dumb, a mere recipient for the male lead's patronizing attitude. One might wonder why, for all the rambling about the sacred feminine in The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown and subsequently, those turning his novels into movies don't populate their fictional universe with more feminine characters and while at it, why they don't equip them with a brain too. I don't know about you, girls, but if I were Mrs. Brown, I'd have a few words with my husband about that! I know the score was praised as the best thing about this production. I wouldn't say. Just like anything else in this film it excels at being over the top with its dragging, pompous, Gregorian chants like sound.<br/><br/>Rant du flick: I know Langdon's profession is make-believe, but still shouldn't an Art historian featuring Middle Ages expert featuring bogus theories generation be knowledgeable of at least Latin and Italian as he is supposedly writing books pertaining to the history of Renaissance Italy? After all, it should only come with the job! It makes you wonder if he wasn't denied access to the Vatican Archives—which are very much opened to researchers, by the way—on grounds of professional incompetence as you need some serious academic credentials to be allowed there for none another than the trivial reason that if you don't have a clue about the language of the documents, what on Earth would be doing there? Staring at them into translating themselves? And since when do any archives on this planet—canonical or not—just give away rare documents in their possession? Especially to a man who obviously can't read them! Yes, I know it's just a movie! Why? While I cannot recommend not to go watch this movie, I have to say that leaving your brain outside the cine is a must. Then you can happily and dumbly vegetate in your seat while the heroes race around Rome stopping every now and then for a bit of gore on the way. By the way, great Rome images! There, I found something to praise about the movie, though those are hardly the merit of its makers."
"kanagsrat","5","5","12","16 May 2009"," Note to self... Never go into cinemas expecting brilliant books to turn out brilliant in film
","Geez where to start?<br/><br/>As i am writing this review, I just came came from the cinema watching Angels and Demons and boy do i have a lot to say.<br/><br/>Now, you(as the reader) have probably read other people's reviews, and they all have the same message: huge chunks of the book were missed in the movie and boy is this message true. Now, I perfectly understand that for a 572 page book to be portrayed in film, there have to be chunks missing from the film that are in the book. However these chunks were so imminent it was almost laughable. Overall, i was disappointed by the movie, but there were a couple of good things which is why i am going to list the good and bad's of this movie.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>1. Special Effects were brilliant <br/><br/>2. Due to not being allowed to film in ST Peter's square, i thought the set designers did a fair job of duplicating the square. <br/><br/>3. Armin Mueller-Stahl did an excellent job of playing Cardinal Strauss. <br/><br/>4. Ewen Mcgregor did an OK job of the Camerlengo.<br/><br/>Unfortunately those points were the only good points i could think of.<br/><br/>Now lets move onto the bad points,<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>1. Where is one of the central characters, Maximillian Kohler (Executive Director of Cern) in the movie? Unfortunately i don't see how the screenwriters could have missed that. <br/><br/>2. In the book, Vittoria Vetra was the feisty yet sensual Italian women. In the movie Ayelet Zurer did an absolutely horrific job of playing Vetra, Zurer was bland, it was almost like she was forced into playing Vetra by the casting directors because of her unmissable beauty. Honestly, sorry to say this but the way the movie was going it seemed like there was no point in having Vittoria Vetra in the movie, because she had absolutely no influence on saving Vatican City, unlike in the book! Also, she had no chemistry with Robert Langdon in the movie once again unlike in the book, overall her presence was simply pointless! <br/><br/>3. Only 3 cardinals died, all 4 were supposed to be dead<br/><br/>4. Cardinal Strauss is actually Cardinal Mortati in the book, once again a lazy stroke from the screenwriters.<br/><br/>5. Cardinal Mortati was supposed to be pope, not Cardinal Bhaggia<br/><br/>5. Learnardo Vetra is given another name in the movie, and nowhere in the movie was he mentioned as the adopted father of Vittoria Vetra, in the movie Vetra describes him as, ""My research partner""<br/><br/>6. The last symbol was supposed to be the Illuminati diamond, but instead it was keys.<br/><br/>7. Vittoria Vetra is not with Robert Langdon in he Vatican Archives (honestly i didn't mind about this, but yet again this is another mistake from the screenwriters)<br/><br/>8. The assassin isn't supposed to be like an academic with glasses, he was supposed to be creepy and of the Islam faith.<br/><br/>9. There were no flashbacks unlike ""The Da Vinci Code""<br/><br/>10. Ron Howard is a bad director<br/><br/>11. Both screenplayers obviously didn't do their research.<br/><br/>12. Unfortunately Tom Hanks didn't do it for me as the symbologist: Robert Langson in Angels and Demons.<br/><br/>13. The acting overall, bar Ewen McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl was really bad.<br/><br/>Honestly, i could go on and on about this but i wont bore you to death.<br/><br/>Your also probably wondering why i gave it 5/10 since I've been so critical about it. Its because i have some sympathy for the screenwriters (despite me being critical towards them as well) for trying turn a masterpiece novel into film. Also, the special effects were good so i gave it some extra marks for that. But where it fell was the absence of important characters, poor acting and poor directing.<br/><br/>Overall, a word for the wise, don't go into the cinema room expecting a brilliant book turning into a brilliant film because that is never the case as proved by Angels and Demons."
"mrsmarohn","10","7","19","14 May 2009"," AWESOME Movie
","I got to see this movie two days before it came out in theaters though a local radio station. I would have never thought that I would have liked this movie, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I am not one to actually talk during movies but I would catch myself saying ""oh, no"" and ""no"". <br/><br/>I didn't think that I would even know what was going on since I have never seen the Di Vinci Code. I was sure that I would be like where did that come from, or who is that person. But they done a really good job at not referencing the other movie very much. <br/><br/>One thing that I didn't like was it almost seemed like the Catholic Church sponsored the movie, and me not being catholic it was hard to follow along with some of the traditions. <br/><br/>There were so many twist and turns and just not expecting what was going to happen next."
"Elswet","9","4","9","17 May 2009"," Fantastic Adaptation
","As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining true to the source materials, and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work. The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Ron Howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.<br/><br/>I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved, back in ""the day."" He is a good dramatic actor and, while I miss his comedic efforts, I do enjoy his more serious performances.<br/><br/>The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.<br/><br/>Although the story of the ""God Particle"" was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. And, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.<br/><br/>In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.<br/><br/>All in all, this is good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"alex_torriero","9","4","9","16 May 2009"," Interesting concept and executed brilliantly!
","Unlike the much-hyped 'The Davinci Code' that I had entered the room, completely aware and ready to compare with to the book, this time I had the privilege of viewing Brown's 'Angels & Demons' with no more knowledge than the fact that it would be somehow related to Christianity. Put simply, I was 100% oblivious of what the movie was about - I just knew it was the follow up and that was anticipation enough.<br/><br/>And I must say, I found it brilliant!!! The concept of answering the much debated Science and Religion controversy in conjunction with the abduction and execution of cardinals was indeed NEW and engaging. From the beginning, I was caught in suspense, and that suspense augmented as the plot thickened. Maybe it was because I had never read the book (thank 'God'), but nonetheless, it remains one film that I have not been able to forget about, and will ponder about for at least the next coming months.<br/><br/>Well done Howard!"
"horrorfan8","7","4","9","15 May 2009"," An OK movie...MIGHT be better if you read the book
","I saw this movie at a midnight screening at a local theater late Thursday Night. I never read the book ""Angels & Demons"" or ""The Da Vinci Code"". I have to say, this movie was okay at best, but it might have been better if I read the books. The movie keeps your attention a little in the beginning, and in the middle. But in the end, it just drags on and on. You think that at one point it will end, but it doesn't. It just keeps going and going and going until it FINALLY stops. Maybe I was tired waiting for it to be over to go home? I don't know. But, the ending did kind of drag a bit. Sort of a let-down. However, I do give this movie a high rating, because it still is a good film and it makes you want to know what will happen. Will the Vatican be saved? Or will it be destroyed by light? Go see ""Angels & Demons"" if you want to find out! Tom Hanks plays a very good professor character that knows what's happening at every moment. Good acting, okay writing, okay movie.<br/><br/>7/10."
"tchockythegreat","4","8","23","16 May 2009"," Monotonous, overlong, and not as exciting as it should have been
","While watching Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, I find myself inevitably comparing the film to the TV series 24. Similar to the plot of a typical season of 24, Angels and Demons finds its protagonist (portrayed in this film by Tom Hanks) attempting to solve an improbably convoluted mystery in an extremely limited amount of time, a mystery riddled with betrayals, narrow escapes, and explosions. However, while 24 for the most part succeeds in its efforts to convey a sense of suspense and entertainment as its plot-line gradually unfolds, Angels and Demons ultimately fails to convey any sort of real suspense and mystery behind its ostensibly high-octane whodunit that unravels in the streets of Rome.<br/><br/>Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called upon by a wary Vatican College of Cardinals to help them solve the symbology-fueled mystery behind the abduction of four leading Catholic Cardinals in lieu of the election of a new pope. Joining Landgon in his mission is CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer; think an older, blander physical clone of Anne Hathaway), who for her part is investigating both the theft of a canister of antimatter from the CERN laboratory in Switzerland as well as investigating the death of a colleague at CERN, who just happens to be a priest that the recently-deceased pope held in high regard due to his efforts to prove the existence of God using science. Aiding them in their endeavor is head of the Vatican Swiss Guard Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and the deceased pope's Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor).<br/><br/>The prospect of a fast-paced race against time to uncover the plot behind the abduction of the Cardinals as well as a plot to destroy the Vatican is certainly a promising premise. Oddly enough, this movie, in which the science vs. religion, faith vs. fact debate is largely center stage, lacks a real heart and soul.<br/><br/>The script of the movie subtracts most of the character development found in the book in order to cram as much tedious description of the symbology and obvious exposition of the clues in the mystery as possible. Because of the film's insistence of spoon-feeding every last detail of the mystery to its audience, as well as the film's insistence of removing all sense of subtext in the film by exhaustively delineating the science vs. religion debate every chance it gets, the pacing of the film is unnecessarily slowed down, which contributes largely to the lack of any real suspense in the movie.<br/><br/>In movies that are as fast-paced as this film aspires to be, character development is often regarded as an afterthought by the screenwriters and understandably so. However, as was the case in The Da Vinci Code, it is such an afterthought in this movie that the actors seem more like props than characters, there merely to advance the supposed mystery from one scene to the next, with any sense of motivation or personality in the characters almost feeling completely irrelevant to the screenwriters. As a result, every character in the movie was painfully one-dimensional. Though not quite as wooden as his first bout as Robert Langdon, the considerable talents of Tom Hanks largely go to waste once again in this film; the hints of personality he attempts to inject into the role are refreshingly welcome but unfortunately few and far in between. Zurer's character does little more than follow Hanks around from scene to scene. Skarsgård's police captain grumbles a lot. McGregor's Camerlengo mopes and paces a lot.<br/><br/>The lack of three-dimensional characters would be forgivable if the action of the film was actually exciting and fun to watch. But it's simply not the case in this film. The film stubbornly sticks to the formula of Hanks and co. running around Rome looking at statues and monuments, talking about hidden symbols, watching someone die, then running to another part of Rome to repeat the process, interrupted periodically by McGregor making heavy-handed conversation with members of the College of Cardinals. This monotony lasts up until the film's final act, which as absurd and far-out as it is, is welcome relief from the monotony of watching Hanks run around Rome and McGregor wringing his hands inside St. Peter's Basilica.<br/><br/>The film runs an exhausting two-and-a-half hours, about two-thirds of that time devoted to long-winded speeches by the characters about symbolism and science vs. religion. With all due respect to Mr. Hanks (one of my favorite actors) and co., my idea of a fun summer movie is not two-plus hours of college freshman-level pseudo-philosophy and pseudo-history with the occasional car chase and murder thrown in for good measure."
"rjankie","3","8","23","15 May 2009"," This is not the book!
","While reading the book, I was excited to see the movie. The book was super. The movie was a big disappointment. Critical parts were changed or even missing.<br/><br/>The setup of the whole story was changed and some characters were totally missing. Symbols were changed in the movie (that's what Robert Langdon is all about). Ron Howard made great movies. But this one just missed it. Credits though on the magnificent scenery and of the Vatican City indoors. The explosion at the end was as expected and really felt like the ""beginning"". Still, highly disappointed. If you read Thomas Harris' ""Silence of the lambs"" and then see the movie, it's amazing how they managed to get every detail of the book in the movie. That's why SOTL is an Oscar movie. If fear this one is not."
"funnybonez6","3","3","6","30 May 2009"," No Angels or Demons could make me watch it again!
","""Angels and Demons"" by Ron Howard is a very bland movie. Tom Hanks is okay as Robert Langdon, but even he can't save a very confusing and uninteresting story and script. The script seems to cater to the dumbest common denominator. You cannot follow the story in an intelligent way, it's too messy and chaotic. I have not read the book, so I assume it's just the movie. It preaches to us that science and religion can coexist happily. That in itself could be an interesting idea, but the way it's done is as if the filmmakers are talking down to us, the audience like we're idiots.<br/><br/>Although I've seen a lot worse movies, they probably didn't cost as much to make. The visuals are okay, and there are even some inspired action scenes, but in the end it's all forgettable. By the time you get to the big twist that Camerlengo is the bad guy, you don't believe the film anymore. That's too bad. The best part about the movie is the assassin who is believable and scary person."
"phileeguy9","6","3","6","17 May 2009"," Faster paced than Da Vinci Code, but not better
","Angels and Demons puts our main character, Robert Langdon, back to work solving historical puzzles and following clues in Rome and Vatican City. But as much as Hanks plays the part well enough and Howard directed quite nicely, I didn't feel that this film was as good as the Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>The Plot itself is plausible enough, pitting the Illuminati against the Catholic Church, with Langdon being called in for help. Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer portrayed their respective characters admirably, as does the supporting cast.<br/><br/>I would say that the pacing of this movie is my main fault with it. The movie itself is roughly over 2 hours, the time frame the movie is set in is basically double that. And with certain plot points forcing Langdon to race all over Rome, you weren't given many times in the movie where historical events were discussed in a way to more fully explain the present-day findings and happenings in the film. In ""Code"" it may have been set in a time-span of one night, but we had down times in mansions, planes, museums, churches and such explaining things. This allowed for the audience to digest that information, but in Angels and Demons these down times didn't exist.<br/><br/>As for other departments I would say that the sound and visual effects were well done, but not spectacular. This isn't Star Trek, so no need for being over-the-top there. One department that I thought was lacking was in music. I thought Zimmer did a great job in ""Code"" but he didn't really match himself here. Then again, most of the music of his I enjoyed in ""Code"" were during the down times which are lacking in this film.<br/><br/>Sequels, or in this case, prequels don't usually tend to do as well as the originals, and I know Ron Howard and Tom Hanks planned on making this film better than The Da Vinci Code, but I don't think they pulled it off. It's not a bad film, but I would've liked to seen more history and less running from place to place."
"kevinbloom","7","3","6","16 May 2009"," Once again, the movie is not as good as the book.
","The movie is not as good as the book! That's all I want to say as a big fan of Dan Brown's book, Angels & Demons. The movie will disappoint a lot of book fans, especially the ending. In the book, the ending is the best part, all the truths have been told at the end; the movie clearly missed one of the most important ones(I better just stop here and let you guys find it out in the book by yourselves). Compare to the DaVinci Code, I liked The DaVinci Code better, I love movies that are associated with solving mysteries from the past history, which is why I loved the atmosphere of The DaVinci Code. Angels & Demons is more like a pure action movie for me, those deep discussions of the relationship between science and religion are also disappeared in the movie. The movie becomes less meaningful compare to the book; but if you didn't read the book, it would still be a solid thriller to watch. <br/><br/>So here, me, as an audience, not a book fan, I give this movie a 7/10."

","From the spectacular ruining of the Da Vinci code, i was very apprehensive to go and watch this movie, but with hope and fairly good reviews i thought against my better judgement and went.<br/><br/>The only thing i got out of this movie was simply seeing all the places that the story flowed through, other than that it was very average. from someone who has never read the book, but watched the movie will think it was good, but for those who have read the book, will again no doubt be disappointed.<br/><br/>producers/writers/directors should take note from the lord of the rings, making a movie that is 3 hrs along or splitting it up, is far better than condensing it into 2hrs worth of mediocre rubbish.<br/><br/>i don't understand why Dan brown would allow his books to remain one of the best sellers of our generation, yet let the cinematic versions rot in the bargain DVD bucket."

By contrast with the unwatchable ""Da Vinci Code"", this one is pretty bearable - also added by the nice photography and skillful effects.<br/><br/>Of course, these formal and immediate qualities can't really make up for the inept story, the eclectic ignorance of the ""historic"" and ""cultural"" mess in the author's skull, the puppet-like characters and the moronic flaws in the logic.

","This film tells how Robert Langdon helps to save the Catholic Church by decrypting a poem supposedly left by a secret organisation that is seeking revenge against the Church.<br/><br/>""Angels & Demons"" has a captivating story and I was wholly captured by it. The film goes straight to the point about the impending calamity facing the Church, with no beating around the bush. This is what thrillers should be! The pacing is quick, leaving no time for breath at all. There is always a sense of urgency in the air as everyone has to race against time, making the plot very thrilling.<br/><br/>The ending is amazing. Just as I thought the film was ending, there was a twist, and another. Who would have predicted the ending? ""Angels & Demons"" excels in delivering two hours of pure intellectual adrenaline. I can safely say it is much better than ""The Da Vinci Code"". ""Angels & Demons"" is one of the best thrillers I have seen in years."

As a matter of fact there wasn't a single angel or demon the entire way through. How ridiculous is that? It could quite possibly be the most misleading title and trailer combo I have ever seen! <br/><br/>What this film is, as it turns out, is a lazy, unimaginative, bland and boring waste of time. From beginning to end it feels like the film makers didn't even try and the story was beyond bad. There were no interesting characters, no great acting performances, no stunning visuals, and not even a decent soundtrack.

And It was composed by Hans Zimmer, so if you are a fan of his, this is a double-entente. In My Opinion, the only score done by Hans that outdoes this is 2008's The Dark Knight, though i can draw certain similarities to both of the film scores. so, Yes, you should see this movie. the catholic church has gave this film unfair press, so do not let that persuade you either. it's just a movie."

And for those who did not yet, I'm sure the first thought is: if the movie is so nice then how about the book, for me it's a good reason to read it. The pace of action was pretty amazing and the music was great. Tom Hanks was as expected the smart, funny and brave American expert! Few scenes are in some way chocking to see, but not that much. The story is also pretty nice, mostly because it's including many original monuments in Rome and in the Vatican Area. I would not expect too much critics as it was the case for Da Vincci even if I think that this time the issue is as important as the other one when it comes to questioning the Church faith. The final shot is amazing, It let me think for a while about the judgment day !!!"
"Tatiana_G","7","3","7","16 May 2009"," Could have been better
","As it always happens with screen versions of popular novels, the audience will measure the movie not only by cast, special effects and such like properties but they will also judge the carefulness of dealing with initial Dan Brown’s text. But for me it did not matter because although I honestly read the book I cannot recall the way Brown described the characters of the novel. I do remember the events, but in my opinion the writer is not really good at dealing with the characters’ motives, their feelings and the stories of their lives. As a result exciting plot of the novel is combined with poor descriptions, and the characters seem to be quite impersonal. The stories of their lives are often too melodramatic as it was with the Camerlengo. His orphan childhood does not actually have much to do with what is going on in Rome, so I think the movie does not benefit from such flash backs. <br/><br/>I found “Angels & Demons” much more absorbing than the previous film about Professor Langdon. What I liked about Howard’s second attempt was that there were not many episodes in which Langdon gives lectures about historic sights. All he said in “Code” reminded me of Wikipedia’s articles. It was boring and he obviously enjoyed himself too much which was also a total disappointment. <br/><br/>I believe “Angels & Demons” could have been much more interesting if there had been an end different from the one in the book. It is clear that the task of the director seems to be to display Tom Hanks to the best advantage, to let him reveal all the conspiracies and become a sole night in shining armors. No more heroes needed if there is perfect Langdon. But I think that if in the final the cardinals had chosen Camerlengo Patrick McKenna as a Roman Pope, the film would have been much more daring. Of course such final would have been a shock to those who enjoyed the book, but still it would have been more fun in such case. You see, the cardinals lied in the press release about the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna’s death. But lie is already a deadly sin. And the cardinals turn out to be ready to exonerate this deadly sin under the condition that they tell lies in order to save their Church. But the Camerlengo lied and killed people because he also believed that in such a terrible way he does his best for the Church. So the cardinals can do wrong, and the Camerlengo cannot. That is unfair. He would have made a brilliant Pope. <br/><br/>The movie gets 7/10 from me mostly because I was impressed by Ewen McGregor in cassock."

","When will the movie industry learn its lesson? This is the 2nd of Dan Browns novels to have been completely destroyed. I don't think it's possible to take a book like Angels and Demons, and cram it in a 2 hour movie, without sacrificing major parts of the plot - as this movie has clearly demonstrated. I found it quite saddening, to see such a fantastic, imaginative, thought provoking novel by an amazing author, turned into a fast-paced, flawed, blockbuster action movie. I found Tom Hanks portrayal of Robert Langdon quite laughable and the actress playing Vittoria appeared in desperate need of acting lessons (you would think this would be a pre-requisite).<br/><br/>However, all this said - I would imagine the film would have been slightly less agonising had I not been spoilt by Dan Browns novel. My boyfriend watched the movie with me, having never read a book in his life and found the movie enjoyable. In conclusion - if you haven't read the book - you may like it (or not completely hate it), if you have read the book and don't want your illusions shattered, AVOID!!!"

","It's hard not to compare this to The Da Vinci Code. It does use the same main character and same premise of secret societies and symbols. But really, other than that, the two films are nothing a like. And that is what makes this film so much better than the other. The point of this film isn't to make you believe in a fantastic idea. This is plain and simple a mystery that uses historical clues. The story too is much tighter, constructed with a countdown, and just all around more exciting. Howard also deals with the subject matter much more deftly (even though I still think someone with a darker touch, like Fincher, would have been more appropriate). In all, this is a very good mystery/thriller. There was only one thing really that rubbed me the wrong way: (WARNING! SPOILER) the ending. After the big reveal and you find out who was behind everything, if you think about things, its hard not to laugh. I mean, how realistic of a plan is this: OK, I want to become the next pope so I'll kill off all the other nominees, steal a nuclear(like) bomb and set it up so that they'll discover it at the last second. Then I will fly it up in a helicopter with the bomb (to be everyone's savior), have it explode (which would probably make the blast worst, cuz in real life, nukes are detonated in the air for a larger blast radius, not from the ground), but I WILL ESCAPE THE EXPLOSION IN A PARACHUTE, land safely, and because I did such a daring act of compassion, they will elect me as the next pope. Facts like it is impossible to actually expect to live through all that and that the papal laws will never allow this kind of election (and since the Catholic church ISN'T the most conservative group in the world, the first thing OF COURSE will be to break with two thousand years of tradition). Sounds like an airtight, realistic plan to me. Right? Anyways, to get back to the film, it is exciting, a fun mystery, and well made."

It expects us to believe that an American professor would know more about the Vatican, Italy, and the Italian culture than career Vatican employees and Italians. Tom Hanks is far from believable as an ""Indiana Jones""-type professor who supposedly knows more than just about anyone in the world about Catholisism, or Italian history or culture.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Ron Howard continue to put out drivel and garbage and this is one of their latest excrement.

","1. Carmelengo wants to unite religion and science, or maybe let science take over religion. His ""heroic"" act (heroic if he was not illuminati) shows that not only could one die for religion/faith, but also for science - religious terrorists as compared to scientific terrorists. 2. All religions are flawed, like all human beings. Could we see religion as an individual human being? Its beauty, its character, its way of thinking, as well as its ugliness? 3. Religion and science - can they co-exist? New Carmelengo handing over Galileo's manuscript to Langdon - science to study religion. But can religion study science? 4. Religion has to depend on science to solve its own problems - using closed circuit television to unveil the misdeeds of Carmelengo. But does science have to depend on religion?"

","""Angels and Demons"" is actually my favorite Dan Brown book, more than the more popular ""The Da Vinci Code."" Even when I was just reading A&D, you already get a sense of how cinematic the entire story was. Apart from the obvious travelogue interest in the Rome and Vatican locales where the action takes place, we also get a closer look into the inner workings of the Vatican and the fabled history of the Illuminati.<br/><br/>""Angels and Demons"" the movie stayed quite loyal to the main storyline of the book. The Pope just died and the Cardinals are in conclave to elect a new Pope. Before that could happen however, a terrorist kidnapped four favored Cardinals and starts to kill them ceremonially in various locations, invoking the Church's historical dispute with the Illuminati. This terrorist does all this while holding the entire Vatican City under threat of annihilation with a powerful anti-matter explosive. The plot, especially the ending, is admittedly very unlikely and highly over-the-top but it makes for a perfect summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>For me, the most interesting character in A&D is the enigmatic Camerlengo. He is the priest who is the dead Pope's closest aide and confidante, and who temporarily holds the Papal powers while the new Pope has yet to be elected. I remember I was very fascinated with this character because I have never heard of such a position in the Vatican, even after years of Catholic education. I learned afterward that Dan Brown fictionalized this part as a real Camerlengo should be a Cardinal, an elector and possible candidate for Pope, unlike what was written in the book. The movie makes major changes in the character of this Camerlengo. In the book, his name is Carlo Ventresca, a young Italian priest. In the movie, he becomes Patrick McKenna, a young Irish priest who used to fly military missions against the IRA. I do not know if these modifications were made to fit the actor who played him, Ewan McGregor, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the main debit of the movie for me is still the actor playing the main character, Robert Langdon. Tom Hanks is completely wrong as Robert Langdon. It did not work in DVC, nor did it work here in A&D. The other members of the cast did very well in their roles. Israeli stunner Ayelet Zurer made a very good Vittoria Vetra. She is much better than Audrey Tatou was in DVC. Stellan Skargaard and Armin Muller Stahl were solid and imposing as Commander Richter and Cardinal Strauss respectively. It was a bit of a stretch to imagine Ewan MacGregor as a priest, much less the Camerlengo, but he was not bad at all.<br/><br/>So overall, this is a very good and exciting summer movie. Ron Howard did much better in this one than DVC. As before, do not take everything seriously as this is fiction. For those who have not read the book, read it! And later, you will be enticed to research more about Vatican lore, the Papacy, and the Illuminati, as I was, to distinguish what is fact from the fiction."
"iamrob7","4","2","4","18 May 2009"," Parachuting Priests....er....
","I quite enjoyed the Da Vinci Code so I should preface this by saying I thought this was most definitely inferior to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was a decent thriller, blighted by a few fairly major problems.<br/><br/>Firstly the opening 30mins of the film involved far too much chasing round involving mutterings about various symbols. There was a lot of muttering about symbols and uninteresting historical figures. I love History myself but I found this all very uninvolving. Too much focus on a car skidding round with dramatic music and not enough focus on actual context.<br/><br/>The film did begin to pick up as time went along, although not by much. Unfortunately I had guessed from the beginning that Ewan Ms character was going to turn out to be the bad guy. It was something about the way he was being acted and a few key things he said. The scene when the guards run in and shoot his would be attackers was fairly implausible and the moment Ewan said 'he is the one' just before the guy got shot kind of confirmed my suspicion that he was indeed the bad guy.<br/><br/>But wait...what is this....they find the bomb and then Ewans character grabs the bomb jumps in a helicopter and then parachutes out of it leaving the bomb to explode 10000feet up in the sky. Ey? I was thinking, maybe I'm wrong, maybe he isn't the bad guy...I mean what kind of insane bad guy sets up a plot whereby he has to fly a helicopter into the sky with a bomb on board and parachute out with about 10seconds to go. That would be quite a risk for a bad guy to take, presumably he must have organised the chopper and the parachute...<br/><br/>So I am thinking this movie is terrible if these are genuine heroics...a priest parachuting out of a chopper after flying it into the sky...seriously...it was just a little hard to swallow.<br/><br/>However it quickly became clear thanks to a recording of the Papal offices that he was indeed the bad guy and just previous to the chopper flying he had branded himself with a red hot metal branding stick and faked the whole assault from the perceived bad guy.<br/><br/>So...he was the bad guy behind it all and that helicopter thing was an elaborate plot he had setup to secure his place as the pope afterwards. BIT OF A GAMBLE...you might say...I mean not only the whole plot which was absurd in the first place with the bomb and the chopper etc etc...gambling that the two people who could have revealed his plot would be shot dead when they were discovered near him when he was branded...but to gamble that the conclave would then elect him pope for the whole chopper thing...I mean that is quite a plan...ambitious doesn't really say it does it...<br/><br/>Anyhow there are many other implausible aspects to this movie which I won't complain about, It is not that I have a problem with implausibility in film...it is just that this film stretched it to the absolute limit...a lot of things made very little sense at all and the film was quite uninvolving for large periods.<br/><br/>My advice is in future they slow the whole thing down, stop with the cars driving fast and the music and the largely uninteresting mutterings, give us some real depth of history and make the story at least mildly plausible.<br/><br/>Note to the director - If you find yourself making a movie where a priest who is currently the acting head of the Catholic church parachutes from a Helicopter which has an antimatter bomb in it...just stop...stop what you are doing and rethink the whole thing...you have gone wrong somewhere..."
"hamzajaffar","9","2","4","15 May 2009"," Great Adaptation!!!
","I saw this movie as a preview and to say the least I had a wonderful experience. although for some absurd reason the critics in London have grilled the movie but for no reason the director or the movie as a project deserves the thrashing.<br/><br/>da vinci code was a good movie but i had my reservations against its adaptation. as far as the adaptation is concerned angels and demons was great. there are a few things that do not coincide with the book but the changes were acceptable and fully justifiable.<br/><br/>some sequences have been shown with less depth and some deleted but it has to be kept in mind that if all these minute details were considered, this movie would have been at least 5 hours in lenght. and thats not the case with this movie rather its with any adaptation be it Charlie and the chocolate factory or the Bourne identity.<br/><br/>tom hanks as Robert langdon does not need any description. to say the least he carried forward his spell created from da vinci code as Harvard symbologist. the role of Vittoria vetra played by ayelet zurer was carried out efficiently but Ewan McGregor as camerlengo Patrick was the surprise package. his acting was superb! Ron Howard has moved to a different level of direction. direction was nearly flawless.<br/><br/>in the end what matters is whether the cast & crew were able to recreate the magic as the author or not. my brother who went with me to see the movie had'nt read the book but was astounded by the ""magic created"". for me its recommended to every movie lover. u wont be disappointed for sure."
"abecipriano","8","2","4","15 May 2009"," Nice ride, good to watch, but not as good as the book
","I just saw Angels and Demons from its first screening yesterday in Manila, and I must say that it's a decent rendition of the book.<br/><br/>Basically, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is asked by the Vatican (or at least the security people handling most of the Vatican except for the Pope's protection which is care of the Swiss guard) to help understand the symbols and other forms of symbolism to help catch an erstwhile thought long-gone group called the Illuminati.<br/><br/>The Illuminati has apparently kidnapped the 4 Preferiti, the top cardinals who are on top of the Vatican cardinals' list to succeed the recently deceased Pope. And not only are they threatening to kill them off every hour, they also stole a device with a deadly bomb-esquire effect and hid it somewhere in the Vatican.<br/><br/>Now there's a race against time as the hours pass, and thousands of people waiting in St. Peter's Square to wait for the announcement of the new Pope.<br/><br/>I actually found this movie lag behind Da Vinci Code in terms of twists, build up to the climax, and action, which is unlike the book in the sense that I prefer the Angels and Demons book compared to The Da Vinci Code because of its action, suspense and twists and superb plot.<br/><br/>Whether this will make millions, the answer is clearly sure, but whether it will become a classic movie thriller/mystery, I'm not certain. At any rate, it's a good movie to watch and simply enjoy, but I don't see myself buying the DVD as soon as it comes out."

","I was not really a fan of Dan Brown until Da Vinci Code was released. It left me wondering how did he come up with that story. When I heard about Angels and Demons it made me say ""I must see that movie"". And so I did. Hanks did a really good acting and the role was very impressive. He's a brilliant professor really trying to help without asking in return. For me, he played the role of an angel sent by God to search for the truth and make the people see who the real enemy is. It was not an exaggerating film but not a simple one. It just showed that it doesn't matter what your faith may be as long as you have the heart to truly save other people's lives."

","Angels and Demons starts off with the pope dying and the Vatican looking for his replacement. However, the four frontrunner cardinals for the pope and a vial of antimatter get stolen (all by one super-soldier guy) and it's up to ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), sidekick physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to figure out who the kidnapper/thief is.<br/><br/>They don't have much time as one cardinal will be killed per hour and at midnight, the antimatter vial will break from it's magnetic container and cause a huge explosion. And, of course all the police are effectively useless and it's up to Langdon and sidekick Vetra to figure it all out.<br/><br/>The movie follows that formula: Langdon figures out the first location, some action scenes and ""time is running out"" suspense. Then another, then another. The problem is, it's so compacted that you're just hopping from one epiphany to the next. It's almost like the hold Batman and Robin tv shows where Batman is given a crazy clue from the riddler, thinks about it, then comes up with the solution after a few seconds. After doing this so many times in this movie, it becomes silly.<br/><br/>What's also silly is the plot. So the pope's son Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) is the ultimate villain, wanting to gain the papacy as he believes the church is getting to chummy with science. So he concocts a plan to get a guy to steal the 4 cardinals, a vial of antimatter, send Langdon and team on a wild goose chase only to save the antimatter vial just in time for it to just about explode and the only option is for McKenna to single handedly take it in a helicopter, sacrificing his life, but jumping from a parachute at the last moment. The conclave, seeing an apparent miracle, decide he should be the next pope. That's some Rube Goldberg type planning.<br/><br/>I did enjoy The Da Vinci code much more. It's been a while, but I do remember it had much of the same thing, but not as condensed. This was a case of too much of a good thing + too crazy of a plan and it just ended up as a boring, silly, mess of a movie. That said, the twist with McKenna did surprise me. Sure, I had thoughts he was the villain, but I didn't *know*. That alone bumped this from a 5 to a 6."
"stefannemanja7","8","0","0","14 June 2020"," Analysts...
","Since ""Angels & Demons"" depends on a split-second schedule and a ticking time bomb that could destroy the Vatican, it's a little distracting when the Camerlengo, a priest entrusted with the pope's duties between papacies, breaks into the locked enclave of the College of Cardinals and lectures them on centuries of church history.<br/><br/>These men, many of them elderly, may face death in minutes, which the Camerlengo knows. The Commander of the Swiss Guard thinks he can evacuate the Vatican and the hundreds of thousands of faithful waiting in St. Peter's Square in 15 minutes before an explosion vaporizes ""a big chunk of Rome,"" but frankly we in the audience think a lot of monsignors back home are going to receive promotions real soon.<br/><br/>Since very few plot details in the film are remotely plausible, including its desperate chase across Rome, the history lesson is excusable. Having been told about the long war between the church and the Illuminati, and religion and science, we are grateful for the briefing, even if the cardinals already know most of the history. This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. ""Angels & Demons"" succeeds.<br/><br/>It's based on a novel that came before ""The DaVinci Code"" in Dan Brown's oeuvre. Prof. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is at Harvard when he is summoned from a swimming pool by an emissary from the Vatican, and flown to Rome to face a crisis. Earlier, we learned, a rare, sealed vial of anti-matter was stolen from the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, and a note taking credit comes from the Illuminati, a secret society that has long hated the Catholic Church because of the days when it persecuted Galileo and other scientists.<br/><br/>A ""popular and progressive"" pope has just died. The cardinals have been summoned to elect his successor. Four of them, the preferati, the favorites to be next pope, have been kidnapped. They will be executed in succession at 8, 9, 10 and 11 p.m., until the battery on the anti-matter vial runs out of juice at midnight and the faithful will see more than a puff of white smoke above the Vatican. I don't recall if the Illuminati had any demands. Maybe it just wants revenge.<br/><br/>In that case, why hide the vial at the end of a trail that can only be followed by clues discovered or intuited by Professor Langdon? Why not just blow up the place? What is the purpose of the scavenger hunt? Has it all been laboriously constructed as a test of Langdon's awesome knowledge? Are the Illuminati trying to get even after Langdon foiled Opus Dei, another secret society, in ""The DaVinci Code""?<br/><br/>I don't know, and, reader, there is no time to care. Langdon uses his knowledge of Illuminati symbols to follow the trail though four Rome churches. He has uncanny luck. He spots and correctly identifies every clue, even though they're very well-hidden. Just as well, because one dungeon overlooked or one statue pointing the wrong way, and he loses. For his companion, Langdon has the beautiful and brilliant Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) from CERN. Her father was murdered in the anti-matter theft. Her purpose is (a) to explain that the battery will indeed run down, (b) request her father's secret journals from Geneva, although they are never read, and (c) run along everywhere with Tom Hanks, to provide him with urgent conversation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there is intrigue within the Vatican and lots of red herrings among all the red hats. The young Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), the adopted son of the late pontiff, joins the professor's desperate quest, as does the commander (Stellan Skarsgard) of the pope's protectors, the Swiss Guard. Inside the conclave, Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is in charge of the election. Because of his sinister mien (I love the phrase sinister mien), German accent and absolutist views on church tradition, he seems set up to be a suspect, since the progressive pope's death may have been an inside job. (I forgot to mention that there has also been time to exhume the pontiff's remains and discover evidence of poisoning.)<br/><br/>All of this happens at breakneck speed, with little subtlety, but with fabulous production values. The interiors of the Sistine Chapel, the Pantheon, churches, tombs and crypts are rendered dramatically, the College of Cardinals looks both (a) very impressive, and (b) like a collection of elderly extras from Cinecitta.<br/><br/>The film by no means tilts the conflict between science and religion one way or the other. The professor is not religious, indeed seems agnostic, but the church, however, is not portrayed as anti-science. Galileo would be happy that there is now a Vatican Observatory. If the Illuminati are indeed scientists, they would better employ themselves not avenging ancient deeds, but attacking modern fundamentalist cults.<br/><br/>The professor has a fascinating exchange with the Camerlengo, who asks him if he believes in God. He believes, he says, that the existence is God is beyond his mind to determine. ""And your heart?"" asks the priest. ""My heart is not worthy."" Agnostics and believers can both find something to agree with there; director Ron Howard does an even-handed job of balancing the scales.<br/><br/>So good, indeed, that even after Howard accused the church of refusing him access to Vatican locations, and although the dependable William Donohue of the Catholic League has attacked his film, ""Angels & Demons"" received a favorable review from the official Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which wrote it is a ""harmless entertainment which hardly affects the genius and mystery of Christianity.""<br/><br/>And come on, Ron: Would you expect the church to let you shoot a Dan Brown thriller in the Sistine Chapel? Get real.<br/><br/>S."

A guy can leave America and go to Vatican, but Anglo-america won't ever leave his heart. And here we are, ""United States saving the world"", again. Thanos must be doing a double facepalm somewhere, and laughing at the tragedy of the ultimate cringe this movie absolutely delivers.

""From Santi's earthly tomb with demon's hole, 'Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.

","While I like Tom Hanks, I'm not a big fan of religious machinations, so I watched this with some skepticism. I was quickly turned around.<br/><br/>This taut thriller directed by Ron Howard keeps you on your toes as a Harvard historian (Robert Langdon played by Hanks) is called in by the Vatican police to find who deployed a bomb using antimatter stolen from CERN that will destroy central Rome in 24 hours.<br/><br/>Langdon teams up with the CERN scientist who created the antimatter, and together they slowly catch up with the hired hand who is killing papal candidates (the pope appears to have died, but was actually murdered). Plenty of potential evildoers are highlighted, from shadowy Illuminati who leave too many clues, to a cardinal who seems to eager to become the next pope, to the deceased pope's personal servant, to the chief of the Swiss guard sworn to protect the pope.<br/><br/>In the end, the day is saved and a new pope is elected, but not before an antimatter blast lights up the skies above Rome at the proverbial midnight hour. This is one of the many forgivable gaffes in the film, as a 1 gram antimatter explosion even high in the sky would have blasted Rome anyway. There's a reason 5 kiloton nuclear weapons are detonated well above ground as they drop, to maximize blast damage. At least the film, unlike the book, shows some damage being done. There are other little weaknesses in the plot (an experienced assassin who gets in a getaway car supplied by his contractor without worrying about said contractor wanting to erase all traces of the crime?!). Nothing that requires enough suspension of disbelief to ruin the plot, though. As always, view the film on its own merits rather than worrying about the book, which of course has more motivation, more detail, more character development.<br/><br/>It's a (antimatter) blast, and even after the denouement (which was not easy to guess ahead of time because there were, as I said, plenty of bad-guy-candidates), one could see the film again for all the loving little details."

To begin with, the founding of the Order of the Illuminati can be dated very precisely to May 1, 1776; Galileo kicked the bucket in 1642, the same year the greatest scientist who ever lived was born, and he died two decades before Adam Weishaupt was born.

Unlike most action adventure movies, Tom Hanks and his female sidekick do no more or less than they are able which is plenty. The movie contains scenes that drive one to infuriating frustration by the awfulness of what's occurring but it sure makes the ultimate climax all that more exhilarating. While not a classic, perhaps not even a great movie, this action adventure is decent, has great suspense and thrills and chills that rival such movies as Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs. The pseudo-climax is actually some of the best special effects, literally exploding on the screen. This intellectual movie with action is in the league of National Treasure and Nicholas Cage but with a more sophisticated and oddly enough a stronger emotionally faith-based, not fantasy-based basis for appreciation. 8/10."

","Now I have never read any of Dan Brown's novels, they are all mainly too long. The Da Vinci Code was mainly a complete bore so I lost interest in both it's sequels when they came out. However I happened to see this film a few days ago and realized that it really wasn't that bad. When the Illuminati kidnap four cardinals that are possibilities to succeed the old Pope after he passed away. The church summons Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to find out how and why the Illuminati have returned and to hopefully find the cardinals. Now, I don't think this is a great film by any stretch but it is a very enjoyable and exciting thriller. It is one of these disposable thrillers that you watch on a boring day. The film has some very well directed sequences and the editing as well as the score were both excellent. The content was shallow and if you look for a film that's more in depth, you will be disappointed. However for those who look for a fun thriller that's exciting and features a straight forward story with a few twists and turns, look no further."

Strong acting performances all around. An interesting plot, but you do need to take a leap of faith for at least a part of it. If you do not like violence, I suggest this film is not for you.

","Suffering from the same set of issues that plagued its predecessor, Angels & Demons manages to be at least a little more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code, thanks to its swift pace & consistently moving narrative, but the ridiculous twists & endless expositions don't make the ride any smoother.<br/><br/>The story of Angels & Demons follows symbologist Robert Langdon who this time teams up with a nuclear physicist to solve another murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican while the Roman Catholic Church prepares for one of its most significant events; the election of the next Pope.<br/><br/>Directed by Ron Howard, this sequel utilises the original's blueprint and is once again marred by a slew of nonsensical twists & absurd revelations, however, this time, it doesn't feel as stationary as the first film. A better pace does help in keeping the interest alive for a longer duration but the end result is still underwhelming.<br/><br/>Performances offer no improvement, for Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon in the same flat manner as he did the last time and the new cast around him is just as forgettable. Its dynamic camera-work keeps the plot in motion and while its fast pace is a welcome upgrade, its never-ending exposition rarely makes sense yet keeps on rambling.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Angels & Demons is another incompetently directed, poorly written & lifelessly acted entry in Robert Langdon's film series but it's richly photographed, briskly edited & features a thrilling score which makes it slightly more bearable than The Da Vinci Code.

","Having just seen the da vinci code and in preparation for inferno I have watched angels and demons today and I feel like this film is similar to the original and doesn't improve. The premise of the film sees professor robert langdon brought in to investigate a murder linked to the Vatican. Tom hanks is back as langdon and is probably the best part of this film. He gives a strong performance and his character fits hanks really well so you get behind him. Ewan McGregor is in this film and he also does a great job with a layered performance that makes you appreciate how good an actor he is. Stellan skarsgard plays the police captain, he does a decent job in this film even.though his character isn't given much development at all. The only performance I didn't like at all was ayelet zurer who just comes across as the obligatory female character that doesn't have any character or development at all. The plot is just like the previous film that it is basically a treasure hunt that gets a bit too complex and bloated for its own good. It does have some interesting moments and I like McGregor's side plot but there are scenes that are unnecessary and a twist that is too predictable. The script also sees no improvement, the dramatic dialogue just doesn't hit and it doesn't get you emotionally invested like it should. Also there is literally like no humour that really hurts the film. The style of this film is allot darker then the da vinci code and that is a good decision for the film. But this film is very slow and sloppily paced that it feels longer then it actually is. Overall this is an average film that isn't as good as It could have been."

"CinematicInceptions","6","0","0","30 November 2015"," Rather bland overall. Not bad, but not good.
","I would hesitate to say that this adaptation is similar to the book. If you're talking in terms of events that occur, yes it's the same story. But in terms of theme and overall feel and effect it's very different. Some of this was inevitable, but not all. What I thought was great about the book was the mystery and revelation of the Illuminati path and the who and why of the whole anti-matter plot along with the debates over religion and science. The book was so intriguing, or so it seems to me, because of it's complexity and extensive setups for the big payoffs. But you can't fit all of that into a two-hour movie, so the result was a few chopped scenes and plot threads, which made the movie suffer. We saw this when Eragon was made into a movie and a few parts of the story were slapped together into something that sort of resembled the complicated novel. With Angels and Demons, the result is a rather bland movie. There's no emotion from the characters and the fast pace reduces the suspense. It's like a historical, though dramatic, portrayal of the events of the book. Usually it's the inverse as with classics, where the actors and director give more life and complexity to the characters from the book. In this case, the filmmakers also decided to make the safe, some might say cowardly, decision to chop most of the science vs. religion debates from the book. I can understand that the studio and other people involved didn't want their name on anything that could be construed as propaganda, especially since people tend to forget about the disclaimer that the studio doesn't necessarily agree with whatever they're showing has to say. Granted, the book had its flaws, mostly in being predictable and stretching plausible reality at a couple of points, but at least it was interesting.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, the camerlengo, the assassin, the presiding bishop, and the head of the swiss guard are all in the movie. The only significant character that isn't included is Maximillian Kohler. The characters are much different than in the novel. They have much less personality, with the possible exception of Langdon, and have next to no motivation even the camerlengo. Most of the camerlengo's spirited beliefs about blending science and religion and not being enslaved to one or the other are gone, even though he has the same revelation about planting the antimatter. Langdon comes off as a more active character than in the novel, but he has no more depth than the other characters.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it, the plot is fairly interesting. With little time to process everything while watching the movie, it might get a little confusing. So you may want to read a summary and watch a trailer before watching it and take notes on the plot. It's good to have at least some background knowledge of catholicism. I wouldn't say that you have to be a catholic or Christian to understand it, but just keep in mind that there is some religious history involved.<br/><br/>The technical execution isn't anything special, but the movie looks nice. The fiery contrast of colors adds to the dramatic feel along with the sound effects and lighting and score. But it's not shot superbly and the acting is standard; definitely not bad, but not good either.<br/><br/>I would recommend this more to people who haven't read the book but might want to. Without knowing the plot twists and such, the movie might have a greater effect on non- readers. To those who have read the book, I wouldn't anticipate that it will affect you too strongly outside of being disappointing. It's somewhat entertaining. I'd rather watch it than not, but I'm in no rush to see it again either. So it might be worth your time to set aside a night or two for it, but don't expect to be wowed. Just a couple of closing remarks: you don't have to have seen Da Vinci Code beforehand and in case I didn't fully address this earlier, you don't have to worry about having any religious beliefs, your own or anyone else's, attacked or anything like that. Overall Rating: 7.4/10."

","I understand that an adaption from book to movie (especially this book) implies changes and that a movie has to stand for itself alone (and therefore mustn't be compared to the book), but I was disappointed nonetheless.<br/><br/>My opinion may be biased because I've read the book, so I'll say only a few things. If you've read the book and are curious how they adapted the various events, characters and story lines, I recommend to you to NOT watch it! Many events and characters are missing completely, sadly.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the book, I don't know if you should watch it or not. The movie has some good in it, but in my eyes misses almost completely the message of the book and leaves a villain whose true motives aren't really explained.<br/><br/>The movie contains a LOT of exposition.

"afcn","5","0","0","5 August 2014"," Entertaining, if you can ignore the plot holes
","Not having read the book (or any books by Dan Brown), I found this flick rather entertaining when I watched it just recently on a long-haul flight. So yes, the movie serves its purpose of killing approx. 140 minutes of your time on a rainy afternoon, during travel et cetera. But does it accomplish this in a smart way?<br/><br/>No, and this for several reasons: First of all, it's one of the movies where the protagonists keep on talking and explain even the most basic things, so the audience will get it. Second, there is no wasted screen time: If they mention something, you can be very sure it will be used in a certain way or become a danger to someone later on.<br/><br/>However, the obvious plot holes bothered me much more (and the per se nice twist at the end opens those holes even wider): Why, for God's sake (sic!), all the effort from the evil guy? Yes, sure, he wants us to believe something wicked is going on, but let's admit that the first body probably would have never been found - Even Langdon found the entrance merely by chance. Just shooting the four hostages would have severed the purpose just fine. Why bring in Langdon at all? So somebody could find the bodies, and in the same way to put the whole operation at risk? What if Langdon failed to find the bomb? In other words, the movie failed to explain the villain's motivation for all this in any plausible way, especially as all the other stuff is explained over and over again.<br/><br/>Then there is this professional killer who manages to virtually eliminate half of Rome's police force (ammunition never runs out, of course), but is stupid enough to... well, find out for yourself. <br/><br/>Or just basic things, such as the retina scanner: The bad guy cuts out somebodies eye to bypass the retina scanner. However, he needs to go through it to get into the specific lab where the guy that he murders sits. Don't tell me you only need to scan your eye on the way out, but not in. Even if that would be the case, there was blood on the scanner on the outside, but the eye is on the inside, close to the dead body. Hello?! And the movie is full of such things. Enjoy!"

","Well, I really enjoyed this film. But, I will start with the bad things. So, I thought the screenplay was mediocre. And because of this fact, it was obvious who the bad guy/villain was.<br/><br/>For me, a very important thing in movies or movie series, is the time line. So Angels & Demons by Dan Brown was written in 2000, while The Da Vinci Code in 2003. So, and I also think Brown stated this, The Da Vinci Code is Angels & Demons's sequel. But speaking for the films, The Da Vinci Code was adapted for the screen in 2006 and 3 years later in 2009 this movie that I am reviewing now. At first I thought they made a prequel, but I read somewhere that they changed the time line from the books, so they actually made Angels & Demons, the sequel for The Da Vinci Code. It is a little confusing.<br/><br/>So related to this, if it is actually a prequel, then I must say that Tom Hanks actually looks older. So unless the makeup artist was an idiot it is indeed a sequel.<br/><br/>I know most people said that it is better than the first film because the first one was kind of boring and the action was mainly composed of Tom Hanks talking. I disagree. The first film kept me entertained the whole time. And, like this one, it was a 2 and a half hours movie. I think both films are great and you should probably have them in your ""movie archive"".<br/><br/>What was my opinion, more concrete, relating to the dilemma on which of the films was better?

"GLanoue","Null","0","0","18 September 2011"," Nice shots of Rome are not enough
","This adaptation of the Dan Brown novel of the same name tries hard to be faithful to the pseudo-erudite tone of the book but just doesn't quite make it. Ron Howard is not a subtle director; his straightforward style could have worked to simplify the book's complexities, but it doesn't. I think one of the major reasons is that it is a bad book, but the prequel Da Vinci code was so popular that the screenwriter and Howard were perhaps a bit too respectful. Howard, to give him credit, tries with a kind of chiaroscuro lighting scheme but even that doesn't seem to work. Many scenes are simply too dark, and chiaroscuro is light and dark combined. Rome is wonderfully lit at night, but nothing equals the daytime sky that inspired so many artists. Howard opted for night time scenes (like in the book) but this just muddies the images, since most are dark close ups rather than dramatically lit piazzas, churches and monuments. Light and dark only work in panoramic shots that can include both. Switching from light to dark doesn't work when the action is set at night. Second, the book insists in making John Langdon into something of a James Bond, Sean Connery style. This may be believable for some, but anyone who knows Harvard professors and ""symbologists"" also knows that not too many are going to be running the 100 yard dash in under 10 seconds, swinging wildly from balustrades, and hold their breath under water for 30 seconds. Most of these guys are so used to talking that the underwater silence alone would kill them, not to mention the gymnastics and their bodies toned by thousands of hours in those armchairs. In brief, it is just not credible, as neither are the clues and riddles and Langdon's solutions to them: too easy. These are supposed to be the Illuminati, the greatest assembly of geniuses the world has ever seen, able to battle the greatest spy network in the world, the Vatican. Yet it alls seems a bit lowbrow. It's like the first book: playing word games in Latin may dazzle people who haven't studied the language, but they're not too difficult to figure out if you have. Hanks tries, as always. He is very good at being earnest as he gets older. Unfortunately, the female lead was not the love interest this time around, and no one really holds our interest except Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo, the Chamberlain who is the eminence grise in the interregnum following a pope's death. He communicates the real power and responsibility he wields behind the scenes. Hanks' Langdon comes across as a clever but preachy high school teacher, and Vittoria Vetra is not a so convincing scientist that we believe she has found the mysterious ""God particle"" at the heart of the plot. All in all, not a bad movie, and worth watching just for the shots of Rome (though these are not so good as a decent travelogue on the Discovery Channel), but not so interesting, and the lighting, meant to be provocative, is only irritating."

You really don't need to read the novel that the movie is based upon to enjoy it.<br/><br/>There are some really good performances in this film, especially from Hanks, who proved himself as a solid leading man many times. Here, he really shines as a leading man.<br/><br/>There is some serious problems with character development with supporting characters, especially ""Dr. Vittoria Vetra"" (Ayelet Zurer), whose antimatter is being used as a weapon, and ""Camerlengo Patrick McKenna"" (Ewan McGregor), who turns an interesting plot twist that I never expected at the end, but isn't seen as much as I would like.<br/><br/>Another problem with this movie is that it is obvious that they opted for green screen for many scenes depicting Roman Catholic churches within Rome's city limits (the church refused to allow the movie to be filmed at the locations since the church declared the book offensive to the church). A barely trained eye (which I have since I learned TV production back in high school) could see the actors were in front of a green screen. These effects will become noticeable to the untrained eye as the film ages, and special effects advance.<br/><br/>One thing this movie does pretty well is that it gives very little time for the audience to breathe between action and plot advancing scenes. You get excited as ""Langdon"" and ""Vetra"" get closer to the murderer(s) as they discover new clues.<br/><br/>Despite not being able to shoot on location, and the threat of a strike at the time, Ron Howard did a great job in the director's chair as usual. He was able to use interesting camera angles to help tell the story nicely.<br/><br/>I can't really say I noticed the soundtrack of the movie, since I barely pay attention to instrumentals since that's not my style I listen to.

"jeddjong","7","0","0","20 February 2011"," Angelic Possession - Ron Howard and co attempt to atone for ""The Da Vinci Code"", and mostly succeed
","Harvard professor and symbology super-sleuth Robert Langdon is back in this second adaptation of a Dan Brown novel. Besides the main character (played again by the inimitable Tom Hanks), the Oscar-winning team of director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer have returned for the sequel. In the wake of 2006's critically-derided The Da Vinci Code, how does its screen sequel fare?<br/><br/>There's a terrorist threat to the Papal Conclave in the Vatican, and the clues seem to suggest an ancient evil is rearing his head, so the Vatican turn to Dr Robert Langdon. He is roped in by Inspector Ernesto Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) of the Gendarme Corps of Vatican City State (otherwise known as the Vatican Police) and decipher cryptic symbols left as clues by the Illuminati and assist the Swiss Guard and the afore-mentioned Vatican Police in rescuing the four cardinals and finding the antimatter before it consumes the Vatican. The beautiful CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) is also drawn into the fray, but even the combined expertise of both academics seems almost powerless to stop the looming Illuminati threat.<br/><br/>Now, if the above synopsis sounds far-fetched, be warned that it is just the tip of this cinematic iceberg. Author Dan Brown is known for meddling fact and fiction and even passing off the former as the latter, achieving at-times laughable results. Plenty of plot points are downright ludicrous and there are enough contrivances to fill St Peter's Square. The key prefix in this film is ""pseudo"" – the film is built on pseudo-science, pseudo-history, pretty much pseudo-everything. Stock characters and a fish market of red herrings also populate the picture. Therefore, suspension of disbelief is key. Thankfully though, the movie is paced well-enough, so much so that one eventually buys into the hodgepodge and goes along for the ride.<br/><br/>We are treated to a wonderful tour of The Vatican City that is part The Amazing Race (but with dead bodies and shootouts instead of roadblocks and detours), part dramatic angel's-eye-views of the world's smallest country. The fortress-church Castel Sant' Angelo, the famous Sistine Chapel, Santa Maria Del Popolo with its imposing obelisk and the former Roman temple of ""all gods"" the Pantheon all figure in this whirlwind romp. While some of Angels & Demons was shot on location, the filmmakers were not granted access to several sites within the Vatican Walls, as such set reconstructions and some digital magic was employed. The results are actually fairly impressive, one might even be fooled into thinking the computer-generated replicas are the real thing.<br/><br/>Ron Howard and company are eminent forces in Hollywood today and exert that power by casting relatively big names. While this film boasts slightly less star power than its predecessor (The Da Vinci Code had actors such as Jean Reno and Ian McKellen among its cast), everyone puts in fairly credible performances here. Tom Hanks lends much credibility to the Langdon role, and gets plenty more to do in this than in the last film, from dodging bullets to saving a drowning man and from taking a dip in speedos to feverishly thumbing through ancient documents. Some of the time though, Hanks clearly has his tongue in his cheek, and especially excels in the rare humorous moments that do ease the cinematic tension. As the female lead, Israeli actress Zurer does barely as good a job as Hanks, relegated to tagging along in the mad dashes from church to church. However, she isn't a bad actress per se and I look forward to seeing her in more Hollywood projects.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, it is good to see Ewan ""Obi-Wan"" McGregor turning in his Jedi robes from the Star Wars prequel trilogy for the Camerlengo's cossack and back in a blockbuster, and truth be told he does a mighty fine job. The incredible Stellan Skarsgard (whom we've seen in such films as Good Will Hunting, The Hunt For the Red October and the Pirates of the Caribbean films), though seems under-utilized as the prickly Commandante; despite this the actor still fleshes out the slight bitterness his character bears towards Langdon with much relish.<br/><br/>The film's small departures from the book seem to be a two-edged sword; on one hand the story has been streamlined and does work better for the screen, but on the other, interesting characters and other elements seem to have been sacrificed. Also, the book came before The Da Vinci Code, but the time-line has been altered such that this functions as a sequel, and the romantic subplot has been jettisoned in favour of a strictly professional relationship between Langdon and Vetra. It seems they learned their lesson from being too slavishly faithful to the book of ""The Da Vinci Code"".<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable in spite of (or perhaps because of) its sheer absurdity, offering up legitimate thrills and even a couple of outstanding action sequences. Far from being offensive or overly-controversial, Angels & Demons ends up being more cotton candy fluff than a ""lofty quest"". But have angels guided Howard and Co. in their mission nonetheless? Perhaps, though this film does have its fair share of demons to contend with as well.<br/><br/>RATING: 3.5/5 STARS Jedd Jong"

","Plot Based on the best selling novel by author Dan Brown, Angels & Demons is a popcorn thriller about a symbologist professor named Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks, being summoned to the Vatican to assist in foiling a diabolical plot against the church and its cardinals. The pope has died and 4 cardinals are kidnapped before the start of the ceremony to elect a new pope. A cryptic note is sent to the Vatican police that details the intentions of the Illuminati to kill the 4 cardinals and blow up Vatican City. Robert Langdon must decipher the clues and, in a sense, save the church. Along for the ride this time is beautiful and mysterious scientist Dr. Vittoria Vetra played by Ayelet Zurer. Together the two set out on a frantic hunt to find the Path to Illumination. The story is full of church intrigue, power struggles, and violence from within and without the Vatican.<br/><br/>Central Conflict One of the themes at the center of this movie is science versus religion. More specifically who owns the moment of creation? CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, is on the eve of proving the God Particle exists that created life in the universe from the collision of matter and anti-matter. The Illuminati choose this as the time to strike back at the Catholic church in an act of vengeance for a previous incident against the Illuminati referred to as La Purga where 4 members of the Illuminati were branded in the chest with crosses and burned at the stake.<br/><br/>""Are you not Entertained?"" The verdict is Guilty. I was entertained. In a recent Colbert Report interview Ron Howard stated ""The thing that Dan Brown does so well in his novels is he collects all these fringe theories and conspiracy theories, old and new, and combines them in these works of fiction and yet he puts enough verifiable history in there so that it stimulates your imagination and your curiosity while it entertains you."" Ron Howard so succinctly encapsulates why this movie and others like it such as the National Treasure are so successful.<br/><br/>Does this movie solve the issue between religion and science? No, but I think it sheds enough light on the subject to spark some interesting conversations that just might make people finally realize that religion and science are not inherently at odds with each other.<br/><br/>If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...<br/><br/>National Treasure National Treasure: Book of Secrets The Third Miracle Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed and of course ...

","As we all know, Tom Hanks is just an amazing actor. But this would have to be my least favorite movie that stars him. I mean the whole beginning of this movie was interesting. But I have a few problems with the movie as a whole. First of all, the title. Very misleading, you do not really see and angels or demons for that matter, unless you count the angel statues towards the end of the movie, however one could take this movie title out of the literal sense to represent something else. But I do not see it. Now that that's outta the way, let me address the plot. So the plot of the movie was a tad interesting I must admit. Some of Earths most brilliant scientists have created a substance called anti-matter which if this substance were to collide with matter, then a huge explosion would take place. The story picks up as this vial of Anti-Matter is stolen and the container keeping the Anti-Matter from colliding with matter will stop once the battery life runs out. So that part was interesting, but as the movie progressed the plot became rather annoying. For example, the character the Hanks portrayed just came off as being ""fake"" and it was incredibly hard for me to buy into the whole thing. Now the character pretty much had all the answers in his head, he knew everything that progressed the plot. It became quite silly. This guy could figure out everything off the top of his head and just did not seem at all plausible. But overall this movie just could not deliver. It has an interesting story line...but that's about it. Tom Hanks alone could not keep this movie afloat, in my opinion this is one of his worst roles. I just saw the actor, and not the character. This flick could have used some more work, but what exactly? That I do not know. If you wanna see something that is a cheap thriller then check out this movie, or if you're even a hardcore Tom Hanks fan, it might satisfy you. But any other kinds of moviegoers out there, just avoid this film. Its really not worth your time. So this one gets a 40%. Hopefully Tom Hanks can make up for this one."

","I don't expect much of a Ron Howard film. His films are bloodless and unappealing to me, despite the effects that are applied. His cinematic ideas are as basic and uninteresting as those annoying camera effects we have in his Dan Brown based films - cameras that move through walls as if to show us the ""hidden truth"" behind what's apparent. Dull. The biggest disaster was the ""daVinci Code"", because that was made when the book was incredibly consensual throughout the world, consensual even in its supposed revolutionary revelations. The film was so poor it couldn't even serve as a proper illustration for the book like, say, the Harry Potter films do with the books.<br/><br/>This one was a predictable failure. If they weren't able to break any rules of the genre with the first one that was already loved by the public before it was even shot, this wouldn't be where they'd make it. This had to maintain the viewers that kept following Langdon even after the cinematic code disaster. So this film uses the skeleton of the first one, and places different flesh over it. Now it's not about the grail, or the blood of Christ, instead it's about some political plot inside the Vatican. The Code was a far more interesting story, as far as the book goes, but both stories are uncinematic to me, because they only tease when you get into the details that Brown cleverly chooses to use to build his intended narrative. What he presents are narratives, versions, stories that might be true. This is done by the association of facts, not through images. That's suited for a book, not so much for a film.<br/><br/>The only significant switch here is that, more than in the Code, Langdon is more of a detective here than a researcher. In the Code, the fun was for you to understand the narrative that was being told to you, in the historical plan, by joining the puzzle pieces that were being thrown at you. Here it was about getting the ""insider"", finding who was manipulating things. Underneath the historical heavy display of facts there is a simple detective story, in the Agatha Christie tradition. And underneath that tradition is a whole heritage that American noir left us to enjoy and explore. If Ron Howard and the other people involved had got this, they might have made a decent film. This way, they didn't.<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","1st watched 11/23/2010 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ron Howard) Good puzzle-solving mystery type movie for about ¾ of the film with a confusing ending. The ending was convoluted but the rest of the movie and the search was good enough to make up for this flaw. This movie is a sequel to the Ron Howard/Tom Hanks original Catholicism thriller called ""The Davinci Code"" with the same author penning the book, Dan Brown. The movie does a great job with pacing and keeping the viewer interested and that's why I recommend the film. The Hanks' character is slightly more agitated and perturbed than in the original but keeps those feeling at bay long enough to care for people in general and help stop the murders of four potential new pope's. The story starts with the current pope dying and the electee's being kidnapped by an anti-catholic group called the Illuminati. Hanks' character is called in to help the church find them and stop their extermination. A side character is an anti-matter expert and helps find a bomb in the Vatican that could potentially blow up the region. Another side character, played by Ewan McGregor was the pope's assistant and the filmmakers play a juggling act with him, as far as how the viewer's perceive him. Other than this, no side stories are introduced and the pacing is quick which helps the movie. Overall, this was a good sequel(in the vein of the National Treasure movies) that was better than the original – in my opinion."

","Basically, the first thing you need to know is that the vast majority of people who were disappointed by this movie had read the book before seeing it. Of those who hadn't, most responded favourably. I am of the latter group. This movie is a fast-paced but not overwhelming 'follow the clues to beat the clock' type effort with just enough twists and turns to keep you involved right through. In trying to keep up with the book, they didn't really have time to develop the characters but other than Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon, who is successfully developed in The DaVinci Code, this is not a character driven story. While it requires thought to watch and keep up with the story-line, it is not a thought provoking movie. The DaVinci code challenged one's belief in the Catholic church and its teachings and this one had inklings in that direction (most notably the science vs. faith argument) but didn't lean nearly as hard on the viewer to engage the argument as part of the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Also of note, the special features included a segment on the creation of the set. Considering the size and historical significance of the locations and the inability to use the actual sites, making this movie was quite a feat.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, how can you possibly go wrong with a Tom Hanks and Ron Howard collaboration?<br/><br/>But that's just my two scents. ;)"

But if you are a little messed up(psychologically or otherwise) check it out.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: Highlights of the film include: A priest strung up on a cross burning to death, followed by an evil priest injecting heroin while screaming at his kidnapping victim, a brilliant climatic sequence involving the Popes son taking a nuclear weapon putting it into the passenger seat of a helicopter, flying the helicopter to a safe altitude, and then bailing out with a parachute, just in time for the explosion to blow him to safety. 8 out of 10 stars."

","I have been reading Dan brown novels ever since they first came in the market they all represent perhaps in a fictitious story an idea which may not be so untrue his books are real wealth of knowledge and i can't even imagine how much research he must have put it to actually write that kind of stuff. Angels and demons by Dan brown gave a lot of it's volume to explain the scientific stuffs like anti-matter and many things see the basic idea of novel is to actually bring to surface the centuries old war of science and religion. Told in a way well only way i can describe it is like attending a Howard lecture on a roller coaster ride. To be honest this movie is really well made if you are looking for good direction , great acting of course by tom hanks, great special effects especially the one where bomb goes off. But for me as a read of the novel i came in expecting the movie to have a strong message which will force us to think about stuffs. That certainly did not happen with the disastrous plot they had in order to make the movie small and you know one of those action thrillers they make these days they just killed the whole soul of the novel The most disastrous of all was the character of camerlengo his portrayal in the movie was like a hungry for power hound as compared to a very complex one shown in the novel of being a mis directed but good at heart kinda guy. Anyways for me the movie was one of the biggest disappointment being a reader of the novel more so because it was of tom hanks. but i guess if you haven't read the novel you shouldn't really care much about those things just put it in the category of indiana jones and you will enjoy it."

(I only rented this one as my wife wanted to watch it.)<br/><br/>The Pope is dead, meaning the election of a new Pope must immediately take place. However the 4 most likely ""Popes in waiting"" have been taken from Vatican City, supposedly by the Illuminati, (which will be familiar to fans of Tupac). The Illuminati have said that the four cardinals will all be killed and that Vatican City will be destroyed by a huge explosion which was conveniently lying around and stolen earlier in the film.<br/><br/>(Best way to explain the difference between the Illuminati and the Church? Illuminati: Pro science and logic, apparently banished a great many years ago and said to include many illustrious names from the art world. The Church: Pro religion (duh), and anti anyone that tries to defy their teachings.)<br/><br/>So the Church calls in Langdon to attempt to solve the case before the Illuminati kill the four cardinals, and the scientist Dr Victoria who developed the boom-boom that was stolen in the first place somehow is able to tag along.<br/><br/>Now Bob, being a symbologist and dealing more with facts is not of good terms with the Church, who have previously given him the cold shoulder when he requested permission to look into their archives for his research, but given the gravity of the situation the late Pope's right hand man, played by Ewan McGregor grants access to Bob and for some reason Victoria.<br/><br/>Now Bob is obviously a genius and in the span of two minutes reads something into every second line of the sacred documents, including things never previously discovered for centuries that lead him directly to the trail of the killer(s).<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie the chase is on, Bob and Vicky must prevent any further killing and therefore save the face and credibility of the Church, as apparently even though the church has massive funds and manpower at their disposal they never seem to uncover anything. In fact whenever Langdon does correctly interpret the latest clue or symbol and relays this info to the Church he is treated with contempt, despite being right or very nearly right every other time in the film.<br/><br/>The dialogue is overblown and preposterous, filled with a massive amount of information and detail that Bob picks off the top of his head and manages to utilize immediately to stay on the trail.<br/><br/>Victoria is simply there to lag after Bob and to receive his wordy explanations, and to shout ""Over here"" at various times, and several other recognizable faces are there as either red herrings or to cause conflict between the parties so that the audience doesn't realize that what they are watching is largely mumbo-jumbo fanciful drivel, albeit entertaining Hollywood drivel.<br/><br/>The final third is laughable to anyone who actually thinks about it realistically, but as said above all in all the film sizzles along at breakneck speed, and like most films if you are willing to ignore logic there are some good moments to be had. I just wish that the subject matter wasn't held as something sooooo important and potentially globally calamitous, as this is basically Indiana Jones lite.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10.

","By mia<br/><br/>The story starts when Dr. Vittoria and Fr. Silvano, and the Nuclear Research initiates the Large Hadron Collider and captures 3 antimatter in a special vial, without this vial if the anti-matter made contact or exposed with the matter this would likely explode like the ""Big Bang theory"" and one anti-matter can power up a whole city for many days.<br/><br/>Some Differences from the book: Book: Langdon received a phone call from the Vatican and went to the Geneva. Film: Langdon was currently swimming at the pool and one of the Vatican Gendarmerie Corps told him about the Illuminati and asked his help in the investigation. Book: All of the cardinals were killed. Film: 1 cardinal lived. Book: Leonardo Vetra father of Vittoria Vetra was killed and the first who was branded with ""Illuminati"" Film: No scene about this. Book: Vittoria was kidnapped. Film: She wasn't kidnapped. Book: The assassin was killed by Vittoria Film: The assassin was killed in a bomb of the car when he got his last payment and ignited the engine of the car. Book: Camerlengo was the son of the late pope, conceived through artificial insemination. Film: Carmerlengo was adopted by the late pope. - Only the Swiss Guard was in the Book. The story is okay but it was a bit fast and some were cut-off that the people watching wouldn't understand the mysteries within the painting, the sculptor, etc. It had the same plot as the Da Vinci Code with a lot of mystery within the Church and Rome and problem solving, and talking too. They needed to go to the first sign / symbol / marker before they'll know what would be the next one. Langdon explained the mysteries about Illuminati, the meaning of the paintings, etc. As I know they where racing against time but the thing was the time of the scenes were always around 15 minutes before the deadline. But what happen with some of the scenes before that? Yup they've compressed the whole book in 2 hours and 30 minutes so they really weren't able to act all of it to a film. They've just got some good parts in the book which is still not enough to make the movie understandable. I understand the movie because I already read the book.<br/><br/>It had the same atmosphere and graphics as the Da Vinci Code except for the 1st and last part of the movie. Not all parts of movie was filmed in Rome but in Sony Pictures Studios in LA, California as the Roman Catholic seen the Da Vinci Code as offensive. I love the structure of library in the film which they film in Angelica Library in Rome, Italy (Wish I could tour in Rome). There was even some old car inside the archive library. And it still looks brand new. Is it still moving or just a model?<br/><br/>The acting was still the same, some doesn't have any expression in their face whenever they deliver their lines or maybe that was required to them. And some characters in the book were not in the film. Lead actor is Tom Hanks whatever you saw in his acting from his other films it's the same thing. He's a very calm guy.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if the book / film really pertain with some secret society that was against the Church. Many religions are against the Roman Catholic and other religion. But I've heard that there was a Black Pope in Rome but I'm not sure if it's really true.<br/><br/>Overall: I still like the book than watching it. I can really understand the mystery within them because it was clearly explain in the book. But still, I wanted to see and curious with the scenery, places, mysteries passage way, etc that what was described in the book."

","Another fine mess the Catholic Church has gotten us into! Tom Hanks returns in ANGELS & DEMONS as Robert Langdon, atheist symbologist from THE DA VINCI CODE (2006), a little trimmer, a little wiser, a little more action man and a little less Vitruvian Man.<br/><br/>The Pope has just died and the archbishops next in line to be God's Bottom Bitch have been kidnapped by the Illuminati, who threaten Rome with implosion by anti-matter if they don't stop being irrational religious fanatics - ""science obliterating religion."" Well, Rome can't stop being irrational religious fanatics, so the Vatican shamelessly calls on Robert Langdon again despite that business with The Da Vinci Code where it covered up the truth about Jesus's ancestors after he unearthed it. Undermining his authority wasn't enough, now the Vatican wants him to save its unholy ass, enlisting his aid to decipher the location of the anti-matter bomb, for which the Illuminati have left clues that only a cunning atheist symbologist could follow and there's none of them around-- oh, dash it all! What are the odds?!! <br/><br/>Through his staggering knowledge of religious symbology, arcane scripture, medieval history and a fair share of gobbledegook that writer Dan Brown has made up off the top of his head, Langdon crisscrosses Rome following the trail of murdered archbishops, before locating the bomb and letting Obiwan Kenobi dispose of it.<br/><br/>And just like it did when Langdon uncovered the Da Vinci Code, the Church then issues another press release undermining Langdon's participation (and bribing him with a precious Galileo text to keep his mouth shut), lying that it was The Victim in an unwarranted attack by extremists - not one of the news reports mentioning The Illuminati, or the fact that the Illuminati's vendetta with the Catholic Church is blowback for the Church unrepentantly torturing and killing Illuminati in medieval times. Langdon outlines quite clearly how the Church resisted the Illuminati ""illuminating"" the Church's superstitions with rationality.<br/><br/>And then Christians have the temerity to question how ""God"" can allow bad things to happen. Keep in mind these people use a CRUCIFIXION as their symbol of peace and love.<br/><br/>Armin Mueller-Stahl is an archbishop with designs on popehood; Stellan Skarsgård is head of Vatican security, with such a big puss on his face he might as well have ""Red Herring"" tattooed on his forehead; Pierfrancesco Favino is a cool Euro detective who just screams Nice Guy; composer Hans Zimmer evokes the right level of religious scariness with his dark, cloudy, ominous score; provides the right level and Ayelet Zurer is the hot chick scientist responsible for creating the anti-matter (or should that be ""un-creating"" it?), a plot point which brings in ""science"" only as a whipping boy.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is the Pope's consiglieri, a post called the ""camerlengo"" (which comes down to us from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, meaning ""murderous religious zealot"" or ""Jedi""). He gives an impassioned speech demeaning ""their new god, Science,"" like it is an alternative religion trying to replace Christianity's myth-based religion with its own myths.<br/><br/>MacGregor's priest is meant to be a misguided ignorant character - trouble is, in their own ignorance, Christians in the audience AGREE WITH HIM.<br/><br/>Science is not a religion, science is not a deity, SCIENCE is a METHODOLOGY based on EVIDENCE; it is an EVER-MORPHING PROCESS, constantly replacing outmoded theories or facts with newer ones based on EXPERIMENT and RESEARCH.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Dan Brown and the people who made this film and the people who watch this film are discerning exactly WHO the villain is here...<br/><br/>Langdon clearly explains: ""The Church forced the scientists out because they were trying to bring intelligence to the Church... 1668, the Church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross, to purge them of their sins, and executed them; threw their bodies out onto the street as a warning to stop questioning the Church on scientific matters. They radicalized them; the purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati bent on retribution."" Not only does the Church definitively prove it is against the methodology of science - which Christians erroneously embrace - it terrorizes those who bring that intelligent methodology to it. The Church is not just the villain in this movie, but the villain to civilization itself.<br/><br/>""Be careful - these are men of god."" --Assassin, to Langdon.<br/><br/>Langdon dodges the question of belief in God - because he's Tom Hanks, America's sweetheart. When Obiwan asks Langdon point blank, ""Do you believe in the Dark Side of The Force (i.e. God),"" Langdon suddenly gets unnecessarily eloquent, ""My mind tells me I will never understand God... and my heart tells me that I'm not meant to. Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive."" A simple no would do, Forrest.<br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that Robert Langdon is smart, but someone call 1-800-EMOTION and get this guy a charisma transplant. Or at least buy him a few vodkas. Hanks gets this close to toppling Nicolas Cage for the Mourning Face of the Year Award. <br/><br/>Usually I welcome powerful minds (as in V FOR VENDETTA), but Dan Brown's writing under Ron Howard's direction has a knack for annoying even the scrappiest Crossword fanatic. Things lead to other things that have so little to do with the former things that we just throw up our hands on the convoluted plot and simply hope the hot chick will get her knockers out. As much chance of that as an angel dancing on the head of a lightsaber."

","Having previously seen this at the cinema, I thought it might be interesting to give it a second viewing on the small screen.<br/><br/>I had read the Dan Brown novel before seeing the film. There are a lot of differences between the two, but the main plot line of the book remains. The main difference being that the part of the Camerlengo, played by Ewan McGregor, is portrayed as an Irish man as opposed to an Italian in the book. I will try to not dwell too much on the differences between the novel and the film, so as to review the film as a stand-alone work. I must say though that Ron Howard is one of my favourite directors, having directed some of my all-time favourite films, including Cocoon (1985), A Beautiful Mind (2001) and the absolutely brilliant Apollo 13 (1995).<br/><br/>The Pope has died and his successor is to be chosen from the conclave of assembled Cardinals. Four of their number, the preferred, have been kidnapped and the other Cardinals are unaware that a bomb, comprised of antimatter, has been hidden in the Vatican. Symbologist Robert Langdon is called in and he must decipher clues left the ancient group known as the Illuminati before the bomb goes off and the four kidnapped Cardinals are murdered. He has the help of beautiful physicist Vittoria Vetra, whose father was killed when the antimatter for the bomb was stolen and the head of the Swiss Guard, who protect the Vatican City, Commander Richter. There are many plot twists in this tale of treachery and revenge, as more clues are revealed and the Illuminati take retribution for centuries of persecution.<br/><br/>This is an exciting thriller with some great action and a fast-moving plot. I thought the cinematography and the costumes were very well done. The setting is Rome and the Vatican City, although I have read that the Catholic Church banned filming in any church. Given that, the locations were excellent. The performances by all of the main characters were also excellent, Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra and Stellan Skarsgård as Commander Richter. Honourable mentions go to Pierfrancesco Favino as Inspector Olivetti and Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the Assassin. Over all, an enjoyable, fast-moving thriller which had a quite complicated plot, so you have to concentrate. I did find it a little long though at 138 minutes but still recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7/10"
"Turfseer","6","0","0","14 June 2010"," Twist ending redeems otherwise implausible, hokey plot
","I've never been a big fan of the material Ron Howard chooses for his movies. The 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' are no exception. But by the same token I will concede that Mr. Howard has come along way as a director. Most of his films are technically brilliant and he has evolved in his abilities to direct his actors.<br/><br/>After consulting Wikipedia's article on this film, I learned that there is actually an organization, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and there is a contraption, the 'Large Hadron Collider'. I also found out that the organization spent a good deal of time reassuring the local population that what they were doing was safe. Therefore, the whole idea that they could create anti-matter in three small cylinders, which could be capable of creating a low-grade nuclear-like explosion and then some psycho could somehow get through security at the facility and steal this anti-matter, was laughable.<br/><br/>If you're a Vatican History buff, you'll find 'Angels and Demons' just up your alley. The story begins with the death of the pope and a papal enclave is convened to choose the pope's successor. You'll find out who the 'preferiti' are—the four most likely candidates to be elected pope; they're kidnapped and immediately the Vatican police assume that the the Vatican's nemesis, the Illuminati, a secret society persecuted by the Catholic Church dating back to the time of Galileo, is behind the nefarious deed. In a nutshell, The Illuminati were the 'free-thinkers' who were suppressed by the Church during the Enlightenment, due to their advocacy of science. Later they supposedly turned violent and held a grudge against the Church for years.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist who is summoned by the Vatican police to save the four cardinals. Also called in is Vittoria Vetra, the scientist at CERN who's in charge of replacing the cylinder's batteries since once they run out, the explosion will occur (where was the Energizer bunny when you needed him most?) Langdon demands access to the Vatican Secret Archives where he discovers clues in a banned book by Galileo. The clues lead to four points of the compass in Vatican City, representing the four elements—fire, earth, air and water. Langdon deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered at four altars at these four different locations.<br/><br/>Langdon races around Vatican City along with the Vatican Police trying to save the four cardinals. The first three cardinals are dispatched in the manner associated with each particular element: Earth: Cardinal #1--suffocated by dirt; Air: Cardinal #2--lungs are punctured; and Fire: Cardinal #3—burned to death. Langdon manages to save Cardinal #4 who is dropped into a WATER fountain in a weighted gurney. The fourth Cardinal clues Langdon into the Assassin's lair—where the four cardinals had been held earlier. The police find the killer's van at a Mausoleum but conclude it's a dead end. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway and end up confronting the assassin who holds a gun on them. He reveals he's been hired by the Catholic church but has no orders to kill them so he lets them go (not at all credible). Langdon finds the last clue in the form of crossed keys, the Papal symbol. He concludes that the final victim will be Camerlengo McKenna (a priest who is chief administrator at the Vatican). The crafty assassin who outwits everybody, is unconvincingly outwitted himself by stepping inside a car and getting blown up by a car bomb (who worked that out, I have no idea!).<br/><br/>Now here's how all this nonsense is saved by the twist ending (SPOILER ALERT!). We're led to believe that the Camerlengo is the good guy. He tries to convince Cardinal Strauss, the head honcho at the conclave to evacuate the Vatican, since the anti-matter is about to explode. The Cardinal, and the other stuffed shirts want to follow their protocol in choosing the pope, so they decide to rely on the Vatican police (along with Langdon) to save the day by finding the anti-matter. Also when Langdon finds the Camerlengo with the chief of the Vatican police, it appears the Illuminati have already branded him (just as they did with the four other cardinals) and the Camerlengo blurts out that the Police chief is in league with the Illuminati (so he gets killed). Finally, when the anti-matter cylinder batteries are about to run out, the Camerlengo (who believe it or not, has training as a helicopter pilot) takes the cylinder up into the clouds in a helicopter, where the anti-matter explodes but kills no one. The Camerlengo parachutes to safety and is hailed as a hero—in fact, the conclave (using an arcane rule) wants to vote him in as the new Pope.<br/><br/>The twist is when Langdon, using a key the Vatican Police Chief gave him just before he dies, unlocks surveillance video stored on the hard drive of the Chief's private computer, revealing that it was the Camerlengo who was the bad guy all along. Not only did he kill the three cardinals but also his adoptive father, the Pope himself. It seems that the Camerlengo was mad at the Pope due to his liberal stance toward science. After Langdon reveals the plot to the Papal enclave, the Camerlengo commits suicide by setting himself on fire.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did well in concluding that the Da Vinci sequel needed to move at a faster pace. And kudos to the production team who recreated Vatican City without having any access to shooting there. Despite the positives, I did sit through most of 'Angels and Demons' with a smirk on my face. After all, the entire premise is based on completely implausible events. But I have to admit, the twist ending at the end is so clever, that I didn't see it coming at all! And yes, I'm willing to say, despite all the hokeyness, to a certain extent, it won me over."

","While I enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it was a bit slow-going for the most part, though the actors did a good job of keeping the film interesting for the most part. But for the sequel, ""Angels & Demons,"" the filmmakers have created an exciting sequel with a story that is more fascinating than the one of its predecessor, in my opinion. Tom Hanks is once again in top form as Robert Langdon, and the supporting cast, including Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgård and Armin Mueller-Stahl, is excellent. The storyline may seem a bit convoluted at times, but the fast pace, fine storytelling and terrific performances make up for a lot. Overall, this is a superior sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code"" that fans of the novel, and regular movie-goers, will surely enjoy! Grade: A-"
"balletdancer21","Null","0","0","7 June 2010"," Great R-rated movie--to bad it's PG-13
","This movie starts out with a graphic, bloody murdered body involving eyeballs missing from the body (the eyeball is shown)--and it gets much, much worse. I'm not going to put the details of all the disturbing murders that are shown as the movie goes on; if you would like to find more detail, I recommend the parents guide. Unfortunately, accurately portraying the movie does involve a general overview of all the gruesome ways people are brutally murdered.<br/><br/>The whole basis of the movie is set around an ancient secret society, like Dan Brown's stories all are. Like the Da Vinci Code, this movie is wonderfully well-researched and very intelligent. In terms of the plot line, I loved it.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, the Pope has just died. The church is about to meet to elect a new one when four of their most elite members go missing. Shortly after, they receive a very threatening message from the previously mentioned secret society--every hour, for four hours, one of the four missing Cardinals will be publicly sacrificed. That's insanely intense and mature right there--but it gets even worse.<br/><br/>Come to find out, there is a bomb inside the Vatican that will go off an hour after the last Cardinal is sacrificed. Of course, since a new pope is being elected, the Vatican is packed will people waiting to see their new religious leader. If the bomb goes off, hundreds, or perhaps thousands of people will die.<br/><br/>Enter Robert Lagdon. The whole movie is about him trying to find the places where the Cardinals are going to be sacrificed before it happens, and ultimately trying to find the bomb and stop it before it goes off.<br/><br/>This movie is a real nail-biter. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br/><br/>One might say that the plot line alone would be enough to get it an R rating. If you add many graphic murders to the mix, I think anyone would agree that PG-13 is not strong enough.<br/><br/>The Cardinals are killed in several gruesome ways. One is suffocated by putting dirt in his mouth. When the newly-dead body is found, there are rats eating away at the mans face. The second one is killed by puncturing his lungs. We see his heavily bleeding, half-dead body in the Vatican Square; the body is discovered by a little girl, probably around nine years old. He dies a few seconds later. The third one is burned on a cross. Before he falls into the flames, we see him hanging them, screaming. I didn't even fully watch that scene, and it still disturbed me. The fourth one lives, but barely. He is strapped to a heavy medal object, and dropped into a fountain. <br/><br/>All four of these men have been branded with the symbol of the secret society. Though we do not see it actually happening to them, it is very apparent what is about to happen. We do see a fifth person branding himself, with much screaming.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, there are many other graphic murders throughout the movie. These include stabbings, shootings, another burning. We also find out that the dead pope was poisoned. To make sure, they open his tomb to check if his mouth has turned black. The corpse is about two weeks dead, and the body is very graphic and disturbing.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie should never have even been considered for a PG-13 rating. It really bothers me that it was not R. My thirteen year old sister watched this, before we knew what was in it, and she was hiding her face for half the movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you are an adult who doesn't mind the gore, this is a great movie. Just please, please think very hard before letting your children watch it."

","After the pope's death, a nefarious organization stashes an antimatter bomb somewhere in the Vatican, threatening to annihilate the conclave of cardinals who are meeting to elect the papal successor. To pass the time until the bomb will detonate, the enemy begins to torture and kill a few of the individual cardinals, but there is a pattern to the grotesque executions, involving hidden sculptural symbols and secret architectural clues. Unfortunately for the church, the man most capable of deciphering the code is the American ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon, who happens to be an affirmed atheist.<br/><br/>A+D is how every sequel should be: The filmmakers found the flaws in the first film and fixed them, making the sequel better. Almost everything is improved in this sequel: The slow pacing in the first film is tightened so much that the filmmakers had the actors talk while walking/running to different locations. Hans Zimmer's underscore in the previous film is now much more blatant and epic, which can keep anyone with ears awake. Even Tom Hanks' hair is less annoying. However, the storyline is still as outrageous and ludicrous as the first, but that's a given if you've read the books written by Dan Brown.<br/><br/>Now judging the film on its own aspects, A+D is a well made time-ticking thriller. After an unnecessarily long forty-minute set up, the ball starts rolling and you're sitting in a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up until the climax. I found the film very exciting and suspenseful and it was nice to see some great monuments and statues around Europe. Having only seen the extended cut of the film, I was surprised by how violent the film is, but I say that as a compliment. I think the film benefits with more blood and violent images that give the film a much more mature viewing than other PG-13 action flicks.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks returns as the main role and he's just as good as the first film, although he looks a bit older. His new partner, Ayelet Zurer, is good enough for the role she's playing, although she seems to disappear for a while in the middle of the film. Ewan McGregor gives a good performance with his Irish accent, although it wasn't spectacular. I also liked Hans Zimmer's score, which gives the orchestra something more to do compared to the first film.<br/><br/>As a sequel, A+D is better than THE DA VINCI CODE in almost every category ever invented. As a thriller, it's a suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end. The scenery for the film is wonderful and the third act is amazing. If I had one complaint for the film, it was the oh-so-obvious twist ending which anyone could see a mile away if they paid attention. Still, what else could you ask for in a popcorn flick?"
"dromasca","6","0","0","21 May 2010"," at parity with 'The Code'
","I belong to a small and well-famed minority. I like Dan Brown's novels and I declare it openly. Yes, I came out of the closet as they say. I liked 'The Da Vinci Code' book (not so much the film) and I said it. I was immediately buried under tons of sarcasm, irony, pity. What can I do? Historical mysteries are one of my preferred genres since I read Jules Verne's books or Constantin Chirita's 'Ciresarii' (Romanian speakers may know what I am talking about).<br/><br/>'Angels & Demons' the book was written before 'The Code', but the movie comes after, so there is no need to explain too much about the expertise of professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) or why he is called to solve historical mysteries with religious symbols implications. It's good that it's so, because the last thing the script in this film has is credibility. Yes, I enjoy historical riddles, but they need some plausible justification to be inserted in the script, and this justification lacks here completely. Luckily I buy easily the conventions of such movies, so I sat back in my chair and enjoyed the action, which is a combination between James Bond and '24' with Rome and papal intrigues replacing Los Angeles (or New York in the last '24' season) and the US presidency, but with corpses popping up each round hour. Moreover, seeing again the beautiful setting of the streets of Rome one and a half month after my last days of vacation there was also cool.<br/><br/>This certainly does not make enough for a great film, or even for a great action film. My main problem with Ron Howard's 'Code' was the fact that he turned the great actors that are Hanks and Tautou unto just good but not very interesting actors. Here Hanks still looks at least as amazed to be in this movie as his character is to be in the middle of all this action, while his partner is now the Israeli actress Ayelet Zorer, which I respect very much for other roles, and I am happy that she got such an opportunity to play with Hanks in a blockbuster but I do not think that they let her use it too well. Maybe in the next film in the series Hanks will be more lucky with a partner to be of interest to him :-) Overall, not a bad action film, not the best either, at parity with 'The Code'."

","Robert Langdon is back in the sequel that is based on the first book. This time Langdon is brought on to a case in the Vatican, there has been a murder. Langdon must help solve a bunch of riddles and clues to make sure a terrorist plot does not ensue.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci code was met with unsatisfied reactions. Hank's hair was a big thing in the media and it overtook the film, since he was such a deadpan character in the first one. He fares a little better here, but it's still kind of ho-hum. The better book of the two is also the better film of the two. Angels and Demons has many problems and I almost forgot I even watched it today, which isn't a good sign. But it is tighter, has a better narrative and feels more suspenseful. <br/><br/>There are tons of stuff missing from the film, as expected. The plot revolves around the capture four cardinals, Langdon must find them all and save them before they are executed every hour. The Illuminati are behind it, who have hired an assassin to kill each one using one of the four elements, earth, water, fire, air. Each one has the word branded into their skin. The clues in this one seem to flow a little better than Da Vinci and gone are the stupid CGI lettering techniques. <br/><br/>The cast is weaker though, Ewan McGregor is a bore. Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Langdon and is weaker than Tautou. Stellan Skarsgård is really the only one who had my attention. He was more of an interesting character than the lead. <br/><br/>The plot is predictable, even for people who have not read the book and the actions that happen on the screen are laughable sometimes. Specifically the stuck in the book records scene and the parachute scene. Both had me giggling while I rolled eyes and the lunacy. <br/><br/>The production wasn't allowed to film in a lot of the Cathedrals, it is painfully obvious is a lot of the scenes. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie it was so bad (the prequels, obviously). The assassin is nowhere as interesting as Silas, he was never given the chance to be. Important relationships are left out of the script and overall the film is really, like I said, forgettable.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the film's rating reflects the good aspects of it. The Da Vinci Code got a 6 from me, so I can't give it that. 6.5 maybe, or a 7? It was certainly the better film of the two since they knew better the second time. Maybe these books just weren't made to be made for the screen? In any event, Angels and Demons is a mediocre film, with a decent rating from me."
"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","7","0","0","13 April 2010"," Angels and demons: Ridiculous
","Everything in this movie is ridiculous: the made up science, the plot, the deaths, the symbols, the script, the accusations, the drawing to conclusions, and the science vs religion debate. Yet it is oddly entertaining, it isn't as anti-Catholic as the bad Da Vinci Code, it does have enough twists and terns, you try to figure out what is going to happen next, you actually care about the characters, it can be oddly funny. It's far from perfect, the ending twist is so ridiculous on such a high scale. For a movie that is 2 hours and 10 minutes, it needs to make interest with the viewer. On the plus side, it is sort-of clever in a way, but not in a way that makes fun of people of science or religion. I think the next time a new pope is about to be decided, we will all be thinking if the angels and demons thing will occur. It won't, because this movie is flat out ridiculous"

","For those who wish to see a live fictional encounter between the bitterest of all rivalries, science vs. religion, then ""Angels and Demons"" is your meal ticket. To all you pro-Catholic fanatics, do not despair, it's not putting down the teachings of Jesus, so please don't condemn Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and all those that contributed in the makings of this movie.<br/><br/>This is assuming the prequel to ""The Da Vinci Code"", the opening scene kick off with the Pope's death. And since the Vatican is now in the process of indicting a new leader of the Catholic Church, the opening scenes look and feel sublime and accurate. <br/><br/>While this whole process in the works, an elite of top scientists are working on a project called the antimatter. Unless you're ignorant about science, or are just a geek who thinks this stuff is cool, well it really is anything that monumental, until you actually see what effect it has. <br/><br/>This is another example of how Hollywood likes to further elaborate on history and science and goes so far as to draw up their own conclusions.Tom Hanks makes his return again as Dr. Robert Langdon ready to hammer in another series of coding and decoding. The Cardinal College gathers around to carefully select who will be their new leader. Just like when they selected Pope Benedict XVI, the smoke from the chimney at St. Peter's Square we know how the selection is determined. If the smoke is gray, then another vote is issued, but if it's white, then the Cardinals have selected their new Pope. <br/><br/>But now the scientific community in in utter turmoil. The antimatter has been stolen. And in the religious, four papal candidates have been kidnapped. However, a video featured warns the Vatican that in an hour leading towards midnight, these religious leaders will be murdered and the stolen antimatter will be powerful enough to blow up Rome. The Vatican depends on Langdon because they believe that a 4 century year old adversary called the Illuminati are the ones behind this evil deed. I'm not sure how this whole rivalry started, but since this is an epic battle between science and religion, the outcome is really poignant regardless whether it is accurate or ignorant. So with time drawing near, Langdon is on a desperate quest to save Rome, find the kidnappers hideout and to confiscate the antimatter from them. <br/><br/>Ron Howard has a certain knack for creating pop films. He tries everything to entertain you and to develop likable characters to keep the flow of his films moving. Here the suspension is a mandatory procedure to keep the film going and Howard makes sure of that. <br/><br/>Sure it's violent, but the energy is handled very nuanced and edited to near perfection. Ayelet Zurer is amazing as the physicist who aligns with Langdon on his long journey to find the stolen antimatter. I liked the fact they kept it real and that Langdon did not have any romantic entanglements with the female scientist. Ewan McGregor was also convincing as the Camerlengo who is responsible for the selecting of the new Pope. <br/><br/>Overall a lot in this movie is handled professionally, from the acting, the direction and the scenes. And Tom Hanks has outdone himself as he always had. <br/><br/>Even though so far I have praised this movie, I still have some setbacks that make this film far from being a masterpiece. The score here was absolutely abominable. It was too damn loud and lacked anything from being lively. Also some of the character development was virtually non-existent. The ending was just simply awful. But the facts were quite fun, like watching a live documentary at times. So aside from these flaws it, is still fun to watch."

","The Da Vinci Code wasn't a bad film, although the pace was slow I found it absorbing. This sequel ditches this approach of the earlier movie and hurries into the action. Indeed, quite a bit of screen time is spent watching the characters run around Vatican City like they are in an episode of Doctor Who! Tom Hanks again plays Robert Langdon, and instead of the walking coma victim performance he gave in Da Vinci puts some effort into it this time around. Called in by the Vatican to help track four kidnapped Cardinals on the eve of electing a new Pope (if you want realism I suggest seeing another movie!) Langdon soon discovers the stakes are raised. The ancient order of The Illuminati have apparently returned to seek revenge upon the Vatican for centuries of persecution of the scientific community . Having stolen an anti-matter container with a limited battery life from CERN. Langdon must solve the mystery of the path of The Illuminati to prevent half of Rome from being destroyed.<br/><br/>If you examine the plot, of course, the whole thing is preposterous, yet this is an entertaining film; I re watched the movie on blue-ray recently in an extended format, and really only noticed an added extra level of violence which might make the film too gruesome for some. The deaths of the cardinals become very brutal in this version.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays the late Pope's chamberlain overseeing the new election and his Irish accent seems to vary between Frank Carson (popular Irish comedian of the 70s) and Obi Wan Kenobi. He's pretty decent, though; the rest of the cast of characters came from central casting cliché inc.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is decent journeyman director, and here he delivers some good set pieces - the second Vatican archives scene is well realised, though owes a little to Spielberg's The Lost World.<br/><br/>There may be those who find the reconciliation between The Church and Science a bit galling - if Dan Brown had serious intent in discussing these issues he might be better served by delivering a more realistic plot; but go into this expecting an adventure/mystery not to be taken too seriously and you'll have a good time. Well worth a look."

","Unfortunately for Ewan Mcgregor, he is the lone star of this film. He was able to portray the character nearly exactly like I envisioned him in the book. He also got in character, unlike Tom Hanks who felt awkward trying to portray an academic. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is a great actor, but I like his off-beat comedy the best (The Burbs, Joe Vs. the Volcano, etc). He did some war films OK. But this role would have been better to be played by somebody with a little more bookish gravitas. All other aspects of the film were sub-par, including the story by Dan Brown, the screenplay, the acting, and the choice of changes from the text. That said, Ewan Mcgregor made the film quite watchable, and had a memorable verging on extraordinary performance.<br/><br/>I was not put off by the special effects, which were fine; nor was I put off by the montage of Rome, which I thought rather beautiful, but this particular film necessitates story above all else, and the story is simply not a plausible one.

","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) finds himself yet again solving a mystery surrounding the Vatican and its hidden secrets. This time around it's all about the secret and evil anti-Vatican organization, the Illuminati, who was shun hundreds of years ago by the Church for saying science explains the world's mysteries and not God. Flash forward to present day and the Illuminati want their revenge on the Church and the Church needs Robert Langdon to help solve their problems. This movie is just like the first one but it is not as edgy and there is absolutely no character development that lets you connect with who they are and why they do this. I really didn't even realize Tom Hanks was even in the movie and couldn't care one way or the other what happens to him because the movie didn't give me a chance to connect with his character. This movie is about 45 minutes too long and all it shows is Tom Hanks running around Italy trying to solve clues. But what this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in is its effectiveness to keep you interested. This fact is due to the excellent directing by Ron Howard who is one of the best directors we have today. It's somewhat fast paced for the type of movie it is but you would like to think that there was somewhat more to the story then what they give you. The so-called twist at the end should have been more shocking and not so subtle and predictable. Ewan McGregor does a great job playing Father Patrick McKenna and is very believable as a priest. He is the only one that shines among the rest of the cast who seem to be there just to collect a paycheck.

","Well at least they didn't make a complete mess of it like last time. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman previously combined for the film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. The film was a total dud. A thrilling, exciting novel was transformed into a dull, plodding movie. Howard and Goldsman, with a second screenwriter in David Koepp along for the ride this time, try again with their adaptation of Brown's Angels & Demons. This time the film is not a total dud but it's certainly not all you would hope for it to be either. Once again it is clear that the book is better than the movie. A lot better.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, with a much better haircut this time, returns to the role of Robert Langdon and Hanks certainly seems more comfortable here than he did in his first Langdon adventure. Hanks as Langdon works fine, it's everything around the film's star which is hit or miss. Where the last film got bogged down with a lot of talk and historical information this film has a much better pace to it. Less talk, more action. So that's good. But in all the breakneck action, with Langdon scurrying to and fro across Rome, a lot of the original story from the novel has been lost. That's not so good. If everything from the novel had been included here we'd probably be looking at a movie that's five hours long. But some of the cuts which were made have cut a lot of the heart out of the story. There's really not much in the way of story left. It's just a frantic race against time and while there is certainly some excitement to be had you never find yourself nearly as invested in the story or the characters as you did when reading the novel. There were personal connections in the novel which added layers of emotion to the story. Here that emotion has been stripped away and what we're left with is just another action thriller. And the novel was so much more than that.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code film had very little to recommend it, that's not the case here. Angels & Demons is passable entertainment. Hanks is much better this time around and he's supported well by some fine actors. Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and Stellan Skarsgård as the head of the Swiss Guard stand out as being particularly memorable even as their characters have undergone some radical transformations from what Dan Brown put down on the page. Ayelet Zurer is fine with what she is given to do in the role of Vittoria Vetra. You just wish they would have given her more. In the novel Vittoria was a critically important character with a hugely significant role in the plot. Here it seems she's just along for the ride and that's a shame. The look of the film is undeniably impressive, as Rome beautifully comes alive. Even the parts of Rome which were brought to life on a California back lot. It's an exciting film, we're given very little time to catch our breath as we race to what promises to be an explosive conclusion. There again you'll probably feel the book's ending works a lot better than the movie's does. But by that point you're resigned to the fact that Ron Howard's movie just wasn't going to measure up to Dan Brown's book. Someone who never read the novel could really enjoy this film for what it is. Those who read the novel can't help but be a touch disappointed, knowing what this film could have been. But this film is certainly better than The Da Vinci Code was. So that's something I guess. Better luck with The Lost Symbol, Ron."

","To start off with... I haven't read The Da Vinci Code nor Angels And Demons. This review is only made from watching the films. I'm what you might call: Not a reader. I prefer the visuals instead.<br/><br/>I remember when I first watched TDVC it was kind of long and boresome. After I got it on DVD and watched it a couple more times, it hooked me. Especially the scene with Hanks and McKellen discussing, over a cup of tea, how the gospels came to life. I very much like their argumentations for and against their validity into the Bible.<br/><br/>Sadly we don't see any kind of this in AAD. The movie is driven by the action quite a bit, and do not dwell at any time in longer discussions or something close to that.<br/><br/>TDVC have been watched a great many times, where as AAD will more be like a part of the DVD-collection. To be dusted off and watched occasionally Don't get me wrong though. The scale of the movie is grand. But it feels more like a tourist-attraction to come see the Vatican and Italy's churches rather than to tell a good story.<br/><br/>McGregor is almost always awesome in whatever role he plays. But he alone can't carry the weight of this much anticipated movie on his shoulders.<br/><br/>I do have to comment that 2 distinguished gentlemen from Denmark played a role in this movie too. Kaas as the assassin and Lindhardt as the Vatican police officer/keeper of the Vatican library (Note his awkward interpretation of the English language even though he's portrayed as a German, or something like that). Sorry... But he don't quite pull this off, though a great danish actor. Kaas on the other hand I liked very much in his role. If You haven't figured it out yet... Yeah I'm a dane too. lol <br/><br/>I like action very much. But to me, it's kind of misplaced here to a certain degree. When You know the story of TDVC and how it plays out, then AAD disappoints me because we don't dwell too much on any given thing in this movie.<br/><br/>A good work-out action-piece is my vote on this one.

We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think.

Angels & Demons presents a large problem and only a small amount of time to save the Cardinals, the Vatican and the Catholic religion as we know it.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon, Tom Hanks, comes to Rome to help solve the mystery of the Illuminati, a secret society that is against faith and religion The Pope has died and the four cardinals that are his likely replacement have been kidnapped. It is Langdon's job to decipher the clues and find our where the preferiti are before they are killed one by one. While he tries to connect the clues he is paired up with a lovely physicist Vittoria Vetra, Ayelete Zurer, who helps Langdon piece together this puzzle and will hopefully retrieve the antimatter and return it safely back to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons shows that devotion and loyalty drive many of us and sometimes we too easily justify our actions as a testimonial to our faith. Camerlengo, Patrick McKenna's devotion to the church allows him to justify his actions as doing God's work. Langdon's devotion to his work allows him to put aside his differences with the Vatican to try to stop the Illuminati and save the preferiti. Vetra is loyal to her fathers work and wants to secure the antimatter and continue her fathers quest. <br/><br/>A similar devotion theme can be seen in the Nation Treasure movies where Ben Gates, Nicholas Cage is devoted to clearing the Gates name and proves that the treasure his family spoke about for years really exists. Gates has to follow clues and piece together history to locate the treasure which is quite similar to Langdon's role in Angels & Demons.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard uses several techniques to keep the audience interested and to develop the universal theme of devotion. By creating conflict between the Illuminati he introduced the devotion theme at the very beginning. The Vatican is so devoted to saving it's religion from the scrutiny of others that is puts aside its differences and solicits the help of Langdon. In one of the open scenes Langdon is swimming and a Vatican official asks for help. Langdon is hesitant but his underlying devotion to his work influences him to go to Rome and decipher the symbols that will help him trace the ""Path of Illumination."" <br/><br/>Angels & Demons combines mystery with history. Your loyalty and devotion will be called into question but your faith will remain intact."

","I have always enjoyed conspiracy theories. I never have really believed any of them, but have always been interested in the possibility of them. This was an exciting movie that had me guessing until the very end. I think that they did the twist part to the ending perfectly. They shocked you with the truth and then didn't pursue it much past that. I like an ending like this. This movie also did a great job of intertwining new technology with old traditions and mythologies. I also thought it ironic that technology was what ultimately ended up exposing the bad guys plans, and it was technology that he was fighting in the first place. Overall a good movie with a good ending that kept me interested until the very end. I would recommend this movie, even if you have't seen the first movie."

","""Angels & Demons"" precedes ""The Da Vinci Code"" in literature, but in film it's reversed. I admit I haven't read either book, and I liked ""The Da Vinci Code"" better. It was a more fascinating premise.<br/><br/>""Angeles & Demons"" is a magnificently produced, elaborate film starring Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Stellan Skarsgård.<br/><br/>The emphasis here is on action and a fairly fast pace, with Hanks and Zurer racing all over Vatican City while angelic music plays. The plot concerns Robert Langdom (Hanks) being summoned by Rome after the Pope's death, and as the conclave of cardinals gather to elect a new one. It appears that the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood, wronged by the church, is now seeking revenge. The group has kidnapped four cardinals, - in fact, those thought to have the best chance of becoming Pope, intending to kill one an hour. They have also stolen an antimatter bomb from a science lab. Langdon is needed to interpret some ancient symbols and find the Illumination Path. In order to get the information he needs, Langdon has to arrange everything through the carmelango, Patrick McKenna (McGregor) who acts in absence of a pope. Along the way, Langdon realizes that there is probably an inside man at the Vatican helping the Illuminati.<br/><br/>Hanks is in the film for his name value. He's very good, but to my mind, this isn't a particularly challenging role. It needs someone authoritative and mature who comes off as intelligent. Hanks fills all of those qualifications, as would David Strathairn or any number of other actors. Ayelet Zurer doesn't have much to do as the scientist trying to recover the antimatter bomb. Both Ewan McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl make great impressions in their roles. It's an excellent cast all around.<br/><br/>Though filmed only partly on location, the whole thing comes off as a magnificent travelogue, and the soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing though not nearly as provocative as ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and if you can see it on a big flat TV screen, you'll like it even more. Today, we're used to seeing smaller, independent films, or films with big special effects. This movie has special effects, all right, but the huge budget also allows for the top drawer all the way, including gorgeous locations, an enormous cast, beautiful color, a top director, exotic lighting, stunning photography, and great music. The opportunities of seeing all of that in one film are becoming rarer and rarer."

","Adapted from Dan Brown's novel of the same name, this one has Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) racing around Vatican City and Rome to stop a series of murders and find a bomb that could destroy Vatican City. The pope has just died, and Langdon gets called in when things don't seem exactly right. A nutcase has stolen enough antimatter from a lab to raze Vatican City and plans to kill one cardinal each hour until the explosion. Langdon and the cops chase here and there, trying to get ahead of the killer. While the killer claims to be a member of the Illuminati, Langdon knows this is a cover for someone else. Perhaps someone inside. Meanwhile, the cardinals have gathered to name a new pope. Fast-paced, although Hanks is a little long in the tooth to be playing Langdon, especially as the events here are supposed to precede the events portrayed in THE DA VINCI CODE. Not as good as the first Nic Cage NATIONAL TREASURER flick or even those Noah Hathaway LIBRARIAN flicks, but it makes a decent time killer."

","ANGELS & DEMONS would work well as a silent movie - well, a silent movie with the musical score of Hans Zimmer in the background. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino offers us views of Rome and Vatican City, both from the exterior and from the historically significant interiors, that are as stunning as any on film. The actors look well and seem as involved as the creaky script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have pasted together from Dan Brown's first (in a probably endless line) novel allows about the derring-do of symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role from The Da Vinci Code). But while the story is interesting - illuminating the Illuminati's centuries old plight to force the Catholic church to accept scientific reasoning instead of condemning it - and while Ron Howard as director does his best to give us a fast-paced thriller, the dialogue dumbs down the audience by the simplistic, hurriedly discovered answers to the meaning of symbols that drive this story. Dan Brown's novel gave the reader some breathing time to digest the ancient codes and incorporate them into the action: Ron Howard's film condenses the important findings in favor of emphasizing special effects and splendid footage of the inner chambers of St Peter's and the various churches that become destination points for the murders of the 'preferiti' cardinals gathered to elect a new pope after the surprise demise of the current pope. <br/><br/>The cast includes some fine, interesting faces and actors - Ewan McGregor as the recently dead Pope's camerlengo, Stellan Skarsgård as the suspicious Commander Richter, a very beautiful but bland Ayelet Zurer as the sole female scientist Vittoria Vetra who understands the importance of rescuing the 'antimatter' that threatens the end of the church and a good part of the territory around Rome, Armin Mueller- Stahl as the crusty old Cardinal Strauss, Pierfrancesco Favino as the Inspector Olivetti, and the always fascinating character actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the assassin - but Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon rattles off his obsession with ecclesiastic symbology with such speed and nonchalance that the mysteries become almost insignificant to the audience who simply go along with the patter. It is a mad chase of a film, fortunately treating the audience to some wondrous scenery and lighting effects. As a film it is entertaining, but then that was the purpose of the book, too. It just feels like it not as fully realized a mystery as would be possible in different hands. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","I did not know what to expect when I first saw this movie. I liked the Da Vinci Code which was close to the book. I read the book, Angels and Demons many times that I know the book word by word.

","I read the book before watching the movie. The movie pales in comparison to the book. <br/><br/>The story was completely changed. Some characters were eliminated or renamed. <br/><br/>For instance, the book was all about the ""conflict"" between science and religion represented as a conflict between CERN and the Catholic Church. The movie contains none of this.<br/><br/>Maximillian Kohler, the director of CERN, is replaced by Commandante Richter as the person who confronts the Camerlengo. <br/><br/>In the book all four Cardinals die, in the movie, the last one survives.<br/><br/>In the book the assassin is a blood hungry dark-skinned Arabic person, who fights with Robert Langdon on three occasions; all those scenes were removed and the killer was replaced with a Caucasian man that seemed to exhibit some type of assassin's honor. In the book, Robert Langdon and Victoria kill the assassin; in the movie he is killed by a car explosion.<br/><br/>The heart of the story, Leonardo Vetra, is non-existent in the movie and Victoria Vetra, a powerhouse in the book, has a meaningless role in the movie; not to mention the fact that the build up to the Camerlengo being the arch villain is presented poorly in the movie. <br/><br/>Many interesting philosophical discussions were left out of the movie. <br/><br/>The comic effect of the cocky BBC reporter Gunther Glick was completely removed and more importantly the provocative idea of the dead Pope having fathered a child through artificial insemination was omitted; that idea was shocking and made the book very worthy in my view. <br/><br/>All in all, the book is much more riveting that the movie.

","Prof Langdon (Hanks) has 4-hrs to locate the kidnapped Cardinals and find the bomb that will destroy the Vatican. <br/><br/>I stopped reading Robert Ludlum novels (The Bourne this and that) as my page-turning hand couldn't keep up with the breakneck pace of the clues given. As I watched this movie I was reminded of the Ludlum novels and saw the parallels. Once the first clues were given we were off to the races. The music also played a big part and helped us run around Rome like a Wild Mouse (a ride at Coney Island) on the loose. The clues and the music made the 2+hours seem like minutes. It was over so quick. What a ride.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a movie that tries to show the differences between Science and Religion. The Science part presents itself in the guise of a secret society called the Illuminati, who have been around for hundreds of years. The Religion part is represented by the Catholic Church. <br/><br/>I call this somewhat gimmicky only because of the racing around to get to the next clue to discovering where the kidnapped Cardinals are and ultimately to where the bomb is too, but this is an excellent production. We get to see a lot of Rome ( I would also suggest you pause the DVD for those moments so you can get a good look). The acting is first rate by all. Also, the dialogue makes us feel privy to the inner workings of the Vatican. And, there is humor injected as well. <br/><br/>Now, the getting around Rome traffic (to get to he next clue) in a matter of mere minutes is sheer Movie Magic. Can't be done. Been there, done that. <br/><br/>I didn't know there was a person called the Camerlengo (McGregor) who has the power of the Papacy when a Pope dies and until a new Pope is elected. <br/><br/>Of course, near the end of the movie all is revealed and there is a twist I didn't see coming.

","I'm not the biggest fan of the film adaptation of Da Vinci Code, yet I'm surprised to see Angels & Demons actually receives somewhat higher marks. I felt that the film was trying to achieve too much. Granted, many of the images are grandiose, spectacular, bombastic, and Tom Hanks sure looks good in black. Yet it was all somehow so lifeless, just like the Swiss Guard. I did enjoy Armin Mueller-Stahl's steel blue twinkle, but it was almost identical to his twinkle in Eastern Promises. In the end, it all felt too pompous and contrived. The master symbolist solving riddles that finger-point right across Rome, hints that no other than him can discern. In between some scenes of excessive brutality, twitching bodies burning to death. And in the end, an unlikely master plotter - of course."

","It was only after seeing the film that I realized exactly how much had been changed or left out of the film and the odd thing is, I didn't miss it at all. While the book is richer and has much more character detail, that's the way books are. As a film, a fast-paced entertaining colorful story, this does very well. Let's face it, some of what Dan Brown writes is really implausible. I mean, did anyone really believe that Langdon could jump out of a helicopter with only a small sheet as a parachute and actually survive? And I was rather glad that the silly, rather precious sub plot of the Camerlengo being the biological son of the late pope, conceived without a sex act was gone. That was kind of embarrassing in its unbelievability. Tom Hanks is rapidly growing into the role Gregory Peck once occupied--when we see him, we trust him because he's Tom Hanks. The cast was interesting in its international flavor and the CGI used to round out the places they weren't allowed to really shoot in was excellent. You have to take Dan Brown novels for what they are--wild rides to nowhere, but you love getting to the destination. Just don't think about it too much. As a film, this was pretty decent since the book they were adapting was a difficult plot line that contained many, many deviations from the main. I say, just sit back and enjoy. Don't forget the popcorn. This film was made for it."

Tom Hanks also lost weight for the part in this movie. In the first movie, he was with a younger actress and in this one he is with someone more close to his age which makes it better, actress Ayelet Zurer. From the first movie actually Hanks looks a whole lot healthier if that's the word in this one. Hank's has a lot to offer when he plays each character. With more movies to come his intriguing talent in his movies has not hit rock bottom yet and was fun to see him in this movie Angels and Demons."

He joins forces with Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) the daughter of one of the victims, who's pretty smart herself and they race around trying to find clues while trying to stay alive themselves.<br/><br/>Dan Brown, like Stephen King, doesn't seem to translate well to film. Or at least, they don't under the direction of Ron Howard. Having failed to make much of an impression with the first and most well known of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series, The Da Vinci Code, he's seen fit to return as director for this second inslalment. And the result is something even more flimsy and unremarkable than that.<br/><br/>I didn't actually manage to finish Angels and Demons (the book) to anywhere near the end, but already the downsides of The Da Vinci Code, in the shape of trite dialogue and thin characterization, were in evidence. This time around though there didn't seem to be much of an inspired or intriguing story either, but I'd still be willing to bet it was more fun than this film. While it's still fairly intelligent and complex, it manages to get bogged down in the hoo hah of all the clever symbols and texts, getting the viewer to try and join the dots to everything that's going on while not providing much in the way of genuinely thrilling excitement.<br/><br/>As the star of the first film, Hanks was practically guaranteed to jump on board in the follow up, looking grateful for the nice pay cheque but just going through the motions and delivering nothing like his most dynamic of performances. Even a colourful supporting cast, including Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Stahl can't inject any more life into it.

","This thriller didn't exceed my expectations and it was definitely too long. The story itself was intriguing and mysterious but all seen in other movies before. Therefore I have to admit that I liked a lot the scenery in Rome and as an Italian I didn't know that the Roman church Panteone is the oldest one built in this eternal city at 27 before Christ's birth year. Even the secret passages in the Vatican area were interesting to see. I don't know if all the turning places were original. The music composed by Hans Zimmer was very authentic and wonderful as in The Gladiator. I found very curious hearing some sentences spoken by the Swiss Guard in their Swiss dialect in a Hollywood film because I am living in this little country Switzerland. Be prepared on a very unexpected end. I hope that there will be another sequel but with a shorter running time. Final vote: 6/10."
"pontram","5","0","0","4 November 2009"," My small little bashing....
","....comes late, and will probably not be read by someone. But suddenly I remembered this movie, which I was watching months ago, together with my 16 year old son. As we missed Star Trek 11, I was very surprised about the first few minutes of this movie, which are offering a high-budget science fiction action flick. This part was very well done, I didn't expect a movie that is taking itself very seriously and confronts us with a ready-to-use antimatter bomb. Which can be handled like an alarm clock. Not even the most courageous James Bond dared such a nonsense, but it was all made very well and fast and expensive, so I wasn't annoyed. But I cannot help to mention that we are as far from antimatter technology like weekend houses for everyone on Jupiter. Now, I know, this is fictional, and a simple H-Bomb would be too boring (and too big to carry in the handbag), I simply assimilated to the fairy tale.<br/><br/>Next, Tom Hanks showed up, and I wondered where this movie would go. Because there came such bored and numb vibes from him that suddenly I felt the inevitable need to sleep. Where the wonderful pictures of Rome and wonderful arranged interiors passed, my lids got heavier and heavier with ever scene with Tom Hanks. I assumed, he has a disease, where the face gets stiff, or he has had a little Botox therapy, that made every existing ability (even those small of Tom's) to act or expressing feelings impossible.<br/><br/>So I decided not to fight against a wonderful short sleep and let go for about ten refreshing minutes, until my son gave me a little punch.<br/><br/>After that little dozing, which is an approach I recommend to every viewer of this movie seriously, when I first saw that Blondie Ewan McGregor, I knew for sure he is the bad guy and he is in charge for everything bad. I liked this. It's nice for our children, and so the money spent is not wasted.<br/><br/>The first real fun for me was my beloved Armin-Müller-Stahl, who plays the bad guy (and should distract from the real bad and blonde guy) like he plays every guy and like every actor with such charisma plays his characters - as Armin-Müller-Stahl himself, with his Stahl-gray eyes and his Stahl-gentle Voice (in my country resynchronized by himself), which is his most powerful weapon.<br/><br/>That held me awake for the rest of the movie, waiting for Armins next appearance.<br/><br/>The ending was absolute unbelievable for me, and I wondered why not the others were jumping up from their seats and throw foul eggs onto the screen. Then I realized that nobody goes to the cinema with foul eggs. But at least....maybe one person except me could remember, that ""little boy"" destroyed Hiroshima from about 600m meters altitude; this height was found ideal to kill as many people as possible. In a distance of about 4 Kilometers from detonation point trees caught fire, and so on... And there is someone who wants to tell me that this antimatter bomb was so, so dangerous ? A fairy tale, all right. I'm a SF-Fan, and so I will not blame the makers for their efforts to make cash with nonsense; most cash in the world is made so.<br/><br/>At least, I told myself later, there were nice impressions of Rome. A little expensive for a postcard, but never mind. My son enjoyed it. Maybe next year we visit Vatican together...."

So, what is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna's original plan? Will he let the bomb blow, if Tom is killed in the archive, or not smart enough to break the riddle?There's too many randomness in these event and Camerlengo was not for a minute worried about his plan. God moves in mysterious way, if Camerlengo get to the pope's position in the end, I must say that all the people are working for him so this play can be played,including the dead ones.

","Diane and I finished an unusual day today by seeing the second of two movies on alternate days, something that does not happen often. Yesterday was Baader Meinhof and today Angels and Demons: two movies at opposite ends of the viewing spectrum; movies nonetheless that were both hugely satisfying for very different reasons.<br/><br/>Angels and Demons was, as Diane was at pains to tell me, a film not to be taken seriously: character development was at a minimum, like popular novels it was plot driven, action supersede history in many instances and the actors actions sometimes don't fit the plot. However, having said these negatives, I found the movie to be about as good an action film as one will find: very fast paced, beautifully filmed (taking optimum advantage of Rome's beauty) and complexity melding into story very satisfactorily.<br/><br/>I thought Howard's direction was excellent. As with The Code, he managed to handle big scenes, a big script, many characters and many locations extremely well. I thought his shot selection as well as the cinematographer's camera work meshed together to give the film a hugely satisfying breadth. I am a fan of Tom Hanks and I thought he carried his character's role very well. He seemed like a college professor to me and he made the transition from researcher to investigator believably through the entire film. Our only trouble with the action was the fact that driving as quickly as the story demanded through Roman traffic took a fair bit of digesting but, hey, this is a movie not a documentary.<br/><br/>It is a truism that Hollywood morphs itself into what they believe to be the zeitgeist of the particular political times at hand; Hollywood in the eight years of Bush conservatism produced many, many hugely ridiculous films and this, made during but released after, is one of only a few exceptions. The worse thing about attending commercial Cineplex's is sitting through the mind numbing previews; maybe that is why I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I don't think so though; it is an excellent film, one easily worth an afternoon or evening."

","Let me first start off that the book Angels and Demons may be my favorite novel of all time and I recommend it to all. I was also extremely excited to see this film. As to not include spoilers I will not reveal any plot elements but I will say that crucial elements of the book were altered or just completely left out for no apparent reason. There was no emotion at all, and there was no reason to feel for any of the characters, when before I cared and understood the motives of every single character. I feel that book was raped and pillaged to make a movie quickly and profitably. I realize that I went into the movie with a prejudice, and could not just watch the movie without the book being in the back of my mind, but I did try and every time I saw a scene where the film makers could redeem themselves they just continued to make the movie worse.

Ironically ""The Da Vinci Code"" was much more popular in its printed form than ""Angels and Demons"", but yet the later one turned out to be the better film.<br/><br/>From the CERN Laboratories in Switzerland a canister containing a new, dangerous substance called anti-matter is removed and the head scientist brutally murdered. After the death of the pope and on the day of the Conclave, where the cardinals come together to elect the new head of the Catholic church, the four favorites for the post are kidnapped. Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology, is called upon by the Vatican to assist them in their search of the four cardinals, because they have received a disturbing phone call, indicating that a secret and supposedly extinct group of scientists that refer to themselves as the Illuminati are responsible. Together with Vittoria Vettra from CERN and Captain Olivetti he tries to find the cardinals by following a path of illumination, that leads to four churches in Rome and eventually to the headquarters of the society. Meanwhile the Camarlengo, Cardinal Strauss and the commander of the Swiss Guard, Richter, are faced with the annihilation of the Vatican, as the vile with the antimatter has been hidden somewhere deep in the city and will go off at midnight. A race against time begins and more than ever loyalty and faith have to come together for a war that might end in the total defeat of the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>While the movie version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" followed the book very closely, Ron Howard made a number of changes to ""Angels and Demons"", most of them for the better. He rewrote some of the characters and could therefore even cross out some of them completely, the most vital one being Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Characteristics and certain dialog scenes were also shifted, something that might confuse those who read the book recently, but for those who did a long time ago, it will hardly be important. Indeed, there are some bigger differences, but pretty much all of them improve the plot, and take out some major flaws of the book. The pacing of the movie is also better than its prequel, with a lot more action and less talking, which makes the 140 minutes go by very quickly.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who once again plays the role of Robert Langdon, is more involved this time, doing a lot of running and always being in the center of things. That does him a lot of good, because he gets the chance to actually show some of his acting talents, and serve as more than just the person who has to tell the audience the historic trivia that the viewer needs to follow the plot. Kudos also to Ewan McGregor, who gives a very strong and emotional performance as the Camerlengo. He's very believable in his role and like Tom Hanks has a very strong presence on the screen. Ayelet Zurer on the other hand doesn't get very much to work with, and her best scene once again brings the typical church motive of women not being trustworthy to the top. Pierfrancesco Favino as Olivetti and Stellan Skarsgard as Richter both do a really good job, especially the later one as the grumpy leader of the Swiss Guard, who frequently complains about Langdon's old-fashioned and supposedly naive methods of finding the kidnapper of the cardinals. We also see Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss, a relatively minor role, that he still manages to play great. Interestingly enough ""Angels and Demons"" has less well-known cast than ""The Da Vinci Code"" but at most times features better performances.<br/><br/>Due to the controversial status of Dan Brown surrounding the Catholic Church, the Vatican denied the permission to film ""Angels and Demons"" in the original churches in Rome. Anyway, the production designers did a terrific job recreating the interiors, with all the artwork and nostalgic charm you can only find in a place like that. Hans Zimmer's music is bombastic and powerful, making several scenes more exciting than they are anyway.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be surprising if ""Angels and Demons"" became just as much of a hit as ""The Da Vinci Code"" which made $750 Million worldwide, despite negative reviews. The biggest flaws of the movie mostly come from the book already and if you enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" already there is no doubt you will also like ""Angels and Demons"" which improved on its prequel without a doubt. It won't end up being a classic, but is still quite powerful, entertaining and a feast for the eyes. (3.5/5) <br/><br/>A fast-paced, thrilling action flick, that does pretty much everything right ""The Da Vinci Code"" didn't and manages to entertain for its total running time, which after all is more than two hours."

","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert on symbols, is called to Rome post haste. Although they are keeping things quiet, the authorities tell Langdon horrible news. The Pope has died and the four strongest candidates to succeed him have been kidnapped by a terrorist (Nikolaj Lie Kass). The assassin has declared that beginning at 8:00pm that evening, one of the Cardinals will be killed every hour on the hour, at area churches. It appears that the killer is working for The Illuminati, a group of scientists with a long history of war with the Catholic church, reaching back 500 years. As if that was not enough, the killer has stolen an ""anti-matter"" device which will be exploded at midnight and which will annihilate anyone within 20 miles of Rome. Ugh. Langdon works feverishly to unravel the mystery, with the help of the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skaarsgard) and the late Pope's personal assistant, Patrick (Ewan McGregor). But, when 8 o'clock tolls, the Prof and his group reach the church a couple of minutes late to save the first Cardinal. How will they fare into the night? This is a very exciting and fascinating story with a relentless pace and a fine, fine cast. Hanks is truly great as the sardonic, nonreligious expert and McGregor succeeds in his meaty role of a troubled soul underneath an innocent demeanor. The supporting cast, although unknown to this viewer, are also very good, with special mention to Kass for his deeply scary role as the assassin. Naturally, the scenery in and around Rome is amazingly lovely and costumes, camera work and other film niceties are of the finest caliber. As for Howard's direction and the tantalizing story, they deserve much praise, for there is no time to catch one's breath before the next big event. On a humorous note, Howard has cast his father, Rance, in the role of a southern-drawl Cardinal and it is too, too funny. So, if you thought this was a flick to skip, do reconsider your decision. This one will fulfill any thinking man or woman's wish for a night of sound entertainment."

"anna-lundin","9","3","8","15 May 2009"," A pleasant surprise!
","When I went to see this movie I expected to be disappointed. I have red the book umpteen times and love it and since movies very rarely live up to books they are based on - well, I didn't dare to hope this one was any different. To my great surprise I wasn't disappointed at all, in fact I was even impressed. OK, sure changes have been made, as always, but in Angels and demons I found almost every change justified. Some things in the book wouldn't translate very well on screen or it would've taken to much time to make them justice. The character alterations that have been made also work out better than I thought possible. All in all, I only have three complaints about this movie: 1) Sometimes Langdons ""lectures"" are a bit overdone, especially in the first part when he starts explaining things no one has actually asked him about. It's just a little too obvious that he's giving background information to the audience rather than to the people he's talking to on screen. Which leads us to problem no. 2): some of these explanations disrupt the pace of the movie. I mean they have only a few hours to solve the greatest riddle ever, find 4 missing cardinals and locate a hidden bomb, and yet they are walking calmly on their way to the archives, when they should be running their a**es of. Why? To give Langdon time to explain some more things we need to know in order to understand what's about to happen. The information is necessary, no argument there, but the way it's delivered could have been done in a better way. Problem no. 3 is the female lead, Vittoria, who spends most of the time just asking Langdon the right questions. And since they've left out the part of the murdered CERN-scientist being her father, there's not much to build on emotionally - she's simply not angry or active enough. Ironically, one of her best lines from the book is in the film, but has been given to another character. Apart from these flaws I'd say the film is just great. Hanks IS Langdon and Ewan McGregor's acting is superb as always. Changes from the original were well put together with fine storyline and no loose ends. Great scenery, nice effects - simply well done (some day I'll have to sit down and figure out why it's so much easier to write about the negative parts than the positive ones). I'll definitely go and see it again."

This movie may be less controversial but it certainly is just as bad in movie terms. Forget religion, it's just a bad movie. Worse, a bad movie that relies solely on religious controversy to sell tickets means there's no pressure on a studio to make a coherent film.

He gave us the biggest film-making ""FU"" to the viewing public of all time with the Da Vinci Code. (""Sure, it's bad fiction but I love to rile up them there Catholics."")

","As assumed Angels & Demons was a very mediocre film. Director Ron Howard and Actor Tom Hanks should be ashamed of their efforts when they made this movie because both are much more talented that what they did here for 138 minutes. The plot was about the only interesting part of this movie. However, the interesting story was ruined by Hanks' inability to encompass a believable character(Robert Langdon). Granted he did have some complex dialogue but nothing he said sounded like he actually knew what he was talking about. If the main character is supposed to be a well respected professor and the integrity of the movie depends on the authenticity of the character then Hanks' should have put in a little more time trying to comprehend his lines instead of just flatly reciting them throughout the entire movie. Once again, like the DaVinci Code there were several cheesy and ""convenient"" epiphanies that could have been executed in a more clever manner. Otherwise, the remainder of the supporting cast: Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgård, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, and Armin Mueller-Stahl all performed very well. The lead female Ayelet Zurer was not bad but anyone could have played next to Hanks in this movie and looked just fine. The best part of Angels & Demons was probably the last riveting 30 minutes, which basically salvaged its grade from a 4/10 to a 6/10/."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","9","14 May 2009"," Board game
","Quite a few action flicks have been compared to video games, with good reasons. But some may remember that before electronic game proliferate the world of entertainment, there was a time, starting in the 1960s, when Monopoly lead the proliferation of board games which came in all varieties imaginable (sleuth, adventure, finance, war, even journalism!). ""Angels and demons"" is the nearest a movie can ever come to resemble a board game. The map of Vatican and Rome is the colourful playing board and the characters the playing pieces. There are clue cards and movement rules and an invisible hand that tosses the dices.<br/><br/>Rules of a board came cannot be overly complicated or they'll spoil the fun. Similarly, A&D is far less complicated compared with Da Vinci Code. The plot surrounds the re-surfacing of a medieval secret society, the Illuminati, scientists persecuted mercilessly by the Catholic Church. In the wake of the demise of the current Pope, the Illuminati comes back with full poetic-justice style vengeance, kidnapping the 4 most likely successors and vowing to kill one every hour, before branding them just as 4 of the scientists were branded and killed a few centuries ago. The culmination will be a total annihilation of Vatican at midnight, using an unimaginably powerful destructive tool, a cutting edge device of nuclear physics that they stole. So this is not only a board game, but one with a playing time limit. The hero engaged by the authorities to unravel the mysterious clues in order to save the kidnapped cardinals and avert disaster is Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert on the Illuminati. Fun and games.<br/><br/>Playing this game with energetic enthusiasm is a great cast of class-A actors. Hanks, who doesn't need another Oscar and not exactly shooting for one with this movie, plays along with good humour. Ewan McGregor, generally recognized as a capable actor even without any major awards to his name, plays Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, ""acting Pope"" until the new one is elected. Versatile veteran Stellan Skarsgard, seen recently in ""Mama Mia"" (2008) alongside with Collin Firth and Pierce Brosnan, plays the intimidating commander of the Swiss Guards in charge of Vatican's security. Not to be missed is Armin Mueller-Stahl (playing Cardinal Strauss), a truly formidable actor who just about stole the show in ""Eastern Promises"" (2007). Very nice to watch is Israelite beauty Ayelet Zurer playing the scientist working alongside Professor Langdon trying to recover her lost lethal explosive device.<br/><br/>While I can understand the Catholic community's protest, there is a certain degree of lure in melodramatic mysteries involving the Catholic Church. Dan Brown gains his popularity primarily through his crafty manipulation of clues and hooks. However, the best mystery novel based on the Catholic Church is a best seller by Canadian Charles Templeton (evangelist, broadcaster, author, journalistamong other things), ""Act of God"" (1977). The setting is very similar to A&D in that one of the plot lines is the election of a new Pope. The ingenuity of AOG is in the other plot line, an eccentric archaeologist's discovery at the Dead Sea of skeletal remains that he can prove to be Jesus Christ's. The terrifying implication is only too clear to his good friend, a Cardinal in New York who is among the top candidates for the next Pope: while educated Catholics who can accept a degree of symbolism in the Bible and cope with this discovery, a large population with minimum education will have their fundamental faith in the resurrection shattered. From there on, it's an agonizing psychological struggle in the Cardinal, as murder is contemplated. ""Act of God"" offers considerably more insight and depth than Dan Brown's mass-pleasing A&D, and I hope someone will make it into a movie. (Templeton's one other book. ""Kidnapping of a president"" has been made into a movie)."

","""And the Vatican didn't like that. So the church began to, how did you say it? Oh, hunt them down and kill them."" Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks)<br/><br/>For a fallen down Catholic boy like me, any time the Church is depicted as manipulative now and downright bloody then (a few centuries ago) confirms my suspicions that it is a business and a brand just like any other multinational corporation. Angels & Demons shows a troubled contemporary Vatican reaching out to its Da Vinci Code antagonist, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to solve the mystery and murders associated with an ancient and violent antagonist of the church, The Illuminati, which appears to be revived after ages of obscurity.<br/><br/>Given that director Ron Howard was barred from filming in the Vatican, including St. Peter's Square, the production is stunning, an evocation of its baroque grandeur beautiful to see in re-creation. While the serpentine story speeds from church to church to track murders before they happen, Langdon acquires an attractive scientist partner, Dr. Ayelet Zuhrer (Vittoria Vetra), with whom he is intimately involved in solving the crime but not in salving the audience's wound of disappointment for lack of romantic adventure.<br/><br/>I applaud the director for allowing the order of the day, stopping murders, to trump the audience's romantic expectations, a distracting Hollywood tradition that needs to die in the face of contemporary sophistication about sexuality and liberation.<br/><br/>Although Angels and Demons touches on such religious chestnuts as the struggle between good and evil, it does a credible job tackling the longstanding feud between science and faith, with science and its antimatter discovery threatening half of Rome. But the film doesn't go too far with the debate because it is first of all entertainment with just enough intellectual stimulation to satisfy any stimulus bill around."
"onepotato2","8","2","5","15 December 2009"," Some interesting stuff
","I'm not a fan of Ron Howard or Dan Brown ...but I have to give it to them for this one. Early on, buy-in comes slow, and it's easy to roll your eyes (anti-matter again? ...that old chestnut?) but it steadily gets better. I thought it slightly better than a potboiler, and it has a stunning climax. As opposed to an emotional wallop (Your girlfriend is the descendant of Christ) it has a WOW aspect. Let's just say if you mention a new kind of bomb in an action movie, that bomb is both, a) required to go off, and b) be more interesting than the lat three hundred bombs, when it does. The climax is followed by a coda that lasts a good 15 minutes; and its machinations are very interesting, but which come (strangely) after you're ready for it to conclude. There's not a single development in the first two thirds of the film that's original or interesting. Everything good is in the coda.<br/><br/>This one takes place in Italy rather than France. It balances the mockery of religion and its hypocritical materialism; with a real reckoning of its power... before retreating safely to establishment respect (Booo! A cop-out). The rapid, on-the-fly analysis of 10 unremarkable Rennaisance sculptures offers nothing to match the breathtaking analysis of a single artists most famous paintings from da Vinci Code. Robert Langdon the 'symbologist' has precious few moments to detect/decipher symbols. The time frame (4 hours) is ludicrous. There's no way so much ground could be covered in 4 hours. And who are these villains that treat murders like puzzles?<br/><br/>When action/effects movies end, the mind usually reels as endless credits go by, implying that thousands of people got paid, but no one had much taste or brains. This was the opposite for me. The craft of FX movie-making is definitely on display. The hordes that must have worked on this receive my appreciation. This is a triumph of generally inconspicuous green screen work, punctuated by some nice FX sequences."

","Being neither a fan of conspiracy tales or particularly of the earlier novel ""The Davinci Code"", I was less than optimistic that I would become a big fan of this new effort by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. So it was a bit of a surprise to find ""Angels and Demons"" is not a bad film at all. But it surely stretches credibility with its quasi- and at times pseudo-historic underpinnings. This is story-telling at warp speed; sometimes you want to have the film rewound for a few frames to verify what has been said by Tom Hanks' (as Roger Langdon).<br/><br/>Langdon's frenetic pace to prevent killings of high priests in the Vatican is the meat of the story(s). Thrown in to crank up the action a little further is the theft of antimatter, of course of much interest to all. And there are outward and internal tensions caused by the Swiss guard, Vatican figures gathered to select a new pope also have in- and external issues. And then of course there arethe Illuminati.<br/><br/>With all these characters embroiled in catching a serial killer (who focuses on highly-placed priests) working for who-knows-who, we have the makings of a pretty good thriller. And if you can decipher Langdon's rapid-fire explanations as to why the pursuit should be conducted his way, you are ahead of his law enforcement colleagues.<br/><br/>There are two exceptions, naturally. Langdon's physics-oriented partner – involved initially with the theft of antimatter she had a hand in developing (Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra)- quickly demonstrates a remarkable knowledge of Church history. Ewan Mc Gregor, who is acting essentially as the acting Pope, also understands seems to understand what is going on.<br/><br/>The fun is in listening to Langdon's rapid delivery of his analysis of the crime scenes and the criminal, and how and why it is all tied together. There are a number of so-called facts spouted that may or may not be true; but that is to be expected in both the novels of Dan Brown and the subsequent films.<br/><br/>The opening shots of the film are right on the money, conveying a real sense of the inner workings of a lab specializing in quantum physics. Credit this work to the director; Ron Howard does know how to make a film.<br/><br/>Three Stars."
"galaxychick","7","2","5","31 May 2009"," IMPROVE on the novel -- Might be better experienced on DVD
","We know the universally accepted rule: No screen adaptation can beat the book it's based on. And a book is the best way to experience a story. But there are exceptions to every rule. And this movie was it. I felt it was one of the rare occasions when a movie rises above the novel it's based on to improve on it.<br/><br/>THE BOOKS: First let me say that I read both ""Angels & Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" books in the chronological order of the saga, i.e. I started first with A&D. And I was so unimpressed by the A&D novel that I had to force myself to finish it. I think the A&D story started well enough but devolved into a convoluted, unbelievable and barely palatable mess in the end. I thought the writing was quite sloppy too. The DVC book was overall better. However both books sealed my personal view that Dan Brown's success with this saga was not with his style and skill as a writer but rather with his controversial subjects and settings. And it's a fact that a good controversy makes for good publicity. <br/><br/>THIS MOVIE: With this in mind, I went to see A&D with the expectation/hope that it will HAVE to be better than the book. And I was not disappointed. I think the movie streamlined and purged the mess of the novel and made the story more enjoyable.<br/><br/>On the other end, while watching it, I could not help but think that someone who is not at all familiar with the story might perhaps be a bit confused especially during some of the fast paced events and action sequences. Having read the novel before hand helped me. A screen adaptation should be able to stand on its own and be clear when telling the story. Because of this, I rated this movie ""7"" instead of a higher score. <br/><br/>In all, I would gladly suggest (perhaps a lone voice here, LOL) to skip the novel and see the movie if you want to know what all the fuss was about with this story. And for an even better experience (especially if you are not at all familiar with the saga), wait for the DVD. That way you can rewind at will to clarify any confusing sequences."

The actor they chose, Ewan McGregor, is a perfect fit for the role though, it's the script writer's fault :p<br/><br/>As far as Robert Langdon goes...well, suffice to say that I didn't pay too much attention to him.

Or perhaps, Brown and the big screen should never happen.<br/><br/>An adaptation of the Brown novel of the same name, ""Angels & Demons,"" prequel to the 2006 film ""The DaVinci Code,"" is merely entertaining at best and unimaginative at worst. Like the previous film, it falls into the dreaded realm of decent and unmemorable movies, and a year from now, people will probably forget this movie entirely, like some moviegoers have just hours after seeing it.<br/><br/>The story begins with the stolen ""God atom,"" the death of the Pope, the kidnapping of the four Preferiti, and an ambigram presumably sent by the Illuminati. And with a start like that, one might expect the movie to proceed in spectacular fashion. Of course, when the Papacy is on the line and Renaissance symbols are involved, there is only one man up to the challenge: Robert Langdon, professor of religious iconology and symbology who must have his PhD in talking fast while busting crimes hundreds of years old. Not so unlike ""The DaVinci Code."" Brown's writing is never really impressive, but in book form, he is able to give readers the false impression of something unique and well crafted. He should, at least, be given credit for having done a lot of research on art and Christian history. It does, after all, confuse people into thinking that he's actually been innovative with his writing. Of course, anyone with the interest and time to do the research could have come up with a conspiracy theory story based on preexisting symbols and ideas, and it might have been done with less clichés.<br/><br/>The illusion of creativity is lost in translation from book to film, though. In the book, the twists and red-herring clues coincide almost exactly with the beginnings and endings of chapters, making the timing between each twist almost the same. With those intervals, ""Angels & Demons"" winds up being a bit too much like an episode of ""Scooby-Doo."" Just when you think meddling Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) has figured out the secret, there's a secret behind the secret, and I probably wouldn't have been entirely shocked to hear Hanks say ""jinkies."" It's regretful that Hanks even attached himself to the first film, let alone a second one. Neither film really requires much out of the actor playing Robert, probably one of the reasons Hanks just doesn't fit the role well. Hanks took on a role beneath his skills and, unfortunately, didn't rise to the challenge of making Robert into a worthy character. I was more annoyed than impressed by any conclusion coming out of Robert's mouth. Also, as well as he can act, Hanks isn't that believable as a fast-talking Harvard professor, because he doesn't quite look the part described in Brown's books.<br/><br/>As Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, Ewan McGregor is one of the best among the cast (although that may not say much for his performance) for the first 90 percent of the movie. His role as the priest is wonderfully done when intentionally endearing, but the turnabout of his character leaves much to be desired in the already unsatisfying conclusion of the film. Stellan Starsgard and Ayelet Zurer as Commander Richter and Vittoria Vetra are both, like the film, decent but very forgettable, rounding out a cast that was neither terrible nor exceptional.<br/><br/>""Angels & Demons"" is, at least, better than ""The DaVinci Code."" Up until the last twenty minutes, it is certainly more entertaining. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, it falls short of the expectations of misguided Dan Brown fans."
"Manal1987","8","2","5","17 May 2009"," After all... I enjoyed it!!
","By far, Angels & Demons is better than The DaVinci Code! Still, Ron Howard has repeated some of the latter's mistakes. The action-packed events and the information-stuffed script give no space whatsoever to other factors, such as performance and underlying themes, to arise. It is a fact that a lot of directors face the usual problem of fitting a rich bulky novel into a two-hour movie. However, many of them have managed to overcome such a problem apparently, Howard is not one of them. This leads us to the fact that Angels & Demons' success over The DaVinci Code is attributed to the excellence of the novel itself.<br/><br/>Regarding cast and performance, again, I think Tom Hanks is a tragic miscast as Robert Langdon! Hanks is a great actor, and he is one of my favorites, but I just can't see him as heroic symbologist Robert Langdon. Besides, he showed nothing of his acting brilliance, for all he has done in that movie is raising his eyebrows and trying to look astonished all the time! Ewan McGregor, or Camerlengo Patrick McKenna to be honest, I expected more from him! But, I don't want to sound too judgmental, I think this is due to the script's flaws; there wasn't enough space on paper for the extremely important and deeply complicated character of the Camerlengo. Thus, McGregor couldn't fully bring it to life on screen. As for Nikolaj Lei Kaas (the assassin), he successfully and masterfully makes his debut in the American movies' scene, for I think that his performance was really applaudable, reminding me of the terrific performance of Paul Bettany as Silas in The DaVinci Code. Stellan Skarsgård, as Commander Richter, stood out as well.<br/><br/>One of the things that I also liked about the movie is the soundtrack. The orchestral symphonies reflect the holiness and grandeur of the setting, and they manage in some scenes to give you goosebumps! The visual and special effects were quite lame for a movie like this. In some shots, things don't seem real at all and you feel as if you are watching a state-of-the-art video game.<br/><br/>Finally, Angels & Demons is certainly an enjoyable experience, especially if you are not familiar with the novel, and the twists and turns of the plot."

","the movie is not completely unfortunate. It is faithful to the book, in a nutshell, the music was over done, the special effects were fantastic and the acting even better. Although there are a lot of things very generic about the film, I enjoyed it richly. Ron Howard was not able to film in the Vatican and his studio substitutes were amazing. One massive problem I have with the movie is the idea that it does not add anything to the story to those who have read the book, I knew exactly when everything was going to happen, when the big musical numbers would begin, and I was able to guess pretty much every scene and set before it was shown on screen.<br/><br/>What I most loved the film which makes it the difference between a rating of 6 and 7 is the facial expressions of Top Hanks especially at the end.

","Okay I'm a chick and I'm not supposed to know these things, but why are all these series of movies that Tom Hanks is in are so conveniently laid out. And the battery thing? I learned in middle school that the cold ensures a longer lifespan to a battery, but in the movie they state the cold reduces the battery charge WRONG—No one on set knew that? Sorry, I really liked Tom Hanks, thought he was adorable in Big and so many others, but doesn't he read the script and have someone read it for him and why not say to the director, hey, how am always at the right moment at the exact time -- every time! I know it's a movie, but come on, you're making me look silly. And the first death that is supposed to be a public spectacleit's in a basement under a hidden doornot very public on that one. There's more, but why bother, title should be 'Angels, Demons, and Convenience'. And don't you think they went a little too far out of the way to make us think the Swiss inspector guy was guilty. I mean the way he handled things, it's like he was a total dope. A man in that position would have been on it, especially after being wrong on the first murder. His character didn't fit his positions and the situations. Anyway, that's the least of the film's worries, it's the rest of it that stinks."

","Angels and Demons is the kind of movie I wanted to see this year . This is probably one of the best thrillers for the past few years .

"Robert_duder","9","2","6","23 August 2009"," Much like the book easily surpasses The DaVinci Code in style, story, and character!
","The DaVinci code film was a decent movie. I had very high expectations for it and I must admit that they didn't really fulfill them although in watching the film again prior to this one I think I enjoyed it more the most recent time through. Still there was something almost campy about it and it certainly wasn't meant to be campy but rather an intellectual spin, a dramatic take on religion and Christianity. I read Angels and Demons and enjoyed the book much more than The DaVinci Code book so I was really looking forward to the newest film. Despite those expectations I was not disappointed for a moment with the film. Was it different than the book? Absolutely. Did they take liberties? They have to. Regardless the pace, the story, the characters, the suspense all easily surpassed The DaVinci Code film. Perhaps Angels and Demons was less complicated but I think for everything director Ron Howard did right in the first one there were plenty of complaints and advice and I think he kept what was right about the first film and fixed most or some of the wrongs making this one even better and really giving the character of Robert Langdon legs to go a long ways on the big screen.<br/><br/>Of course truly giving Langdon legs is the amazing and unstoppable Tom Hanks who is literally one of the greatest actors in the history of theatrics (in my opinion.) Now Robert Langdon is a bit of a laid back character, doesn't have a lot of zest necessarily, same in the books but Hanks makes him likable and he definitely gives him more personality in Angels and Demons that was lacking from DaVinci Code. Hanks is just fun in the role and best of all his chemistry lights up the screen and makes the whole adventure a blast. Ewan McGregor, who I have not always been a fan of, is downright brilliant (award worthy dare I say) as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna. Hanks and McGregor have terrific chemistry opposite each other and McGregor's character is fantastic. Stellan Skarsgård gives a terrific performance, but rather understated as Commander Richter, an anti-hero that really helps the story along. Langdon's female companion this time is Ayelet Zurer who does a great job in the role but she seemed so similar in look and personality to the girl in the original film that it was like watching her all over again so she kind of gets swept under the rug in my opinion. Legendary character actor Armin Mueller-Stahl has an appropriate but subtle performance as a main Cardinal hoping to become Pope.<br/><br/>In some ways it was only natural that Angels and Demons be a more entertaining film. The action and suspense is higher, the religious overtone while absolutely present isn't the driving force behind the plot, and Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard had time to learn and hone the characters and story and everything else. Sequels are rarely known for surpassing their originals but this one does in every sense of the word. Both films are worth seeing and both are cutting a place in film history for box office success and it is certain that they will do the third Robert Langdon film and I will definitely want to be there to see because so far they have only improved and Angels and Demons turned out to be one of, if the not thee, best sequel of the summer! 9/10"
"zer0oskul","5","2","6","17 May 2009"," The Best Comedy of the Year 2009!!!
","What a brilliant comedy full of ridiculous juxtaposition, and showcasing, in the style of The Princess Bride, that a really bad book can make a really funny movie by never building up any suspension of disbelief whatsoever. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer(True Romance) holds together scenes made entirely of unopposed magnets, the sheer cinematography and performances generally come across brilliantly. Though, overall, the story is terrible the cinematography manages, and at times it seems impossible, to maintain the movie's watchability over two and-a-half hours and captivate us all for a fun time.<br/><br/>This is such a fun and funny movie, and the ending is brilliant!<br/><br/>BRAVO, Ron Howard and crew!<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Scientists are working in a lab at CERN; but the lab, rather than being on the surface, is located about ten feet from the ATLAS computer, which is actually hundreds of feet below ground and kept at almost absolute zero, and the warming and cooling of the complete hadron collider track takes months. So the movie implies that they have a very powerful heating system (for the comfort and survival of the scientists) operating against the biggest, most powerful refrigerator in the universe.<br/><br/>The movie's ATLAS calorimeters--in reality, a specially galvanized steel substance that decays when bombarded by particle explosions--are little tubes (probably nanotubes) that all the particles travel through to be measured; and none of the particles go through any process of decay whatsoever... and the initial collision explodes incredibly slow, at a visible rate... and, of course, all of the scientists are silently proud of their achievement and softly smile to themselves, rather than experiencing rapturous joy at having performed a task none have ever done before and perhaps seeing for the first time in history the thing that some scientists have called The God Particle: the Higgs-Boson. They just softly smile and nod to themselves. HILARIOUS!!! <br/><br/>ANTIMATTER STORAGE IN A BATTERY POWERED TEST TUBE!!! And the battery only lasts until Midnight; on the stroke.<br/><br/>A group of papal potentials are kidnapped and left dead, or dying with ancient brands across their chests representing the four elements of ancient alchemy, which Robert Langdon(Hanks) refers to as the basic elements of science: Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water; and the ancient brands are printed in English! Not Olde English but Modern English. Olde English would have made sense. Eorde Fyr Wind Watar, or even Latin: Terra Incendia Ventus Unda. But no! It's in plain modern English! This major fault in a major plot point is gut-bustingly funny. Every time we see one we are reminded of the ludicrousness of the situation.<br/><br/>While running through an underground maze for some reason, along with guys in flack suits for some reason, Robert Langdon(Hanks) comes to a dead-end. The guys in flack suits turn around and leave for some reason, even though they're escorting Langdon for some reason. Langdon, in the deep, deep depths of some ancient tunnel kicks aside a pile of leafs to reveal the path he must take. LEAFS!!! We're deep in the catacombs under Rome, the place probably hasn't been disturbed for years aside from the random Illuminati or Cardinal, and there's a pile of LEAFS down here. And the pile of leafs from outside, obviously concealing something are not what attracts Robert Langdon(Hanks)'s attention, he is actually drawn in by the fact that all the bricks are the same shape in a line, like a path that leads to the leafs. The leafs are never mentioned as being mysteriously out-of-place deep in a dusty catacomb.<br/><br/>And for some reason there's a beautiful CERN scientist, Vittoria Vetra(Ayalet Zurer: she was in another movie that you never saw and probably never will), following Robert Langdon(Hanks) everywhere asking him why he's doing stuff. There's almost a reasonable explanation for her existence: she has a spare battery for the antimatter container, which has no timer on it, only blinking lights, but she can only change the battery if she has more than five minutes before the expiration of the old battery... which has NO TIMER. At one point, because a pen is not immediately available, she tears a page out of a priceless handwritten book by Galileo. If I were Langdon I would have assumed she was a spy trying to discredit my reputation, rather than a particle physicist, and turned her in immediately.<br/><br/>A Catholic douses himself in kerosene and sets himself ablaze, a la Buddha!!!<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is that all of the news reporters are standing on scaffolds and atop their news vans when the antimatter--instead of collapsing and dissipating into nothing when contacted by natural matter, this contact includes being looked at-- the antimatter explodes and washes a nuclear-bomb-like blast-wave over St. Peter's square-- leaving the entire rest of the Vatican, and all of Rome, undamaged--the explosion sends people flying and sliding, all the news reporters are tossed from on high, headfirst, really hard, at the road, most probably killed, and at least suffering concussions and brain hemorrhages. The next day they're all fine and everybody reports calmly without even a scratch.<br/><br/>Cool part: At one point Robert Langdon(Hanks) flips through a book containing sample symetric anagraphs that did not make the cut as the movie's Illuminati emblem.<br/><br/>The thing also contains micro homages to other Tom Hanks movies, for example I found myself muttering about how I bet he wished he'd remembered how to build the CO2 filter from Apollo 13, while trapped in the Vatican archives with a depleting air supply. The air supply was completely drained in a matter of less than an hour. And the first time we see Robert Langdon (Hanks) he is swimming, wearing a Speedo and, though all we've seen is his pale butt, I was instantly able to recognize him from his introduction in too-small tighty-whities from Big.<br/><br/>And, seriously, there's almost two and-a-half hours of this stuff!"
"choochootrain29","8","2","6","17 May 2009"," Better adaptation than The Da Vinci Code...
","After watching the trailers and hearing good things from the movie, i decided to go watch it. For those who have read the novel, may find that there are a few differences in a couple scenes. The setting of the film was in Vatican City, Rome, Italy. As much as they weren't allowed to film inside the Vatican, they did a fairly good job at simulating the setting with the computers etc. What I would recommend to those who are planning to watch the film, and have not read the novel beforehand, I would suggest that you pay close attention to what they are saying. There are some information which the book talks about which are not mentioned in the film, hence some viewers may be a bit confused. In the film, the style and speed of which the characters solve riddles/mysteries is a bit too fast and not detailed enough. However, the film still stretched to 2hr and 20mins!<br/><br/>All-in-all it is a big improvement from The Da Vinci Code!"
"kevinjr16","8","2","6","17 May 2009"," Pretty good. At least not a snoozefest.
","I thought this movie was pretty good. I never read the book and never will. Its kind of predictable but way way better than the davinci code. The best word to describe this movie is Grand. Its very visionary and no doubt controversial, especially among catholics, but entertaining nonetheless. The opening was very very good and the movie had me riveted in my seat the whole time. The long boring conversations of the first are now replaced by tension and ticking doomsday clock. The race is on to uncover the truth and expose the secret behind the illuminatti. Tom Hanks offered a decent performance but i think Ewan McGregor was excellent as the carmelango. The girl was pretty much just there to throw another girl into the mix as she really ends up having no purpose whatsoever. So definitely go check this movie out."
"juliet-hime","7","2","6","16 May 2009"," more that I expected but less the twist unlike in the novel..
","I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown. Of all his books, Angels and Demons is the best and next will be Digital Fortress.The novel was well written, thrilling, full of twist and action. This is the novel that I couldn't pull down during classes.<br/><br/>When I heard about the movie, I invited my family to watch it with me even though they don't like thrillers. We watched the movie a while ago at exactly 4:15 in ATC. Unlike Da Vinci Code, this was the best. You will experience a fast pace, puzzling adventure of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) together with Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) in solving the case of continuous murder of the preferiti by the white man Illuminatus with the twist of the personal story of the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).<br/><br/>Although there are scenes that was removed or change in the movie. Maximilian Kohler did not appear in the movie not like in novel wherein he is was concern of the death of Leonardo Vetra and he was the one who called Robert Langdon in the book. Also in the book, Vittoria Vetra explained to Langdon how the Rome will be destroyed by demonstrating with the little antimatter. The Hassassin depicted as a tall and black man unlike in the movie which was a white man. In the movie, it did not explained that Camerlengo Patrick McKenna was the son of the late pope through a test tube that conclude to the last part, that was changed, when the survived preferiti was chosen as a pope and not Camerlengo Patrick McKenna. For me, the book shows more adventure for they must convince the Swiss Police that the preferiti will die in different churches by an Illuminatum and the destruction of Rome by a canister of antimatter.<br/><br/>But on the top of it, the over-all cinematography was PERFECT! The Vatican City, CERN, Vatican Archives, the statues of the saints and catacombs.. It made me feel like I was in Rome or merely part of the scene.<br/><br/>Over-all, I'll rate the movie 7/10 for a job well done and also made my family praised the novel I loved. I cannot wait for the Digital Fortress LOL!"

","I just came out of the movie. I didn't like movie adaptation of ""Da Vinci Code"". The book was fine , original material was there but the script and movie itself was too slow paced and full of long artificial explanations and dubious conversation scenes. Angels and Demons however had much more movie material to work with...From historical and beautiful Rome locations and replica of Vatican scenery to simpler explanations about Illumunati and their history with Catholic church the whole background was almost with novel. The thing that worked in both book and script of A&D was ""ticking time bomb"" fact. It both keeps the pace faster and puts a sense of purpose to whole movie. Langdon and Vittoria who try to save cardinals and find the antimatter , Richter , Camerlengo , Strauss , Olivetti who try to control the situation before deadline , Assassin who kills cardinals one by one. There is not much scene to waste because time of the whole movie is also limited and there is lots of material which can or could be adapted....<br/><br/>That is also my major complaint about whole movie. Because of time constraints there are lots of changes like editing the kidnappings of cardinals , origins of relations between Camerlengo and Pope or fight between Langdon , Vittoria and Assassin in Castle of Angels....This is an undeniable problem with book to movie adaptations I guess. Still it is a good movie and a much better adaptation than Da Vinci Code. For Robert Langdon fans we can even see his famous Mickey Mouse wrist watch briefly..."
"ctte1269","7","2","6","15 May 2009"," Better Than Davinci but strays too much from the Book
","First off, Angels & Demons is my favorite all time book. So obviously I have been eagerly waiting for this movie. I never wake up early but I did so today just to see the movie early this morning. So now for the critique: The story line doesn't quite follow the book, which was disappointing. However, I understand the changes due to time constraints. If they followed the book to a tee, it would be at least a 4 hour movie. So I accepted that. Angels & Demons was very face paced (except for the beginning which kind of dragged). The beginning is where Ron Howard decided to turn this into a Sequel instead of a Prequel...this was done by an allusion to Langdon's previous trouble with the Church, which is an obvious reference to The Davinci Code. The movie was a fun movie, but don't expect too much, except for the fact that Hank's reprisal of Robert Langdon isn't as stale and stiff as he was in the Davinci Code. Further disappointments were: 1) the casting of the Hassasin was way off. I always picture him as a stocky dark skinned man who's only goal was to murder and inflict pain on anyone who stands in his way. In the movie, he is a tall, skinny white guy, who in the end, has an almost ""sensitive"" side when he is confronted by Langdon and Vittoria. 2) Vittoria's father was not used as a character. Instead, they used a ""co-worker"" and they scenes in Cern definitely varied from the book. and lastly...The Final Brand was not the one used in the book. I thought the Illuminati diamond was one of the coolest parts of the book, but in the movie it was totally different, not even an ambigram!!! All in all though it was enjoyable. Don't take it too seriously, just kick back and enjoy the action and forget about the book. I do recommend people to read the book, because it is suspenseful and a fast read. 7 out of 10 stars!"

","Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!<br/><br/>Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.<br/><br/>As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.<br/><br/>I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!<br/><br/>Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

"mrnunleygo","2","1","2","28 October 2016"," Good cast drowns in ridiculous plot
","If humanity makes it to the 2030s, this film a sure to be on the 2030s equivalent of Mystery Science Theater. I've got no problem with a good cast that faithfully labors to make this film watchable, but as others have noticed, the overall plot is patently absurd. Hero Tom Hanks chases the Illuminati, who appear to be the last true disciples of Rube Goldberg (youngsters, google it), who leave a ridiculously complicated trail of clues that have to be solved for their ultimate plan to work but who also do everything they can to prevent these clues from being solved (which is all part of the plan, but never mind). I have never put a spoiler in a review before, but this movie richly deserves at least one. There is a bomb that is supposedly as destructive as a five kiloton atomic bomb, but at the last minute it is carried out of range of doing any damage to anything. Uh, guys, judging from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a ONE kiloton bomb 1000 meters above the Vatican (which is as far as any helicopter could have ascended in just over two minutes) would have destroyed every building within a half mile radius and basically vaporized everyone in Saint Peter's Square. A FIVE kiloton bomb would have knocked down every building in Rome, with additional vaporisation. Yet when the bomb goes off, not one of the supposedly brilliant scholars present knows enough to ask ""Hey, why aren't we all dead?"" Tom Hanks should at least have turned to his female companion and say ""Wow, you really f***ed up that prediction!"" I'm sorry, but this is unconscionable. It actually makes me angry. It teaches the audience that atomic bombs are really not all that bad after all, in an era when people need to understand just how powerful these weapons actually are: and remember, hydrogen bombs are measured in megatons, and a megaton is 1000 times as powerful as a kiloton. Shame on the people who included this scene in their movie!"

Even more contrived, and now Tom Hanks proves that even great actors can't overcome crappy scripts and listless direction.

"Seraphion","7","1","2","22 September 2014"," Still a good Dan Brown styled thriller, yet it lacks weight on the major theme
","Again as with Da Vinci Code, the story looked like it's taken straight from the Dan Brown novel considering Langdon is always explaining things much like a walking encyclopedia. The thriller aspect improved in this movie compared to Da Vinci Code as it feels that the suspense is kept at almost all the duration of the movie by using the fast paced story flow and the many speeding car and running people scenes. Although this means less action part compared to Da Vinci Code, this also means that the story is being brought to its originally designed genre of thriller. Yet it's quite regrettable that the subject of the main theme, the Illuminati, feels lacking in comparison of Da Vinci Code's main plot. Tom Hanks' role as the intelligent yet faithless scholar is a straight continuance from his role in Da Vinci Code. Ewan McGregor can play the character with the hidden agenda very well; his character will turn out very nice especially to those previously oblivious to the story through the book. Stellan Skarsgaard also bring out nice color to this movie."

Some of the dialog is actually laughable.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Following the murder of a physicist, Father Silvano Bentivoglio, a symbolist, Robert Langdon, and a scientist, Vittoria Vetra, are on an adventure involving a secret brotherhood, the Illuminati. <br/><br/>Clues lead them all around the Vatican, including the four altars of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water. <br/><br/>An assassin, working for the Illuminati, has captured four cardinals, and murders each, painfully. <br/><br/>Robert and Vittoria also are searching for a new very destructive weapon that could kill millions."

","Director Ron Howard (Splash, The Paper, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) returned for this sequel to The Da Vinci Code, based on the book of the same name by Dan Brown, and from the trailer I saw I hoped it would be good. Basically the Large Hadron Collider has been activated at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and three antimatter vials are made, but immediately after this Father Silvano Bentivoglio (Carmen Argenziano), watching the experiment alongside Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Man of Steel's Ayelet Zurer), is killed and one of the vials is taken. At the same time in Rome the Vatican must decide on a new pope after Pope Pius XVI has died, with Camerlengo Patrick McKenna taking temporary control, the four men favourite to be elected are kidnapped by the Illuminati, and they are threatening to kill one of these four candidates every hour, and destroy Vatican City at midnight with the vial which would be used as a bomb. Symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) from Harvard and Vittoria from CERN are summoned by the Vaticans to help the four men and stop the bomb, Langdons deduces from a clue that they will be killed in four locations with altars and angel statues relevant to the ""Path of Illumination"" and the concept of the five classic elements, earth, wind, fire, water and the mystery element (assumed to be sky). One by one they track each man, whether in time and successful in rescuing them or not, and they are all confirmed to be in churches with names related to the elements, whether in foreign language or alternative meanings, but if they are too late the men will die in extremely painful ways, but all men are marked by heated branding with the word relevant to the element and fate. While Langdon and Vittoria follow the clues and hope to find one of the four men in each location they determine, the Vatican are voting and trying to come to a conclusion of who will elected the next pope, but the four men missing, or any of them reported to be found dead is making this difficult. Following the locating of the four men, the fifth they eventually deduce is McKenna, he is found branded, and despite his severe injury by branding he goes to help find the vial and its attached explosive device in the location that has been determined, below the church of St. Peter's Tomb, its battery life is low and will explode soon. In desperation to stop the destruction of Vatican City the vial is taken by McKenna, who was formerly a military pilot, and a helicopter takes him high above the city, the antimatter vial explodes when all lights on its indicator have faded, a blast wave causes pressure and minor damage below, and following this McKenna appears on a parachute and is praised a hero. However, Langdon and Vittoria are shown a video of the events before finding McKenna with the brand on his chest, he did it to himself, he also masterminded the kidnapping of the four candidates and the theft of the vial, this was to ensure he would become pope, and when McKenna realises he has been exposed he runs to the nearest holy building and commits suicide, setting himself on fire. The Vatican make the announcement that McKenna died from injuries related to the parachute fall, Cardinal Baggia (Marc Fiorini) becomes Pope Luke I, Langdon is allowed the material he needed from the Vatican to complete his latest book, but they request any mention of the the Catholic Church in his future work is gentle. Also starring Stellan Skarsgård as Commander Richter, Pierfrancesco Favino as Inspector Olivetti, Nikolaj Lie Kaas as Mr Gray / Assassin, Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss, Thure Lindhardt as Chartrand, David Pasquesi as Claudio Vincenzi and Cosimo Fusco as Father Simeon. Hanks is still good being intelligent and charming, McGregor is good with his time on screen being mysterious (and I assumed, rightly, from the trailer that he was the villain), and the supporting cast are all okay, the problem is the, the action is good and following the clues is alright, but it is not paced that well, the dialogue is corny, and it is just is not as gripping as the previous and much more interesting film, a disappointing but just about watchable enough mystery thriller. Okay!"

","Is anyone else increasingly tired of Ewan McGregor's trite mannerisms and being stuck with his own brand of non-acting in film after film? Unfortunately, he's a major presence in ANGELS & DEMONS, Ron Howard's follow-up to his DA VINCI CODE. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon, and this is based on another Dan Brown novel.<br/><br/>The good news is that it's better than the awful DA VINCI CODE, but then it couldn't exactly be worse. ANGELS & DEMONS has pace in the first hour and style in places, and some interesting snippets of historical information thrown into the mix, although it's still saddled with the same problems as its predecessor; namely, that the clever-clever plot which tries to be so intricate all the way through actually turns out to be incredibly simplistic and naive come the end. It's also incredibly overlong, and dull in places.<br/><br/>It's admirably vicious for a family film, with all manner of nasty deaths that in some ways recall the SAW franchise, a clear inspiration here. Tom Hanks is also better, more relaxed and at the same time more believable in his role. However, the shonky script wastes the talents of the likes of Stellan Skarsgard and the other cast members like Armin Mueller-Stahl, and it gets increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, reaching a nadir with the ridiculously cheesy effects of the helicopter finale. As a result, I can't really say I'm looking forward to the next in the series..."
"elshikh4","4","1","2","16 March 2012"," Such a boring comedy !
","This is a thriller? No. This ""was"" a thriller, because by the way it was handled; it turned into a comedy. Look how things run: Tom Hanks alludes to a statue, knits his brows, then uncovers the whereabouts of the next murder, and maybe the killer's shoe size too! To tell you the truth, I believed that his character can look at your ears, and know what the last things you've heard were! Well, this is provocative. And with repeating it, for more than 10 times along the way, then it is more provocative. And with adding so serious music, running camera, and snappy cutting; it becomes perfectly a comedy. Originally, if the criminal is so smart, why in God's name he leaves all of these clues for Hanks to discover?? Why doing it the old-fashioned way?? The answer: so author Dan Brown finds a material to write, and movie star Hanks finds a movie to star!<br/><br/>The dialogue is overcrowded with the most sophisticated information ever said by an actor in a mainstream Hollywood movie since Star Wars! It made me laugh, especially when the writers went to apportion the information on Hanks and his partner to throw them as quickly as they could, so nobody would understand anything! Then, that female partner. Firstly, WHY THERE MUST BE A FEMALE PARTNER??! Secondly, she happens to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING!!! At first, I presumed that she has knowledge in terms of the atom technology, but OH MY GOD, she proved later that she was a scientist in arts, history, code breaking, security, forensic medicine and unlocking the closed desks!!<br/><br/>The science fiction of finding the origin of creation was shown as a laughable mambo Jambo. There is a bomb threat, however a million men and women is determined on staying in the very threatened place to know the name of the new pope?? The character of the relentless hired killer is totally copied from the first movie, he's just talking good English this time! The Vatican papal foundation behaves at the end like an Italian mafia family?!! Hanks character acts flawlessly, as if he's Superman without the costumes and the fear of kryptonite as well! I bet that you thought for all the time how Hanks was in the wrong place; simply he's a fine actor, and according to the no character that he plays, you have to feel awful irony, since he does nothing but running and running and running (he didn't have any comic one-liner either!). Why he wasn't written as say a claustrophobic guy; that could have made the closed library scene more interesting, and made the character a bit vulnerable for God's sake! And ladies and gentleman, the genius plot twist was too clear from the first minute; so who they were kidding??! I saw the truth about Ewan McGregor's character coming from 7000 miles away, otherwise why to cast a star for that character?!<br/><br/>The only respectable ""thriller"" part remains in the last 10 minutes; not for the scene where we watch the first Camerlengo James Bond, but for not having any statue that speaks to Hanks! So according to what really works in this movie; it is a comedy, yet the laughs were far in between, therefore it lost the pace; which labels any comedy as boring, and hence bad. Now, after seeing the 2 installments, if you ask me which is better; (The Da Vinci Code) or (Angels & Demons)?, I must go for (Plan 9 from Outer Space)!"

","Angels & Demons is a mystery-thriller film that was based on Dan Brown's novel by the same title. It is the Interquel or second film, although the book was published first in series chronology of Robert Langdon.The movie stars Tom Hanks,who reprises the lead role of Langdon,together with Ewan McGregor,Ayelet Zurer,Stellan Skarsgård,Pierfrancesco Favino,Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller-Stahl.Producer Brian Grazer, composer Hans Zimmer and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard also return after working in The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons,although was written before the novel The Da Vinci Code, the story transpires after the events of the latter movie.Robert Langdon, the most respected symbologist in the United States, who uses his knowledge in order to decode a symbol on the skin of a murder victim. The clues put him on the trail of an international conspiracy involving the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>Inspite of the many issues involving about the Catholic Church,the movie was far from entertaining and interesting as compared to the novel itself.The film was more of an exercise instead of a story being told on screen. It was talky and a violent conspiracy thriller will bore not only kids and teens but adult viewers as well.It lacks tension,suspense and drama as everything in the movie becomes clichéd and predictable.Also,the story is far from realistic as it becomes ridiculous and implausible at some points of the screenplay.<br/><br/>Acting-wise,it is noticeable that there is limited chemistry between Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer.I felt that even Hanks himself is on a rush delivering his lines as we see his character constantly chasing not only the enemy but as well as the exercise required by the plot of the movie.Too bad that it was a poor adaptation of a good novel.Maybe it is better to read the book instead of watching the movie adaptation."
"pcpl1","6","1","2","10 May 2011"," I am disappointed
","I read about 2 months ago Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Then my wife read it. Yesterday on Monday May 9, 2011 my wife and I saw the movie Angels and Demons on Blue Ray extended version. When I read the book I was thrilled by the writing of Dan Brown, the excitement and the story set before my eyes. The movie is so different from the original story, lots of elements have either disappeared or have been changed in such a way that I think it does not reward Dan Brown enough. Mind you the special effects are spectacular and Tom Hanks like usual is brilliant in the role of Professor Langdon but I must say that both my Wife and I are disappointed. Where is Kobler??? Langdon's girlfriend in the book is warm and emotional. the actress who plays her in the movie is cold as ice. The assassin who in the book appears so powerful looks like a geek in the movie. For just a movie without reading the book its OK but after reading the book this movie is a flop."

","Watching a film purely for the sake of being entertained is what I would relate to Angels and Demons. The movie was fast paced and thrilling - good entertainment. The acting in the movie wasn't brilliant but it was passable and helped the plot line along(though I personally think that they could do with a little less blank faces). The film is a good watch, however, if you read/liked the book you'll be disappointed in how much they missed out.<br/><br/>When I first watched the film I thought it was brilliant: murder, mystery, history - my favourite things. The movie inspired me to read the novel which I had heard wasn't as good. Only 100 pages into the book, not only did I find it incredibly interesting but also I realised exactly how many fundamental things the movie missed out. One major thing that the movie failed to include was the fact that Vittoria was Leonardo Vetra's(the one who had his eye cut out) adopted daughter, not just his ""working partner"". Another was that the Illuminati symbol was not printed out and distributed but rather burned into Leonardo Vetra's chest.<br/><br/>As I continued to read, I noted that the directors of the movie only kept the major facts the same but changed everything else.<br/><br/>Again, if you read the book, watch the movie for the sake of it though you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book, the movie is great entertainment, though not the best."

"jonathanruano","7","1","2","4 April 2010"," Angels and Demons
","With ""Angels and Demons,"" a film about Professor Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra's race against the Illuminati to save Vatican City from an anti-mater bomb that could wipe everyone out, proves once again the Ron Howard is not the great film-maker many people say he is. Take just the beginning of ""Angels and Demons."" We see currents of electricity move up wires, but big deal. That special effects trick has been shown so many times before that it seems boring and repetitive now. The other scene, which shows director Howard showing off, reveals the floor of the pool so that we have an idea what it is like for Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) to swim under water. But again, do we really need to know? We can just as easily to go a swimming pool and find that out for ourselves. There is also no character development in ""Angels and Demons."" Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) are the same people at the beginning of the film as they at the end, in spite of all the tumultuous things that have happened to them. The same is true for the villains in this story. There are also certain flaws with plot development of this film, especially toward the end.<br/><br/>Yet at the same time, ""Angels and Demons"" is not a bad film. It imitates some of the best scenes in the Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones series: studying of archival sources, opening tombs, and watching Langdon get himself dirty while going through a secret passage way or sneaking through a vent. In short, this film is very good at showing the wonder of going into strange places and discovering new things. This side of the film, in many ways, compensates for its flaws such as those illuminated above and makes ""Angels and Demons"" entertaining right up to the end."
"MaeAbdulbaki","4","1","2","18 February 2010"," Disappointing
","Contains Spoilers!<br/><br/>I was excited to see this film - having only recently finished the book. But I knew, after watching the first two minutes, that I was not going to like it.<br/><br/>The beginning sees Vittoria in a lab, obviously at CERN, with a few other scientists who, we find out a few minutes later, have created anti-matter, a heavily unstable specimen. Then, Vittoria walks into a lab to find her partner dead... thus, taking out the personal relationship between them (they were father and daughter).<br/><br/>Then, we find Langdon swimming laps in a pool at 5am. A Vatican representative shows him a paper with the Illuminati ambigram (which, in the movie, was not branded onto Leonardo Vetra's -- his name change in the movie escapes me -- body.) Then, the quick chase to save the prefiriti (the favorites to become Pope) before the assassin kills them and brands them with the four ambigrams of the Illuminati.<br/><br/>The movie takes away from the true meaning of the book, changes two important character names and practically gives away who the mastermind behind the Illuminati scheme is near the beginning. Vittoria Vetra, a very strong-willed and intelligent character, might as well have been written out of the script for all the usefulness she provided.<br/><br/>I know most movie adaptations do not stick completely to the book, but this movie disgraces it. If I hadn't read ""Angels and Demons"", I would have been completely confused by the movie. It moved too fast and seemed too focused on the thrill of the chase, rather than the argument of science vs. religion. There was no real pause and stop for the character to play catch up with all the information they kept throwing out.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' portrayal of Langdon was too sure and confident, almost cocky. In actuality, Langdon is just a professor with a love for art history and symbology. Yet, in the movie, he has no doubts, he is never unsure of himself, and walks, talks, and acts like rather like he'd be a better fit as an authority figure.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor doesn't give the camerlengo enough justice. The camerlengo was supposed to be a character of stability while the world was supposedly falling apart around him. Instead, he is portrayed like a man with a secret gleam in his eye, which gave the impression that it was truly his orchestration. His portrayal should have been of a man of faith trying to maintain a sense of calm before the storm until the end when we actually do find out it was, indeed, him.<br/><br/>Overall, it was very, very disappointing. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone, especially those who enjoyed reading the book."
"freemantle_uk","4","1","2","1 January 2010"," Get me a symbologist!
","My God this film is stupid, I mean on the edges of braindead. It is plot holes which you could drive a bus through. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard should really known better to return to this series.<br/><br/>The plot of this film goes like this. The Pope has just died and the Catholic Church need to elect a new leader. But here's the problem: a old enemy has emerged, the Illuminati. They have kidnapped the four preferitis (the leading candidates for the papacy) and have stolen a case of anti-matter. They plan to kill a Cardinal every hour till midnight, and bomb the Vactican in an explosion of light. The Catholic Church are determined to continue the election despite threat, and call in help from Havard symbolist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer). They work with the head of the Vatican police led by Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård), and a liberal priest Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), who wants to open up the church. It becomes a race against time to save the cardinals and prevent Vatican City with thousands of innocent people in St. Peter's Square getting blown up.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons is much better then the Da Vinci Code, but having a STD would be better then the Da Vinci Code. Angels & Demons was Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon book, but since the Da Vinci Code was a massive success it became a film first. Therefore Angels & Demons became a sequel to the monster success of the first film. What the main problem with Angels & Demons is the source material. I have read the Da Vinci Code, and I can safety say its one of the worst novels I have ever read. I don't mind the fact the novel was critical of the Catholic Church (normally I enjoy being critical of organised religion), and the book had a good premise, that Jesus had married and had children and his bloodline survives in the modern age. But Dan Brown is a poor writer, there is no characterisation, Robert Langdon is too smart (but only reveals his knowledge at certain points). Brown likes to show how much research he had done given the reader too much information we don't care about, and he still gets the facts wrong. Brown became a writer because he thought he could write a better novel then The Doomsday Conspiracy, and I properly could write better novel then Dan Brown. Whilst the story of the Da Vinci Code might have worked for some people in a book, it definitely didn't work in a film. It was long, drawn out and boring. At least with Angels & Demons the film is shorter, more action packed, and there is more a threat/race against time for the audience to get excited about. But there are still a lot of problems. As mentioned their are plot holes. The biggest being there is a powerful bomb hidden under Rome, and I'm sure the Italian police and military would evaluate the city and use their intelligence services to find the bomb and the Cardinals. The other is why would the Illuminati go through all this effort if they was a trail of evidence behind them. It makes no sense. Why not mix it up a bit. Al-Qaida or the IRA wouldn't operate like that. The twist at the end was also not need and Dan Brown does the same thing in The Da Vinci Code: that trick gets old if not done well. There are also stupid scenes like last action scenes which are so silly. There also the unrealistic element in the film of the police showing up to sense of a dead Cardinal a minute too late. The acts a travelogue for Rome, much like the Da Vinci Code was for Paris and London. I bet Rome's Tourism Board are happy.<br/><br/>Acting wise no one stands out for good reason, but that's because of the lack of material to work with. The only I could say who comes out with any merit is Pierfrancesco Favino who plays a senior police officer. Ayelet Zurer disappears off the screen because of the lack of depth she has. And I'm sure everyone knows about Ewan McGregor's poor attempt of an Irish accent: it would have been easier to cast an Irish actor like Michael Fassbender.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a great example of a hit-and-miss director. He can do really good films like Frost/Nixon, Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind, but also weak films like the Da Vinci Code, Far and Away and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He tries his best, but he is not an action director, he is a good drama director. His action scenes were lackluster. As well Howard also doesn't have a lot to work with behind the camera, and struggles to begin real drama or tension to the film.<br/><br/>I think the bare bones of the story, an old threat to the church returns could have worked as a really good thriller or horror film, but not as a action film. It could have been handled with a lot more intelligence with better writing, but of course Dan Brown can't write.<br/><br/>It's not worth watching."
"tomasetti","Null","1","2","31 December 2009"," Agree with comments
","I read many of the comments on this website before posting my own. Needless to say, many of the comments were extremely accurate. Many have read all or some of Dan Brown's work, and are able to sequence the book and the movie in it's entirety.<br/><br/>I have none of that, I only have one observation, technical in nature. While I am a fan of the willing suspense of disbelief, I am a bigger fan of logic. And when movies omit technology (either because of the time period, or despite it), I am more at ease. When films embrace technology, there are always one of two outcomes. They either do it correctly or incorrectly. This movie does it incorrectly, and to the peril of the entire main plot!!! When Hasassin, the villain, steals a wireless camera and moves it more than 2 miles away, it can only be one type of wireless camera. One that uses CMDA, TDMA, GSM or some other standard broadband technology. It would also need to broadcast pretty strongly (about as strong as a common cellphone). Therefore, the signal could then be traced and the ENTIRE PLOT CAN BE AVOIDED. Think about that.<br/><br/>We're talking about the Vatican, the catholic church. They have more money and access to the type of security that belongs in the movies. They can't trace a simple TDMA signal? They have to hire an archnemesis in Robert Langdon and then have him solve 16th century puzzles on a running stopwatch? PLEASE I don't know if this stolen wireless camera was as much part of the plot in the book as it is in the movie, where they are trying to cut power to parts of the city to see when the camera loses light etc, but if it is, I couldn't read the book either. Dan Brown, either embrace technology in your books (and their very simple concepts) or start writing books set in medieval times. <br/><br/>I am willing to suspend my disbelief and believe that there is a heaven in the sky, and that Moses can part the Red Sea, but I will simply not believe the Vatican cannot trace a cellphone signal in the year 2008."

","""Well, I don't know who keeps leaving them!"" Sorry, just recalled that old Monty Python sketch. Okay, the vibe I am getting is that for the fans of Brown's original book, Howard made a bunch of changes that they considered unacceptable. Fair enough, I guess, but honestly, a book is always going to be better than the movie. Also, Brown got so many things wrong in the book about Catholicism that the film makers probably did him a favor by making changes.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's a well paced film, good performance by Hanks. I think it telegraphed it's suspense a bit early when you found out the Ewan McGregor character was the mastermind behind all the mystery. Yeah, that was about as predictable as Scooby Doo. ""It was old man Carmalengo all along!"" ""And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling Symbologists!"" <br/><br/>Catholic groups were upset with their church being mocked, but the book was much harsher than the movie and the church deserves a lot of criticism..."

","If you have read the dubious source which has become the basis for the movie "" The Da Vinci Code "" and this second addition which emerges as "" Angels and Demons "", you'll quickly realize the intricate nature of Ron Howard, the director. Having read the book, then watched the movie, I see the enormous segments of the literary track, were left out. Howard is a great director, as proof is seen in his past work. In this film however, there is a great deal lacking. Though it's not as complex as his 'Code' which drags the audience across countries, this one has the befuddled audience racing around Vatican city itself. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon a cryptologist who did not ingratiate himself with the Rome see in the first film, is reluctantly recalled by the same church to help solve the latest threat which calls itself the Illuminati. This secret group has kidnapped four important cardinals and promises to murder them for past sins of the church against the Intellectals brutalized in the past. Nikolaj Lie Kaas plays the assassin who stays well ahead of Hanks and physicist Vittoria Vetre (Ayelet Zurer) and Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård). With the complexity of a Physics problem, the movie is entertaining enough if you like crowds, racing sequences and threats of final annihilation. There is gratuitous drama, character suspense, combined with double and triple double-crossing, so much so one forgets who is fighting whom. As a result, this is an exciting movie for those who seek to leave the theater with heads spinning. But having read Dan Brown's juvenile books, they are baffling enough and it's not necessary to see his cryptic suggestions on the silver screen. ***"

","I watched Angels & Demons for the first time last night, and i found the film to be excellent. It starts off with the Roman Catholic Church mourning the death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome. Vatican City prepares for who will be the next Pope Until that time, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a papal court official and former helicopter pilot, takes temporary control of the Vatican. Reporters, nuns, priests, and other members of the Church crowd into Saint Peter's Square, waiting for the white smoke from the conclave, which signal who has been selected as the next pope. But the Illuminati, a 400-year old, underground secret society, kidnap the four most likely candidates before the conclave begins The Illuminati threaten to kill one every hour, starting at 8:00 pm, and then destroy the Vatican in a burst of light at midnight. I found the scenery to be amazing especially around Saint Peter's Square, I do not see why people do not like this film."

","Started watching this movie, i personally had expectations of thrill and unfolding mystery in the offing. It sure did justify itself on all those grounds. It is starkly different from its predecessor 'The Da Vinci Code' which was too much information in very less time. It would not be wise to go for theatrical version of it and I would highly prescribe renting a DVD and do a 'sit back and watch'. Also, this would not take much of 'rewind and replay' as The Da Vinci Code demanded. In short I would say; its a good whodunit and you would enjoy watching it.<br/><br/>One thing i could not digest; In the movie, it was told that antimatter explosion could create explosion and consequences similar to that of a nuclear explosion. But in the end when explosion actually happened, though it was very high in the air, it did not do much."

","Well I can't say this is in my top list of movies. I don't think it would even come close to making it. However, I am most definitely giving this movie a POSITIVE review. The reason for this is that it is simply an enjoyable ride from start to finish! The description I read from another comment of the movie being 'A Roman Cat and mouse with Forrest Gump' is close although maybe just a bit too harsh as I felt a bit more entertained than that would give! I watched 'The Davinci Code' too and like many others I really didn't think too highly of it. This time around, different movie I know but similar in m,any ways and of course the obvious one being the backdrop of the Vatican and all its glorious architecture. Some might say it is worth seeing the movie for that. I wouldn't. :-) I'll just say if you want a nice, enjoyable watch, nothing too serious and scientifically and historically, complete fabrication (although there are lots of nods to real events etc, the whole premise is fantastical!), plus you like a movie to have the mysterious killer (although it was far too predictable at times!) and the high speed chases to save people, the big ending and well...you want to waste a couple of hours, ...<br/><br/>... then I would say you really should watch this movie.<br/><br/>It's good.

"tubby1","5","1","2","12 July 2009"," No thrilling mystical hunt.
","Much like the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons fails to do justice to the much more impressive books. For me Angels and Demons is the better book and more suited to the big screen. It is disappointing to say that Angels and Demons really does not deliver. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Ewan Macgregor do good jobs with a script so abrupt and poorly designed it is in coherent to the viewer. Ayelet Zurer who plays Vittoria Vetra is sadly just a 'hanger-on' the particular purpose or real significance of her presence is never really examined, and appears to be only there to ask questions or to answer them to fill in gaps within the screenplay. <br/><br/>The biggest failure is without doubt the screenplay. The opening seems particularly rushed with it moving from the Vatican to a CERN research lab rather messily. There is no explanation to events and although at times it appears the story has been slowed for our better understanding it doesn't assist or enable us to be as concerned as Robert Langdon. Indeed some of the verbal dialogue is at times undecipherable and painfully leaves you without knowing what has happened. Angles and Demons does not delve into the heart of the matter, that is the battle between religion and science, it gets lost in the messy narrative.<br/><br/>The crisp cinematography and score are excellently done and help heightened the aesthetics but without the internal structure(plot)seems out of context.<br/><br/>The film does drag and it is a real shame that it could not piece together Dan Brown's work better to produce a thrilling mystical hunt. Maybe it is fair to say that adapting such books to screen will always be hard to deliver but it really shoots way-lower on the expectation level."

","This is a Boys' Own adventure for grown-ups pure and simple. Sure you can chuck in the mix a secret society and the Catholic Church, and that works better here than in Da Vinci, but at the end of the day this is a film with one premise: unravel some clues, defuse a bomb, and the obligatory twist. It's a watchable and enjoyable murder mystery with less of the pseudo-intellectual than Da Vinci and it really does look and feel like National Treasure for the over 30s.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how much better the pacing and action are in this one, but disappointed at how little real sleuthing was involved. Many of the clues were solved by simply following the directions.<br/><br/>All in all a surprisingly fun film (If fun is the right word for a murder mystery) with just enough philosophical musing amid the break-neck action and gruesome killings to justify your brain cells involvement.<br/><br/>With excellent settings (Even though we all suspected a lot of computer wizardry) and with Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as always working well together this is good entertainment if a little popcorn.<br/><br/>All in all: go for the plot and stay for the action."
"poe426","7","1","2","24 May 2009"," Tom Hanks worth watching...
","More often than not, Tom Hanks can make even a middle of the road movie watchable. (Sure, there have been a couple that make you cringe- anything wherein he attempts an accent of any sort, for instance-, but he's one of the few performers whose mere presence can make a good movie a Great movie.) As a supporting star, he even made a soccer ball look good (I wept with him when the stalwart Wilson got lost at sea). Hanks can, by virtue of a look alone- no expression, just a blank look, using only the Eyes and a tightening of the Lips- bring one to the verge of an emotional chasm that must perforce be crossed if one is to continue on. I **** you not. He does it in ANGELS AND DEMONS, wherein he plays a cross between Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. Ron Howard does an excellent job as Director (as is his wont) and the cinematography has to be seen to be appreciated, but it's the last 20 minutes or so of the movie that's troubling. Had the movie ended when it clearly SHOULD have (with a noble sacrifice), I would've been obliged to rate it a ten. As it stands, it's a sometimes thrilling thriller and rates a solid seven. See it."

"moviesleuth2","7","1","2","22 May 2009"," Same grade as ""DaVinci Code,"" but different strengths and weaknesses
","It has long been known that the prequel to the literary sensation ""The DaVinci Code"" would be rewritten as a sequel to the 2006 film. Other than a few token lines of dialogue referencing the first film, it really doesn't matter (not that there are many people who haven't read the book OR seen the movie). While the two films are very similar in style and plot, the films have different strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the renowned Harvard symbologist who prevented the destruction of the Holy Grail in the previous film. After the previous events, Langdon is obviously not high on the Vatican's list of well-liked individuals. Nevertheless, he's the only one who can help them when four cardinals who are favored for the papacy have been kidnapped, and a bomb is hidden somewhere in Vatican city that could completely destroy the city. Making matters even more desperate is the fact that because the Vatican is nominating a new pope, all the cardinals are there.<br/><br/>This is not an actor's movie. The film moves too fast for anyone to really ""act."" Still, none of the actor's blow it. Tom Hanks essays the same character that he did in the first film, and the other major players, Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl do what is required of them. The newcomers, Ayelet Zurer, Thure Lindhart, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Klass, and David Pasquesi do the same. No one here is going to be up for any awards, but that's not the point. This is all story and nothing else.<br/><br/>Ron Howard must be a director that reads reviews of his movies. Unlike ""The DaVinci Code,"" which, upon first viewing, failed to generate the momentum that the novel had, ""Angels and Demons"" does something that the first film didn't: generate legitimate tension. That's not saying that ""The DaVinci Code"" film was boring, it's just that this one contains moments of actual suspense (even if you have read the novel beforehand, like me).<br/><br/>That is actually part of the problem. The film moves so fast, it's hard to generate any feeling for the characters, and Robert Langdon isn't really the one who's in any danger (well, sort of. Up until the end, the film concentrates on solving the most immediate of crises on the way to the big one).<br/><br/>""Angels and Demons"" is also plagued by some technical problems. The lighting in the film is terrible. It's so dark that we can't appreciate all the majesty of the inside of the churches. Is there no legitimate light in all of Vatican City, or does everyone there just like to do everything in the dark? I don't think it's the latter. On second thought, why don't we just say that the film's cinematography as a whole is terrible, because when indoors, the camera does not make use of the large space. And even though the art is a huge part of the film, we never really get a good look at the artwork.<br/><br/>I'm at a loss to explain why the critical reception of the film was so vicious. It's by no means perfect, but ""bad"" is certainly not a word I'd use to describe Ron Howard's new film. Even ""mediocre"" is too cruel. Do I recommend it? Sure, but the film moves so fast that I'd suggest reading the book first."

","This is a movie i was quite excited about. I loved the book for its intricacy and the fact it kept you guessing. <br/><br/>Now while i knew what to expect from the film, as yes, it did follow the flow of the book pretty much perfectly, it left out crucial parts of the plot, things which thickened the narrative and made for more dramaitc plot twists. I felt a lot of Vittoria's plot line was left out, and this let me down, as her storyline provides the crux of the book (mostly).<br/><br/>All in all, it is an enjoyable movie, it sure as S*** did not feel like 2+ hours as it moves with good pace and flow, but when it says ""Based on the novel by Dan Brown"" it really means loosely based. I still fail to see why movie makers cant stay truer to source material, Peter Jackson proved it can be done with LOTR, and such widely accepted books like Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons which have a great fan following, the films should be far more reflective and true to the books.<br/><br/>Good movie, but could have been better"

Is a more focused film and so, even if the A & D book (or Illuminatti) was inferior to DVC book, its film adaptation is much better.<br/><br/>It is a good fast pacing adventure and mystery film with a very good cast (the only unknown was the leading lady :P) and a very good plot.

I want to go to a movie to relax and enjoy it and I'm tired of having to work to make out what's going on. It seems that directors have opted for darker shots so they don't have to work as hard on the scene make-up. I for one am tired of it! I was also a little disappointed that this movie didn't have the depth of interest and intrigue as the first one.

Hanks' co-starlet Ayelet Zurer isn't very pretty and she has a rough-hewn appearance. There are no romantic interludes between them, but everybody else in the cast was terrific, including Ewan McGregor as the priest and Stellan Skarsgard as the Vatican police chief. The villain is a lethal S.O.B. who is a crack shot with a silenced automatic pistol and displays no qualms about killing Italian cops even after he has disarmed them. He gets his just comeuppance in the end. The helicopter scene at the end is unrealistic like much of the movie but it is utterly entertaining with some interesting Vatican lore thrown in for good measure. Director Ron Howard generates lots of hair-raising suspense, especially in the Vatican archives and later on toward the end with the shoot-outs.

","I think Ron Howard did a great job, but the script brought the film down like a dead weight. Whenever an interesting relationship or element pops up, it's left and we continue on, and with the film being pretty fast paced and 'OMG NO TIME LEFT, Wilson' this does work most of the time, but I found myself wanting a break from the primary action about 2/3 of the way in.<br/><br/>But, here's the reason I decided to write a review. The freaking dialog, it's awful. Probably around 95% of the dialog is just exposition, a history lesson or a cue for the people who didn't pick up the visual tell. It is a deeply historical film and therefore needs the contextual underpinning, but we don't need to know every detail about everything that gets mentioned. It drags the plot and at times, can be frustrating.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think there was a female actress in there. I don't know. I think she popped up every time needed a translator or the heroic professor was left by the police. All she seemed to do was answer questions or give Langdon an excuse to think out loud. Which is a shame, because the relationship between science and theology is one of the key topics of the film, and this ambiguous female character - a scientist at CERN - could have been the link between these. But no, all the seemed to do was act a medium for Langdon's thought.<br/><br/>Other than the script, it is quite a well-made film and is definitely worth a watch if you're up for a bit of gung-ho church-hopping."

He has just to assemble a cast and work on the plot.<br/><br/>If I go on with the story than it would feel as if I am rating the book itself. And the ingenuity of the writer is clearly visible in the story. We are drawn again towards the ancient crypts and the fight of good against evil. The church had tried to hamper the scientific endeavors in the medieval age and now a secret scientific group wants to take retribution. They steal an antimatter capsule from the laboratory of CERN and try to implode the whole Vatican down with its cataclysmic power. As the story unfolds the various layers of corruption unveil themselves. The thrill is never ending and there is always a Shyamalan kind of twist waiting for us in the storyline.

We know that he can play his parts really well and in this movie, his role was not even challenging. Evan McGregor plays the camerlengo to the pope and his acting is also laudable.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when the antimatter blasts a thousand feet above the Vatican. The sky turns into a glorious nebula and for the audiences down on earth it would have surely looked like a godly work. There is a high level of depth in which this scene is shown.

","If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie! Little Opie Cunningham should be ashamed of what he did to this book! ""Angels and Demons"" is, arguably, Dan Brown's best book. Ron Howard turned it into a blatant Hollywood capitalization. He killed the spirit of the story. He took out complete scenes, which were essential to plot and character development. He took out complete characters, only to realize later that they were necessary for plot development. Then he had to add new characters back in to get the plot to stay on track. He took out complete actions sequences. He took all of the character out of the Killer. He turned him into a milk-toast hired gun instead of the dedicated true believer that he always was. Come on. This whole movie watches like a rush job that they had to dumb-down for greater mass appeal. When all they really did was alienate all Dan Brown fans!"

","It is a hard job to adapt novels into screenplays, then into a film as exciting & thrilling as the original novel. <br/><br/>There have & always will be changes made,hopefully for the better.<br/><br/>Akiva Goldman & David Knoep have adapted Dan Brown's exciting thrilling novel in an excellent, exciting & thrilling movie.The changes made were mainly due to cast choices & editing the novel to a proper running time. Ron Howard's direction is crisp & tight. As we know this is a sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE.<br/><br/>I, for one did not care for THE DA VINCI CODE. Angels & Demons is a far better movie.<br/><br/>Since the film story happens in about an 18 hour time span,there are no unneeded flashbacks or back-story,(a few short scenes tells all).<br/><br/>There is also no time for any sort of love story. Adding one would have been very unrealistic.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is much better as Langdon this time out. Ayalot Zurer an Isreali actress is a co-scientist. helping Langdon solve this puzzle.<br/><br/>As he always is, Ewan MacGregor fits his role like a kid glove. The other main cast members also are international stars. Stellen Skarsgaard, Armen Mueller Stahl and Pierfrancisco Favino, who is an up & coming star from Italy.<br/><br/>The Special Visual & Audio effects are just magnificent. Obviously they could not film in the Vatican or St. Peters Square, The effects are so good you cannot tell that these scenes are not the real thing.<br/><br/>NOTE, there are only two explosions one part way into the film & the final one. This is the right way to do special effects.<br/><br/>The story has great stunt work, BUT not the phony stuff we see in other films. The film does have a few flaws. what film does not, just sit back like I did & enjoy. one more thing, great music score by Hanz Zimmer.<br/><br/>Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points(out of 100) IMDb 10 out of 10)"

","I walked out of the Da Vinci Code movie, and we almost walked out of this movie, but I insisted on staying. This movie had many twists and turns, it may seem like it's heading no where, but it's a very exciting movie. I'm sorry, but it's quite difficult for me to describe this movie without giving out a lot of spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent, though. I really recommend it for the suspense lovers, and those who have seen the Da Vinci code movie.

"jdkraus","8","1","3","18 June 2009"," Despite its flaws and alternatives from the book, it delivers
","Probably like the millions of people worldwide, I read Dan Brown's novel ""Angels and Demons"" after reading and seeing ""The Da Vinci Code."" Both novels are excellent and Ron Howard's adaptation off of ""The Da Vinci code"" is probably among the best I have seen. Impressed by ""The Da Vinci's Code"" success, I expected an equally as a great film for its prequel.<br/><br/>""Angels and Demons"" is accurate to the novel, but not nearly as I hoped. The book would have made for a three-hour film and I am glad that the filmmakers were able to fit it into a 2 hour and 18 minute film, which flies by. Nevertheless, because it is a movie, it leaves some important twists and subplots out as well as a significant character from the book and an alternate beginning and ending. I don't mind the additions, they were okay, but in my opinion, they did not fit the story as well as the book. <br/><br/>For one, not giving too much away, the assassin, who's going on the rampage against the Catholic Church, played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas is a far different villain than in the book. Yes, he's a cold-blooded killer, but he lacks the venom to make a believable villain. I did not despise him like Paul Bettany's wonderful work as Silas in ""The Da Vinci"". The villain's comeuppance in the movie is also feeble compared to the novel, which in the book is quite intense.<br/><br/>The other performances in the film, however, are great. Tom Hanks dazzles as Professor Langdon, Ayelet Zurer is both gorgeous and stunning as Victoria, and Stellan Skarsgard, as usual, plays a real hard ass as Commander Richter. But the real genius that drives the movie is Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo. I have a feeling that he won't receive an Oscar nomination, but I'll keep my fingers crossed. It's also nice that Armin Mueller-Stahl is in another film. He's up there in age, but he delivers his lines fluently and brilliantly, as he does in every film I have seen him in. <br/><br/>Salvortine Totino's cinematography is beautiful and Hans Zimmer's score is awesome. I will point out that the score has a little bit of ""The Da Vinci Code"" rendition, but it nonetheless delivers. The other visual works such as: costumes, set design, and visual effects are also lavish. <br/><br/>But like many people on the IMDb board, there is the question on its PG-13 rating. Having read the book, it would have made a solid R. Yet, the movie does not cut out much in terms of violence from the novel. I'm not a squeamish person, but much of the violent content in this film was surprisingly shocking and gruesome. I wonder if the MPAA has become lazy when it comes to the rating system. Then again, ""Angels and Demons"" has hardly any swearing and nudity, which often makes an immediate R versus just containing violence. I don't know, but in my opinion, it deserved the R rating, and I've seen movies that are rated R for violence and they are nowhere near the leagues of this film. Despite its flaw and alternatives from the book, it delivers. My rating: *** out of ****"

","Greetings -- Good expectation for a good bit of entertainment and perhaps even some edification. But... Just another darn night at the mega-theater, putting up with utterly atrocious previews of coming attractions. Both the previews and what they preview. If a coming attraction has quality, it's lost in this piling on of excess. I cringe and talk to myself and ""whoever"" in a mutter of high dissatisfaction. I pull my cap down. And I make me another promise to show up late next time. Swoosh!! Edit fast faster fastest. Swooosh! Disdain for the viewer. Swoooosh! Woosh! Distortions. Don't they suppose anyone with taste goes to movies anymore? Is that why movie makers do this to us? Why not have some regard for youthful intelligence and taste, too? Give us ALL some. Oh, well. Oh, Hell! -- Enough. It's on with the feature, and I take off my cap. -- Film language. The editing, the kind used during features, also comes near to hurting Angels and Demons. Closeups are vastly over used. Sure, they aid the ability to give us special effects. And that's part of the hurt -- special effects overused. --Let's try the plot and the film language which tells it. One review puts it like this: ""... and Howard's excellence in directing ... make this film so superb. It also lies in the simple things that keep characters like Hanks true to life...."" --OK, I can certainly buy that about Actor Tom, but not this example: ""... with his wearing of a simple Mickey Mouse watch ...."" --My guess is that Director Ron has so few chances for comic relief, he has to use this trite edit and 1 or 2 others. As we exited, a couple ready to enter asked. I said, ""Oh, OK. It's a commercial about religion."" And I was thinking about a lot more, including: --There are many Catholics and religious literalists in our world, and Hollywood wants their ticket money, too. So let's not offend. Wrap it up kinda like the end of Singin' in the Rain so's we wanna feel good and come back."
"Eric_Spangler","7","1","3","28 May 2009"," ""Does God exist"" is simply the beginning . . .
","""God sent you to save the church."" Science. Faith. Can they co-exist? Robert Langdon has unraveled the Da Vinci Code, and now comes face to face with Angels & Demons, a sequel that continues the adventures of the Harvard professor of Symbology with a growing knack for debunking religion.<br/><br/>The film's music, cinematography, and production are similar auteuristically with writer Dan Brown and director Ron Howard's first work; it will certainly satisfy those that are seeking a homogeneous experience. While the action was constant and moving and the plot turns kept one guessing, the story fails to move us. Still, Tom Hanks offers a convincing and believable portrayal, even if a year's worth of adventure is packed into one single day.<br/><br/>The film raises some of the same kind of questions that the Da Vinci Code raises: important questions about faith, reason, and the existence of God; herein lie the intersection of post-modernity and religion's place in today's world. Particularly interesting are the questions directly posed to Langdon about his own belief (or lack of belief) to which he responds that he has not yet ""received the gift of faith."" Near the film's end, one Cardinal makes it clear that he believes God actually sent Langdon to help the church out of it's dilemma. As this final suggestion is made, Langdon is without an answer for the first time. ""Religion is flawed because people are flawed,"" explains the Cardinal. If religion is not the answer, the film fails to answer it's own criticism with a better option.<br/><br/>Those who are curious about the Catholic Church may also find the movie interesting, as the movie depicts the death of a pope, as well as a portrayal of the drama that happens behind the scenes in order to select a new Vicar of Christ. However, this story comes with a twist. In order to catalyze the church, the pope's death is revealed to be more than it appears. Without giving away the entire plot, aspirations for power clash head on with the Vatican's sworn protection authorities. Is the age old church enemy the 'Illuminati' behind the conspiracy, seeking revenge for alleged murders by the church in the past? Or, are they simply taking advantage of an opportunity to leverage a scientific discovery of subatomic particles that may help explain the origins of life, and at the same time demonstrate the triumph of science over faith. What happens when matter and anti-matter make contact? A terrible explosion. This potential explosion throughout the film seems a perfect metaphor for the faith vs. reason conflict that is happening simultaneously.<br/><br/>A little bit of research reveals that there's a significant amount of 'fiction' (i.e. Illuminati's purpose, various atrocities committed by the church, etc) that could be misleading if one accepts the film as authoritative. At the same time, there are several points of potential dialogue that could prove productive between persons with and without faith. ""Does God exist"" is simply the beginning.<br/><br/>-ESpangler"

It's a superficially written screenplay that emphasizes the settings-cathedrals, Vatican city, Rome, etc over characterization, suspense and following the clues over anything resembling a realistic plot.<br/><br/>I thought they were respectful of the church as far's they needed to be, and really the Vatican has nothing to fear from movies like this.

The viewer is constantly wondering how the characters get to cram so much action, situations are a lot of times very unreal but the good cast (Tom Hanks and Ewan Mac Gregor especially) helps to keep the story entertaining. Well, the film is not entirely without faults but in the end it gets to deliver action, thrills and a very strong acting.

"nymovielover1961","4","1","3","19 May 2009"," What a Let Down
","In today's world, we love adventure movies-- especially if they have to do with secret societies, hidden treasures, or myths that deep down, we all want to uncover. A slough of movies have come out recently to please this facet of the public's wants: Indiana Jones, National Treasure, and the duo of the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons.<br/><br/>The craze of the DaVinci Code was well-deserved. The film had everything that adventure-seekers and movie-lovers alike enjoy. The plot was intriguing, involving, deep, well-researched, and, overall, very good. The acting was decent, more than decent for Sir Ian McKellen, but the peak was that most magnificent ending, backed by the beautiful score from Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>Now, Tom Hanks is back-- with new haircut. He has been asked to help the Vatican save the lives of four of their cardinals, as well as the Vatican City as some antimatter (shockingly enough) from the Hadron Collider. The plot is simply odd, not so deep or involving, as it's mainly all centering around the geography of Vatican City, and that's not very interesting. The violence is not the good kind (meaning the kind that makes a movie great) but it makes the film less enjoyable and thoroughly cringe-worthy. Plus, there is no amazing moment of ""Ohhhh..."" for the audience, making it not nearly the smashing, amazing success that the DaVinci Code was.<br/><br/>Though Angels & Demons was the prequel to the DaVinci Code, it was not made first. Maybe because everyone knew that the only reason anyone would go see Angels & Demons is because the DaVinci Code makes it seem like it would be great.<br/><br/>All in all, not a good call from Ron Howard. Even by Paris Hilton standards, it falls short of gigantic expectations."
"ferguson-6","6","1","3","17 May 2009"," Be Gentle Inside these Walls
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard is back jabbing at the catholics with help from Dan Brown's prequel to DaVinci Code. This time it is a full out action film and Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon shares some attitude with Indiana Jones! Italy in general, and Vatican City in particular, make for stunning scenery for this assault on the senses. The to-scale set of St. Peter's is marvelous, as are the not open to the public areas of catacombs and Vatican archives. Can't help but enjoy seeing the historic sites as Hanks and Ayelet Zurer (Vantage Point) race through the city trying to stop the massacre of four cardinals.<br/><br/>Supporting work from Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl is particularly effective, though Ewen McGregor is out of place here. Mueller-Stahl's recent history of playing bad guys certainly plays right into the hands of the filmmakers. Don't miss Ron Howard's dad, Rance, as one of the Cardinals. Sadly, brother Clint makes no appearance.<br/><br/>My preference of this story would be more intrigue and insight into the secret society of the Illuminati, and I do wish more of the Roman sites could be on display ... but this is terrific popcorn fare and will be enjoyable for most. Don't miss the amazing music playing over the closing credits."

","I saw this film last night and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I have both read and thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's novels so it was disappointing to see that Ron Howards Da Vinic Code failed to live up to the high standards set by the book. With regards to this, I expected much of the same from Angels and Demons, so it was brilliant when I came out of the cinema thinking that I had just seen a pretty good film.<br/><br/>Yes it is pretty good. Not excellent, but pretty good. The film is much faster paced than the Da Vinci Code which I feel is one of the reasons behind why I enjoyed the film more. The actors do a great job and I particularly enjoyed Ewan Mcgregor's role in the film as the camerlengo. I also enjoyed the soundtrack.<br/><br/>One of my main assumptions about modern entertainment, is that the book is always better then the film. Indeed, the case is no different here but the point I want to stress is that the film leaves a lot of stuff out and even alters certain events or details. However, in retrospect I can see that this suits the fast paced narrative and by no means does it spoil the film.<br/><br/>Just like the Da Vinci Code, this film has it's critics, but I want to stress how hard it is to turn a Dan Brown novel which excels on attention to detail and problem solving within the minds of the character's heads, into a successful film.<br/><br/>I urge people to see this film because it provides good entertainment and I left with a sense of satisfaction. I give the film 7/10."
"phrixion","8","1","3","16 May 2009"," Much better delivery than Da Vinci Code, worth a watch
","After the disappointing Da Vinci Code film. (I'm a fan of both Angels&Demons and Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown), my expectations were already low but not surprised this film was better than the first. Even though Angels&Demons was published years before Da Vinci Code. Go figure? This film delivers well as the book was written in a fashion that reads like a international action thriller touching on the intellectual and spiritual.<br/><br/>The film takes off with the development in sciences that would have significance in proving the big bang theory but a crime is committed and a sample of the proof is stolen from a large lab in Europe. As the story progresses, they realize there may be a tie to a group who claim to be the Illuminati and who are seeking to bring down the Catholic church with the truth of science. This somehow involves deeply delving into the history of the Catholic church, it's security concerns, hidden treasures and the bits of truth that may be stored away that they don't want the public to be aware of.<br/><br/>From there, the film just gets thicker and faster. Ewan McGregor does a great job and is a refreshing face in the film along with some other good names that round out the cast, unlike Da Vinci Code which had only one mode to the film. Angels&Demons is much more watchable and theatrical. The performances are much better because the book has many bigger than life characters and events. It followed the book better as in the way it didn't water down the controversy and graphic details. The Angels&Demons film is definitely worth a watch and will wash out any of the bad taste left from Da Vinci Code."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","4","7 June 2009"," Same problems as ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but slightly better
","If we learned anything from the film adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it's that Dan Brown's best-selling religion-centered mystery novels don't translate into great films. Entertaining, sure, but great, no. The dialogue gets bogged down with historical explanation and the characters get little attention because there's simply no time with all the symbol decoding. But box office receipts are another story: ""Da Vinci"" fell just sort of earning twice its budget, so great film or not, there would be ""Angels & Demons."" Not surprisingly, this film suffers from the same deficiencies despite being a bit better.<br/><br/>I have read both books and seen both movies and ""Angels & Demons"" the film is easily a notch better than its film predecessor. Unlike ""Da Vinci,"" focused on the mostly little known ideas of the sacred feminine, ""Angels"" is about the inner-workings of the Catholic Church, which requires considerably less audience educating than the sacred feminine. Writer Akiva Goldsman, who penned both Brown adaptations, doesn't have to waste all his time explaining the history/mythology as he did in ""Da Vinci"" ... only most of it. <br/><br/>""Angels"" is more of a thriller and a tad better suited for film than ""Da Vinci."" This film is a sprint from start to finish, taking place in under 24 hours and its premise is very simple: 15 minutes in you learn that a legendary group of scientists from the 17th century who were persecuted by the church have risen again and threatened to kill four cardinals every hour starting at 7 p.m. and follow that up at midnight by exploding the Vatican with anti-matter - - unless Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and an Italian anti-matter scientist (Ayelet Zurer) can stop them by decoding a set of ancient clues planted throughout Rome. The suspense comes much easier because they have to solve the clues on time or people die. ""Da Vinci"" was much less straightforward. This moves quick and is consequently more entertaining. It also doesn't hurt that the backdrop for the story is the stunningly beautiful Rome: it's more dazzling to watch.<br/><br/>As for the problems being the same, Tom Hanks is yet again wasted talent. He has the Robert Langdon look and the reputation to bring in profits, but his character just has to sound like he knows what he's talking about and spit out mythology and history quick enough so that we can get on to the next scene. Of course Hanks does this well, but anyone could. These films just have no room to develop character or elicit any emotion from the audience. At least this time, Goldsman and acclaimed director Ron Howard don't even pretend like they can create catharsis and focus on making this film as fast-paced and thrilling as possible. They succeed here better than in ""Da Vinci"" and smart artists don't make the same mistakes twice.<br/><br/>Viewers that read the books, saw ""Da Vinci"" and still didn't like ""Angels & Demons"" have no one to blame but themselves for giving in and buying tickets to see something proved not to translate well into film despite being in the hands of a master like Howard. Anyone who walks in and expects to at least be entertained by a mystery for 2 hours with no expectation of being as good of the book will find they get exactly what they paid for and maybe even find it was better than ""Da Vinci."""

","Despite all the flaws with Dan Brown's writing style, Angels and Demons was a very entertaining piece of ""detective"" fiction. Where Da Vinci Code had many scenes of sitting around, sipping tea and discussing art, A&D had a much faster pace to it, which translates significantly better to the screen. The history aspect which DVC capitalized on is surely present, but to a somewhat smaller degree, allowing the plot to stand on its own two feet.<br/><br/>Fans of the book should know it stays mostly true. Sure, you can whine about stuff like ""omg no guy in wheelchair"" or ""omg she was his daughter not his partner"", but the essence is definitely intact. One twist at the end is left out, but it felt forced anyways in the book, so I believe its best as is.<br/><br/>Still has the weaknesses of the book, but is much better than its predecessor as it is less of the ""history"" lesson (note the quotes). Tom Hanks still isn't perfect, but he's learned some of his lessons from the last one. Overall, if it looks like the kind of thing you'd like, you probably will. If not, you won't.

This didn't bother me at all, but if you are at all squeamish or thinking of taking younger children, keep this in mind.<br/><br/>All in all, this isn't the greatest film in the world, but it is one of those movies that really is better seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Michael"

","The movie is good.I have read the book and i like the movie too, because i went to the movie hall with a mind set that no one can reproduce a complete novel to a movie and i wanted to see how brilliantly the director has handled it. I was happy with the way the story has been shown and i really doubt if it can be done in any better way. But I missed the X-33 in the movie, they could have included that in it. I was expecting to see more CERN parts in the movie, but it was very less. Of course, they can not show more of it as the main story totally in the Vatican City and they shown it beautifully.Good work. I'll give 8.5/10 for this movie."

","This is terribly silly material mounted as though it was a revelation from some high-browed expose of the Catholic Church, I guess. The Church's history is certainly full of colorful, tawdry, lurid stories that really don't need a layer of ""symbolology"" veneered over it. There's very tight, well-directed movie making here, but it's all pretty silly when we're supposed to gasp that a statue's arrow is pointing in some direction to another statue that's pointing in another direction, and there's a big jug of anti-matter (science is poorly used here) boiling somewhere about to go off.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks needs to write this one off. I think he's a rare talent, but intellectual posturing isn't encompassed in those talents. The rest of the cast (save Ewan McGregor who can't wait to pull out the stops and chew the marble pillars...he does...have patience, he does) is miles above the material, as is the director and everyone else involved.<br/><br/>I won't say this is a good popcorn movie (like ""National Treasure"" or ""The Mummy"" installments which are really its companions) because it has pretensions far above that. Those aren't really made clear, but it's mounted like a million bucks, yet it's only drivel.<br/><br/>Ron Brown's books are written like movie scripts. Too bad that Hollywood thought Brown had something serious to say. It's above anything in ""Star Trek""...and in fact there are comparisons. Perhaps Ron Howard should try his turn with the new cast of the Enterprise. That might produce a really fine blockbuster."

","Of the people I saw Angels & Demons with, only 2 of us had read the book. And everyone besides the 2 of us liked the movie. I think we would've liked it as well had we not come in with such high expectations from an amazing novel.<br/><br/>The problem is how far they stray from the novel for seemingly pointless reasons. The character of Maximillian Kohler (director of CERN and suspect in the bomb threat) is completely absent from the movie. The real villain's reason for the attack has been altered so much that it doesn't even question the same issues of the religion as intended in the story. And what on Earth was the point of changing the final Illuminati symbol?! One of the most fascinating parts of the book was the artistry of these designs, and they left out the most incredible one. There are also dozens more differences that will irritate any fan of the book.<br/><br/>If you've read the book, just watch it on DVD if at all. If you haven't read it, go see it and my guess is you'll love it. I'm sure I would have. I think from now on, I'll read the book after the movie to avoid disappointment, because the books always seem to be better.

","Faith is a gift he is ""yet to receive."" But Professor Robert Langdon has done instead is merely knelt before the Magdalene and and ridden a car backwards at high speed under someone's the Jedi reflexes. Like Professor Indiana Jones, he can wave the flag of the scientist no matter what plot machinations demonstrate before his own eyes. And the audience can disbelieve right along with him.<br/><br/>One of the best story devices here is that the Vatican security office receives a live camera feed showing an anti-matter bomb that has ""artificial light"" on it so to find its location throughout the movie they shut down power to each section of Vatican City, one by one. What's not determined is whether the artificial light is A/C or D/C like the explosive device itself running out of battery power, nor how long the power needs to be turned off in each case before it can be seen on the security monitor (long enough to hold one's breath?), nor who remains in the security office to observe this, nor how they plan to view the monitor should they get around to switching off the power to the security office.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the mastermind behind this multi-layered crime had made great leaps of faith. Of COURSE you can find a trustworthy thug to transport an unstable experimental substance (which will not exist until moments before its theft) across the world and then stand on it patiently. Of COURSE even though you are using the real anti-matter bomb and have placed it where it can destroy something that you want, you have calculated the correct influence of cold on battery power and you know within a second when it will die and how far away it must be to survive a matter-anti-matter contact explosion. Of COURSE you can invite an academic into a crisis that threatens tourists of Rome and expect that he will respect the Vatican's decision to keep Roman police out of it for fear of ""world media attention."" Of COURSE he will wade through the seemingly doomed crowds with full knowledge of a time-bomb and simply tell no secular cops because he's just that kind of respectful guy. Of COURSE it is also quite worthwhile to arrange your set-piece killings according to a puzzle with clues any whip-smart symbologist can follow in time to help facilitate and witness your grand finale. And of COURSE it is worth killing the highest-ranking priests you can find when the afterlife and judgment are uppermost in your psyche.<br/><br/>They say an adventure is only as good as the villain's plan. In this case it is full of more holes than Swiss Cheese on the CERN lunch cart. I admit while reading both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I was turning the pages and feelin' smart since I knew and still know nothing about the Illuminati or secret societies and those books might either be a primer for a lot of us or the whole nut of our education on these matters. In book form, it was interesting as it unfolded. I fumed a bit about this or that, questioned some as a weather-beaten Catholic myself, but overall enjoyed the way plot points revealed themselves. I admit that the adaptation for the most part has likely made wise choices in omissions. One critic cited Langdon's joke from the book, ""Neutrinos have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic."" But that glibness couldn't just be dropped into the life-and-death scenes that survive. Sometimes the time it takes to read a page rounds out an unlikely event that would be tough to take on screen. So I can't fault the adaptation and Ron Howard made as good a movie as can be made, but as a thriller trying to be just entertainment I don't think it will hold up to scrutiny. The entertainment value ends up being the tap-dance of Hollywood's nice guys Hanks and Howard in dealing with settings and issues that super-secular Hollywood holds in contempt. If you go to the movie interested in tracking that, then it's worth sitting through. But otherwise it will be all about why an unarmed scientist feels comfortable walking into dark abandoned buildings expecting to find a brilliant and powerful murderer."

","What terrifying discovery would make the Vatican turn to Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the man who cracked history's most controversial code? When Langdon finds evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati—the most powerful underground organization in history—he also faces a deadly threat to the existence of the Illuminati's most despised enemy: the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>Upon learning that the clock is ticking on an unstoppable Illuminati time bomb, Langdon is recruited to travel to Rome, where he joins forces with Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a beautiful and enigmatic Italian scientist.

"Cinema_Love","4","1","4","17 May 2009"," Angels & Demons
","Angels & Demons sees Robert Langdon (Hanks) recruited by the Vatican when secret society the Illuminati kidnap and threaten to kill four cardinals then detonate a hi-tech antimatter bomb under St Peter's Square. With the help of physicist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), Langdon embarks on a mad puzzle-solving dash across Rome to save the day. Howard juxtaposes Langdon's frantic search with a crisis behind the doors of the Basilica - the Pope has just died and the cardinals are unable to come to an agreement on their next leader. The Camerlengo (McGregor), in caretaker charge until the new selection, aids Langdon while attempting to smooth over problems within the Vatican.<br/><br/>Shorn of his mullet, Hanks is more at ease as a thinking man's action hero this time. He's helped by Howard's improved grasp of action (no abysmal Smart car chase here) - the staging of a set-piece in the Vatican archives where Langdon must escape a room that's quickly running out of oxygen is tense and funny, and Hanks is the type of actor who can effortlessly blend the dramatic and comedic. Howard dances around location problems well (a man drowning in the obelisk fountain was never going to get approved!), though there's a hideous computerized recreation of the Pantheon's interior, which looks like a frame-by-frame Microsoft Paint compositing job.<br/><br/>There are still moments of awkwardness from the usually dependable Hanks, like when he takes a dig at the Swiss Guard and comes across like Fonzie clad in a tweed jacket (""C'mon fellas, you called me""). McGregor is lumbered with a difficult role, that of an action hero priest, but he's skilled enough to paint his character with the required subtle brush strokes. It's cringe-worthy, though, when he casually mentions how he can fly a helicopter, and is called upon to do just that in a finale complete with dreadful ""ascent to heaven"" symbolism.<br/><br/>Where Brown mastered the art of getting readers to turn the page, rocketing the story along fast enough so his plot holes and portentousness never become much of an issue, his two big screen adaptations suffer from an inertia that brings these problems to the foreground. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman, generally solid plot technicians, come unstuck with a wordy, 'tell don't show' script that insists on joining the dots for viewers instead of letting them do it for themselves. Angels & Demons never really wants to admit that it's an absurd folly masquerading as a high-brow thriller, but it's marginally more dynamic than its predecessor and will probably pass time reasonably well as in-flight entertainment."

But this wasn't his best flicks.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons -movie is VERY different from the book, and some changes I could understand, since the movie was only 2,5 hours long. But some changes could've been undone -like the very beginning of the movie. They tied Vittoria Vetra to the story with very light reasons, when the dead scientist wasn't Vittoria's father -like in the book. The story would've been much better, if she'd had more personal touch on the whole thing than just finding the anti-material.<br/><br/>And there were lots of this kind of not-need-to-do changes in the film. Also I was a bit disappointed when Langdon/Hanks didn't go to the helicopter at the end. It would've been so much more cooler.<br/><br/>And many of the original characters were gone or placed with another one.<br/><br/>But.. Oh well. I DID like the book better.

However, anyone acquainted with street traffic in Rome would tell you it is impossible to travel from The Vatican to the Pantheon to the Piazza Del Populo, back to the Vatican to Santa Maria della Vittoria, to Piazza Navona to the Castel San Angelo in the time alloted by the plot. And that was using a car. As to walking/running, the Passetto connecting the castle with the Vatican is half a mile long, and connects to the Apostolic Palace several floors below the Papal Apartments.

","As a viewer who has not read the book, I suppose I cannot judge this as a book remake, but purely as a film. Also, having not seen The Da Vinci Code, I cannot make a comparison between the two films. However, all in all I was completely gripped throughout the duration of the whole film. I thought it was fast paced and exciting from beginning to end and often found myself edging toward the edge of my seat in suspense and anticipation.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a convincing and excellent performance as Professor Langdon, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Beforehand I was not a fan of Tom Hanks, nor did I dislike him, however I found that after watching this film, I already like and appreciate him more as an actor. He brought the right amount of charm and courageousness to the role, which added likability to the film no end for me.<br/><br/>My main motive for viewing this film originally was to see the performance of Ewan McGregor and his portrayal of Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, as I am a massive fan of both his work in films and of his Motorcycle journeys with Charley Boorman. Overall, I thought his role in Angels and Demons was perfect. Although an unfamiliar role for him to play, I felt that he was completely believable, and the only fault I can express is his use of accent. His Irish accent wasn't bad, in fact in certain places it sounded completely genuine. However, from time to time, it was hard to decipher that an accent was present, other than his own. Despite this, I enjoyed his performance almost all the way through this film, however was disappointed that his character turned out to be not as innocent as first suspected. Playing the role as 'the bad guy' is something I am unfamiliar with when it comes to McGregor, and I found it almost upsetting that this was the character he was playing.<br/><br/>This film is a must see if you're a fan of fast-paces thrillers or dramas. In my opinion, I don't wish to read the book. I am usually more a fan of books than films myself, but I simply enjoyed this film too much as it is to sit and pick fault with what was changed and what was left out of the book. 8 out of ten, and buying on DVD."

","Ron Howard’s followup to The Da Vinci Code is an easy-to-follow, paint-by-numbers mystery thriller that probably would have received little recognition had it a) not been directed by Howard, b) not starred the redoubtable Tom Hanks, and c) used religion as its theme. All three elements contribute to form an overblown, frantic mess that offers little mystery.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Hanks), the “symbologist” (not a real position) of The Da Vinci Code, is again the hero here, called into action by the Vatican itself, as four of its esteemed cardinals have been, um, cardinalnapped, just as an Conclave to choose the new Pope is about to begin. At the same time, an experiment at Switzerland’s CERN research center has produced a nifty new substance called antimatter - and it’s been stolen! By, it appears, whoever kidnapped the cardinal. The antimatter’s storage container must be found before midnight, or else the battery will run out, and everyone will be doomed.<br/><br/>So it’s a race against the clock as Langdon and a beautiful CERN scientist (Ayelet Zurer) try to locate the container and save the cardinals. The mismatched duo - will they fall in love? - must match wits with some unseen wacko religious extremist, as well as the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skarsgard). They’re helped by the youthful Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), i.e., the Pope’s Helper fellow, and the chief of Vatican City’s police force (Pierfrancisco Favino) - or are they? The bad guy could be a good guy in disguise, right? Or did I just blow your mind? One thing that did bother me a lot about this movie - aside from the faceless, let’s-run-from-clue-to-clue plot device - is that for a movie that’s supposed to be peopled with Serious Folks who revere Important Things, sort of like Indiana Jones and his “it belongs in a museum!” mantra, there’s a LOT of desecration of religious artifacts, often for no good reason at all. Example: Langdon and his gal pal get access to the Vatican’s archives (of course they do) to look at one of Galileo’s original texts. The only one remaining in existence, right? In lieu of translating, they just rip a page out. Much light is made of the mysterious archives, and although I’m not remotely religious, this struck me as particularly disrespectful. Was Howard lampooning the Church, or was he trying to tell a good mystery tale? He succeeded only in doing the former, which is a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Hanks isn’t bad - better than he was in The Da Vinci Code, anyway - and his hair is less distracting here. He’s every bit as intrepid as you’d expect a Harvard professor to be in investigating a murder, which I’m sure is something that happens all the time to Harvard professors. Probably more than for Yale professors, anyway. So he’s not the problem, or even a problem. An issue, though, is that the characters are so thinly drawn. I mean, when you see two characters who seem a little dodgy, you know one of them will turn out to be not so dodgy, and maybe even a Good Guy after all. “Twists” like that can be spotted too far in advance for my tastes.<br/><br/>If you took the core plot of “24″ and stripped away most of the tension and all of the character depth and added sacrilege, you’d get Angels and Demons. The book, as they say, is a heck of a lot better than the vapid movie version, but you probably assumed that anyway. What you might not have realized is that although this book was a lot better than the Da Vinci Code book, the movie is only marginally better than the DVC on film."

Fantastic cinematography - many beautiful and awe-inspiring shots that are exciting and satisfying <br/><br/>3. Solid acting - nothing special, but certainly not distracting <br/><br/>4. Leaves the philosophical mumbo-jumbo to the book - sure, the movie adds in its little tidbits of religion vs. science but it doesn't try to make a big deal out of it <br/><br/>5. Good music - typical Zimmer stuff but very well placed in terms of scenes <br/><br/>6. Yes! moments - Howard definitely delivers the most intense/exciting scenes from the book with a satisfyingly similar atmosphere to the book; some things were obviously left out but it all seemed to work out because the movie felt like it was a good length.<br/><br/>So overall, it was an enjoyable, exciting, satisfying movie to watch. I highly recommend it! <br/><br/>N.B. Reading the book beforehand added to the effect of the movie instead of detracting from it. <br/><br/>Rating: 7.8/10"

","Angels & Demons is yet another movie which I liked very much. It is a sequel of The Da Vinci Code, but The Da Vinci Code is barely alluded to. Only mentioned as ""recent events"" or some other vague wording, but I guess that is by design.<br/><br/>Angels & Demons is very good because it deals with the murder of the Pope and the kidnapping of four Cardinals. The Cardinals are being held captive and the kidnapper has said he will execute them one at a time starting at 8 pm and then at 9, 10 and 11. At midnight a antimatter device will obliterate Rome.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is back and asked to find the antimatter container.He is joined in this hunt by Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) because she is the scientist that created the canister to hold the antimatter, and she can change the batteries of the container to prevent the explosion. Langdon and Vetra are also joined by Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) because he believes that Langdon is the best hope in finding both the canister and the four Cardinals. Carmelengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) round out the top of the character list, well except for the assassin (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who doesn't have a name or at least it is never revealed.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are fairly good scenes. The first is the scene when Langdon saves the final Cardinal from being killed. Langdon witnesses the Cardinal being thrown into a fountain to drown. Jumping into the fountain, Langdon dives under the water but is unable to help the Cardinal alone because he has been strapped to a dolly with weights. Langdon grabs tube that is pumping air into the fountain to give the Cardinal SOME air. Eventually some nearby pedestrians come to Langdon's aide.<br/><br/>The second scene I like is really a collection of scenes. I like Langdon's search for all the alters of science in or at which the Cardinals will be sacrificed on. At one time Langdon basically tells Commander Richter to, basically, help or get out of my way. Langdon also tells them all that he was asked to help by them, he implied that he would stand by or go home if they didn't give him some mutual help.<br/><br/>The third scene I liked was when Langdon enters the archives of the Vatican a second time. This time Vittoria is not with him, but Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt) is present to make sure Langdon behaves himself this time. Alluding to the first time Langdon and Vittoria are in the Archives and Vittoria rips a page out of a pamphlet. Anyway, this time when Langdon and Chartrand are in the Archives they are trapped inside one of the sealed rooms when the power is being turned off in an effort to find the antimatter canister. The power being turned off turns off the air being pumped in the room. Chartrand tries to call for help on his two way, but the room is lead lined blocking any signal. Langdon topples a large shelving unit against a window hoping to break the glass, it doesn't work. Langdon then grabs the hand gun of the unconscious Chartrand and shoots the glass, it too doesn't appear to work. Langdon climbs up on the shelving unit in frustration and passes out. The glass has been weakened by the weight of the shelving unit, Langdon and the shots from the gun, and eventually breaks, allowing air to flood in to the room.<br/><br/>There are other scenes I liked, but I won't describe them here. The reason I won't describe them here is because I would much rather you watch the movie. The script if very well written. Dan Brown's research into the practices of electing a new Pope is great.<br/><br/>I can't wait until the next Robert Langdon adventure. The next one should take place in Washington, D. C. and a couple of other places along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Unfortunately there is no information on when The Lost Symbol will be released.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars, for the storyline and all of the action."

Ron Howard undermines the movie by filming glorious artworks, Bernini's ""St. Teresa,"" for example, as if they were graffiti-covered sidewalks in a hip hop video. Howard uses hand-held cameras, murky lighting, and jumpy, quick cuts and you never really get to experience St. Peter's Square, the Sistine Chapel, or Rome's fountains, all of which serve as backgrounds for the film.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks used to be an actor I respected. Here he is scraping bottom. He looks old, baggy, and lumpy, and he isn't suited to play the intellectual-James-Bond, international sleuth in a fantasy thriller.<br/><br/>The plot is a mishmash of the incomprehensible and the impossible. There are several unnecessary, gory, sadistic scenes I wish I had never seen. The villain will be obvious to anyone who's ever seen a movie and has a three digit IQ. The movie might have been fun camp; Howard makes the mistake of treating it seriously.<br/><br/>It's no good for Howard, Hanks, and Dan Brown to protest that they don't hate Catholicism, for ""Angels and Demons"" is a profoundly hateful film that lies deeply and repeatedly in its depiction of Catholics and Catholicism as a cabal of malevolent conspirators. It's frequently pointed out and absolutely true that no contemporary, mainstream Hollywood film would ever depict members of faiths other than Christianity in such an ugly, bigoted way."

Basically all of the events happen in four or five hours and its not enough time. Add to it the fact that what the plot requires is so incredibly laughable that you really can't believe it. I have no doubt that this would work as a book where words can be used to gloss over or redirect the silliness of it all, but as a movie where its stark reality you really can't hide how dumb much of it is. So many times all that needed to happen was for one person to say something obvious then it would all collapse.(I won't even get into the fact that you'd have to be blind not to realize who the bad guy is the minute he walks on screen) <br/><br/>That said its a reasonably enjoyable film.I know that may shock you but there is enough to the story that you may very well get hooked into the tale. Certainly most of the set pieces work unto themselves (with the exception of the incident with the cops and the fountain). There are some incredibly beautiful images (the nature of which I dare not reveal lest I reveal plot points).

","Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. ."

","This film essentially begins in at a Swiss laboratory with scientists producing three canister of the highly explosive compound known as anti-matter. Not long afterward, however, one of the scientists is murdered and a canister is stolen. Meanwhile, in Rome, it is reported that Pope Pius XVI has died and upon his burial a papal conclave gathers to select a new one. But just prior to this solemn event, four of the most influential cardinals are kidnapped with clues pointing to a secret organization known as the Illuminati as the likely suspect-and their plan is to destroy the Vatican using the stolen canister of anti-matter. To prevent this the Vatican sends a secret envoy to Harvard to enlist the help of ""Professor Robert Langdon"" (Tom Hanks) who specializes in ancient symbology and might be able to decipher some of the clues left behind by the Illuminati. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code"" had more action, the conspiracy theories were even more absurd than in the original film and this tended to weaken the overall story rather than strengthening it. That being said, while this wasn't a terrible film by any means, it wasn't something a person could take seriously and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average."

","For me, this is one of the rare cases that doesn't call I-read-the-book-movie-sucks evaluation. Indeed, the screenplay cherry picks the reasonable parts of Brown's story omitting the nonsense in the book. With most action pulled by Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer's character seems like a filler for a female cast. To make things worse, Zurer acts more like a lab technician than a top notch physicist. The plot is simplistic and predictable. If you read Dan Brown's other books or saw Da Vinci code, it won't take you long to figure out the twists and the villain. Some nice scenes from Rome are the redeeming qualities of an otherwise average popcorn flick. This is not a thriller that will blow you away but will probably entertain you on a lazy Friday night."

","Robert Langdon is back with another mystery to solve. A vial of anti-matter is stolen from the LHC (Large Haydron Collider) project. The current pope of the Vatican dies in mysterious circumstances. Four cardinals are kidnapped by what appears to be the illuminati - who confirm that each hostage would be killed on the hour leading up to midnight, where, at which time a bomb (the anti-matter) would be set off - destroying the Vatican, and a large area of Italy. It's a race against time for Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) and Vittoria Vetra (played by Ayelet Zurer) to rescue the prisoners and stop the bomb. To do this they must solve century old riddles left to the through religion and literature. <br/><br/>If you've seen ""The Da Vinci Code"" then expect a lot more of the same. It's the usual book-smart adrenaline filled detective journey film that Ron Howard brought to screen, basing the content on Dan Brown's book by the same title - ""Angels and Demons"". Like the first film, some of the scenery is lovely to behold (possibly not as nice as the first film though), also like the first film - a decent cast is assembled who mainly do a good job. There were some parts which felt a little wooden and didn't allow me to connect emotionally but all in all it was harmless. I think the biggest let down for me in this was actually Ewan McGregor's character - Cameriengo Patrick). I like him as an actor, but this character felt like a let down because it was obvious from the get-go that he had his own motives. There were some clues to his character development on show but his general mannerisms from the off suggested there was more to come. Maybe it was Howard's direction that led him to deliver the way he did because he hasn't been that obvious in other films - say that, this is probably likely as there were a lot of things in the film which seemed to be dumbed down - I'm certain younger audiences could have followed along with no problems. Having read the book I know that there was a lot more to the character and there was also a lot of information, interactions and characters missing. This makes me feel that the film is 'lite' version of the book. This film is actually darker than the first ""Da Vinci"" film both thematically and aesthetically. <br/><br/>My overall verdict is that this story had the potential to be better than the first film but it wasn't delivered because it felt watered down and quite obvious throughout. 6 out of 10. It was still a simple and brainless film to watch, it's not awful - but it's not outstanding either."

","Tom Hanks carries on in his role as a Harvard symbologist. This time he's called to the Vatican because of threats received from an anti-clerical group called the Illuminati -- revenge for the way the church mistreated the Illuminati hundreds of years ago, driving them underground and almost exterminating them. (Kids, the Vatican is an independent city with its own police force and a staff of Swiss mercenary guards and is in the middle of Rome, which in turn is in the middle of a European country called Italy.) The Pope has just died and the city, waiting for the next Pope to be chosen, is in a tumult of anticipation, waving flags, setting of fireworks, punching each other out, and choking the grounds of St. Peter's. It's in this disorderly milieu that Hanks is asked to find and disable one of those ticking time bombs set by the Illuminati. The Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals from the Vatican and will kill one per hour until five hours later, when the anti-matter bomb will go off with the biggest bang known to man, beast, or celluloid. The device is hidden somewhere on the grounds of the Vatican itself -- maybe.<br/><br/>Then it gets really twisted and turns into two or three plot threads. Will Hanks exchange kisses with his beautiful Italian assistant? Who is the madman behind the plot and how do we find him? Who is the insider in the Vatican who is screwing everything up? And -- pride of place -- WILL they find that monstrous and incandescently evil anti-matter bomb? The bulk of the film is given over to the last task -- finding that bomb -- and, with only four or five hours before it explodes, everyone is forced to run instead of walk and to drive at top speed through the traffic-choked streets of the city. And the byways of Rome are something to behold. I had an encounter with a policeman who was directing traffic by hand at a busy crossroad. As I oozed past him I shouted a quick request for directions. He stepped off his pedestal, walked over to the car, leaned on the windowsill and began chatting in the most friendly manner about an uncle who lived in New York.<br/><br/>At any rate, we have Hanks and his intense female companion running from one landmark to the next, followed by the Vatican and Roman police force and Peter Skarsgaard, chief of the Swiss Guards. The clock on doomsday is winding down. Two or three of the hostage cardinals have already been branded and murdered. (One corpse seems to have been in this condition for much longer than a few hours.) In other words it's a chase movie, involving cues that I -- a humble shoemaker -- was unable to follow. I DID manage to get the reference to Bernini's marble statue of St. Teresa having a mystic experience. We actually get to see it, or a replica, and it's magnificent art work. You don't get a decent view of it or you'd be able to see down Teresa's wide open mouth into her throat and wonder how it was possible for Bernini to polish her tonsils. And hovering over her while she levitates is a smiling cupid holding a golden arrow. Instead of the arrow pointing to Teresa's nether regions, suggesting not an epiphany so much as an orgasm, as in the original, whoever has been leaving the clues has twisted the arrow in a direction that will lead Hanks and the rest to the next location. No, I didn't get it either.<br/><br/>I found the movie watchable but confusing because it's so episodic and convoluted. There were some James Bond moments that left me wondering why they were there. And the plot is a kind of paradox in that the person mainly responsible for the entire thing foils the plot without explanation. I gather this has now become another franchise. Tom Hanks, the Harvard symbologist, and an attractive assistant are called in to solve a conspiracy that will bring about a disaster. Haven't we seen this before?"

","The friend Dan Brown lined up with his poor novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" and to the heat of his success we got his second work ""Angels and Demons"" in which repeats scheme, style and philosophy, and as we all know, despite To be earlier than the first, became popular after this. Although there are those who think that the latter is better, I had enough to sink the archetypal code. So I can say nothing about the virtues of the text on the film or viceversa. What I do affirm is that what we have seen does not pass from a rather fancy gymkhana in which the tracks follow one another as a clumsy excuse to advance the plot. At first glance it may seem ingenious but if you look closely is a jumble without ton or are in which one does not find out anything. I really barely understood Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) deductions, or what led him to go from one side of Rome to another. A lot runs, I run you, fairly forced but little more.<br/><br/>Having said that however confusing the details of the investigation, what is the plot I call the first. The bad, the plans, what's behind the Illuminati. Everything, except some points of the plot that neither Ron Howard nor Down Brown could solve. And it is not to put medals but the progressive minds of these creators are simpler than they are totally useless and all the clichés that introduce are come to the league, at least for which it has some sense of smell for these cases. With this the film is not that surprising, nor that arouses much interest. To tell you that he was more concerned if Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, from Italian and Catholic, nothing, Jewish from Israel) wore shoes or boots (yes, fortunately they were the latter) I tell you everything. Of course, the scenes that are sprinkled ""Angels and Demons"" between ridiculous and laughable, entertain and allow you to laugh at your expense for how bad they are.<br/><br/>Special mention deserves the philosophy of this novel led to the big screen. On the one hand, its success, like that of the ""Da Vinci Code"", lies in a certain Manichaean and progressive vision that gives a historical pedigree to this leftist position. Light fighting against the reaction for centuries and even millennia. How cool! In this vision, the Catholic Church is the perfect target as an obscurantist institution par excellence. The fact that this approach is a bundle of delirious and pamplained memes without any historical background is the least of it. But on the other, there is a positive vision that encourages the very Church that is attacked so that steps towards a kind of harakiri in which they end up dissolving all their dogmas and beliefs. Here is insisted on the mantra of combining religion and science, as Benedict XVI says, Reason and Faith. What they do not understand, not even the Pope, is that reason and science directly destroy the Faith and what is the Own religion as we know it. I understand that an atheist does not care, but he who writes annoys this tricky philosophy as determined to rationalize religion as to end all the magic, the sacred and the supernatural that every creed defends."

","While it was a long way from perfect, or even great, 'The Da Vinci Code' was better than expected, considering its less than great reputation.<br/><br/>Despite being a box office success, 'Angels and Demons' received mixed to negative reviews, and it's not hard to see why. As an adaptation of the book, which also had some imperfections but was an engrossing and intriguing read, 'Angels and Demons' is extremely poor, with much being cut out or dumbed down, giving the film an over-simplified and over-complicated feel. On its own terms, it's just as problematic and, contrary to some opinions expressed here, inferior to 'The Da Vinci Code', sharing some of the same flaws but amplified while making more on the way.<br/><br/>'Angels and Demons' to its credit is a great-looking film, being beautifully shot with breath-taking locations that could have been utilised more. Hans Zimmer's music score is haunting and accentuates the thriller mood of the film. Tom Hanks gives his role an easy-going charm, while Ewan McGregor has an earnestness while also trying very hard to give his character plausibility (though the character has too much of the opposite for him to properly succeed).<br/><br/>Stellan Skarsgård is similarly strong, as are Victor Alferi and a chilling Nikolaj Lie Kaas.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ayelet Zurer is a charmless and bland substitute for Audrey Tautou, with little to do and giving her worthless dialogue far too much weight. Then there is Armin Mueller-Stahl's very over-acted villain and Pierfrancesco Favino who spends the whole of his screen time looking hopelessly lost.<br/><br/>The cast are not helped by their (interesting) characters being reduced to mostly simplistic caricatures, and even those not quite as badly affected are underdeveloped. Nor with a truly corny and clunky script, muddled direction by Ron Howard and a story that feels convoluted, to the point of incomprehensibility in places, and childish with plot twists too obvious.<br/><br/>People have said that 'Angels and Demons' had brisker pacing than 'The Da Vinci Code'. Personally, it was partly yes (it is in a way) but largely no. To me the pacing was all over the place, with so many convolutions and parts that feel jumpy it did feel rushed, while the middle act especially lacked urgency and instead dragged like mad.<br/><br/>Overall, not without dishonour, and with enough to prevent it from being completely demonic, but very lacklustre and disappointing, with it also falling far short of being angelic. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

"markwatney94","9","0","1","2 November 2016"," This movie made me love and visit Rome
","An exceptional film on so many levels, Angels & Demons combines an exciting and compelling story with interesting characters and some amazing visuals. The latter are, of course, due to Ron Howard's visionary direction, but to the remarkable setting as well. I regard Rome as the most beautiful city I've ever visited, where antiquity, Renaissance and modernity meet. My love for Rome, however, wasn't sparked until I saw Angels & Demons. For me there is hardly a more exciting premise than to explore all the ancient and Renaissance artwork and buildings in a fast-paced treasure-hunt. Dan Brown has a talent for weaving a twisted and involving plot around these historical events and famous sights. After seeing Angels & Demons I traveled to Rome and visited all the major locations as well as smaller ones like the Chigi Chapel and Santa Maria della Vittoria.<br/><br/>At some points, the story may appear somewhat far-fetched, but if you are willed to ignore some of the historical errors (like the myth of ''La Purga''), this film offers you not only code-solving in a scavenger-hunt, but a real historical sightseeing tour. What is truly exceptional about this movie is that the major part of the plot takes place over the course of about 7 hours, as well as at night, making for a particularly tense and dark atmosphere. In general, Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp's script even improves on the mostly already good novel, i.a. by adding a great prologue and cutting out the love story (which is refreshing to see in a big blockbuster) and some over-the-top moments like Langdon jumping out of a helicopter. The character's are mostly well-drawn, especially Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, brilliantly portrayed by Ewan McGregor whose calm yet emotional acting gets the viewer involved in his fate. McKenna is a really ambivalent and layered villain with terrible means but nevertheless understandable motivations. The assassin, very well portrayed by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, is more than the average action movie assassin as well. While he is cruel, he is shown to regret some of his deeds and to have some moral principles. It is unrealistic, though, that he can conduct the executions on St. Peter's Square and on Piazza Navona unnoticed (the latter being way too under-crowded compared to the usual Roman evening). Pierfrancesco Favino gives a very convincing performance as Inspector Ollivetti, as does Stellan Skarsgård as Commander Richter, though it isn't clear why he is so hostile to Langdon. Unfortunately, Ayelet Zurer is not that memorable as female lead Vittoria Vetra, and does not manage to stand out and show her presence on screen compared to the strong presence that Tom Hanks has. He, as usual, delivers a solid performance, with some dramatic and even some subtly funny moments.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard and DP Salvatore Totino really create a visually stunning movie with an appropriate style. Many location shots are beautiful compositions of camera movement, colors and lighting. This applies both at night – to scenes at Castel Sant'Angelo, at The Fountain of the Four Rivers and to the stunning VFX establishing shot of the crowded St. Peter's Square – and in daylight, to the aerial establishing shots of St. Peter's Basilica and the Pantheon. Other notable cinematography includes tracking shots of white smoke rising in the Sistine Chapel's chimney, resembling the Antimatter-pipe tracking shot at CERN, which underlines the film's central theme: the connection between religion and science. A major part of the film consists of fast-paced sequences, in which the arc of suspense is kept high with a lot of clever action, and Howard understands to stage that and the code-solving very cinematically in scenes like Langdon discovering St. Peter's Square and Bernini's Four Rivers are the second and fourth altar of science, respectively. Most of the exposition is given ''on the run'', avoiding it to be boring. Nevertheless, Howard does not miss to give the film and the audience time to breathe, with scenes like Langdon washing and redressing himself, emphasizing his emotional involvement in the events, and with some beautiful imagery, too, like the statue of St. Teresa slowly melting after the fire action scene. There are some sequences that do not quite live up to the rest of the movie, e.g. the whole sequence at CERN, or Langdon trapped in the Archives' vault, which – though a suspenseful scene – does not really push the narrative forward. I appreciate, however, the producers' bold choice to include the brutal, hence striking and powerful imagery of the cardinals' executions in the theatrical version.<br/><br/>Since the crew was only partly allowed to shoot in Rome, Production Designer Allan Cameron and his team had to rebuild all the great architecture and artwork. He and his Art Director recreated the sets with so much detail that the transition is hardly recognizable. The Behind-the-scenes-footage shows the commitment of the whole crew in creating this film, which was worth while, for I think the Production Design in Angels & Demons is really Oscar-worthy. The major Visual Effects shots include CGI extensions of sets that were rebuilt only partial (like the ceiling of the Sistine chapel, and St. Peter's Square) and look all very realistic and impressive. The most Oscar-worthy part of the film however, is Hans Zimmer's score. Though he did reuse themes from The Da Vinci Code, he rearranged them, and made an impressive mixture of old-fashioned choir movements with strings and modern fast-paced orchestral pieces with synthesizer elements. Particularly great music plays during the Prologue, the great scene showing the preparation of the Conclave, and in the songs ''Air'' and ''160 BPM'', another showcase of Hans Zimmer's minimalist but ingenious technique of developing a single motive into an epic orchestral climax.<br/><br/>In the end, Angels & Demons is one of my favorite movies of all time for so many reasons, and its few flaws do not even begin to matter against the merits, excitement and beauty that Ron Howard, Hans Zimmer and company put into this film."

","With the upcoming release of the new Ron Howard-Tom Hanks thriller INFERNO Sony has chosen to re-release their first two original outings together with the Dan Brown character of Robert Langdon. It's a good thing to as some may have forgotten how great those two movies were. Not only that but it makes a great excuse for upgrading from the old DVD to blu-ray formats. And of those fortunate enough to have upgraded to the new 4k format it is available that way as well.<br/><br/>I've reviewed the first film so now on to the second. This time around we begin with the passing of the Pope and a papal conclave about to begin to select his replacement. Coinciding with this is a test at the Hadron collider where a new form of antimatter has been created. One of the team responsible is found murdered with a word burned into his chest: Illuminati. In addition to that, one of the containers of anti-matter has been stolen.<br/><br/>Symbologist and religious iconography expert Harry Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called upon by the Catholic Church to assist in investigating the murder and helping to interpret the symbols being used, in particular the one on the dead man's chest. As the best expert in the field he is flown to the Vatican to assist only to find disagreement among the different security teams working there. Along with Vittoria Vetra (Aylet Zurer), one of the scientists from the Hadron collider and confidant of the recently murdered man there, the pair arrive just as a video message arrives for all involved.<br/><br/>Four members of the church have been kidnapped and are being held in a secret location seen on camera along with the container of anti-matter. As the recording plays out clues are offered as to what is to come. Langdon deciphers them to be a warning of the deaths of each and a final blow to the church to follow in the upcoming hours. But those clues also give him an idea of where to look for each coming murder and the possibility of catching the man behind it all.<br/><br/>The race is on as this film focuses not just on Langdon's knowledge but the battle against the clock as one member is to be killed each hour from 8 until midnight. Each location will provide clues to the next. All of these clues stem from an ancient secret organization known at the Illuminati, religious followers who were persecuted for thinking there could be a co-existence between science and the church who went underground. Langdon is the perfect choice, the right man in the right place to try and stop not just the murders being planned but the possible end of the Catholic Church as well.<br/><br/>While featuring the same main character this movie is like the first film only in the lead actor and the polished look director Ron Howard presents on screen. The rest is far removed from that film in that this one spends as much time showing the race against the clock as it does Langdon's attempt to try and figure out just what is going on and where. He finds himself drawn into conflicts where he has to become involved physically as well as mentally this time around.<br/><br/>Again the movie looks gorgeous. Howard has again assembled a crew that brings forth some of the most amazing scenes to watch, even more so when you learn that most of them were not even filmed in Vatican City or in the buildings there but on sets surrounded by green screens. The extra go into detail on how this was accomplished. You'd never know it while watching the film, a statement to how fantastic a job they've done.<br/><br/>Hanks is again perfect in his performance as Langdon. That right combination of awe when confronted with things like the Vatican library and the locations each clue takes him to combined with that sense of urgency as he tries to save another life is something that would not be possible in the hands of a lesser actor. Ewan McGregor as the late Pope's right hand man, now in charge until the conclave finally selects a new Pope, does a fantastic job as well. Zurer attempts to hold her own and does so but her part never really feels fleshed out.<br/><br/>As with the first film this movie stirs curiosity in the viewer making you want to learn more about the history involved and the icons on display. It pulls you in as a mystery and has you wringing your hands that the bomb is found before it goes off releasing a force as deadly as an atom bomb if not more so. And when it's over it leaves you wanting more, which fortunately we will have when INFERNO is released. One can only hope that Howard and Hanks don't make us wait as long for them to film author Dan Brown's other Langdon book, THE LOST SYMBOL. And if he write another let's hope they pick up on that one as well."

","Based on the homonymous novel by Dan Brown, this film takes the symbologist Robert Langdon in an adventure in Rome, where he will try to save the Catholic Church, and the ""Eternal City"", of the threat of an antimatter bomb. Directed by Ron Howard, the film has a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, and a cast headed by Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer.<br/><br/>Let's start with an important statement: I haven't read the original book yet, so I don't know how far the film is faithful to its story. All that I will write was only about the film, forgetting the book.<br/><br/>And I start with the skeleton of the film: its far-fetched and strange script. In fact, the whole story seems centered on a macabre plot to a certain guy can be elected pope. A conspiracy that seems hard to swallow or fully understand. It looks like that guy draws an intricate plan that, from a certain moment, depends almost entirely on luck or, at best, on good odds. And that is totally senseless. The script has several flaws and even the correlation between some artworks presented seems too forced to be credible.<br/><br/>The actors are good but could have had a more interesting performance. Although Tom Hanks has improved his performance as Langdon (he clearly had some minor difficulties with the role in ""Da Vinci Code"") and have done an excellent job, his partner, Ayelet Zurer, received a more ungrateful and undeveloped character. In fact, Vittoria Vetra always seems to be left on scene and rarely contributes decisively to the investigation, merely following Langdon. Ewan McGregor was perfectly comfortable with the role of Camerlengo, but his character ends up being the victim of the major script errors that we have mentioned. Stellan Skarsgård shone in the role of the suspicious commander of the Swiss Guard, but Pierfrancesco Favino could have done a better job if his character, Inspector Olivetti, not spend half the movie lost and without knowing how to lead the investigations. The special, visual and sound effects were excellent, especially in the final of the film. The soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, lives up to his reputation but not brings any novelties.<br/><br/>Despite these errors, the film is not too bad. Good action sequences, a very healthy suspense, the beauty of the scenarios of Rome and its artworks, combined with a story that has no dead moments, help the public to swallow the film and make it quite acceptable."

","I like this way better than the Da Vinci Code. The movie is an adaptation of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon's book ""Angels & Demons"", which actually preceded the Da Vinci Code. I watched the movie first prior to reading the book. Before reading, I thought the movie was fast-paced and coherent. After reading, I thought the movie did a great job in basing off the book.<br/><br/>Firstly, the cinematography is beautiful. The setting is in Rome and the Vatican City, and the night scenes across the city is gorgeous. I was very impressed the movie crew recreated the St. Peter's Square and many of the churches to great detail.

","Following a friend's recommendation, I started to watch 'Angels and Demons', directed by Ton Howard and starring Tom Hanks with really knowing what it was all about.<br/><br/>As soon as the movie started, I realised I had made a mistake.<br/><br/>I am not totally against 'action movies' or indeed any decent suspense or clever mystery yarn with 'baddies' and 'goodies', but it has to be really good – an Oscar winner, or close to.<br/><br/>By way of example, a recent action movie that I thoroughly enjoyed was 'The Town': a bank heist, cops and robbers pic set in Boston and it was one of the best in that genre that I have ever seen. There was plenty of drama, action, suspense, and real people with real dramatic lives, to the extent that you actually believed in them and cared about what happened to them. But in the main, most of the formula-ridden junk that the film studios churn out these days leaves me absolutely cold.<br/><br/>I read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, as it was a world-wide phenomenon, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Well, it was a clever romp with some genuinely suspenseful and exciting story lines. I know I am being elitist, but I thought the quality of the writing was pretty ordinary, to say the least. However I was sufficiently interested to view the hyped up movie of the same name, but frankly, I couldn't even make it to the halfway stage. To me, it was totally boring garbage.<br/><br/>And now, inadvertently, I was watching a Dan Brown 'sequel', complete with Tom Hanks performing a reprise role. I decided to give it a chance and watch it for a while, for something in the back of my mind reminded me that this movie was reckoned to be a much better film than the Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>It was a certainly a well-produced flick, and the 'no expense spared' production values oozed out of every inch of footage. The actors, including Hanks, were doing their best, but frankly it became very tedious. There was no chemistry between the two leading stars and there were lots of stereotypical, creepy Cardinals and other nasty Italian priests playing all the bit parts. The plot might have been fascinating in print, but to this reviewer, it was a piece of boring nonsense and the behaviour of the leading participants didn't contain one iota of credibility. <br/><br/>The story involves a sinister, murdering group of scientists, whose ancestors went underground in the middle ages to protect them from persecution by the catholic church. Then these evil men, who kidnap and kill 4 cardinals and then blow up Vatican city with a piece of stolen anti-matter was, to say the least a bit far-fetched. But in this day and age, it was just another variation on a totally unoriginal theme. I am okay-ish with unbelievable plots – even way out science fiction plots - but the characters must always behave in a convincing and credible manner. In this movie, as in so many of a similar ilk, they simply don't. There was no way to relate to them as being believable, real people - they are just comic-book, cardboard cut-out dummies, with their strings being pulled by avaricious studio producers.<br/><br/>I gave up after about one hour. Not for me I'm afraid."

I guess the producers redesigned this movie as a sequel. Well, this feels like a quasi-sequel.

A CERN scientist, Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) joins him to save four kidnapped cardinals and the entire Vatican from Illuminati's retribution.<br/><br/>The film starts at morning, and the terror begins at 8pm. Every second matters for Langdon and his crew as lives are at risk. The pace is apparently faster than ""The Da Vinci Code"". It's impressive that most of the scenes are shot at studios and not in the Vatican, as the filmmakers are probably prohibited. Also, this feels like a film that pushes the PG-13, so watch out if kids are watching.

The Vatican is under terrorist threat with four cardinals kidnapped. One will die every hour before a bomb goes off. Robert Langdon is summoned to unravel codes to prevent the murders.

Tom Hanks returns as Langdon but he is reduced to a repetitious goose chase that is beneath his talent. Ayelet Zurer is basically the film's female lead and little else. Ewan McGregor plays the next possible candidate for Pope but the role is too obvious and despite sudden twists it is still unmoving. Stellan Skarsgard is also featured as another possible guilty party but the role isn't very broad. Not nearly as suspenseful as The Da Vinci Code although equally appalling to religious folks.

","Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. Not quite disastrous, but dangerously close."

It's a race against time to not only try and save the lives of the cardinals, but also to avert the detonation of an anti-matter bomb which will destroy Vatican City. <br/><br/>In spite of The Da Vinci Code making gargantuan amounts of cash, there were many who actively hated the movie. Yet this follow up from Howard and his makers still enticed just under $500 million's worth of worldwide paying punters into see it. Ultimately it's a very different movie to Da Vinci, where that film was sombre and talky, and had a great religious hook that caused tremors in Christianity, Angels and Demons is a pacey race against time serial killer thriller. Albeit one that is still religion based and additionally topped up with some sci-fi gubbins. <br/><br/>The ticking time bomb format works well as a cliff hanger and the narrative allows Langdon and his latest lady investigator, CERN scientist Vittoria Vettra (Zurer), scope for no-nonsense detective work. There's a good solid mystery story at the heart, one which doesn't veer to being over complicated, and the production value is of a very high standard. Casting is first class, with McGregor and Skarsgard complimenting the reliable, and thankfully new haircut sporting, Hanks. It's a little draggy in the mid-section, as history comes crashing into the mix and the makers feel the need to be cerebral, and the finale is bizarre if wholly appropriate, but herein lies the problem <br/><br/>If you can judge it on its own terms, not as a Dan Brown novel recreation and a link to bad memories of Da Vinci Code (not me, I liked it well enough actually)? Then it's a film of simple pleasures. If not then it kind of goes without saying that you probably already dislike the movie! 7.5/10"

The film sort of runs on autopilot and it's an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>However, the great thing about this film is how it truly does shed a crystal-clear, bright light on how truly ridiculous and corrupt the Catholic church really is. The church apparently didn't have much to say about the film upon its release as they stated it was ""harmless entertainment"" while the President of the Catholic League stated ""Enjoy the movie, but know that it is a fable."" Their nonchalant nature spoke volumes.<br/><br/>No doubt, much of what the film shows is based on truth, I have no doubt. As all religions have already been disproved a hundred times over by science, the Catholic church and its corrupt politics and horrifying popes are no doubt worried about that one moment when science actually crosses over and disproves the Bible once and for all with no way of covering everything up again and shoving it into the archives.<br/><br/>So, the film is fine, but the light cast upon the Church is brilliant, and for that, I thank you, Mr. Howard, even if these sorts of lights apparently just continue to merely blind people instead of showing them the truth."

It was there the two knew why they were being summoned to the Vatican, and what Langdon was being shown by Vincenzi back at Harvard began to make sense. The Vatican has been receiving threats from an enemy of the past in the Illuminati which has been threatening the lives of the four preferiti (the four most likely cardinals to be elected as pope) which the Illuminati warned of killing each cardinal at each hour, one each before midnight where by then, the Vatican will be destroyed in a burst of light.

But with the success of The Da Vinci Code which brought American author Dan Brown into the wider international audience, the adaptation of the original prequel to The Da Vinci Code has been viewed as a sequel to the 2006 release of the film adaptation of the novel. The timing of the release of the film adaptation of Angels and Demons is clearly reflected in the interest in the election of a new pope, like in real life, how Pope Benedict XVI was elected. In the novel, the papal election attracts little interest. Readers of the novel will also be able to detect other significant differences in the film. The camerlengo in the novel is an Italian, and not someone of Northern Ireland origin, as Ewan McGregor's character at one time in the film explained to Dr. Vittoria Vetra of how he came to be at the Vatican.<br/><br/>As someone who has read the novel of the same name and thoroughly enjoyed it, there was a certain degree of expectation.

The acting, filming, and screenplay all attain par for the course, and most importantly, the film is enjoyable and fun to watch.<br/><br/>This said however, Angels and Demons is still far from perfect. On paper, a story like this can have ridiculous scenarios play out and still be interesting, but on the big screen, these events become altogether too far fetched, and doesn't properly capture the readers imagination. Also, the film, although a proper adaptation of the film, still neglects several parts of the novel that would have made it a far stronger movie story wise.<br/><br/>Overall, Angels and Demons is definitely a well polished Ron Howard film.

","The Da Vinci Code was a film that was far too over analytical making it slow and losing tense and pace unlike the book. Angels and Demons has an entirely different outset. It still explores the story efficiently but is more fast paced, tense and leaves room for more action and thrills. Ron Howard has expertly and correctly kept truly faithful to the book. Tom Hanks delivers another excellent performance as Robert Langdon and I was very impressed with Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and the script and dialogue is sharp and the twist at the end is unexpected unless you have read the book. This should appeal to intellects and fans of the books.<br/><br/>Obviously Dan Brown's books have stirred up lots of controversy particularly Angels and Demons among the Catholic community, which is fair enough. It can be very insulting in that sense, but as an atheist I wasn't bothered and lets face it at the end of the day the idea that any of this could happen of the Camerlengo poisoning his own Pope and using anti-matter to reunite religion is so absurd, it comes on to the extreme of preposterousness. So as a result I don't take it seriously and just see it as trashy entertainment, though it is a bit off putting that a lot of the facts Brown associates with the book as true actually aren't, but I was happy to look past it.

This might be due to trimming down some of the historical conspiracies and their meanings. While these historical ponderings were key to a good deal of the excitement and suspense that Brown created in his novels, I think they disrupted the pace of the action in the DVC.<br/><br/>With a leaner story, A&D moves much better as a movie than the DVC.

Well played and a film that keeps you guessing and wanting to know the outcome throughout.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) comes back as the symbol guru. Once the pope dies it is time to select the new pope. Tying in with a science experiment, the Illuminati has a mystery involved in it and Langdon is sent for in order to get through the clues of the event. I believe the theme is directed to secrets in high places. <br/><br/>Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) is the daughter of the physicist that discovered a destructive weapon that may get into the wrong hands. Vittoria's father is killed and the clues begin. Langdon and Vetra team up to find out the clues to discover the secret behind the weapon all while seeing how the Illuminati ties in or if it even does.<br/><br/>All while the clues are being deciphered there is a killer on the loose. This killer is linked to one of the hidden secrets of the two problems that Langdon and Vetra are trying to get to the bottom of. All together there is a lot going on.<br/><br/>Camera angles aid in discovering who is intended to be seen doing what. There were times I would catch myself noticing things outside the main characters. These things I caught helped me follow more closely what was exactly going on. The angles were not noticed until I watched the movie another time<br/><br/>This movie had me on thinking mode the whole time. Wondering why, how, and when was a fun aspect of watching the film. Camera angles and certain scenes were clues to certain aspects of the film. Sound was good and lighting was dark as stated before. Some of the scenes were darker than I would like but the way it is done it helps you focus on the shot and get only what the film maker intended you to get. The darkness plays well with the films intention.<br/><br/>This movie calls for close attention. There are secrets in high places. There are different things going on in the movie that you must keep up with for the whole movie to make sense. Overall this movie was one worth watching again and again to catch other things I had missed before."

","As a suspense film I value for its entertaining value. But on the facts of bad Italian and the picturing of Cardinals smoking and a very well shaped young priest as the secretary to the pope (a highly unlikely coincidence)who does not speak Italian well (pronunciation mistakes) and some of the should-be-Italians pronouncing Italian badly render the film a bad and unauthentic taste. Anyway as a person who studies in Italy and who speaks English and Italian, the language barrier (on the part of the actors who act as Italians) was a major flaw. Apart from that the capturing of scenes in the inner walls of Vatican was amazing and is commendable. It's almost impossible to access the inner walls of the Vatican and to be able to see these things (even if they may be wrong up to some extent-I am not an expert on it) is amazing.

","As one who appreciates the use of irony, I have to admit that it was the use of irony that really made this movie work for me. Where the original story in the series - ""The Da Vinci Code"" (which I thought it was taken far too seriously by too many of my fellow Christians) - came across as more of a deliberate attempt to call religion itself and especially the Catholic Church into question, this takes a much broader approach to the question of religion. It makes sure that some of the evils of religion are portrayed, but at the same time it's made clear that these are the evils of men rather than evils by which to judge either God or faith.<br/><br/>The basis of the story is the so-called ""God particle,"" and deals with the attempts of scientists to recreate the moment of creation. Having succeeded in that, what results is a particle of immense destructive power which is somehow seized by the ""Illuminati"" - a somewhat shady historical society which in this movie is portrayed as a quasi-terrorist organization acting against the Roman Catholic Church - and is used as a threat to blow up the Vatican during a conclave to select a new pope. This becomes a sort of Vatican cloak and dagger movie. Four cardinals are kidnapped by this group, who leave clues as to what will happen, and we discover early on that there's a limited amount of time before the bomb blows up, so in some ways this becomes a stereotypical (but well done) countdown movie, where you're pretty sure everything will work out in the end, but you're not sure how you'll get there. To unravel the puzzle, the Vatican (somewhat unconvincingly, given his history) calls upon the ""religious symbologist"" Robert Langdon (again played by Tom Hanks.) You can't really be sure who's on what side until the very end of the movie, and some of the twists that take place as the movie nears its end took me completely by surprise. I thought I had the whole thing figured out with an hour to go, but I didn't, so that was quite effective.<br/><br/>Things perhaps got a wee bit silly from the point of the parachuting priest onward, but it was decent fun, and I did appreciate the irony of Langdon becoming the one whom Cardinal Strauss concedes (over Langdon's objections) was called by God to save the church essentially from itself. I also liked Strauss's line ""religion is flawed because man is flawed,"" which seems to sum things up quite nicely. Overall, I liked this more than ""The Da Vinci Code,"" perhaps because, minus the controversy of the earlier novel/movie, I could appreciate this more on its own merits."

","Recap: The Pope has died and all the world's cardinals has gathered in the Vatican for Conclave, to choose the next Pope. But the process is disturbed, four cardinals, the favorites for the election, has been kidnapped, and the entire Vatican is threatened by a batch of antimatter, with the equal explosive force of a small nuke. The Illuminati has risen again. Despite his previous works, the Vatican police bring in Professor Langdon, to help them solve a mystery heavy with mystery, symbols and hidden agendas.<br/><br/>Comments: A sequel to The Da Vinci Code, but apart from Langdon and a few unimportant references it does not follow the previous, and can be easily watched without having seen the Da Vinci Code. What it kept is the feeling of mystery, the detective story and the intrigue. Because Angels & Demons is a very good detective story, and despite being over two hours long, the time flies by. The story is full of prime suspects, and the story is twisting its way forward. It is almost twisting too much, so that you come to expect the movie to try to fool you. Unfortunately that leads to the opposite result, the movie becomes quite predictable.<br/><br/>It is a very well made movie, Ron Howard is a skilled and meticulous director. But what this movie lacks compared to the Da Vinci Code is the visual wizardry and the tangible historical connections. That gave that movie an extra edge, lifted it to a higher level, that Angel & Demons never reaches. Still it is a very entertaining mystery.<br/><br/>If you, like me, likes stories that utilizes and builds on existing symbols and organizations, and puts them in a plausible but fictional story, you will enjoy this too.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I thought this was an entertaining movie, even if the whole antimatter plot point was a little absurd. The Vatican brings back symbolist Robert Langdom at a time of crisis. The pope has just died and the 4 cardinals that were the leading candidates to take his place have been kidnapped. An ancient society called the Illuminati has threatened to kill 1 cardinal every hour starting at 8 and they have stolen the antimatter and hid it in Vatican City and it is due to explode before midnight. As in the Di Vinci Code, Langdom uses clues associated with the various churches in Rome to find out where each cardinal will be executed. Langdom and the police run all over Rome being just a little to late to save the first 3 cardinals lives.<br/><br/>Then there is a twist with the bad guy being one of those closest to the pope. What I don't get is why did he hide the antimatter where he was because if Langdon hadn't figured out in time where it was, he would have been blown up too. And are we supposed to believe he had the whole save the day with the helicopter carefully planned out from the beginning.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's actually a movie that has a plot. It's good enough to keep your interest till the end."

","I'm not really partial to riddle based films, but I did take a chance and watch this film (Angels and Demons) the title of this film is a little misleading. Without reading any reviews on this movie, I was under the assumption that this would be about violent and scary scenes of vicious demons. That was not the case. The movie is based on riddles of the Catholic Church. Tom Hanks played his role very well. He was very convincing with the knowledge of the history of the catholic religion and the Illuminati. The way he worked out the riddles and mystery of the symbols drawled you into the story. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) a well known symbolist of Harvard University, known for his work of the Da Vinci Code of the Catholic Church, is called upon by the Vatican to solve the mystery murder of Vetra the physicist who just created an anti-matter time bomb which was stolen at after his murder. Langdon was summoned to the Vatican where he met up with Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) the physicist's daughter, to solve the riddles the thief leaves behind. Langdon is introduced to the Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) who is not impressed with Langdon and his expertise of symbolism or his feeling of the Catholic Church. I could feel the tension between them two right away, which helped peak my interest in the film right away. Langdon learns that four cardinals had been kidnapped and through the riddles that the Illuminati are responsible. Ron Howard did very well as a director of this film in including an emotional and coherent plot. When I thought I had this movie figured out, another scene would thicken the plot. I was continually entertained and stumped by the turn of events. The attention to detail with the motif was excellent. I felt the film really captured a spiritual connection with the Catholic Church and the Vatican."

"callanvass","6","0","1","7 January 2010"," |Spoilers| Not as polished as The Da Vinci Code, but it's OK.
","Angels&Demons is a film I was very much, half and half on. It looks spectacular ,locations are absolutely beautiful ,but it's just lacking too much substance. I will be the 1st one to admit that The Da Vinci Code, is a bit slow paced in scenes. And I noticed how they tried to to make the pace a lot better this time around, only it left a lot more plot holes, as a result. I have not read any of the Three Novels ,so It's not really right for me to criticize. I am a big fan of Ewan Mcgregor's, but he seems to be heavily miscast though, as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, he just seemed off. Ron Howard has abandoned the low key suspense, into a more thriller orientated film. Gone, is the know it all Tom Hanks. Instead we get Tom Hanks in ""smart"" Action hero mode, it just didn't seem right. I didn't exactly care for the big twist at the end, either. The film spent so much time, making Camerlengo to be the good guy, and the hero at the end, and well to be perfectly blunt, it left me feeling cold. The film's action at the end, is without a doubt a sight to behold. Never have I seen an explosion like that, leave such a jolt while I've been watching a film. Angels&Demons is decent entertainment to be sure, but it just didn't engage me like The Da Vinci Code did. <br/><br/>Performances. Tom Hanks is solid ,but unspectacular here. His portrayal of Robert Langondon, Doesen't have the depth that it did in the original, but he still managed to produce plenty of charisma. He's somewhat in Action hero mode here. And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it kinda seemed out of place. Ewan McGregor is miscast as Camerlengo. His accent was really odd, and he just seemed clueless to the whole shtick. Ayelet Zurer is a poor woman's Tatou. She Doesen't have the charisma that Tatou has ,and ended up giving an impression, more then anything else. Stellan Skarsgård is excellent as Richter. The man is full of intensity and unpredictability, I enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Angels&Demons is an OK film, that I personally didn't find to be anywhere near as engaging as The Da Vinci Code. The Da Vinci Code was far from a masterpiece ,but it produced more suspense and a more engaging storyline. Angels&Demons falls flat for the most part. Still there is some decent stuff here, to make this a decent rental, but not anything more than that.<br/><br/>6/10"
"eschetic-2","8","0","1","18 December 2009"," Ah, the irony! Better film, lesser returns.
","Millions of us who enjoyed the finely crafted fiction of Dan Brown'a DaVinci Code novel were sorely disappointed in the highly anticipated and inevitably successful Ron Howard movie of same. Tom Hanks didn't fit our mental image of the suave central character, Robert Langdon and like many modern action movies based on decent novels, it short-formed or omitted too many of the best loved plot details.<br/><br/>Ironical, Brown's less well crafted earlier novel Angels & Demons came to the screen as a far more satisfying film and fled to DVD far faster. Let's face it, worse novels frequently make better films, both because they may rely more on visuals and action than mental development and because there are fewer invidious comparisons to make. Hanks as an EARLIER Robert Langdon (several remarks in the film make the time frame of the story which was supposed to take place BEFORE the DaVinci Code ambiguous at least - and those who know both books will try to ignore these or face the disappointment of the negation of the relationship with Sophie) is fitter and more like the Langdon of the novels - he has to be in this far more active role. The less complex plot for Angels... has fewer ""codes"" to be missed, and the one major plot revision between page and screen actually makes more sense than Brown's original even though it allows a supporting character (the perfectly cast Ewen McGregor as the Camerlengo) to ""take stage"" from Langdon (it had to do with the well filmed helicopter climax).<br/><br/>Like The DaVinci Code and all those earlier James Bond thriller/travelogues, Angels & Demons takes us to exotic places (here in and around Rome and Vatican City) and while the set designers actually recreated a majority of them for filming, they did their job beautifully and even those of us who have been there can enjoy ravishing revisits to favorite places along with the action.<br/><br/>Of course there are the inevitable plot holes which the flesh and action films are heir to (in all probability no mortal man could cover the ground specified in the time allowed and the effect of the specified bomb is basically incalculable and fudged for effect in the film), but Director Howard and plotter Brown keep us too visually and mentally occupied to care.<br/><br/>For anyone who likes action films intelligent enough to allow thought on a higher plane than the Disney/Bruckheimer misfire, G Force, Angels & Demons is highly recommended."

","We all know the controversy surrounding this series of movies involving the Vatican and Roman Catholicism. I am Roman Catholic but I see no reason for those who are upset. This is not billed as anything more than a fictional story based on the supposed ""Illuminatti"" from the time of Galileo. Supposedly they were formed to combat, from within, the Church's stance against science which may go against old, established religious beliefs.<br/><br/>As this story begins the Pope has died and the Cardinals are gathering to discern and name a new Pope. But someone with the Illuminatti have kidnapped the 4 main candidates for Pope and are promising to kill them one at a time.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is back as Papal historian Robert Langdon and he is asked to be flown to Rome to help figure out what is going on and how the Cardinals can be saved.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a priest who was a confidant to the deceased Pope and, we find out, had been adopted by the Cardinal as a small orphan. Stellan Skarsgård is head of the Swiss Guard, Commander Richter. Armin Mueller-Stahl is Cardinal Strauss.<br/><br/>The beginning and the end of the movie work very well. Some of it involves capturing a small quantity of ""antimatter"" as the CERN Large Hadron Collider starts up. Much of the middle where they always seem to make the correct guesses, and always turn up 1 or 2 minutes before something will happen, come across as a bit tedious. Good places to get up and grab a fresh beer without pausing the DVD. But overall entertaining."

","There's something about Dan Brown and his books that make him sort of Michael Moore's best friend, intellectually-wise. With each of his works, he tries to expose a large and important area of society or corporation and make it the latest scandal or controversy. A few years ago, Ron Howard made a film about Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" and it immediately stirred controversy and heated discussion in many countries because of its views exposed towards the church, and of course, no one even mentioned the incredibly creative plot or the masterful writing, but only the religious content. Never mind that Ron Howard (who used to be one of my favourite directors) left the film almost devoid of any of the charm and suspenseful wit the book possessed; but whatever. Dan Brown's other book, ""Angels & Demons"", the prequel to his Da Vinci Code has now been transformed into a movie, with Ron Howard directing again...and that's enough to make anxious Brown fans flock to the movie theaters, biting their nails in apprehension.<br/><br/>Okay, I know that my job as a film reviewer is to review the film itself, without taking the book as one of the primordial points I should focus on, but before we go on with the review, I just have to get this out of my system: The book is an amazing masterpiece, expertly constructed and so engrossing you actually find yourself reading it all through the night and arriving next day at work with soggy eyes but a content expression. Those of you who are fans of the book and want to see the movie, be warned- it should contain a message that says ""this film is loosely based on the book by Dan Brown"", because it changes so many things and modifies so much plot that the book and the movie could at some point seem like two completely different things. But what can you expect from a two-hour-and-change film directed by Ron Howard? Having said that, let's continue the review.<br/><br/>Leaving the immense differences between the book and the movie apart, you would have to admit that the film isn't all that bad, really. Yes, we have Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the symbologist we've all come to love, who's an erudite and know-it-all respectable professor at Cambridge, and who's written, ooh, tons of books and articles. There's this gigantic nuclear lab somewhere in Europe where top scientists from around the world create the most innovative (and sometimes unbelievable) things; a short number of these scientists are working on the creation of antimatter (the opposite of matter) which could explain the origins of creation and which could become a valuable source of energy. And there's also an important event going on in the Vatican City, namely conclave, where the Pope has died and the world sits still until a new Pope is elected.<br/><br/>Then, a scientist in the nuclear lab is killed, a canister with a small spec of antimatter (which could blow up and entire city) is stolen and suddenly appears to be hidden somewhere in the Vatican City. The people who stole this powerful source of energy and destruction call themselves The Illuminati, an ancient and long-forgotten sect, who have sworn that the four principal cardinals of the Catholic church are to be executed prior to the antimatter canister blowing up at midnight of the same day. And who do you call to solve a crime and stop a terrorist plot involving a long-dead sect? None other than our dear Robert Langdon who, we're not surprised to learn, is an expert in their symbology and history.<br/><br/>Well, that's the premise. What follows is another version of the puzzle-solving, car-chasing, suspense-inducing, church-terrorizing, quick-thinking ""Da Vinci Code""...only better and more believable. At least you can rest easy knowing that Ron Howard has made this film into a truly enjoyable experience, and he has learned from his mistakes in his previous film to make this into something you can actually cheer and applaud to. The film is fast-paced but well-structured, expertly acted, intelligent and witty beyond measure. The production design, cinematography and costume design merge to transport us into a breath-taking guided tour through Rome, the Vatican City, and the people and customs involved therein. Hans Zimmer's score is fabulous, transforming his original Da Vinci score into a wonderful listening experience, at times exciting and heart-pounding, at times otherworldly and heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Yes, truth be told, I really liked the movie. Even the changes that were made from the book to screen are acceptable (because if nothing had been changed, then we would be staring at a five-hour movie, at least). In conclusion, it is better than the Da Vinci Code, it is one of Ron Howard's most entertaining movies, and an all-around fun experience at the movies this year.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4!"

Though the plot has changed a bit, there's been some juggling with characters and some plot lines have been cut out - the movie does catches the books vibe and makes a wonderful, easy in following, story.<br/><br/>And definitely, you can doubt the camerlengo's plan but you need to reconsider that the camerlengo didn't thought of an outcome of his plan: he thought he was doing a good thing - despite the cruelty of which he was aware of. The outcome of everything could've different for his sake, his only goal was to make the catholicism stronger.<br/><br/>This movie I can definitely recommend watching, if only for the exciting vibe the movie is drenched in - after all, the vatican is kind of fascinating and the movie gives you images to places you'll never be.

"honorhorror","6","0","1","1 August 2009"," Message delivered, so why worry about the effects?
","If the Joker form the Dark Knight see Angels and Demons, he may pat on his hips saying, ""why so serious?"" Actually all the commentors were complaining about the cast, the stiffy portrait of several center characters and the incomplete story that is cut from the novel...But my point is, the movie got its message perfectly delivered, so why so serious?<br/><br/>First off, the movie is quite a sightseeing trip, reflecting last year's In Bruges. Vatican is absolutely a must-go on all the tourists' list! That is what I told myself after this entertaining viewing. Despite the fact that the movie was portraying Catholics in a negative way in a absolutely negative context, the movie was still allowed to be shot in Vatican. How ironic! Anyway, I quite enjoyed the effects they put in this one, much more than I did in the first one. Davinci Code was almost entirely handicapped compared to Angels and Demons, in terms of technical sophistication, cinematographic, plot development and most importantly, pacing. In fact, the pacing alone is worth seeing for those who like thrillers. Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks and the religious fanatic Ewan Mcgregor were fun, or at least funny. <br/><br/>However, under its sophisticated skin, Angels and Demons failed to be a better mystery thriller. The more obvious reason being the plot development. Wait, did I say it's better than 1st one, sure. But it's still weak. The ultimate bad guy in the movie could be figured out almost instantly in the branding iron scene with Mcgregor, not to mention his personal show thereafter. The movie is too dark to be Indianna Jones while too professional in religious history to be National Treasure, yet it didn't have much to offer a really unique style. That's why it ended the same pale way like its predecessor. The less obvious reason is different. To make a clarification, I am not a Catholic, but a believer in Jesus. So this movie for me, should be offering some really interesting(or meaningful) perspective to offset its apparent lack in goodwill. Unfortunately, I didn't find much. Simply stating, the movie sells its plot and message in a outright way that is considered outrageous by many, and that's weighted too much to bore all the audiences(presumably all non-Catholics). The problem is it's as superficial as it's based on the writer's historical knowledge(fantasy?), which is something you can't sell twice so easily. The climax reminded me of L.A. Confidential, however with all the flat roles and outright anti-Catholic propaganda, it got tired and tasteless.The worst thing about such a novel-adapted movie is that all the retarded assumptions look more retarded live, as if Catholics is the only religion the world knows, and the election of a new pope is hotter than US presidential trial, which gives Vatican a Hollowan. It's just too clichéd to appreciate. ""Can you really give me something more detailed and solid so maybe I can scientifically prove this religious group's hyper-critic nature?That might be fun... "" The joker raised his right hand......The teacher didn't pick him. Sadly, the Joker had to make a list of messages the movie sells by himself. So: 1, Catholics(or all Christians) have a defending nature that protects all the dirty little secrets here and there, which is unforgivable for people who claim to be holy. 2, Since a pope unmanned all the scriptures some hundreds years ago for the sake of mind purity, this religion's teaching should be inhuman at all. 3, If you are a charity group as well as a bank, you are naturally a hypocrite. 4, The highest ranks of Catholics are a mess, since they can't overcome their superstitious/exaggerating nature that is dwelled in their faith and directly produced their hypocrisies and murders and all the worse-than-ordinary sins. Ah, please remember they did this one in special favor to the writer and director of ""Angels and Demons"" the movie. See you next time.<br/><br/>OK, if anyone tells you he hates/loves this movie by its messages, do notfight him. Just say you respect any given religion or philosophy, and the problem should be solved. Good luck!"

Even for died-in-the-wool Randians[1], there's more to literary or cinematic life than ""plot, plot, and plot.""

","Tom Hanks reprises his ""Da Vinci Code"" role of Dr. Robert Langdon in ""Angels & Demons."" This time around, the puzzle Dr. Langdon has to solve is the location of the Church of the Illuminati (hidden somewhere in Vatican City), and he better find it fast, since a bomb hidden in the Church is set to go off at midnight, destroying Vatican City. <br/><br/>Mixed into the main plot line is the usual Catholic Church intrigue, a deadly assassin, and Ayelet Zurer (playing a scientist) as the female lead.<br/><br/>At its heart, the story is a ""whodunnit"" no different than any usual episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"", except the stakes are bigger, production values are higher, and we get Tom Hanks playing the role of the unflappable mystery-solver.<br/><br/>Even though the movie doesn't push any boundaries creatively and the plot is completely ridiculous, ""Angels and Demons"" is an exciting, involving movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. The reasons it works are: 1) Ron Howard's kinetic direction; 2) the movie never lets up, there's always something happening; 3) great production values and locations; and 4) Tom Hanks<br/><br/>Because of the pace of the movie, you don't really notice how silly the plot is, and even when you do, you ignore it because the movie is so well made. In other words: yes, it's a silly movie, but relax and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>If there was an Academy Award for ""wrenching an exciting movie out of not-so-great source material"" then Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and crew would win it for ""Angels & Demons."""

","No one really knows what happens when antimatter and matter meet. It is possible that a fizzy interaction layer forms, which limits the annihilation rate. This is similar to putting a drop of water in a pan to see how hot it is - if it is at the right temperature (700 to 800 degrees F) it will dance around. A lower or higher temperature will make the drop evaporate much quicker. A layer of steam insulates the drop from the heat below. This is how people can walk on glowing coals. So while the antimatter is completely consumed, it may not have the big, quick explosion that people assume. The reaction could still be dangerous, though."
"avcho","7","0","1","2 July 2009"," Surprisingly Fun but not what i expected
","I went to see this movie without any high expectations(since The DaVinci code did not impress me that much). I haven't read the book so my comments are strictly about the movie and it's script. To be frank i love the subject matter and all kinds of conspiracy theories related to the Church, the Vatican,secret societies etc. Well, the movie did not amaze me in this aspect, since it was more of a fast-paced action-thriller then a real conspiracy movie. If you expected a rich storyline which would interweave facts and fiction about the Illuminati, their secret acts and their hundreds years old struggle with the Vatican you might be disappointed. However, if you can enjoy a quick-paced thriller which is not trying to be the smartest movie you've seen and you can enjoy a movie that would require some suspension of disbelief for the sake of entertainment you might find that this is an above-average movie. All in all that was not what i expected but it was a fun ride - better then the most movies of it's kind that Hollywood keeps pumping out every year. I would rate it somewhere between 6 and 7 for the entertainment value."

","I remember reading the Dan Brown book about four years ago now, and here I am watching the movie. First things first, let me just say what a remarkable job the director and writer did keeping everything true to the original novel, with only a few things that I can remember not being here - quite a remarkable feat, and between this and Watchmen, 2009 is truly a year for great book-to-movie adaptations.<br/><br/>However, really this is just a standard action movie otherwise, as it isn't really pulled off with enough gusto to really remain captivating. The acting is passable, the directing is passable...everything is just rather adequate. It is a lot of fun at times, but it's also a bit boring at times - possibly reflecting here on Dan Brown instead of the screenwriters? Whatever the cause, this movie is a bit of a mixed bag between good stuff and stuff that will make you want to fast forward a bit. Angels and Demons may not be a genre transcending movie but it is a lot of fun, and if you're looking for a summer blockbuster...well, really, I guess you could do a lot worse than this."
"creedreaper","8","0","2","24 June 2009"," Spectacular Movie but Not as phenomenal as The Da Vinci Code
","First off do not compare the two movies because it's useless as both were extremely well written and well directed. Angels & Demons had exactly the kind of content I was hoping to see. Although The Da Vinci Code had more mystery this one had more action sequences. Mixing modern Science with ancient history was a brilliant concept. Tom Hanks needs to be applauded for such an amazing acting. He's the reason both movies did so well. I love watching religious mysteries especially in Vatican City especially when it involves the teachings of Pope. I'm not catholic or anything and yet I find it so interesting. I really hope to continue seeing such movies in future."
"varun-mentor","8","0","1","12 June 2009"," Mixed reactions! A&D had some good stuff indeed!
","Let me put a perspective on the movie from a non dan brown reader standpoint.<br/><br/>A&D starts with Pope's demise and a series of mishappenings calling for Langdon's entry to demystify the mishappenings and save the Vatican from catastrophe of Antimatter annihilation suspectedly stolen from CERN.<br/><br/>No prizes for guessing, Langdon saves the Vatican single handedly by solving all the clues leading towards unearthing the biggest scam in Vatican history.<br/><br/>The best part of movie which gave me goosebumps sitting in theater was the breathtaking cinematography. Ron howard's work at its best in capturing the pristine beauty and splendor of various basilica, chapels etc of Rome, Vatican. Story was indeed highly predictable, a racy Hollywood thriller, the movie was very well tightly held but the plot could have been a bit deeper and real.<br/><br/>Like the most stupid scenes being one single assassin killing entire group of police officials to execute entire plan on his own. And then after battering every thing that moves, he lets away hanks and zurer quoting stupid reason like you are not carrying weapon so i wont kill you etc.<br/><br/>Nevertheless with all the flaws this movie had, i felt in the end, the climax came about to be extremely gripping when you felt movie was about to end and I was about to leave theater after Mckenna was about to selected pope and then twist comes in and langdon again comes to the rescue was very interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, there could have been improvements in the film as standards set by ron after giving us legendary films like Beautiful mind (probably the best films ever made and most underrated) and Cindrella Man (another underrated but awe inspiring movie) suggest. But overall the movie was good and i liked it and am gonna think of it for next week or so. 8/10"
"barrys82","8","0","2","13 June 2009"," Better than The DaVinci Code
","Angels and Demons is the adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown , the same person that wrote The DaVinci Code and as well as he DaVinci Code it is directed by Ron Howard and with Tom Hanks in the leading role. This one is way better the the previous one but it isn't that great to impress. Angels and Demons is a very well structure thriller with lots of action, adventure and suspense. It has a fast rhythm, a convincing and interesting story, although I think it has some holes that if you're not paying attention you will get bore very easy.The digital effects are extraordinary that in some way compensates the lack of story. The locations are excellent, maybe the best of the movie. Watching every street, every corner and every church of Vatican City is really impressive and interesting. The cast is really good. Tom Hanks repeating in the role of Robert Langdon, in this second movie he is more an action hero than a respectable scientist but still a very good performance. Ewan McGregor was excellent as Camerlengo McKenna, it was a very powerful performance and Ayelet Zurer was good but with very little presence. In conclusion, Angels and Demons is a decent thriller you will enjoy."
"patricklorenz_ba","6","0","2","28 May 2009"," Not very illuminating
","Over here they call this flick ""Illuminati"" which could be translated with 'enlightenment'. That's pretty ironic because ""Angels & Demons"" will enlighten a lot of people. But certainly not in a way Hollywood will prefer. ""A & D"" is supposed to be a thriller. Maybe a clerical one. But nevertheless. By definition a thriller is a ""book, film, or play depicting crime, mystery, or espionage in an atmosphere of excitement and suspense."" Well, it's a film. And it's depicting crime and with some good will even mystery. But where's the atmosphere of excitement and suspense? Shaking the camera and staccato cutting doesn't create excitement or suspense. Full stop. Maybe excitement to a certain extent but this kind of excitement only makes you ask yourself whether you are willing to punish your senses by watching this images or just turn away. But not under any circumstances one would call this flickering suspense. Not at all. The only suspense the makers created in ""A & D"" is the ultimatum which runs out at 12 pm. So what? This is it? We're really supposed to believe that Tom Hanks along with St. Peter's Square and Rome will be blown away? Ridiculous. Don't get me wrong. The idea itself isn't ridiculous. It works as initial situation. But not as suspense creating momentum for over 2 hours. But that's all some overrated Director and Screenwriters can come up with? Oh, I forgot the chamber scene. Very suspenseful! Because the oxygen is running out. But luckily Langdon is intellectual enough to shoot the glass. I'm impressed. That's pretty clever and consistent story telling. It's a shame! I don't even want to write about the third act because it's simply too bad. What remains is an enlightenment in form of a worry. The worry that the Hollywood guys don't remember how to make a good movie for people who actually want to think about the seen or even discuss about it. This isn't even a popcorn movie because every single corn of your bag has more substance."

","ANGELS & DEMONS Director: Ron Howard Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 138 Minutes Rating: PG 13<br/><br/>Everyone has heard the age old adage 'Lightning never strikes twice.' That's almost doubly true when looking at the work of an author, or indeed a film maker, who has created a piece of work that has set the public's imagination on fire. Whereas SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was in turns terrifying and electrifying, the sequels have been mostly damp squibs. And while there's no denying the box office clout of the more recent STAR WARS films few of even the most die-hard fans would dare claim that the films had as huge an impact as the earlier trilogy.<br/><br/>Which brings us neatly to Dan Brown and ANGELS AND DEMONS! Brown's earlier novel THE DA VINCI CODE most definitely set things on fire. It even set itself on fire as right-wing Christians insisted on holding book-burnings! Such draconian measures did little to stem the success of the book and if anything the publicity brought the book even more attention. It was a monumental success and Ron Howard's 2006 film of the same name was equally successful, at least at the box office, earning a colossal three quarters of a billion dollars around the world. It's very difficult to replicate that kind of success.<br/><br/>The team behind that global phenomenon return for the highly anticipated ANGELS & DEMONS, which is once again based on the best selling novel of the same name by Dan Brown. Ron Howard directs and Tom Hanks returns as the hero, Harvard Professor, Robert Langdon. In the earlier film Langdon went head to head against the Catholic church and in so doing revealed a closely guarded secret.<br/><br/>This time out, however, the tables have been turned somewhat and the Vatican desperately need the help of Langdon because he has discovered evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret society, which are known as The Illuminati. They are, according to the film, the most powerful underground organisation in history and are a deadly threat to the existence of their most despised enemy, The Catholic Church.<br/><br/>When Langdon learns that the clock is ticking on an unstoppable Illuminati plot, he travels to Rome where he joins forces with the beautiful and enigmatic Vittoria Vera, an Italian scientist. They embark on a non-stop, action-packed hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on the planet! Together, Langdon and Vetra, follow the four hundred year old Path of Illumination that marks the Vatican's only hope for survival.<br/><br/>ANGELS & DEMONS is guaranteed to be box office gold. If only one in three of the people that saw the earlier film go to see this it will bring in a quarter of a billion dollars and that's not bad! As a movie, however, it doesn't quite live up to expectations. So as code-cracking movie it's a little long and not all it's cracked up to be! Tom Hanks, however, is never less than watchable and the movie meanders along at a relatively enjoyable pace. Not great then but not too bad either."

","After reading the book I was looking forward to watch a movie that did not preach ""praise the lord"" to me, which Hollywood movies usually do. Well, this movie (too) preached ""praise the lord"" to me. Normally I just ignore it, but this move was supposed to be based on a book with a quite different message.<br/><br/>I got my first bad feeling when the scientists at Cern where portrayed as careless, clueless, risk-taking, irresponsible children. I thought, hey wait... this is completely opposite to what the book is all about. And it got worse. Much worse. Langdon suddenly is a believer (deep down inside... yeah right), and the only bad thing the church ever did was mutilate statues and kill four suspicious scientists some hundred years ago; everything else is skipped, and replaced with religious moral speech!! The mixed emotions you get in the book are replaced with carefully labeled good guys and bad guys.<br/><br/>Yes, it disappointed me!<br/><br/>Besides from that, it is a good action movie. Not super great, but absolutely not bad in any way. The plot turns about the same way as in the book, and it is all very exciting and high-paced.

","Don't be fooled by the first couple hundred comments here; nearly all of them came from people who 1)were involved with the film, 2)are Dan Brown ditto-heads, and\or 3)spent about $10 to see this in a first-run theater and do not want to admit they shelled out so much to see such an insincerely manipulative movie. The purpose of my comment is to help you decide whether to 1)rent this the first week it's out for one night at $2.60, 2)wait until you can rent it for five nights for a buck, 3)wait until you can rent it for five nights, two-for-a-buck, 4)wait until you can see it for no extra charge from your TV provider(s), or 5)skip it altogether. (I will guarantee that those people who choose options #2 through #4--that is, who invest $1 or less in ANGELS & DEMONS, will be unlikely to rate this even as high as I did, at ""5"" out of 10.)<br/><br/>I watched every excruciating minute of ANGELS & DEMONS' 2:18:27.26 running time (with my better half, on two free passes from the local radio station, for which we waited another hour). Ron Howard (I will NOT blame Dan Brown for this) violated several cardinal rules of movie making: 1)sure, you can have a surprise bad guy, but you CANNOT ASSUME every movie-watcher has read the novel, and stick in the twist nine minutes from closing credits with NO foreshadowing, thereby capriciously negating the hero-building mood you worked so hard to establish for the first two hours of your film, 2)you cannot stuff more wrong-headed incidents of people simultaneously displaying I.Q. disparities of 10 and 200 (that is, people being geniuses at placing themselves as totally secure evil masterminds while at the exact same time lacking even an insect's sense of basic self-preservation) than all seven seasons of the TV show ""24"" combined, and 3)if you're going to vandalize the characters of your lead actors as well as a good portion of the world's intellectual and art treasures, you cannot do it in such a casual, throw-away manner (unless you're making a farce such as MARS ATTACKS!)."
"luket","4","0","1","19 May 2009"," Rehashed novel fails on many levels
","I think it would be fair to say that the impressive cast was attracted by the equally impressive pay-packets they were undoubtedly offered as well as the chance to partake in a movie that will deliver at the Box Office.<br/><br/>I am not somebody who likes to constantly compare literature to filmic adaptations as they are stand alone art of different mediums and as such deserve to be judged on individual merit. However, it is impossible to read 'Angels and Demons' and not be frustrated by the alterations that have taken place in adapting the novel for film.<br/><br/>After reading the novel I believed that the film would be significantly more successful the the Da Vinci adaptation for the primary reason that the novel is not as focused on theological details that were lost in the adaptation of The Da Vinci Code. The pace of the novel is also more suited to adaptation and the setting of Rome had the potential for incredible cinematography.<br/><br/>Before I define why this film is worthy of a 4/10 rating I will say that the film was well paced (as it should have been), Tom Hanks was likable as Langdon (despite initial casting concerns) and the powers that be graciously decided to omit Langdon's farcical helicopter dive towards the end of the novel (why on god's earth did Dan Brown include this pathetic episode in an otherwise decent book). That being said, the film, as an adaptation fails on so many levels.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book I would argue that you will not leave the cinema demanding a refund, but those who have read the book will be hugely disappointed by an opportunity missed to create a really decent Dan Brown adaptation.<br/><br/>Tonally the film was vacant,but deep down with Hanks and Howard involved, fine craftsmen as they may be, it was never going to the dark and sinister thriller it should have been.<br/><br/>I was however, deeply frustrated by the unwillingness of the director/producers to opt for a riskier but longer run time that would allow the novel to be more honestly adapted. The Langdon/Vetra love interest was rightly omitted - I don't think anyone would say it had any impact whatsoever in the novel, but unbelievably they chose to omit 99% of all the background information that made the characters interesting and motivated - Vetra's relationship with her adopted father paralleling the relationship between Camerlengo and the diseased pope.<br/><br/>The conflict between science and religion was addressed in the loosest terms and sadly the CERN narrative was completely ignored, leading to a not so clever twist and bland storyline. Where was Kohler, one of the most interesting characters in the book? Why did they decide to rewrite the assassin of 'Hassassin' character. His physical presence, fanatical stance and twisted morality was an ominous presence in the book and yet the powers that be decided that he would be better written as a 'bit character' from 24 - a 'gun for hire' - SERIOUSLY WTF!!!!!!! They also decide to rewrite the character of Olivetti in a bid to relieve the film of any interesting, conflicted characters that might offer any element of tension. I actually left the theatre angry at the fact that supposedly 'professional people' allowed the film to be made in this way.<br/><br/>Maybe worst of all is the dialogue. If I another Dan Brown adaptation hits our screens with the characters explaining their thought processes to the person standing next to them, I may be forced to punch the screenwriter. People DON'T talk like that!<br/><br/>With background, non existent, character diluted and a pretty shady script, 'Angels and Demons' will be just another box-office hit with no substance. Sadly, it could have been so much more. This had the potential to be the best of all the Dan Brown adaptations and I am sad to say it is an opportunity missed. The 7/10 rating will probably remain, but, it will not be on merit! If the Vatican interests you watch Godfather Part 3 as Angels and Demons is certainly one you can afford to miss."

","OK, so having read the reviews excoriating this movie I allowed myself to be dragged along to to see it with low expectations. I have now realised that Irish Times journalist Donald Clark is in fact a reverse barometer. He gave it 1 star out of 5. OK so it is not 5/5 but it is a respectable 3/5 and an amusing way to spend a couple of hours, even exciting. It is in fact much better than the Da Vinci Code mainly because it has better pacing, some genuinely exciting scenes and it is better visually. <br/><br/>It is a chase movie and like the airport book it was inspired from, it is pretty vacuous abusing the disciplines of history, physics and logic in equal measure. But it's fun. You don't go to a movie like this expecting a watertight plot or expecting a message to humanity. You go because you want a bit of entertainment and popcorn. You don't expect the hero to die, you know he will save the day in the end. But so what? When you go on a fairground ride you know how it will end, but you expect thrills none the less. <br/><br/>And if you are a physicist who is offended by scientific impossibilities, then you are in the same class as the religious types offended by the Da Vinci Code, unable to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Does what it says on the tin."
