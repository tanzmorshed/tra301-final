","So many people have complained about the Gertrude Lang character (Alicia Witt), Holland's interaction with her, and the purpose of the character, and I am simply amazed at the hostility.<br/><br/>1) ""Playing the sunset"" was Holland's way of getting Gertrude to relax so she could play the notes fluidly. They both knew that she didn't sound professional, and wasn't going to. The idea was to get her just above the level of making a fool of herself as she did the first time he called on her in class. Then she could, and did, perform in the band without dragging down the whole ensemble.<br/><br/>2) Her goal was not to be a professional musician. Did no one else hear her speech about ""I just wanted to be good at *something*""? She listed all the fabulous achievements of her parents and siblings, and concluded, ""I'm the only one who's..."" The missing word would have been ""useless"" or ""worthless"". Or ""a failure"". Thirty years later she's the governor (not the mayor!), because in 1966, Holland helped her gain confidence for the first time.<br/><br/>3) She wasn't ""wasting"" Holland's efforts by going into politics. Art, music and theater education don't exist solely to create professional artists, musicians and actors. They also exist to give young people an opportunity for change and growth, even if they never use a paintbrush again.<br/><br/>I liked that plot twist. Almost every high school has an alumnus who has achieved something in art or entertainment, but a lot of people sell one painting or appear in one film and become a hero to their home town. But there are only fifty states, and it takes an extraordinary amount of drive to become governor of one of them. It's unlikely that she would have taken that first step towards empowerment without Holland."

","The first time I saw this film was in the movie theater with one of my best friends--both of us musicians. By the time we left, both of us were bawling our eyes out. This film is very touching and well done. Granted, there are accuracy errors (every film has those) and I've noticed several complaints about the music in the final scene (why are people so nitpicky?). I had a band director much like Mr. Holland when I was in middle school, a man who struggled at first as a teacher but soon became a beloved and inspiring director. Every time I watch this film I think of that man, and how he changed my life for the better. It's a movie I can truly relate to.<br/><br/>Okay, enough reminiscing. :P If you want a film that will tug your heartstrings, this is it. Rating 9 out of 10."
"bppihl","Null","32","35","1 August 2004"," Great story with challenges and rewards
","I remember seeing ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for the first time in high school. I liked it then, and still do. Films about teaching often involve tough kids and less than ideal teachers, among other things.  I have to say this film is an exception. Mr. Holland is an inspiration in so many ways that he does not realize or even want to acknowledge. It is also a story that could have taken place and that some people can relate to.  This is why I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland has a dream of composing a very memorable and moving symphony, and to ultimately be ""rich and famous."" But working odd jobs in pursuit of his dream doesn't appeal to him. Reluctantly, he takes a day job as a high school music teacher to support the family and at first hates it. His students are not motivated to learn through readings and tests, and do not respond well to the music of Bach. When he finds they love rock and roll, he integrates this into the curriculum, much of the disapproval of the administration, who believe ""rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline."" He teaches and mentors many students over the years, from a clarinet student who doubts her talent and feels inferior to her musically talented family, to a wrestler who becomes a drummer, and a talented singer with her eye on him who wants to go to Broadway despite any barriers. Whether or not he knows it, Mr. Holland inspires them to do something worthwhile.<br/><br/>Despite his love and talent for teaching, Mr. Holland cannot develop this same level of rapport and love with his wife Iris and son Cole, who is deaf. His desire for Cole to appreciate music is outweighed by Cole's inability to hear and his father's reluctance to help him. Cole learns sign language from his teachers and mother predominantly. Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind, and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually, though, he learns to accept and deal with these challenges, and becomes more loving and appreciative. <br/><br/>I recommend ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for musicians, singers, music teachers, and really everyone. Enjoy the show!"

","It's a MOVIE!  I'm reading comments so vastly polarized to one extreme or another so as not to be believed.<br/><br/>Okay, I am a musician.  I've been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer.  And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious 'serious' musicians out there).  I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.<br/><br/>Is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS musically accurate?  No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.<br/><br/>Designed to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd?  Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood.  It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned ""Play the sunset"" scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.<br/><br/>And if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland's 'opus' only being ten minutes long (the ""It took him a lifetime to write THIS?"" mantra) I think I'll scream.  Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work?  Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS!  It's entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece.  Think outside the box, people.<br/><br/>As for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I've ever heard.  But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can't say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more 'educated and refined' musician types that have posted here.<br/><br/>Sure, there were some flaws.  Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing.  William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion.  The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.  And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.<br/><br/>But overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss' best, and one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>I'm a musician.  And I liked it.  So sue me...."
"Tito-8","10","54","65","6 May 1999"," Excellent film, with even better music
","Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding (as is the whole cast) in this thoroughly enjoyable film.  I really liked it the first time, but with repeated viewings, I'd say that this film got even better.  It's a little predictable, but so what?  For me, it was impossible not to care about these characters, and the ending was the perfect heartwarming note to go out on. It was rather funny as well, but my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.  All-in-all, this was a completely satisfying film, and I would call it a must-see."
"macpherr","10","46","55","22 April 1999"," Richard Dreyfuss is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.
","The writing of this movie by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Nick of Time), nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Awards, is one of the best stories that Hollywood ever put on the screen. The sensitivity and perception of the Director Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) adds a special touch to the story.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, The Competition, The American President) was  nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for this role, which is my view one of his best performances. He is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.  I seldom cry while watching a movie,  but when Mr. Holland enters the school auditorium with grey hair and the entire school is applauding when he retires, it makes me cry. I cry every time I watch it,  and I can also cry every time I bring it to mind. If I ever get a part where I have to cry all I have to do is to bring back that memory back!  That moment is a combination of my mother a music teacher and my dad aging. There is no greater love than to lay your life for another... When I graduated from college I wrote a letter thanking my parents for the rainy days they had to go to work,  and for all the sacrifices they made for me and left it on top of the dining room table so they could find when I was not around.  Needless to say that the entire family cried. That is what that scene means to me. I do not see Mr. Holland as a frustrated composer, he was just frustrated because he had other commitments that did not give him the time to compose. Glenne Headly did a great job playing Iris Holland. She has appeared in ER recently. Olympia Dukakis (Steel Magnolias) plays  Principal Jacobs. It is beautiful when close to her retirement she gives Mr. Holland a gift.  Jean Louisa Kell (The Day Lincoln Was Shot) is Rowena Morgan who steals the show because she sings beautifully. William H. Macy, (Fargo) plays Vice Principal Wolters who goes insane when he listens popular music coming from Mr. Holland's classroom. Poor Gertrude Lang,  Alicia Witt (""Cybill"") is trying so hard to get the technique that she forgets about her feelings. I love when she finally gets to feel the piece and lets herself go.Then when she comes back as grown up is very touching. A music teacher having a deaf child is ironic. Mr. Holland  teaching the kids about Beethoven is marvelous!  I love when Cole (Anthony Natale (II)), comes back as an adult and participates in the celebration of his dad's retirement, and also because he himself is going to teach at the school for the deaf in Washington DC. This movie struck a cord with me because of the music and because of all the elements that were brought into movie and story. I would give it a10 + if I could. It is one of my favorite dramas! I am not much of a drama person, I prefer comedy, but this is a very special drama."
"slymusic","Null","9","9","30 June 2009"," ""What an auspicious beginning.""
","""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is the story of a musician whose passion in life is to compose great music. But in order to provide for his wife and son, Glenn Holland must take a post as a high school music teacher, which is seemingly the last thing he ever wanted to do. In the thirty-year period of which this story takes place (mid-1960s to mid-1990s), Mr. Holland discovers through his struggles, little by little, student by student, that he indeed has what it takes to become a great teacher and mentor. He applies the entire history of music (""from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock-and-roll,"" as he expresses it) in order to help his students learn to appreciate what music is and what it has to offer to the world. Of course, Mr. Holland faces some hard challenges along the way, namely the fact that his numerous teaching responsibilities take him away from giving his son, who has a ninety-percent hearing loss, the attention he desires. In the end, when all of the arts programs get dropped from the school curricula, Mr. Holland believes that all of his teaching efforts have been for nothing. It is then, and only then, that he realizes how much of an impact he has actually made on the entire community.<br/><br/>The casting of ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is terrific. Richard Dreyfuss was THE actor for the leading role of struggling music teacher Glenn Holland, who experiences life with all of its joys and sorrows through music. Glenne Headly is wonderful as Mr. Holland's loving, reasoning, understanding wife Iris. I highly admire Jay Thomas as phys ed teacher Bill Meister, who strikes up a lifetime friendship with Glenn right at the start of Glenn's teaching career. Not to mention Olympia Dukakis in her top-notch portrayal of principal Helen Jacobs, William H. Macy as vice principal Gene Wolters, Alicia Witt as struggling clarinet student Gertrude Lang, Jean Louisa Kelly as the lovely soprano Rowena Morgan, and Terrence Howard as athletic star/drumming novice Louis Russ.<br/><br/>Here are my personal favorite scenes from this heartwarming film. Mr. Holland shows his first signs of success when he convinces the self-conscious Gertrude Lang that playing music is meant to be enjoyable and is ""not about notes on a page""; with this in mind, Gertrude shuns her music stand, closes her eyes, and ""plays the sunset"" on her clarinet. Until Rowena Morgan makes her first appearance, the various singers who audition for the upcoming Gershwin revue prove themselves amusing in their interpretations of ""I Got Rhythm"". A tense moment in the Hollands' household occurs when their little boy Cole, deaf and with virtually no communication skills, has difficulty showing his mother what he wants from the cupboard. Rowena sings a beautiful version of ""Someone to Watch over Me"", with the orchestra conducted by Mr. Holland, on the last night of the Gershwin revue. Shortly after learning that his son is deaf, Mr. Holland is almost in tears as he describes to his music appreciation class the agony of Beethoven's deafness. Following the assassination of musician John Lennon, Mr. Holland sings a nicely orchestrated version of Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" and dedicates it to his own son Cole, now a teenager (Joseph Anderson); from then on, Glenn shares a much greater rapport with the forgiving Cole. And finally, Mr. Holland cannot fight back the tears at his high school's surprise celebration of his thirty years as the music teacher; his former student Gertrude Lang, now a governor (Joanna Gleason), makes him aware of all the lives he has touched: ""We are your symphony, Mr. Holland. We are the melodies and the notes of your opus, and we are the music of your life."" <br/><br/>""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is a film that I believe offers hope to the many people in this world who are forced to take day jobs for which they have no high regard. As this movie progresses, we come to understand how fortunate Glenn Holland's students are to have him for their music teacher."
"bob the moo","Null","33","41","11 May 2003"," Good story for the unsung heroes of life  touching without being sickly sentimental
","Glenn Holland is a young composer.  In the fifties he stops touring with his band to teach music in a school which he hopes will free him from touring to allow him to work on his main love of composing his own music.  Despite initially hating his job, Holland soon learns to enjoy it and how best to communicate the love of music to his pupils.  We trace his life over 30-40years as he has a son with his wife and goes through great emotional times while putting his personal dreams to one side.<br/><br/>Although this had `sentimental life lesson film' written all over it, I still wanted to give it a go and strangely still enjoyed it.  The film is very much a bit of praise for all those who are unsung heroes in there lives and it had the potential to be really sickly sentimental.  Happily a good script manages to avoid this for the majority of the time.<br/><br/>The weakness of the film is the fact it that it does try to cover a lifetime and occasionally there isn't enough plot to do that well.  I know it would have been difficult but I do feel that the film could have been either a little tighter or filled to overflowing with plot to make it feel shorter. As it is it is still enjoyable but it does feel a little wandering at times  but I guess that's like life in a way.  When the climax comes though it is hard not to be a little moved by the lesson that the film is teaching us.<br/><br/>However, the reason for the success of the film is also the reason for it's Oscar nomination  Richard Dreyfuss on good form.  He kept me watching even when the material was stretched.  He is totally believable in the role  for a microcosm of his performance watch his face when the announcement is made about the surprise they have prepared for him  his emotion got me right away!  He deserved his nomination for this as he is captivating over the whole film.  He even ages very convincingly and make up should be congratulated.  However while makeup were concentrating on Dreyfuss they totally forgot about Headly who doesn't age a bit until the final time period (apart from looking a bit tired).  She is badly miscast and she doesn't fit the role at all.  Thomas, Macy, Dukakis and Anderson (as the teenage Cole) all do well in support  but this is Dreyfuss' movie.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this.  I usually struggle with things like this because they pile the sentiment on thick like a daytime TVM.  Happily this script avoids that are the majority of the flaws are compensated for by a strong performance from Dreyfuss."

","I love this movie because I had a fantastic, inspirational teacher in high school that all the students admired and looked up to. Even though I was in high school when this movie came out, I still carry the memories. Nicolas Cage deserved to win his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, but I still would have loved to see Richard Dreyfuss win. The whole cast was wonderful, and you actually felt like you were in the 60s and 70s, unlike other films set in that time period. <br/><br/>How often does a film come out that generations relate to; and a film so touching about a teacher who cares about his students, and vice versa? Will always be one of my favorite films."

","What a wonderful movie. I just watched it and am in awe of Richard Dreyfuss' amazing acting. Only being 15 but an avid music lover myself, I sat there wishing I had a teacher like Mr. Holland that inspired me like so many of the students in the movie, that made learning fun by connecting with the students, by doing everything Mr. Holland did. The stories of the students were real and believable. I connected with the girl that played the clarinet, Gertrude Lang, because sometimes I even feel that I'm never good at anything.<br/><br/>Every person of every age can appreciate and love this movie. At the end, when Mr. Holland's goodbye party was discovered in the gym and he took the stage, I was crying.<br/><br/>What a wonderful movie. History-wise, music-wise, and story-wise."
"tieman64","Null","6","6","19 February 2010"," Needs more Cowbell
","Glenn Holland, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a musician and composer who joins the teaching department at the JFK High School. He initially takes the job in order to earn some quick cash, his aim being to eventually take some time off and write his ""magnum opus"" (a piece of transcendent orchestral music which he hopes will ""change the world"" and ""touch people""), but what started off as a part time job soon becomes a longterm career, as Glenn battles both students and school staff, constantly fighting to get others to realise the importance and beauty of music (and by extension, art).<br/><br/>Eventually Glenn's students become receptive to his message, Glenn using a variety of ""innovative"" and ""out of the box"" teaching methods to win them over. The film highlights the erosion of creativity within schools, the power of art, the way these institutions degrade the mind, how school syllabuses are subject to budget cuts and outside job demands, but mostly it says that no life spent in a worthy pursuit is wasted.<br/><br/>Glenn Holland may not have been able to write the ""magnum opus"" he dreamt of, but he did something equally important. He touched the lives of thousands of students, inspiring and influencing them in countless ways. Glenn's life was a symphony, Glenn's existence a piece of music, and that, the film says, is worth celebrating.<br/><br/>In other words, the film is pure cheese. But if you look past all the sentimentality, the heavy-handed tear jerking, the film has a worthwhile message. It says that teaching art is one thing, but living like an artist and inspiring others to do so is an entirely different thing altogether. It's a love letter to beauty and creativity.<br/><br/>Beyond this you have a nice performance by Richard Dreyfuss in the lead and, ironically, some terrible music throughout. Why do films about music (think ""The Pianist"") often feature bad music? <br/><br/>7.9/10 – The ""teacher genre"" is filled with films like this. ""Dead Poet's Society, ""Coach Carter"", ""Dangerous Minds"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Stand and Deliver"", ""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""The Substitute"", ""Freedom Writers"", ""School of Rock"" etc, all follow a similar plot.<br/><br/>Interestingly, whilst most films that seek to show changes to a character over a significant span of time use a relatively young actor and then add makeup to make him look older, ""Mr Holland's Opus"" does the opposite, choosing a performer whose actual age closely matches the final age of the main character, then using makeup to rejuvenate him for the film's early sequences. Surprisingly, the result works better than the usual approach."
"abum190","9","7","8","22 April 2006"," ""Life is what happens when you're making other plans""
","This is a line of the Beatles' song that Mr. Holland sings to his son, Cole, at a concert. I've seen this movie plenty of times, but for the first time, I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.<br/><br/>The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.<br/><br/>This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.<br/><br/>I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives."
"sol-","Null","4","4","11 June 2016"," Teaching isn't easy
","Taking a position as a high school music teacher in order to pay the bills, an aspiring composer finds the job unexpectedly challenging but also unexpectedly rewarding in this Oscar nominated drama starring Richard Dreyfuss. The film gets off to a solid start with Dreyfuss discovering his every preconception of teaching challenged; there is no ""free time"", ""high school is not a democracy"" and it is absolutely impossible to leave campus at the same time as his students do. The movie missteps though by not spending more time on this section of his journey; before long, Dreyfuss transforms into an obsessively motivated teacher who has simply come to accept the demands of the job. A deaf son is eventually thrown into the mix to give Dreyfuss a chance to realise how his obsession with his job is negatively impacting on home life, but there is nothing especially novel or exciting about this plot development. A maudlin music score does not help matters either. In fact, were it not for its towering lead performance, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' would be difficult to endure. Fortunately, Dreyfuss is in fine form, credibly ageing over 30 years during the course of the movie. The film also does a good job capturing his reactions to various historical events over the three decades portrayed on screen (his grief over John Lennon's death is highly memorable). Whether this alone is enough to render the film worth viewing may vary per viewer. Clocking in at nearly two and half hours long, the film is not an easy, breezy watch, but fans of its lead actor might well find it worthwhile."

Richard Dreyfuss was glorious in his performance as the troubled Music Teacher.

"ccthemovieman-1","8","27","43","9 March 2006"," Genuinely Nice Bio Film That Hits Mostly The Right Notes
","This is simply a nice, dramatic story of a music teacher's life. Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher, ""Glenn Holland."" It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.<br/><br/>The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son. <br/><br/>The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt, who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor; Terrence Howard, a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam, and Jean Louisa Kelly, the last and most memorable student perhaps, an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.<br/><br/>Interwoven are some personal stories, particularly with Kelly's character, and with fellow teachers (Jay Thomas playing the most likable) and school administrators (Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy). The most personal, of course, involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son (played by three different actors as time passes.) Glenne Headly, meanwhile, plays Dreyfuss' wife.<br/><br/>As you can see by this cast, this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable, as Hollywood seems to be, to control their political bias by giving unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts; atheist John Lennon almost deified in this film as one of the ""heroes"" of the 20th century, plus a few more digs and plugs here and there, all with the normal Liberal bias.<br/><br/>Propaganda-aside, it's a genuinely nice film about people who succeed through dedication to their professions. The movie seemed to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative, but it works. It's also a plug, if you will, for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability."

","It drives me crazy to read posts about Glen Holland being a pompous, self-centered a-hole who treats his family like dirt and amorally pursues a young student, etc.<br/><br/>The whole movie's point has less to do with the process of teaching music to young ruffians (although that premise is a great backdrop to the story) and much more to do with an artistically passionate man's belated growth and atonement. Holland is an intensely flawed character from the get-go, and the reason we cry at the end of this movie isn't because his ""American Symphony"" is moving (indeed, it's nothing more than treacly and clichéd), but because he has, in two decades or so, sincerely figured out what's important. He certainly has his moments of sleaziness and selfish behavior, but without them the movie wouldn't have a purpose or any real story.<br/><br/>This film is about a man's journey late in life, which is a journey most of us don't want or need. It is a slow and honorable journey, in which he learns a lot about himself and the audience learns to appreciate music and his students' unending charm and talent.<br/><br/>Overall, an unbelievably well-put-together film about life and its many unbelievable (yet realistic) paths. <br/><br/>A must for any parent with a musically-talented kid."

Richard Dreyfuss' performance as Glenn Holland is not only memorable but unforgettable one of his best roles. Glenne Headly is terrific as his wife. He has a fantastic supporting cast like Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt, and others to support the film. The film is kind of a downer about a man who has spent thirty years of his life as a teacher in a small town. I was troubled by the fact that he and his wife stopped having children after Cole was born. I thought the deafness was to create friction between the musical father and his deaf son. Still, it's a good film. You'll cry a little."

","With all of the trashy, throw-away, so-called ""stars"" out there, a small handful of folks have always stood out on the basis of sheer acting talent. Richard Dreyfus is among them.<br/><br/>I first got turned on to him with THE GOODBYE GIRL, and something just clicked. THIS was the Real Thing! After JAWS, I started looking for more... and promptly found a quirky, offbeat offering, THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ.<br/><br/>Three wildly different roles... and all handled to perfection. THIS MAN IS AN ACTOR! After a succession of other roles, Dreyfus hit THE role, the one he can always be proud of... playing Glen Holland, the reluctant music teacher who came to love the profession that life and circumstances had forced him into.<br/><br/>The greatest gift MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS gave to me was an appreciation for a person in my own life... for the first time in several decades, I thought of my personal Mr. Holland, band director Herbert Rifkind of Chicago Vocational High School. Mr. Holland and Herb Rifkind couldn't have been more different people; Herb had been part of the Marine Corps Band in Washington, and tho he'd moderated the military approach to one more suitable for dealing with high school kids, his band was a tight and precise machine, carefully trained with patience and love.<br/><br/>Holland's ""marching buddy"" practice, and the sound of the drummer's Street Beat winding up at the start of the parade instantly took me back across decades... during halftime in a football game in Soldier Field in Chicago, steering 40 pounds of reluctant brass Sousaphone through a high wind while maintaining precise marching interval and cadence in the ankle deep mud, all the while struggling for perfection on the bass obbligato of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever""...<br/><br/>We didn't do it for glory, or even for ourselves... tho we'd have never admitted it back then, the band did it right to keep from letting Mr. Rifkind down. Holland and Rifkind were alike in that way; he was our best friend on the faculty, and the one that we now remember with a special fondness.<br/><br/>The Rifkinds and Hollands of this world probably have the most profound effect on their students of any high school faculty member; they give their kids something of VALUE that lasts a lifetime; an appreciation for music, and the self discipline that's needed to master a musical instrument or navigate life.<br/><br/>Holland and Rifkind are very special people... simple men, doing a job that they love, but a job that affects every student they ever encounter for a lifetime. It was time that somebody made a movie about these unsung heros.<br/><br/>Dreyfus did it RIGHT."
"fred-houpt","10","4","5","7 June 2007"," Weaving love and music into the fabric of life
","Although this is not entirely Richard Dreyfuss's film, surrounded as he is by an excellent cast, he holds the film entirely on his shoulders. He has made many films over the years and has hit some memorable home runs. Think of Close Encounters, Jaws and you've got between the two films some very big hits which delivered terrific entertainment fun. I've enjoyed his work over the years and even his lesser known works such as ""Tin Men"" are quite enjoyable and have worn well over the years.<br/><br/>In ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", Dreyfuss is given lots of depth to his character and he wasted no time filling in the form. The subject and script must have excited him because his performance is strong, centered, not overblown or over sentimentalized, touching, emotional when necessary and reserved when called for. There is an especially magical moment when he is in a close up with the student who excelled at singing (can't recall her name). They have an obvious sexual undercurrent going and we are led to believe, breath by breath that they will embrace and yet Dreyfuss takes his body language just to the furthest edge and then holds. The tension collapses when someone walks in the room and we are amazed that they did not kiss. It's a really great scene that aspiring actors should study; here is a pro who shows how to act with finesse.<br/><br/>The story is terrific and the plot carefully includes many characters and although some verge on stereotypes, they all appear quite believable and human and much of this has to do with the quality of the actors and the lines they emote. There is a strong impulse to drive this film into a 'heart on your sleeves' climax and it does stray briefly into this mode. However, by the time the film is over the build up of love for this man is so immense and overpowering that the surprise he gets at the very end just makes us all weep with joy.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed how his character finally learned about his own failures as a father and rather than sink into depression and recrimination, he rose to that challenge in the same insightful way his entire teaching career was handled.<br/><br/>The film is a complete joy from beginning to end; the cast as I say was superb. Given a terrific story and sensitive direction from Stephen Herek, this is as good as film entertainment ever gets. Keep the tissue box close at hand; it's a tearful joy and not easily forgotten."

"dwr246","10","6","9","2 May 2006"," A touching movie about the power of music to change lives - even those of the ones who teach it
","Opus literally means ""work"" in Latin. And this affecting tale of a man's life work is one of the best made in recent years.<br/><br/>The movie starts in the fall of 1965 when Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) starts teaching at John F. Kennedy High School (which is in the process of being renamed as he arrives). Mr. Holland was playing keyboards with a band, but has tired of touring and wants time to settle down and write his own music. He finds teaching to not be much to his liking at first. The kids aren't interested, and he doesn't know how to get through to them. In addition, his principal, Mrs. Jacobs (Olympia Dukakis), is always on his back, as is the Vice Principal, Mr. Wolters (William H. Macy). His only friend on the faculty turns out to be the football coach, Bill Meister (Jay Thomas). His complaints to his wife, Iris (Glenne Headley), are met with sympathy at first, but when he learns she is pregnant, he realizes that he needs this job to support his soon to be larger family. At that point, he commits and becomes an excellent teacher, learning how to connect to the kinds of music the kids like and relate it back to the classics he is required to teach. Along the way, he reaches several students: a young clarinet player (Alicia Witt), a football player (Terrence Howard) who learns to play the drums in order to keep his GPA high enough to continue to play - an undertaking done at the request of Meister, a gifted young singer (Jean Louisa Kelly) who longs to make music rather than work in her parents business and who develops a bit of a crush on Mr. Holland. His personal life fares a little less well. His only son, Cole (Nicholas John Renner, Joseph Anderson, or Anthony Natale depending on the age) is born deaf, and he can't share his father's love of music. Or so Mr. Holland thinks, until he realizes his frustration has shut his son out of his life. Once again, he rises to the challenge. However, it is only when the music program is cut from the curriculum, and Mr. Holland is forced to retire that he realizes what his true life's work has been.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant script. Mr. Holland's passion for life - music, his work, his family - is wonderfully depicted, and contrasted against his own limitations in being able to achieve his goals. When faced with his shortcomings, he does something about them, and in the end triumphs because of it. And having his former students come back and show him how he has influenced their lives is an especially nice touch.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Dreyfuss is a skilled actor, and he brings a warmth to the part that contrasts nicely with Mr. Holland's less appealing characteristics. Headley gives a sweet performance as a woman who loves her family and stands by them no matter what. The scene where she expresses her frustration at not being able to communicate with her son is especially well done. Thomas puts in a nice turn as the football coach. I'm not a big fan of Macy, but he does pretty well as the vice principal. Dukakis is nothing short of fabulous as the principal who decides to mentor Mr. Holland whether he wants her to or not.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a tear jerker of a movie, especially the ending. But it's well worth the sacrifice of Kleenex, whether it's the first time or the hundred and first. This is a movie that says yes, anyone can make a difference in ways they never dreamed of."
"scholara2","9","5","8","8 September 2006"," Wonderful movie.....
","I found this to be an uplifting movie and not at all tragic.<br/><br/>It's about a man who has life happen to him while he's making other plans.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss shows again what a gifted character actor he is. From ""What about Bob?"" to ""Mr.Holland's Opus"", we see his incredible range from drama to comedy. He is one of the great character actors of his generation.<br/><br/>Dreyfuss really puts his heart into this performance, like when he sings to Cole. You can see the sweat on his brow, and although he's no John Lennon, I thought his singing was pretty good.<br/><br/>Also, in this age of techno wizadry, you can't always trust what you see on the screen, but it looked to me like he was actually playing the piano, in which case, another facet of this talented man.<br/><br/>His character agonizes over a potentital relationship with a beautiful and talented student in a midlife crisis, but at the end makes the right decision.<br/><br/>And the ending, it was so moving that even the cast had tears in their eyes, and I somehow don't think that was fake.<br/><br/>The timeline of events from the 60's to the 90's was also excellent.<br/><br/>Overall, a beautiful movie, and everyone put in a great performance. I thought it had the right balance, without getting overly sentimental and sugar coated, and evoked a feeling of the times with the music and settings.<br/><br/>I take this movie out and watch it every once in a while."

","This is just a wonderful film - seen it six times, cried six times. The finale literally gives me chills every time.<br/><br/>I think the character of Mr. Holland resonated with me so much because he reminded me of several great music teachers who had a profound influence on my life (1970's). In a larger sense, he was typical of a LOT of the teachers in my day: dedicated, idealistic baby-boomers who were going to change the world by affecting one student at a time.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in utilizing as its backdrop the American cultural & political landscape of the 1960s-1990's (Vietnam, civil rights movement, Watergate, etc).<br/><br/>Kudos to the director and everyone else involved for getting most of the music stuff ""right"" - I'm a musician and I usually look for bad fake playing, inaccuracies, and anachronisms.<br/><br/>Cheers to the late, great Michael Kamen for his wonderful score & especially ""Glen Holland's"" American Symphony: it contains musical ""quotes"" ranging from Copeland to Gershwin; to the final note from The Beatles' ""A Day In The Life"".<br/><br/>...yes, I realize John Lennon wasn't American ;-) ....<br/><br/>One minor plot flaw: why couldn't The Governor just issue an Executive Order to restore Music Education funding?

","Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed ""Invictus"" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse."
"paul2001sw-1","7","3","4","15 May 2006"," Life is what happens while you're busy making plans
","The make-up department does a splendid job in ageing Richard Dreyfuss in Stepehen Herek's film about an aspiring composer turned music teacher who finds his vocation over thirty years. It's a good performance from Dreyfuss as well, and the movie also benefits from a reliably creepy turn from William Macy as Dreyfusss' boss. In fact, as a portrait of a life set against a changing political, and musical, landscape, showing how (in the words of a song that features in the plot), ""life is what happens while we're busy making plans"", it reminded me of the epic BBC drama series, 'Our Friends in the North'. But it lacks the deeper engagement of that series with the specifics of the times it portrays, and at times seems a little trite as a result. Dreyfuss was Oscar-nominated for his role and this is definitely the sort of film that gets considered at these awards: earnest, gently liberal, ultimately upbeat and essentially unthreatening. And you can take that as condemnation or commendation, as you will; but I enjoyed it."
"roghache","9","3","4","25 April 2006"," Brilliant tribute to unsung heroes...one music teacher's impact
","A masterful tribute to music teachers. My own son, now a college freshman, played in the school band for seven years (through both middle and high school), so our household had first hand experience with a dedicated music teacher and could relate well to Mr. Holland's contribution. <br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss is brilliant as the would be composer, Mr. Holland, who must reluctantly resort to teaching in order to support himself and his pregnant wife. As the film chronicles for close to three decades, we witness Mr. Holland's aging (effectively done), the changing styles, fads, and current issues of high school students, the growing up of his deaf son, and most of all, the emergence and development of Mr. Holland's teaching skills and the impact they have on the lives of his students, both musically and personally.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland has a tremendous effect on his students, to name a few...a timid clarinet player with low self esteem who eventually becomes state governor, a wrestler transformed (after much effort) into a drummer who is later killed in Vietnam, and a talented singer who ends up heading for Broadway. These instances may remind many viewers of that 'special teacher' in their own lives, whatever the subject. I agree with another reviewer that even for those such as the clarinet playing governor, who don't pursue music as a career, having musical training during childhood & adolescence makes for a lifelong enriching experience. People are not one dimensional, with their job the only significant factor in their lives. <br/><br/>The afore mentioned singer, Rowena, who has a serious crush on her teacher & mentor, brings one of the more interesting sub-plot lines to the story as Mr. Holland (experiencing some marital difficulties and despairing the lack of composition success he's dreamed of) is tempted to join her when she departs for the Big Apple. I thought the scene extremely moving when his wife discovers from the musical program that this lovely, talented young student is the mysterious 'Rowena' of her husband's composition and suspects (fears) a romantic interest. Also, Mr. Holland's viewing of his family's photo album is dramatic under these circumstances of temptation. How refreshing (for once, in Hollywood) that our hero 'does the right thing'. I admit to being disappointed that an older Rowena doesn't reappear at the end concert as a famous Broadway star. The two of them could have had an interesting moment there, and I was waiting for it.<br/><br/>The depiction of the parents' struggles with Mr. Holland's deaf son, Cole (especially given the father's musical career), is effectively done and gives us all a better appreciation of obstacles faced by those with disabilities and their families.<br/><br/>The funding dilemmas for academics, arts, & athletics in the school system are always relevant. Band has recently been cut in my own son's former high school, a tragedy. I wish Mr. Holland's music program could have been re-instated. As one commenter noted, pity his former students couldn't have had a fund-raiser or mass protest to officialdom so that their children would not be denied the musical opportunities they themselves experienced.<br/><br/>As for the end concert, it's dramatic beyond words and must have given Mr. Holland the real definition of success. This scene certainly came to mind a couple of years back when I attended a retirement banquet for my own son's middle school music teacher, with entertainment provided by a band consisting of both present and former students. There are many Mr. Hollands out there in the school system today, and they especially must be gratified by this recognition of their generally unheralded efforts."

","Yes the story is sappy and idealized. That is the point. No one goes into teaching to get rich. Some start teaching as a way to pay bills, but no one stays in teaching to do that. Glen is like the best teachers I had. Intelligent. Fiesty. Challenging. Willing to make students look beyond their textbooks into the world.<br/><br/>Great soundtrack. Real issues, especially for those of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s when schools slashed budgets left and right and then wondered why this generation was so apathetic. <br/><br/>If the movie was today the director would spend forever on the ""affair"" with Rowena and maybe throw in a gratuitous love scene. This movie does right by the characters, who remind me of specific people in my school experience."

"jims-29","10","3","4","14 March 2005"," How a Music Teacher Digs Deeply to Help Teens Succeed
","This movie follows the career of a frustrated composer (played to perfection by Richard Dreyfuss) who couldn't earn a full-time living as a band member. The movie starts when he begins a new career as the music teacher at a small-town high school to pay his rent. He quickly comes to realize it's not only high school students who don't want to be in class, but also their teachers. A series of very unmusical students with a variety of motivations implore him to find a way to teach what appear to be hopeless cases to become competent at their instruments. This forces him to dig much deeper into the teens' psyche and his own soul to invent ways to help the teens succeed. I found it very admirable the way he learned to control his verbal responses to kids who seemed so untalented and so far beyond the possibility of redemption. He bit his tongue and came up with positive responses that were honest yet gently guided the teens towards the discovery of possibilities no one even knew that they were capable of. As the parent of a teen, I can tell you this is very hard to do, and I really appreciated the lesson the movie teaches by example! I found it very inspiring the way these experiences impacted the teens involved as they grew to adulthood and beyond, and I believe such lessons could be very impactful on junior high age students who may be struggling in one subject or another at school, and on their parents. I'd highly recommend this film to benefit the parents of kids in the 10 to 16 years of age range, as well as to junior and senior high school teachers of any subject.<br/><br/>The story also shows how he inspires one very talented student, aptly played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly, to discover her inner voice and pursue her musical ambitions. To me, this film would have been worth seeing on the strength of her charming performance and beautiful singing voice alone. I think she'd make a great ingenue as Christine in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, for example, and I hope she gets that opportunity some day. I'd also love to see her opposite Josh Groban performing a musical duet, that would be magical indeed."
"mrslawn","Null","3","4","8 November 2004"," Wonderful tale of one man's life
","To the person who ripped this movie because of its supposed injustice to music, I think you totally missed the point. This movie isn't about music and how it's taught. It wouldn't matter if Mr. Holland was a math, English, science, or music teacher. The whole point of the movie is to show the evolution of Mr. Holland as a man and teacher. Mr. Holland had a passion for music, he shared with others around him, and touched their lives. What is so wrong with that? And, I would have loved to have heard more of his composition, but do you really think it would be logical to spend 20 minutes of the movie listening to it? Yes it was a very important part of his journey, but this is still a movie, not a trip to the symphony. I thought it was a fabulous movie. It touches my heart every time I watch it and I would recommend it to anyone. As someone who is about to enter the teaching world, I think it is a wonderful example of how teachers who are passionate about their subject can influence and effect not only their students, but the community as well."

","**Minor Spoilers**<br/><br/>I have been the child of a music educator for my entire life.  My mother is quite a bit like Glen Holland, if you can believe it (only sweeter!).  I cannot help but think of her as I watch this film for the gazillionth time.<br/><br/>Stephen Herek did a fabulous directing job, in my opinion. Now, has this movie been ""Hollywood-ized?"" Of course.  There are several instances in this film where the action on screen could not plausibly happen in a real educational environment. But the story here is not necessarily about music theory or literature: it is about one man's struggle to do what he loves and get away from his ""fallback,"" only to discover that for the past 30 years, he has, in fact, been doing what he was destined to do all his life.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss very accurately portrays the reluctant band director. I was amazed by his performance in this film; he's come a long way from ""Jaws."" Within the first 10 minutes of watching this movie, I forgot Dreyfuss and could think only of Mr. Holland. His interactions with all his students and his own family are very touching and believable.<br/><br/>Maybe the reason I like ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" so much is that I grew up hearing my mother talk about how she had never really cared to teach music and left the world of science strictly as a fill-in for another teacher, only to receive one of the biggest retirement parties given by students I've ever seen (she later told me that being a music teacher changed her life). Maybe it's because I'm at Texas Tech University studying Music Education. Maybe it's neither.  All I know is that this is a wonderful film, and if you have an imagination and a heart, you can look past the musical and educational errors in this film and enjoy the underlying story.<br/><br/>

","There are many profound places in this movie.  The best thing, for me, is that it doesn't over-glorify the subject matter.  Holland is never portrayed as a superteacher.  If he does find peace in his life choices, it's a process that takes years and years.  Another thing I liked is the transitioning from decade to decade.  We can't help but see that time is slipping by for Mr. Holland...and for all of us!  <br/><br/>I also appreciate that the school is shown as an average one.  It isn't a sparkling architectural gem, as in John Hughes' films, nor is it a pit of squalor, as in the first act of ""Lean on Me.""  The bureaucrats who oppose Holland are not villains.  The students are neither budding prodigies (in most cases); nor are they pitiful caterpillars struggling vainly to emerge from their cocoons.  In sort, Holland, his colleagues, his wife, son and students, are all REAL.<br/><br/>Anyone who appreciates music (or who didn't appreciate their music teachers enough) will enjoy the singing (well, maybe not Richard's, but...)<br/><br/>Glenne Headley was outstanding, too.<br/><br/>/r"

As someone once said, what is happiness but your dreams?  Those of us who are a little older may reflect on the unrealized dreams of our youth, but although some of those dreams went unrealized, some of life's events still turned out to be a lot richer than we would have ever expected.  The look on Glenne Headley's Iris as she comes to grips with who ""Rowena"" is (see the movie and remember her look) gave me chills.  When Glenn Holland later says ""I love you"" and she says ""I know"" -- now that's a realized dream that beats being on stage at Carnegie Hall.  Relax, don't be too critical and enjoy.

","I wish to laud this film first for its structure as it could have slipped so easily into your standard TV-movie sentimentality--and it escaped. <br/><br/>
This is achieved by the superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss, and with a very strong and balanced supporting cast.  True, some of the characters were cliche but they were played ably.  I agree with someone here that Glenne Headly did an excellent job.  She was on an even playing field with Dreyfuss--great acting don't come into singletons usually.<br/><br/>It is a movie not as much about accuracy in music as a gentle  condolences of all the unfinished dreams in all of us.  It is not about the opportunities we missed, the talents we ignored.  I will venture to say it doesn't matter if Mr. Holland had real talent or not.  To me, I see Dreyfuss' character not as a teacher intent on inspiring all his students into kodak ""aw shucks moments"", but a person who stuck to his decisions in life with integrity.  <br/><br/>Many cliches, ""pass the tissue"" moments were played with subdued thoughtfulness by Dreyfuss.  Great job!<br/><br/>If anyone is accusing the movie as being manipulative while describing ""Forest Gump"" as ""emotionally honest"", then I will stand guilty and taste the sinful pleasure.  I, as an average joe, will identify more with Dreyfuss infinitely more than an unrealistic caricature (of human goodness) that Hollywood assembled.  Perhaps I have some inexplicable bias towards ""Gump"" due to it being a Hollywood fantasy about human goodness (with everyone around Gump flawed in some way but somehow redeemed by his purity), which is the diametrical opposite to ""Holland""--a realistic portrait of a less-than-perfect human."

","Warning: potential spoilers<br/><br/>I have to admit that I simply cannot understand anyone bagging this movie, or saying it is poor. This movie is my all-time favourite, I have watched it countless times. Despite the fact that perhaps some of the musical facts may have been incorrect, I feel that point is so trivial and unimportant as to even feature as a point against it. If you pick on the musical facts, then you have most definitely missed the meaning of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie shows how a teacher can endear himself to the students, help to shape their lives, and in turn, gain fulfillment himself. That, is the point of the movie, anything else is irrelevant. This movie is outstanding in many ways. Firstly, it has a lot of history, for those of you who enjoy their history, like me. It spans 30 years. It shows the impact of the Vietnam War, how Mr Holland taught a student who in turn ended up dying defending his country. We see one of his former students who started out as shy and untalented, rise to be the Governor of the state. Whilst all this is going on, in the background we see his family growing, and the impact his deaf son has on him, and his heartache that his own son will never truly be able to hear music. As previously mentioned, right through this, is the history of 1965-1995 and how society, beliefs and cultures change. If the ending is not enough to move you to tears, you are simply not human - simple.<br/><br/>We all have experienced a teacher who believed in us, made us believe in ourselves, and shaped our lives. That is what this movie is about. The intricacies are unimportant, it is the moral of the story which is the focal point. The movie certainly brings to life a sentence in John Lennon's song - Beautiful Boy: ""life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans"". Ever since seeing this movie, I have adopted this as my motto. Never has a truer sentence been uttered. This movie deserves nothing short of 10, and I believe will go down in history as one of the best movies, and will be classed among the famous classics.<br/><br/>If you don't see this movie, you are missing out on something very, very special.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

The first time I was fresh out of high school, a former high school music student myself, and found much to relate to in the high school/music aspect of the movie.  Now I'm 27 years old, and able to understand the movie in a much more ""adult"" fashion. This movie is a touching reminder that money and fame aren't necessary to achieve success in life.  Richard Dreyfuss plays his role as the reluctant high school music teacher as if he was born to it.  I love the way world events of the time periods (the movie begins in the 1960's and ends in the ""present"") are brought into the storyline.  Especially beautiful is the way John Lennon's death serves to bring Holland and his son together in a way they've never been able to be.  I personally think that Glenne Headley holds the movie together perfectly.  Her portrayal of Holland's wife is superb, lending the movie believability and heart.

","(WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS WITHIN)<br/><br/>This film is a tribute to the teacher/s who changed your life and helped to make you a better person.  A few who have savaged the film on this board may have lost sight of this aspect.  It involves a music teacher and I can understand disappointment of serious musicians in some regards.  That aside, on the balance I found it to be a very fine piece of work.<br/><br/>The basic plot involves a performing musician who reluctantly takes on a job as a high school music teacher.  He loathes his job and would much rather be composing and performing music.  Over a period of thirty years we see him evolve from a rather self-absorbed overgrown brat into somebody who connects with students on more than just a purely musical level.  Later he is made to realize just how many lives he has really touched in those thirty years. Mr. Holland the man is flawed in many respects, especially in his dealings with his family.  We all know of creative people who are so ""into"" one thing that they let other aspects of their lives become a shambles.  This is addressed on many levels within the film.<br/><br/>I thought that this was one of Richard Dreyfuss's better performances. Jean Louise Kelly is a very capable singer on the Gershwin tunes and she has grown up to be a very beautiful woman compared to the snotty teen she played in Uncle Buck.<br/><br/>I am thinking that the reason most of the music in the film is either pop gold or ""standards"" is because most of the general public has heard them before.  As a musician myself, I can understand why classical musicians might view this choice with dismay.  It was probably done to be more mass-appeal.  (Easier to hum ""Louie Louie"" than ""Fingel's Cave"" if you're Joe-Sixpack)  I agree that the ""Opus"" that Mr. Holland devoted thirty years of his life to is bland ""wallpaper"" that sounds like it was lifted from several 8th grade level concert band scores.<br/><br/>In general, you'll love watching this film if you had that one special teacher who touched your life.  They may have been a music teacher, a science teacher, or your driver's ed instructor.  But if they changed your life for the better, you will always remember them.  This one hit home for me on all levels.  In this day and age of shoot em up films, it's nice to see somebody go out on a limb for once."

","I have had a look at the comments posted here, both for and against it.<br/><br/>     Some of them are using such harsh and strongly worded language, that one may think they are talking about a life and death situation, or maybe the future of our planet, as we know it. Some others are so inane, that they are pathetic.<br/><br/>     We are talking here about movies, folks! You know those things which make you dole out a few bucks to be entertained. Of course, those bucks add up together to really BIG money and BIG business. In fact, movie producers may well be the highest rollers and gamblers in the world. Authorizing millions and millions of dollars to put together a bunch of snippets, which nobody can predict will bomb, or be a hit at the box office.<br/><br/>     Some viewers have dissected the minutae to such an extent, that it makes you think they just want to show off their knowledge of the movie making industry ,and its inner workings. Some others have elaborated extensively on the psychological aspects of the movie, making one wonder whether they are Freudians or Jungians.<br/><br/>
     For me, this is a simple story of an ordinary man, trying to do the right thing, and doing his best to play the life  game by its rules, even if he has to let go in  a matter of minutes, his deepest dreams and aspirations, just for the sake of being decent. And that's where the real tour de force is, making such a great movie out of a common situation.<br/><br/>     There are many Mr Hollands amongst us, we just don't see them.<br/><br/>     I found it to be highly entertaining, and was surprised when 3 hours went by so quickly.<br/><br/>     I have no doubts that many others will feel the same way...."

","What Low Man and others who have made similar comments fail to account for is that 7/8 of the movie-going public don't know a fugue from a fermata.Most of them like one or more of the musical genres, but probably can't say why, in musical terms. <br/><br/>In any case, the movie isn't about the rarified and arcane nuances of music as an art. Its creators didn't aspire to see it cited in Grove's or a top musical journal. The film could have easily been about dramatics, fine art or any of the three r's disciplines. Each evokes passionate interest from students and claims some wannabee top performers in those fields as teachers, sooner or later. The film is about how one can release one's tight grip on self-aggrandizing dreams and find a gloriously satisfying life in service to others. This message it transmits superlatively."
"theowinthrop","10","4","6","5 September 2007"," A Most Moving Teacher's Film
","There are plenty of films about the effect of teacher's over the years on their students. The best known is GOODBYE MR. CHIPS with Robert Donat, but there are others (GOOD MORNING, MISS DOVE, for example). The tragic personal life of the teacher as opposed to his or her dedication to the students is the subject of the drama. Yet the formula works when does well, and MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS was an example of such a successful version.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfus is Glenn Holland, who has been hired in 1965 to teach music appreciation at JOHN F. KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL (the principal is Olympia Dukakis, and the vice principal is William H. Macy). Holland's wife (Iris - Glenne Headley) and there child Cole are in a house in the town, and we watch his domestic tragedy - not so much with his wife, but that their son is deaf. Holland concentrates over time on his students, and his constant warfare with the vice principal on matters like rock and roll or the values of music appreciation in learning. Among the students he helps are young athletes trying to accomplish academic achievement, young women trying to break into the field of entertainment or trying to bolster their self-confidence. But he is constantly brought up short by the problems of his relations with his family - especially as his son Cole grows up (Joseph Anderson - age 15 Cole here). Cole is deaf but he is intelligent, and he blows up when Glenn fails to realize that Cole is intelligent about music - a subject he thinks Cole can never share with him.<br/><br/>The running thread through all this is that Glenn began the teaching gig as a money maker while he creates his musical masterpiece - a symphony. But both the home life and the school work take up all his time. Yet, as the film ends he realizes that he did leave an imprint on his students, and he did prove a warm and loving husband and father despite real strains due to Cole's condition. The film ends with a proper validation of his full success.<br/><br/>Dreyfus was wonderful as Glenn (ably supported by Headley, Macy, Dukakis, and Jay Thomas as his friend the sports coach), and got nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar. While he did not win, his career rejuvenated. And he would eventually try (with Thomas) to do a television show in the next decade that dealt with the problems of a teacher in a high school."
"lee_eisenberg","10","4","6","10 November 2006"," I saw Richard Dreyfuss in a bookstore while they were filming this.
","In September, 1994, my mom and I were in the checkout line in Powell's Bookstore in Portland, Oregon. There was a very short man in front of us. When we got up to the cashier, she identified the man as none other than Richard Dreyfuss. We turned around and sure enough, it was he. Needless to say, we wondered what he was doing in Portland.<br/><br/>A little over a year later, we found out what he was doing when ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" got released. We thought that it was one of the best movies that year. We all really liked that it portrayed how sad he got when John Lennon got assassinated. A very good movie.<br/><br/>About a year later, Richard Dreyfuss appeared at Grant High School again. He made a speech encouraging people to vote in the upcoming election.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie. I recommend it to everyone. Also starring Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy. Strange that Stephen Herek also directed movies such as ""Critters""."

","This movie was really great. I first saw it when i was a freshman i high school, and i have't stopped watching it since. For me...parts of it were real tear-jerker. Other parts were funny, but overall Stephen Herek did a GREAT job directing this film...and THE CAST did a GREAT job as well. For me, watching the movie really opened my eyes. It showed me that music is in every one...it's just up to the people on whether or not they do something to strengthen their abilities. It also showed me that musicals aren't stupid. Because believe it or not, before i watched MR.Holland'S OPUS..that's what i thought. But it really did open my eyes up to musicals. and i owe it all to my chorus teacher my freshman year in high school"
"lou53053","10","4","6","27 June 2006"," I did have my own Mr. Holland
","I just finished re-watching this movie. I first saw it in the theaters when it came out. I fell in love with it as my favorite teacher in high school was my band/choir director. As fate may have it, immediately upon arriving home from seeing the movie, I received a phone call asking to be part of the orchestra to celebrate the retirement of my favorite teacher. A special song had been written for him, so of course I dusted off my clarinet and before I knew it, I was part of my own Mr. Holland's Opus. I remember that evening and all the wonderful years surrounding this teacher each time I watch the movie. It still requires a box of tissues in my opinion."
"Cpeajay","9","4","6","25 April 2006"," It's my life...!
","I thoroughly enjoyed the MR. HOLLANDS' OPUS when it first was released and still love it today. Being a high school band director myself I was surprised when I saw that Hollywood was doing a movie about a band director... not just the ""do good"" teacher, but a music teacher. <br/><br/>Much of the movie stuck a familiar chord with me -- the ""free summers"" to make music (HAH!!), the arguments about how much time is spent away from the family. THe one part I found really unbelievable (at least for me) was the band and the football team SHARING the football field! LOL!! That doesn't happen for a lot of band directors I know!!<br/><br/>WHen the movie came out this movie was all about my high school band director. It reminded me of how many students he has affected, and how I can never thank him enough for all he did for me. Now when I watch it the movie for me is about my students. I've been doing this gig for 18 years, so now I'm beginning to understand how many young lives I've touched. YEs... and every time they get to the end... I still end up bawling like a baby. This movie means a lot to me."
"robinflamingo","10","4","6","26 July 2005"," For all the Mr. and Mrs. Hollands...
","This movie exemplifies the love and passion that a born teacher can communicate to his students, and how it can change their lives. I've been fortunate enough to have my own Mr. Holland in my life, and I've tried to model my teaching after him. Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as the teacher who would be a composer, and occasionally forgets his own family in pursuit of excellence. But, as in any good old fashioned drama, his family sticks by him, and in the final reel, it all comes together to make it everything worthwhile.<br/><br/>Regrets and doubts, joys and accomplishments. Living those and coming out on the other side stronger is the mark of a true teacher. Mr. Holland's Opus is a delight because of its realism."
"88keyz","10","4","6","17 June 2003"," Richard Dreyfuss' Opus
","I first saw this movie on video in late 1996, I was 19 years old and I thought that I would hate it.  What kind of sappy, sentimental crap was this?  Why should I like it?  Well, I'll tell you.  Its because this is the story of a man's life work and how he made a difference in the lives of those people around him.  I think that some day many years from now we would all like to look back and say that we made the difference in the life of even one person.  Dreyfuss gives us the performance of a lifetime as the titular Mr. Holland.  Watching him transform from a frustrated, half-hearted, hot-headed young teacher to a man of wisdom, compassion and caring is a wonderous sight to behold.  His battles with his hearing impaired son pull at your very heart strings.  Mr. Holland is a man we all know and love, he might not have been your music teacher but he/she was someone special in your life that made a difference in your education.  I was lucky enough to have a multitude of great teachers just like Mr. Holland that changed my life and made me appreciate the great place a teacher holds in our society today.  Mr. Holland's Opus might be silly and sentimental but I can't help but love this movie.  I'm not ashamed to say that I cry big crocodile tears everytime I watch it.  This movie hits you right where it feels good, it makes you proud to have shared this experience.  You were there to watch him grow and become the stuff of legend.  You were there for Mr. Hollands Opus, no, you were there for Richard Dreyfuss' Opus.  Because in the end the real opus is not his music but his effect on the lives of his students.  Now thats beautiful music."
"MacTheMovieguy","10","4","6","13 April 2003"," Richard Dreyfuss's best performance
","Sure. I'll admit, it was sappy. However, this movie is successful in that field. A lot of movies try to make you feel for characters (Autumn In New York) who are fantasy type characters that no one in real life is actually like. However, here, they've managed to give us a real person vibe in Glenn Holland. Holland, played like a God by Richard Dreyfuss, music composer by night, has just accepted a job teaching music at the John F. Kennedy High School in his town. His wife (Glenne Headley) is naturally happy for them. As time progresses more and more, Holland becomes more grounded in the profession he started off hating. Life begins to throw curveballs at Mr. Holland, one big one in the form of his son (which I won't spoil for you). Even Mr. Holland's brief encounter with one of his students is played out so well that you almost cry for both of them. The end is everything we've built up to. Some people may even cry. I just found the whole movie to be perfect. It was exactly what I look for in a movie, and I'll watch it again and again. 10/10."
"gitrich","8","8","16","25 November 1998"," Richard Dreyfuss is perfect for this role. It is a moving story of dedication and love.
","Richard Dreyfuss plays a musician, Glenne Headly, who takes, what he thought would be, a temporary job as a high school music teacher. For the next thirty years he encourages his students to love music as he loves music. His dedication, however, carries with it a toll on his own family. It is a moving story that will stay with you for a long time. One of Richard Dreyfuss' finest moments on film."
"patricianolan999","1","12","29","27 May 2008"," too many stupid clichés!
","This movie makes me sick! Every worn-out cliché ever said or written about teachers is here....he's infatuated with a sexy jail-bait student and almost runs off with her (that actually DOES happen), he likes his students better than his own son, he has a loving but frumpy wife, bla..bla...bla! And of course, as a young teacher, he vows he'll only teach until he becomes a famous musician. Predictably, he ends up being a teacher for 30 years! And of course, he's the ""noble"" teacher who inspires his students...one of them even becomes Governor! Hey, couldn't SHE have pulled a few strings to let him keep his job? Or, being the Governor, she could have personally gotten him a NEW and better teaching job! What a bunch of crap. I hate these ""noble teacher"" movies."
"aalmhs","6","4","7","9 November 1998"," The right formula...
","Covering 30 yrs of a person's life was always going to be hard, but this film manages it without interrupting the flow. Mr Holland, faced with everything to hold him back from completing his opus, more than impacts on his music appreciation class - from those who said they couldn't, to those who had to break free and try their hand at the city lights. I liked the subtle time changes with the cars and the aging characters. The Cole sub-plot was a little bit misplaced (although I can't see how else they could have done it) and overall the story was predictable, but it was an inspiring movie all the same."
"jessejace","1","15","39","9 April 2009"," This movie makes me want to barf
","This is one of my least favorite movies ever: a movie geared towards people who don't really know anything about music, and as such, reveals its complete stupidity to those who do. Mr. Holland's Crappy Opus is the story of Mr. Holland, a cranky guy who's not a very good teacher, not a very good musician, not a very good husband and not a very good father. To put it mildly, he has no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>He works for his whole life on this ""OPUS,"" and when it finally gets performed, it's god- awful. It sounds like he wrote the soundtrack to a lame movie (except the people who really do write movie scores don't spend a whole lifetime on one film). How can you work on music composition your whole life, and still have no talent for it? Is it possible? Well, in the movies, anything's possible.<br/><br/>The movie seems to credit Mr. Holland with inventing the pep band, which makes him all the more despicable to me. When the pep band at my high school started playing ""Louie, Louie,"" the kids at the game didn't cheer. They would roll their eyes, and/or vomit. No movie can make me believe that being in a marching band is cool. Drumline, this means you. I was in the marching band from 6th grade until high school graduation, and it was decidedly not cool.<br/><br/>There's also the pointless Rowena Subplot, which culminates in a gripping scene where Richard Dreyfuss's wife reads Rowena's name on a program, discovers that Rowena is not just a celtic mythology figure that her dorky husband is in love with and consequently makes a face. You'll be glued to your seat as a spectrum of emotions from stern disapproval to disapproving sternness passes through Mrs. Holland's face, and then the Rowena subplot proceeds to go precisely NOWHERE.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland ""touches the lives"" of all these students...and each life he touches is destroyed! He tells the redheaded girl to play the sunset; she becomes a miserable politician. He gives Rowena ""voice coaching"" (is that what the kids are calling it now?); she runs away, never to be seen again. He hits that football player kid on the head with a bass drum beater to teach him about rhythm. (Yes. The only black guy in the movie has to learn about rhythm from a white guy.) And that kid dies! The film's solitary saving grace is the fact that it introduced Alicia Witt who, after appearing in Mr. Holland's Stupid, Life-Sucking Opus, went on to become the cutest redhead I have ever seen. She can play my sunset any day. Or something.<br/><br/>But what's up with that scene where the hearing-impaired people ""appreciate"" music by watching idiotic flashing lights? Nice going, Mr. Jackass, you've just implied that deaf people are morons. Let's wait and see whether they thank you for touching THEIR lives, dickweed. I actually found myself rooting for William H. ""This Is My Deal Here"" Macy, the school's evil, conservative, buzzcut-sporting budget Nazi. ""Go, Mr. Macy. Cut his budget! Cut it DOWN! The school needs three new football stadiums, not creative arts education! Burn those violins on the baseball diamond!"" So, if you like movies that are just ill-conceived vehicles for 60s pop rock montages (blah blah blah, fake moon landing footage, blah blah blah, Martin Luther King Jr, blah blah blah) and scene after scene of Richard Dreyfuss being a jerk, run out and see Mr. Dickweed's Heinously Barfalactic Opus."
"ozthegreatat42330","9","3","5","13 March 2007"," Simply one of the finest movies made.
","Once in a generation a film comes along that reminds us about that special person who makes such an impact on our lives, and the lives of so many others, while remaining unaware of the effect that they have had. In the 1930's it was ""Goodbye Mr. Chips."" In the 1940's is was ""Good Morning Miss Dove."" And now comes ""Mr. Holland's Opus."" These three films have one thing in common. They cover a lifetime of teaching and the effect it has on the teacher as well as the students they have come into contact with.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfus creates a bravura performance as Glenn Holland, and should have won the best actor Oscar for his role, even as Robet Donat did in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips."" This film was special to me for two reasons. I had a chorus teacher in high school had affected me in such a way as Mr. Holland did his students. And years later I had the opportunity to work with and teach Drama to young people from age six up. I have seen this story from both sides, and it still affects me so very much. <br/><br/>My only argument with the film is in the final scene. If the Governor was so dedicated to Mr. Holland why did she not do something about retaining the music program in that school? It is a small plot point, but I was curious. All in all though this is a wonderful film, and should be in everyone's film library. It earns two thumbs up from me."

I enjoyed seeing the high school changing each each decade and I thought it was very interesting how the music was changing to reflect the state of the times. some people don't like the movie because they thing the opus at the end was a let down, but for me I love this movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

I am a University teacher myself, and I surely do know what it is like to get a tight connection to the students' hearts, without losing either your integrity or your authority. I felt what Holland felt, I understood what he did wrong and what he did best. All his ups and downs, all his misgivings, wrong ideas for the class, bad relations with his hearing-impaired son, tough relations with the local educational authorities - everything is shown admirably well. Also, and it should be pointed out, the movie is especially good at the scope. The 30 years of the US history are shown briefly but very vividly and really well. What is really weak is the sheer predictability. Many Hollywood films are made this way - Good/Bad, Up/Down, White/Black. I mean, I could easily foretell when in the next scene Holland will have a problem or its graceful solution. Also, the grand finale is too sweet. I understand, Hollywood dictates the rules, so the serious film must have a refreshing, sweet final. But it was all too much. Too sweetish, too bombastic. Notwithstanding all that, in general, the movie is one of the few that really shows what teaching job is."
"charlessmith702210","10","3","5","11 December 2006"," A very good saga of a music teacher dealing with the changes in the decades
","This is almost like a saga in four acts.<br/><br/>In the 1950s (Act 1), Glenn Holland starts off life as a music teacher at Kennedy High School, with his wife, Iris, on his side. He is told by the high school administrator to start a marching band for his high school although he was not yet trained in marching band techniques. He had to learn the techniques quickly.<br/><br/>At that point, Glenn befriends a Black bass drummer of the band who could not hear the beat during the time the band rehearsed the ""Stars and Stripes Forever"". He eventually makes that drummer find his beat, and he does!<br/><br/>But in the parade scene, as the school marching band passes by (with Glenn acting like Professor Harold Hill in the ""Music Man""), Iris has already became pregnant and has a baby named Cole, as both were parade spectators. The fire engine that goes by after the marching band sets off a deafening sound of its horn that lasts for about 15-20 seconds--right in front of them. Looks like the simulated din was 150 decibels and she didn't know what to do with that noise. That confusion caused her not to block Cole's ears from the fire engine horn blast....but as the camera does a close-up shot on Cole, as well as the sound editing---you realize that Cole's ears ended up permanently damaged because of that one-time noise exposure.<br/><br/>Not until Glenn and Iris realize that Cole could not hear sounds pretty well and could not respond to his parents' calls that they realized something was wrong and they took him to an audiologist. The audiologist tells them the very bad news---Cole is 85% deaf.<br/><br/>Glenn responds by holding one class talk at the high school about Beethoven and his bout with complete deafness.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on to the 1960s/1970s (Act II), the black bass drummer who found his beat is drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, but the movie doesn't mention it until Glenn gets a letter saying that he was killed fighting in Vietnam. He then goes to his funeral to meet the surviving parents but he doesn't know it was a military funeral until the banging volleys from a 21-gun salute go off.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on to the 1980s (Act III), Cole (now growing up from baby boy to preteen son) is trying to go on with his life dealing with his hearing impairment by learning sign language, and Glenn wanted to do a big singing project, which because of budget tightening was reduced to doing a short Broadway revue honoring George Gershwin. He then befriends a very talented singing lady, Rowena Morgan (played by Jean Louisa Kelley) after the revue was a smashing success..but the friendship ended when Rowena said that she wanted to go to New York to start a Broadway career. Then, Glenn helps Cole feel the final part of the last movement of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony by introducing special lights that move to the beat of the music...as well as a large amplified speaker.<br/><br/>In the final part of the movie, the 1990s (Act IV), Glenn finds out that his favorite program at Kennedy High School that he did for about 30 years--music--was going to be accessed by administrative budget cuts. This angered Glenn so much that his long-kept secret was revealed as his music tenure at Kennedy was about to end. This came in his big ""opus""---his final public performance at the school, as he conducted his own ""American Symphony"" , which featured some of the high school's alumni as well as active students in his last orchestral performance as a conductor. The work combined elements of classical, pop, and rock and I described it as a short soundtrack to his very strong devotion to not only music teaching--but music per se."

What was the name of that song she was practicing to play for the band later on in the movie. I would really like to know. I really enjoyed this film and the transition Richard Dreyfuess made from young to old. I feel he was a very great person for this part and showed audiences that he can still hold a movie on his own. I thought the music was especially well chosen. And one of my favorite scenes was the one where he taught that girl.

"edwagreen","10","3","5","8 January 2006"," **** Required for All Teachers
","Finally, a realistic picture about teaching.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss is memorable as a new teacher in Mr. Holland's Opus.<br/><br/>He begins a 30 year career as a music teacher in a large high school. He comes across his principal, Mrs. Jacobs, who demands a month of lesson plans in advance on her desk in the morning. Any teacher can understand what that is. Then, there is an assistant principal, devilishly played by, William H. Macy, who takes an instant dislike to Mr. Holland. He can't wait to""rat"" him out to Mrs. Jacobs.<br/><br/>Seeing that traditional teaching methods are not working, Holland tries unorthodox ways which of course riles Macy.<br/><br/>The irony that a music teacher would have a child who is deaf. Beethoven could best understand that frustration.<br/><br/>When Mrs. Jacobs informs Holland of her retirement, she says something to him that all teachers would love to hear: ""You were my favorite teacher."" Of course, Macy becomes the principal and as the years pass,the two still have a contentious relationship, as their hair turns gray.<br/><br/>Holland works on that forever opus and is almost ready to give everything up and run away with a student until common sense prevails.<br/><br/>After 30 years, there are budget cuts and the Music Department will be eliminated. Sounds familiar in today's climate?<br/><br/>Mr. Holland will be forced into retirement but not before a rousing tribute by his present and former pupils. One very special student appears and it's a delight to see how far she has come.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss, in a memorable Oscar nominated performance, is magnificent. He conveys the ideals of a teacher and what we have to go through. <br/><br/>This is truly a welcomed film for its reality and emotions shown."

"tfrizzell","Null","3","5","25 November 2000"," Richard Dreyfuss' Best
","Richard Dreyfuss received an Oscar nomination in 1995 as the title character, a man who decides to teach so he will have more time to write music and conduct.  Of course he learns real quick that teaching is time-consuming and that he has no extra time at all.  The plan to teach for a few years turns into a career and the audience gets to experience all of the teacher's ups (a son being born, learning to love his work, creating a top-notch music and arts department) and downs (learning his son is deaf, learning of the death of one of his former students in Vietnam, and learning that his department's funding will likely be cut, forcing him to retire before he wants to).  ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" works because of a great performance by Dreyfuss.  He makes everyone else in the film better as well (Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, and Louisa Kelly).  The direction is strong and the screenplay is even stronger.  A great film.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"gagewyn","Null","7","17","17 January 2000"," Entire Plot and emotional content can be summarized in a 45 second preview
","The main value of this film is for baby boomers to go out and see it and get all nostalgic.  For a nostalgia film it is not that well done.  The music of the various decades when Mr Holland is teaching is painfully shoved into a simplistic plot.  The emotional and inspirational interactions between students and teacher are similarly simple.<br/><br/>If you see a preview for this at the beginning of another tape, then you have pretty much seen the movie.  The plot is the typical teacher believes in something and spreads his intensity to the students- Oh how sweet.  I am just touched by this heartwarming experience.  I sat around and mocked this with friends of mine who are heavily into band.  OK, so Mr Holland spent thirty years watching the band department fritter away and composing and opus made up of bits of classical music so well known that I, with no musical training could pick them out.  I mean gee itÕs not as if there arenÕt thousands of aspiring composers out there who could have provided.<br/><br/>The bottom line is nostalgic gushy liberal people who like to think of themselves as artistic people or patrons of the arts will really like this, and the rest of us will have reactions ranging from vaguely bored to disgust.  At any rate a second viewing would be a waste of time, but once is worth a shot if you are a gooshy person.  If you are looking for something different this film is not for you."
"harry-76","3","7","17","30 March 1999"," An Annoying Film
","This was a particularly vexing film to watch. Here is a frustrated young composer who doesn't have the gumption to make a commitment to his craft, and sheepishly takes a job as a high school music teacher, just to ""have something to fall back on.""  It's certainly depressing to see his character waist his life engaging in a second-choice activity, for fear of taking the necessary professional plunge and pursuing his dream. So he toils away for years until he's ready to retire--then he's rewarded with a cheering assembly full of high schoolers and treated to a performance of a musical composition he wrote (though we've seldom seen him working at his craft). Not that the piece is remarkable, just percussive, brassy and rhythmic. Talk about a downer film experience!"
"SEN-3","1","10","27","13 December 1999"," lots of problems with this film
","I am immediately skeptical when a movie about music or a musician is made. That is not to say that such a movie can't be made well; Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984) was both entertaining AND accurate, at least in terms of script details which pertained to music theory, performance and literature. Mr. Holland's Opus, however, falls miles short of this goal.<br/><br/>The myriad factual mistakes in the movie only lower my opinion.  For one thing, it IS normal (in fact, necessary) to empty the spit valve of a brass instrument in mid-performance.  For another thing, Mr. Holland lectures his students about Beethoven's deafness as if it were complete and nearly life-long, which it wasn't.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland himself is, as a character, unlikable through the entire movie. He is a less-than-stellar teacher who lacks the patience to do anything besides yell at his less-than-stellar students.  He appears to be hard at work for a huge chunk of his life on this magnificent ""opus.""  Upon hearing his work at the end, his composition is revealed to sound like something a dime-a-dozen Hollywood filmscore writer would vomit out in a couple of hours time.<br/><br/>This movie was made to appeal to devoted (however uneducated) music lovers. It's message is mixed, and therefor weak; at the end, the music program is cut from the school, resulting in not a victory for the community, but rather a tiny, meaningless, symbolic ""victory"" for Mr. Holland (who emerges only as victorious as finally hearing his mediocre ""opus"" performed live can make him).  Furthermore, the young clarinetist who Mr. Holland tries so hard to cultivate ends up a politician rather than a musician, which suggests to me that Mr. Holland's stint as an educator has been completely fruitless."
"moonspinner55","3","4","8","27 November 2016"," Shameless
","Richard Dreyfuss, director Stephen Herek and screenwriter Patrick Sheane Duncan attempt to pull off a cinematic hat-trick with ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" yet this feat is impossible when none of them appears to know anything about music or high school music bands. Their film is pure sentiment, not existing as anything but a formula nosegay thanks to the built-in nostalgia factor and the 'emotional' score from Michael Kamen. Duncan's script is ostensibly about an indefatigable music teacher and his students, their scattered triumphs and lumpy relationships as seen through many years' time, though Herek turns the proceedings into a recycled lovefest. The picture is certainly well-produced, though the shameless, plastic-coated sincerity with which it was made is nearly enough to sink Dreyfuss' Oscar-nominated lead performance. *1/2 from ****"
"ray-280","1","9","24","2 October 2007"," Bloom County's Opus was far more impressive
","How dare this film soil the name of Opus, the great cartoon penguin from Bloom County, who is quoted to this day. That Opus lived his dream, knew who he was, and left his unique mark on life. Mr. Holland's ""Opus,"" by comparison, only confirmed his invisibility and historical irrelevance. We are to think that Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is one of life's unsung heroes for changing the lives of young people through music, but he is merely unsung, a man of little achievement who does little more than feed our tax coffers while doing what those who cannot do, do: teach.<br/><br/>Dreyfuss, who owes most of his carer to the overrated The Goodbye Girl (1977), tries, and fails yet again, to deliver an Oscar-worthy performance. Had he won for this performance, I would have lobbied stronger for making one actor a year give the award back.<br/><br/>Here we get the story of a touring musician who settles into a teaching job for financial stability, and so he can compose music in his spare time, only to learn that teaching is fulfilling all its own. On the other hand, we don't see successful musicians or composers giving up their lives for teaching, so the entire premise is flawed. This guy is not a success, and is simply making the most out of failure, while the children he ""inspires"" are making the most out of their indentured servitude in the education system. The supporting cast, which includes the equally overrated Olympia Dukakis as the principal, makes this one of the worst big-budget films of all time.<br/><br/>Not only do I recommend not watching it, but also disowning anyone who ever decides to play it when you have no choice but to watch it (such as if you are stuck at a friend's house and can't jump out the window to avoid it). If you must watch this film, please set your sights higher than the loser of a lead character did, and don't ever convince yourself you are so happy with so little."
"Benito-5","2","9","24","13 December 1999"," Cliches, inept music, and bad acting - oh what fun.
","My first complaint is one that can be applied to almost every popular movie about music, to whit, a movie about someone who has a passion for music should have competently written music in it. Also, there should be no flaws in musicology. If one is not going to get every detail right on music, one should make a movie about dinosaurs or middle-aged housewives meeting old college flames or hard-hearted cynics finding a spark of warmth in the world. One who is not willing to understand that in music, more than in any other field (besides rocket science), the devil is in the details.<br/><br/>However, that having been said, there are movies (Amadeus comes to mind) where the history and music were inaccurately portrayed but still worked as movies. Mr. Holland does not make up for the shortcomings. It is clicheed, poorly scripted, and not well acted. I cannot say that there is a great movie about passion for music driving a composer. Probably because popular romantic notions about artists and composers are silly and wrong to begin with, a movie based on such a flawed premise is destined to fail. Music is interesting, so study music, study music theory, study music history. Learn what makes good music good and bad music bad (it is not all that subjective). Do not waste time on inane pap like Mr. Holland's Opus."
"classicsoncall","8","2","3","2 July 2018"," ""Well, there's a lot more to music than notes on a page.""
","I'm sure I've said it in one or more of my other reviews, but I don't think I could ever be a teacher. I just don't have the patience for it, and I have to admire someone like Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) who can put aside those feelings of frustration when it seems like he's not connecting with his students, or when they're just not that interested in what he's teaching. The story actually starts out that way, and I could identify with Holland the first time he erupts in class, only with me, it would probably be for the entire semester. So I acknowledge that deficiency on my part, and give teachers all the credit in the world they deserve. <br/><br/>The interesting thing is how Mr. Holland found himself stuck as a teacher much the same way young student Gertrude Lang remained stuck as an ineffective musician. Holland needed to reach into his inner reservoir of humanity to strike just the right chord in order for Gertrude to overcome the obstacle that hindered her ability. Once that hurdle was cleared, she was able to participate in the band successfully, even if it was not her career ambition. I liked the way that scenario played out. I think we probably all have had teachers in our past that struck just that right chord to make classroom participation enjoyable and steer us in the right direction. <br/><br/>It wasn't until Holland introduced his class to the connection between Bach and rock n' roll that he really hit his stride. Making subjects fun is an admirable skill that a lot of teachers just don't get. It's unfortunate however that Holland couldn't translate some of that teaching ability to his home life and relationship with his own son. But that in time did also improve, a case of Holland learning how to be a talented human being as well as a talented teacher. So all in all, ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is an inspiring story, showing how a single individual can affect the lives of so many in ways that are both visible and invisible. Every school deserves to have at least one teacher on board like Mr. Holland, inspiring students and faculty alike."

","Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace."

And when Holland learns that his own son loves music its just gets that much better.<br/><br/>I have and will continue to recommend this movie to anyone who will listen.

","I've read some of the reviews here and I'm inclined to think a group of crabby, miserable no-life's got together and decided to low-rate and bash this movie on silly, ridiculous grounds. Some say they ""hate"" this movie and are ""offended"" by it. Um, really? This is among the most non-controversial movies you will ever see, lol. To ""hate"" something so light-hearted says A LOT more about you than it does this film. But I digress...<br/><br/>I just caught this movie on television and was reminded of how much I enjoyed it back in '95 when it was released. What a delight. As Mr. Holland says in the movie, music is not something you ""know,"" it's something you appreciate, something you feel. I think this is a sentiment that especially applies to those commenters who ""hate"" the movie because it's historically inaccurate. My response: WHO CARES? The supposed inaccuracy does NOT take away from the theme or the intention of the film. The film is intended to evoke inspiration and sentimentalism and it does precisely that. It's a smart movie, but it's not at its core a ""thinking"" film--it is a FEELING person's movie. Like most great movies, its power is that it touches you on the inside. You totally miss the boat if you think about it too much or nit-pick here and there.<br/><br/>If you love music and learning and passion and reflection, this movie is for you. Please don't be fooled by the ridiculous low-rating of 7 here. It's an absolute tear-jerker--I cried twice and I'm not a boo-hooer--and a feel-gooder. If you have a pulse and you're not an ""accuracy"" snob, you WILL enjoy this film and I recommend adding it to your DVD collection.

We went to see this movie together and literally sobbed through just about the whole movie! I absolutely loved the way Richard Dreyfus portrayed Mr. Holland through all the stages of his teaching career. By the end of the movie, I felt that I actually knew Mr. Holland. I felt that I was able to take part in his career and that I gained something just from watching this movie. To this day, I consider Mr. Holland's Opus my very favorite movie to the point where nothing else even comes close! <br/><br/>Incidentally, my best friend and I are both now teachers and hope that we can have even some of the impact on our students that Mr. Holland was able to have on his."

I think sometimes it's good to drop your guards, just be yourself and enjoy whatever it is even if it means wetting a couple of tissues. But having said this, I think the sentiments shown in the movie are quite genuine and at least I didn't feel that I was watching a mush.<br/><br/>I have always felt that true teachers, the ones that really inspire you, could be counted on your fingers of your left hand. Richard Dreyfuss plays one such music teacher who would not hesitate to play rock n roll in a class of classical music, if it helps his students to understand and appreciate music better. Richard Dreyfuss is absolutely convincing in this role of Mr. Holland that spans 30 years of his career.<br/><br/>Actually Mr. Holland is a composer who has taken up teaching just to pay his bills. He wants to be rich and famous and has been working on a symphony that would help him achieve that but that's not how it turns out to be. He is not rich and not famous, certainly not outside his small community. Is he a failure? The story of our lives (at least most of us)."
"w_brianna","Null","2","3","26 May 2000"," It's Good!
","I do not agree with any of the critics on this page. Mr. Holland's Opus is a brilliant movie. It's intelligent, interesting and inspiring. You shouldn't tear it apart and analyse every minute detail about its musical accuracy. This is just a movie, but a very good one at that. Someone here by the nickname of ""spleen"" was the most wrong though: ""The entire movie is just a re-statement of the old chestnut about music being an expression of emotion. Well, that's NOT what music is. Music is an intellectual art."" That's total crap. Perhaps ""spleen"" learnt to play music for the wrong reasons (i.e. to show off, seem smarter/more inetellectual than others), you sir/ma'm, may have leart to play the classics but have not one musical fibre in your body, otherwise you wouldn't be so misguided. Any real musicians/songwriters know that music IS BORN out of EMOTION. Music is an expression of what comes from the deepest place within a person's heart and soul, and these internal emotions is what puts the pen to paper.  If you were to write a song that is not inspired by emotion, you'd have a lifeless ditty most often used for something like breakfast cereal commercials on TV. If you want real music you can't even start without emotion. To say that music is intellectual art, and nothing else is totally wrong. Anybody who has the talent can play and write music, it has nothing to do with intellect, or social class/status as ""spleen"" seem to apply.<br/><br/>But enough about that and let's get back to the movie. Contrary to some of the other comments, I have found the acting to be of very high quality from all the actors, especially Richard Dreyfuss, who should have gotten an oscar for this performance. The script is well crafted, the story itself is very involving, and moving.<br/><br/>The only flaw I found in the whole movie is at the end where we finally get to hear Mr. Holland's opus. Well, it certainly disappoints and if Mr. Holland really existed, his opus would be much much better than what we're presented with here, but again we're dealing with a movie here, movie makers don't really know/care about how to compose a really great song, they probably hired a budget composer to come up with the bit, which is a shame really as it adds a dent to this otherwise realistic, well thought-out movie.<br/><br/>Overall Mr. Holland's Opus is a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone. It is somewhat long, but considering the story and how it depicts 30 years in someone's life, the length is justified indeed (and at no point does it ever get boring).<br/><br/>Mr. Holland's Opus is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy night, tucked in bed all nice and cosy. 9 out of 10 stars."

","I am truly surprised by the attacks on this movie. It is a very moving film reminiscent of Goodbye Mr. Chips, The Browning Version, Three Cheers for Miss Bishop, and even It's a Wonderful Life. In all of these movies (except the last), a teacher feels that his or her life is wasted because his or her ambition or (in Miss Bishop's case, grand love) was unrealized. However, the climax of the movie comes when the protagonist realizes that he/she has actually touched many lives for the better.<br/><br/>Most of the negative comments below are about the musical knowledge shown in the movie. I'm sure that would not bother the average viewer. The movie is quite sentimental at heart, but is more realistic in showing the protagonist's frustrations and anger over his frustration than most of the ones listed above.

"Ken Sinderberry","Null","2","3","16 May 2000"," Great struggle as a teacher
","Mr.Holland started his teaching career very poorly but as he went on he learned how to become a very good teacher. He wanted to go in and be a dictator, go in and tell the student's to do this and do that. But after speaking to his wife he learned how to make it fun by relating what he wanted to teach to things the students liked. The issue with the girl who was bad at playing the clarinet, he pulled her aside and used his time (i.e. After school) to teach the girl. I think this is a good way of getting students to catch up to the rest of the class. If you truly want to be a good teacher you have to put in the time during your own time. If I have students lagging behind I don't plan to stop the whole class and teach at their level because that is not fair to the smarter students. I would assign different work, give extra help to the students who are finding it tough until they have an understanding and do the same level of work the smart kids are. Mr.Holland was motivated by his wife, I can't recall their conversation but she said something to him that made him tick that he had to teach on a different level. I don't know how to get teachers who have lost interest in the job to become motivated again. Maybe for these teachers it is better if they give the job up and move onto something that they are highly motivated to do. Maybe they could ask the student's how they want to learn it could turn out that their definition of fun is yours and that could re-light the spark that has gone. I believe that this is a true interruption of teaching, of course not all teachers but I would bet that there were and are teachers who are completely frustrated by the job and want to give it in straight away without really giving it ago. That those teachers find something that makes them get up in the morning and really look forward to going to work and being infront of those students. I don't have the magic answer to what that is because I think that it is a personal thing that in no way is the same for everyone. We all need to find what makes us go, we are all here now learning to be teachers so we all have some sort of drive to be here, we just have to keep that drive going when we graduate and get a job and then I think we'll all make excellent teachers. I think I've gone on enough now, if anyone wants to discuss what I wrote I look forward to reading your letter. After all that's what this discussion list is all about. Ken Sinderberry."

"Altaira","Null","2","3","1 July 1999"," a true band geek festival
","I was still in high school when ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" came out, and it was immediately popular with the ""band geek"" crowd.  A band geek is someone who has made all their friends through band, dated exclusively through band, and generally loves band.  Nerdy, yeah, it is, and I was one of that crowd. But we sure had fun.  That fun is displayed nicely in Opus, through Richard Dreyfuss's career as a high school band teacher.  My friends particularily enjoyed the scenes that depicted the common, everyday tribulations in the band room: learning how to hold your instrument, much less play it, staggering backwards in muted agony after that first unison note.<br/><br/>Near the end, the music program at Glen Holland's school is put into jeopardy.  This is, unfortunately, a sad fact that happens ALL too often in our schools.  Dreyfuss has a line to the effect of, you'll cut band but I guarantee you'll never cut football.  My former high school struggled with that very same vicious arts vs. athletics debate not too long ago.  It seems sports are always paramount to creativity.  But that is a discussion, not a review. Anyway, the subplot involving Glen Holland and his student, Rowena Morgan--the musical star, is uncomfortable because that too can happen in real life.  Although student and teacher thankfully do NOT have a relationship in Opus, this problem is latent and real in our society.  We do not hear about it all that much, but honestly, one occurance is one too many.  The movie does a good job of letting the viewer realize what is going on, yet doesn't subject us to anything further. Lastly, Richard Dreyfuss is commendable as the aging music teacher, who goes from young and unwilling to teach to silver-haired and fighting to stay in the classroom.  The make up effects here are wholly believable and Dreyfuss's performance is one of the most realistic depictions of a high school music teacher."

I understand that music is a very serious topic for many people including several reviewers who hated this film. But I think they miss the point; Mr. Holland is not a musical genius, he's a high school music teacher. And yes, his opus truly sucks balloons, and that's because Mr. Holland is a musical mediocrity.

So one can explain things clearly and get nowhere unless they present it in a context that sparks interest.

"classicalsteve","4","3","6","17 April 2016"," Rather Contrvied Storyline with an Embarrassingly Bad and Cliché-Ridden Piece at the End
","I guess ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" was supposed to be about an inspirational music teacher throughout his career to give the audience tears of sentimental joy. As a classical musician, all I can say is ""Oh brother"". There are some really fine films in this sub-genre about teachers, mentors, or coaches engaging with students, athletes, etc., including ""Dead Poet's Society"", ""Hoosiers"", and probably the finest one, ""Stand and Deliver"". ""Stand and Deliver"" was based on a real teacher who found creative ways to speak and teach to minority students struggling in East Los Angeles. As far as I know, ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" wasn't based on a real music teacher, and too many of the incidences shown were clearly written by people who knew next-to-nothing about the music universe.<br/><br/>Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is an aspiring musician who has dreams of making it big as an established composer. He then takes a position at a high school as their music teacher as a means to compose. Of course, the inevitable ""resentment"" of the other faculty emerges as he proves to be one of the most popular teachers in the school. Simultaneously, the faculty constantly belittle the value of teaching music in the classroom. As a classical musician myself, I applaud the idea of an inspirational music teacher fighting for the importance of the arts and music public high schools. However, I found the premise so obviously contrived I couldn't help saying to myself ""oh dear Lord"" in many scenes. I was in high school when there was drastic cutting of arts and music funding, but I never found the faculty dismissive of the music teachers. <br/><br/>One of the other terrible aspects of this film is whoever produced it didn't bother to simply hire a bona fide orchestral conductor and show Dreyfuss how to conduct. While I will agree Dreyfuss' performance is relatively good given the material, his conducting is absolutely god-awful. The upbeat cue to begin a piece is completely incorrect. You don't just start slide into it after a couple of little beats. You actually take a virtual ""breath"" and clearly indicate the cue beat which signals the performers to begin. And he constantly moves his upper body up and down with the beat as he conducts, which is complete no-no as it's distracting to the performers. If the character is supposed to be this amazing musician, why does it seem like he never took conducting in college? <br/><br/>While he's teaching during many years, he's writing ""An American Symphony"" on the side, supposedly his magnum opus. At the end of the film, as a tribute to him, many of his former students, now adults, produce a concert to play his ""opus"". And then it's really OMG, this is so bad. His final piece is a silly ultra-cliché-ridden little monster masquerading as a ""great orchestral work"". All the melodies sound like overused tracks from bad films from the 1970's, including an unremarkable string theme, used ad infinitum on many pieces and songs from the mid-20th century. Also the piece is not truly orchestrated in terms of varying the instruments. All the instruments play ""tutti"" constantly, in other words, all the instruments play during the whole piece. This is not how orchestral works are written. The music should vary with different instruments playing melody and harmony in different passages, otherwise the piece becomes monotonous, which literally means ""sounding the same"". In great works, only in a few dramatic moments does an orchestra play tutti. And the drum section only makes the whole thing sound pop-oriented; I couldn't take it seriously. The Opus really does sound like a high school student's first stab at writing an orchestral work. It doesn't even sound good enough for the Boston Pops who were always playing very light orchestral music. Unfortunately, Holland's ""opus"" wasn't even so bad it's good. Even rock songs from the 1980's are more easily tolerated than the ""Opus"".<br/><br/>The good films in this genre have a lot of bite and grit in them, particularly ""Stand and Deliver"" and ""Dead Poet's Society"". Both deal with social and societal issues. Some of the best, like ""Stand and Deliver"" were based on true-life experiences. However, ""Opus"" is too saccharine and contrived for its own good. While Mr. Holland deals with his student's problems, I never got the sense the story was real but rather artificial and written by people who didn't really know this subject. And the Opus at the end proved that Holland really wasn't that great a composer. He's lucky he received his job in the first place! Of course, there are many fans of this film, and I am sure I've caused many grievances with this review. However I can tell you, no matter how much this film may ""move you"", this is not what I experienced as a classical musician in school. There's a lot more blood, sweat and tears than what's shown here. Students don't always listen to the teacher, sometimes playing when they shouldn't be. Some teachers berate lesser-skilled players. Playing music in educational institutions is not the easiest of tasks including both student and teacher alike, but I don't believe the makers of ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" quite understood that."
"aberlour36","8","3","6","1 June 2007"," Heart-warming but flawed
","This is a lovely film, designed successfully to bring tears to the eyes of everyone seeing it. The acting is superb all the way around. Dreyfuss is a wonder. But there are quite a few historical flaws (see the goof section on this film) and mistakes. The lack of synchronization between the musicians and the music is maddening. The caliber of playing is far too high for the age-level of the players in the later stages of the film. And the absolutely stunning Jean Louisa Kelly was too old and too good to be a high school student. (She had recently graduated from Columbia University.) The film is also too long. A treacly bit about a black student who lacked rhythm and then died in Vietnam could easily have been skipped. By the way, at the funeral, the parents of the young man are shown in mourning. But sitting next to them, ostensibly a relative, is a young woman who is smiling during both shots of the family. That's the kind of carelessness that marred this otherwise fine film. One more thing: teachers will know that it isn't that easy to win the hearts and minds of young people. Mr. Holland as an educator must have doing things off camera."

","Spoilers.  What saves this movie is Richard Dreyfus' performance and the delicious tightening of the screws as the sentimentality increases.  The plot isn't novel.  We've seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" a thousand times. Then there are the several versions of ""Good-bye, Mister Chips.""  Surely other versions that I can't remember of the guy/woman who finds himself/herself in a job that seems unrewarding, then, after a lifetime of attempted escapes, seems finally rejected by the system he's resented, like a ship deserting a sinking rat.  But no!  The man/woman has had more of a benificent influence than he/she has thought.  And this despite the tribulations of deaf children (in this case), alcoholism, existential despair, mismanaged marriages, mental illness, or crippling dandruff.  At the end all of his friends and supporters gather in a final handkerchief-drenching salute.<br/><br/>It's a little difficult to imagine Richard Dreyfus exercising self restraint but he does it here, and very effectively.  The plot developments are almost entirely predictable.  The student who can't play the clarinet winds up governor.  The one who can't play the drums is lost in Vietnam.  (The film covers 30 years.)  The gorgeous young senior who falls in love with him becomes a stage success.  Through it all, Dreyfus plays, not Dreyfus, but Mr. Holland.  He's quite good.  And he gets ample support from people like Bill Macy and Olympia Dukakis.<br/><br/>A secondary plot has him in a kind of love/hate relationship with his hearing-challenged son, Cole.  What a disappointment for a music teacher and composer.  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a child who's deaf.  (The script writers went overboard on irony here.)  When John Lennnon is murdered, Dreyfus has a big silent fight with Cole, who protests that he too feels Lennon's loss, although his old man gives him no credit for it. This is resolved when Dreyfus realizes how wrong he's been, and at a tribute for the murdered ex-Beatle sings Lennon's simple, touching song, ""Beautiful Boy.""  He alters the last line of the lyric, so that it becomes, ""Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful -- Cole.""  Not being morons, the audience could have done without that change.<br/><br/>But no matter.  It's an above-average uplifting story.  Every time the bell rings an angel gets his wings, you know.  The only problem I have is that, what lingers most tellingly, is not the one and only performance of Mr. Holland's composition, but his reply to a friend who offers to help however he can, now that Mr. Holland is fired for budgetary reasons, perhaps a letter of reference.  Dreyfus says, ""I'm sixty years old.  Who are you going to write a letter of reference to -- the morgue?""  I hope he enjoyed conducting his opus."

When he actually signed C-O-L-E, I remember sort of looking at my best friend and we both started laughing.

I never felt any affection for Mr. Holland. He comes across as a selfish and egotistical little man. This guy treats his deaf son like a leper all his life and one sappy scene about John Lennon's death and we are supposed to believe their relationship is repaired. Also, Mr. Holland falls in love with a 17 year old student, lies to his wife about it and contemplates leaving with her for NYC. The ending is so unoriginal, I had to laugh.

"Low Man","1","7","21","24 January 2008"," Hatefully Trivial
","I didn't write about this film right after seeing it because it made me so mad that I knew I'd be overly harsh with it.<br/><br/>It has now been many years, and I just looked over the comments already made, and I wasn't going to add anything until I saw one recommending lightening up on the film.<br/><br/>Why? One reason given is that of course it's not musically accurate, but it's no more inaccurate than Star Trek or Star Wars is to actual science. I can't argue with the bare facts of that statement, but...<br/><br/>I don't think anybody seriously believes there are Jedi running around fighting evil with light sabers or that there are hand held phasers out there. It's fantasy, and that's understood. Nearly everybody who isn't deprived of the ability to hear music knows about it, though.<br/><br/>My chief hatred of this movie lies in the fact that it perverts what a lot of people think music is. I have had more than one student say something like, ""I thought I just had to play the sunset."" Many people with such impressions will give up when that fantasy is shattered, and some under my tutelage have.<br/><br/>Star Trek and Star Wars never set a potential scientist on a false path like that. I even remember seeing specials on either the History Channel or A&E about scientists who were motivated by what they thought might be possible in those shows. The fantasy inspired in that case. It did not create a false expectation.<br/><br/>What this movie has to say about music and being a musician is trivial when it is not dead wrong. That is not simply bad, it is hateful.<br/><br/>A far better movie for dealing with this topic is a French one called ""Tous les matins du monde"", and I commented on that one at this address:<br/><br/>http://imdb.com/title/tt0103110/usercomments-19<br/><br/>It's not a film you can show your kids, but the whole musician conundrum is handled with far more subtlety and truth.<br/><br/>I know that there are plenty of other examples of Hollywood inaccuracy as far as film topics go. James Bond has little to do with real espionage. Rambo is not anything close to realistic as far as being a soldier goes.<br/><br/>Becoming a soldier or a spy, though, probably isn't something you try to become until long after such illusions are discarded. I have had adult students come to me thinking ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is completely accurate. One even asked me if I knew whatever became of Glenn Holland.<br/><br/>The piece of music at the end is pretty bad too, but I figured that was going to happen. There's an awful lot of music I hate that the general populace seems to love, but that does not trigger my revulsion for this film. The lack of reality also doesn't do it. ""Amadeus"" doesn't have a lot of factual accuracy in it either, but I still find it entertaining.<br/><br/>It is the trivialization of what music is and what being a musician means that gets to me. If they had just tried to make an entertaining movie, I probably would have found it OK, but this contemptible piece of twaddle trivializes something that needs more serious attention, and I can't forgive that."

Instead he became a role model for his students in the high school in which he taught, giving a few excellent guidance, which helped them out later in life. Great movie."
"Spleen","3","5","15","21 October 1999"," Brainless, and therefore unemotional
","Our society seems to care much more about sport than about music.  Compare the relative prestige of Mr. Dreyfuss and the football coach.  Hell will freeze over before the latter will be forced to suffer the indignities of the former.  But `Mr. Holland's Opus' is just one more indignity - yet another illustration of our lack of respect towards music.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland's opus - titled `American Symphony', as if no American had ever written a symphony before - is a bare two minutes long.  It's also twaddle. Holland has reinforced an ordinary, unchallenging tune with schlocky drum beat as if he's afraid we won't be able to tell where the bar lines fall without help.  THIS is what he's been working on all his life?  Ten minutes, MINIMUM, is what we should have had to sit through - ten minutes of GOOD music - if the film was going to be at all serious about paying music the kind of respect we pay sport.<br/><br/>It's for this reason we're glad that Mr. Holland gives up his pipe-dream of being a professional composer and in favour of a profession where he might actually do some good; the trouble is, he's not a very good teacher, either. Yes, people are inspired by him, but that's because the script is rigged. Observe:<br/><br/>(1)  As his music reveals he has no quality control.  His supposedly enlightened appreciation of the Beatles, for instance, carries no weight at all, since he's one of those tiresome people who like everything.<br/><br/>(2)  He's forever having stupid ideas.  He gives a concert for the deaf - BEFORE political correctness of this kind was fashionable enough to give him some kind of an excuse.  He wastes public money on a ludicrous screen of flashing coloured light bulbs that's meant to give deaf people some idea what they're missing ... I mean, really.<br/><br/>(3)  He confuses Stravinsky with Shostakovich.<br/><br/>(4)  He gives absurd - nay, incomprehensible - advice to students, asking a clarinettist to imagine a sunset and then `play the sunset'.  I can imagine the composer bounding into the room and bellowing, `I wrote a SONATA, not a damned sunset.'<br/><br/>The entire movie is just a re-statement of the old chestnut about music being an expression of emotion.  Well, that's NOT what music is.  Music is an intellectual art.  Even the `simple' delight we take in a good tune - not that the film provides us with very many of those - is an intellectual pleasure.  And here's the rub: because we are never called upon to use our brains, because the film never shows us the complicated mechanics of REAL musical instruction or music, we can't understand Mr. Holland's emotional involvement to his craft, either."

The premise of this film is a bunch of loosely-connected vignettes that involve a frustrated composer becoming a teacher, and reluctantly growing to love his students. These students return at the end of the story to perform a tearful rendition of Mr Holland's 5 minute masterpiece. 5 minutes! This composition has apparently taken him most of his adult life to write. Again, 5 minutes!This is the greatest contrivance of this underwhelming and ultimately infuriating piece of heartstring-tugging tripe. My advice? Watch ""Dead Poets Society"" again. You'll find more that is new in the hundredth viewing of that masterpiece than you will in one viewing of this shower of offal."

","It is amazing that this movie is held in such high regard considering its abundant mediocrity. It does have an engaging cast, but the story and writing are unbelievable or cliché. There is more authenticity in any episode of ""The Wonder Years,"" which seems to have been a stimulus for the writer to scribe a high school teacher's soap opera set against the realism of the turbulent '60s. I would be astounded to find out that any part of this movie was based on anyone's actual experience as a teacher. As devoted as teachers may be to their thankless profession, the prospect of a teacher so removed and distant from his hearing impaired son is ludicrous. There is no believable explanation for this strained relationship. If Mr. Holland had a hang up because his son was deaf--guilt, anger, etc., the film makes no such connection."

Richard Dreyfuss may have had the role of a lifetime in his performance of music teacher Glenn Holland, and his extraordinary range shows he has been one of the most underrated talents in American acting. This is an uplifting movie the whole family can watch and get something out of: a movie of uncompromising depth that doesn't pander or cut corners to fit into a formula.

","Maybe I just needed a break from watching too many Bergman movies, but I liked this sentimental and predictable movie covering thirty years in the life of a high school music teacher. High school being in my distant past, this movie brought back a lot of wistful memories. Even something as simple as remembering how the vacant hallways turn to chaotic madness at the sound of a bell was cause for nostalgia. <br/><br/>The teacher in question, Glenn Holland, gets into the profession in order to have a day job while he works on composing. But the job eats up most of his time and, when he and his wife have a child, his early dreams have little chance of ever being realized. Many people back into life-long jobs and, as Mr. Holland, they grow into their professions and find them rewarding.<br/><br/>Most everybody has memories of good teachers, and Glenn Holland will probably bring them to mind. That in itself makes this movie worth seeing. We don't have all that many movies about teachers, so there is room for one more. In fact we have very few movies that concentrate on any profession in a serious way. In many movies it is hard to figure out just how people are making their livings.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfus' performance is what raises this movie above the average. Tracing a life over a period of thirty years is always a challenge and that challenge was met here, both in terms of capturing the cultural changes from 1964 to 1995 and in terms of Dreyfus' physical appearance and emotional outlook.<br/><br/>The story is pretty predictable, but, hey, think of all of those sports movies where the home team wins in the final scene. This movie has more substance than most of those movies that seem to be churned out on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>I have to say that the talent in this high school far exceeds anything that I recall in my high school. Holland has his orchestra sounding like a first-rate community orchestra. And the Gershwin review was far from amateurish - enjoyable in its own right. In my high school of over 3,000 students we had nobody to compare with the voice and poise of Jean Kelly.<br/><br/>There are some good scenes, like the one where Dreyfus urges Kelly to take the risk and follow her dreams and go to New York to pursue a singing career. That scene ends with Dreyfus staring into space with a melancholy gaze - is he regretting that he did not take the risk he is encouraging Kelly to take, or is he realizing that he never had a talent comparable to hers? I thought that Holland's having to struggle to teach the black kid how to find the beat was a good touch.<br/><br/>If you can put your critical thinking on hold just a bit, you will enjoy this."

In fact, those who haven't had experience with this area of education may find the movie enables them to relate to the meaning music has played in others' lives.<br/><br/>However, I encourage all who read this post to investigate the possibility that a modern movie can speak to the magic of life itself, and the meaning thereof.

Moreover, ""Holland's"" bitter sweet ending is not merely tacked on, but is the logical result of the educational policies of this country.  This film celebrates the great American sense of community by elevating a teacher to heroic status.  This film is truly a wonderful acknowledegment of the hard work put forth every day on on behalf of our children by teachers.  This film is about real Americans, and needn't stray into the utterly fantastic to fill us with a se4nse of wonderment at the life led by Glen Holland.  This is ""Forrest Gump"" for thinking people. A nearly perfect film."

","Yeah, many people tease me about loving this movie so much, but what are movies for if not to make you feel good?<br/><br/>I remember when it came out, I hadn't seen the trailer, or heard anything about it, even though I was a projectionist at a movie theatre for some time.  In fact, I had started the movie dozens of times (but projectionist rarely watch every movie they project).  One day, while doing regular rounds and checking picture and audio, I caught the scene when they find out that Cole is deaf... I watched it for 2 minutes, and was already tearing up.<br/><br/>After that, I watched almost the entire movie twice each day for the next couple of days.  I still watch it on video and it just makes me feel so good and thankful that there are teachers out there who give so much of their lives for all of us during our growing years."
"petermaxie","Null","2","4","25 July 2000"," Made to benefit serious musicians, Mr. Holland's Opus does this, but at the expense of including any artistic music in the film
","Artistic composer Glenn Holland says: `I don't wanna be a studio musician.' Though it was 5 years ago, I still remember that I was the only person in the theater who laughed at this line. Why is it funny? Imagine a trained Shakespearian actor auditioning for Scooby Doo voice-overs. This is the sentiment behind Holland's subtly sardonic line. <br/><br/>Though Opus tries to be serious concerning the struggles of America's artistic musicians, its lack of musical authenticity (the lack of truly artistic music within it) directs its voice towards non-musicians. This may well have been deliberate since much of the funding for musical art must come from such lay people. The underlying issue, however, reveals the fact that most Americans clearly are not in the least bit interested in serious music nor traditional (classical) music education. Most Americans prefer non-serious music.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Opus was made by producers who apparently wish to use the film's melodramatic chutzpah to interest the nation in music education & its funding needs. There is irony in the fact that many of today's popular music artists are much less musically devoted than they are well versed in the business of music. Here is where music entertainment, not music art, is revealed as America's predominant music culture. Aside from the line above, the film doesn't address this issue. What it does address is the related issue of public school music education. It is related because many of America's artistic musicians make their livings as music educators.<br/><br/>There are reviewers below who disliked Opus while others are perplexed since they liked the film. The latter are correct; there is nothing wrong with a melodramatic film that is more melodramatic than it is faithful to musical ideology. But the fact that this melodramatic film with little insight into serious educational music was made into a political statement in defense of our nation's music education causes some of the musically faithful to call ""foul.""  Those offended are apparently unaware of the misrepresentation sometimes necessary in political attempts to influence people who need to be pushed into helping the needy & high minded.<br/><br/>Everything about Opus is like a liberal campaign with the best of intentions & the ability to connive its way into the hearts of taxpaying citizens. The film was made not by devoted artistic/educational musicians but by experienced film businessmen. These entertainment industry men hired The Seattle Symphony Orchestra & The Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra so as obviously to make themselves appear affiliated with artistic and educational music culture. The film was ostensibly about a frustrated, unemployed music composer, but all of the actual music in the film was composed by a successful music businessman whose achievements include the ""Die Hard"" film soundtracks. A few die-hard purist musicians get upset (reviews below) over these inconsistencies. Yet the more upset they get, the more they may be biting the hands that are attempting to feed them.<br/><br/>As I watched Dreyfuss making his speech on music education at the Oscars, I thought: That's an actor. What does he know about music? I had the same thoughts as I watched this film. This is the problem with being a musician who likes films. It's like being an astrophysicist trying to appreciate Star Wars.<br/><br/>Clearly, Opus is not a film easily digested by us serious musicians, despite the fact that its political aspirations are an attempt to aid us. The ironies abound in this situation. Such musicians are apt to disagree with its tagline: `It's not about the direction you take. It's about the direction you give.' It's the individualism found amongst serious classical music composers that is at odds with this very American morale. Couple this dispute with our current ""we"" generation, its distaste for egocentricity, and we find such serious composers veritable outsiders, indeed degenerates, in the opinions of mainstream Americans. It is not a pretty place to live, and the first few scenes of Opus illustrate this hardship. Holland also said: ""I don't wanna be a music teacher,"" but he became one and in the end the community said ""no thanks, we don't want a music teacher."" Pretty tough stuff.<br/><br/>For the political campaign to aid artistic & educational music, by all means see this film & afterwards contribute what you can to the cause. However, for real artistic & educational music, I recommend ""Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts"" & other such videos containing real artistic & educational music, many of which may be found listed here at IMDb."

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","15 October 2013"," A movie of shattered dreams, and the influence that you leave on others
","This movie receives an awful lot of praise and I find that I quite enjoy it as well. It chronicles the life of a music teacher at John F. Kennedy Highschool (arriving after the name was changed from Ulysses Grant Highschool). He came into the school reluctantly because he wanted some time to compose some music but ended getting caught up within the school.<br/><br/>Mr Holland's Opus is a movie about shattered dreams and about how what we look to do is not what we end up doing. Holland's dream is to write a symphony but he finds that he is doing too much to get any time to actually dedicate to it. He becomes a teacher and almost immediately after he has a child forcing him to buy a house. To pay off the house he decides to take up summer work which drains even more of his time. Each of these things are unplanned and he finds himself caught up in the affairs of the school for thirty years.<br/><br/>He is overjoyed at having a child and dreams of raising this child as a great musician, but once again his dream is shattered when he learns that the child is deaf. As such he begins to isolate himself from his son and embrace his students. He feels that he can not relate to his son because he believes that he cannot appreciate that which he loves. This causes dissension between Holland and his son because of this.<br/><br/>Mr Holland's Opus tries to create a real person with dreams, desires, and heartaches and it is a movie about how he confronts these heartaches. Though he finds that he cannot write his own music, he is drawn further into the school wanting to work with the students there. Another shattered dream comes when the jock who he teaches to play the drum is killed in Vietnam. He saw a lot of potential for the boy, especially how he struggled with his incapability to learn only to be killed in a war that nobody wanted. This is contrasted at the time with another student who is so intelligent that he ends up wasting Holland's time. Holland drags him along to a funeral to point out to him a real student who struggled to learn only to have his life struck away from him.<br/><br/>In the end Holland feels that he has gained nothing. He is dumped in a budget cut and even though he fought, there was nothing he could do. He walks out of the school thinking that he had done nothing only to walk into the auditorium to be confronted by all of the people that had been through his classes in thirty years and what they had become. It is interesting to see the first girl he worked with, the one who struggled with the oboe walk up as governor of the state. Holland believed that he was a failure but when he looked upon all of the people who he had influenced it struck him that he was not going to be forgotten.<br/><br/>This movie shows us that even though we may not have made a huge impact on the world nor have got where we have wanted to, all we need to do is look around at the people we have interacted with to realise that we have made an impact in our own way. Even though we may not have risen to the heights, our close friends will remember us and what we have done for them."
"c-hagemann","3","5","16","21 July 2003"," So cliche
","The start of Mr Holland in class says it all. He begins his class with the unanswerable question: 'what is music'. If I would begin like that, students would no longer take me seriously. And of course (I hope I do not spoil anything) the girl who cannot play the clarinet, succeeds. First in playing the clarinet and later on in life.<br/><br/>What I really disliked in the screenplay is the very fragmented way in which it is structured. The relationship with Mrs Jacobs is hardly elaborated on; what happens to the drummer happens all of a sudden. I think the director and scenarist took their jobs like Mr Holland took his initially: too light."

I've had a glimpse of this, and the result is disturbing. <br/><br/>Disney threw everything they had at this project, and it shows. It shameless exploits every accessible emotion including race and adultery but always in a soft way. <br/><br/>The one thing that interests me in all this engineered manipulation is the use of redheads. Disney has invented a new science of redhead archetypes, and along the way reinforced or created new roles in film for reds. Here, we have reds in the roles of (a heavy) Alicia Witt and Joanna Gleason. In the role of the creative teacher partner, (Sara) Alexandra Boyd is red. In the school crowd are about ten per cent reds, an enormous inflation over reality. <br/><br/>Gleanne Headly, on the other hand is often red.

You have been warned.<br/><br/>There's a really great film about teaching music and how it inspires kids to new heights, which features a stellar performance from a top acting talent. It's called Music of the Heart with Meryl Streep-- a movie which is seriously underrated, but earns all of the sentiment which Mr. Holland's Opus just takes for granted.<br/><br/>But perhaps the thing which irritates me the most about Mr. Holland's Opus is the ending of the film, and I'm surprised that in the reviews I've read here no one else is irritated by this as well.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland has lost his job due to the school cutting funding arts programs. And they have a big party for him and we meet all his old students and lo and behold...gasp!...Gertrude the red-haired girl who didn't think she was talented that Mr. Holland showed her she could play the clarinet back in 1965 turns out to be the Governor.<br/><br/>Now, in the movie, they then play Mr. Holland's Opus--something which apparently Holland has been writing for over 30 years but which turns out to be a 3 and a half minute piece of new age pap-- and Richard Dreyfuss sees the wonderful effect he had on the students he had over the years and it's all heartwarming blah blah blah<br/><br/>But every damn time I see this movie I can't help but think that Holland should have slapped Gertrude repeatedly while screaming ""You stupid little [expletive deleted]...the State you are Governor of is allowing arts programs to be cut from schools due to lack of funding! I should have never taught you clarinet, you moron! How dare you come here after I've lost my job because of your policies. Why don't you try raising taxes or diverting funding so we can teach kids, you little twerp!? What was the point of getting you to play the sunset when you don't do anything to GET MY JOB BACK!?!

Mr. Holland feels like a failure, and he has the desire to create a musical masterpiece. In order to pay the bills, he gets a job as a teacher at a school, and he teaches them how to appreciate music; this allows them to learn how to appreciate life.

","*May contain spoilers even though the movie is so cheesily predictable that they aren't really a suprrise*<br/><br/>I can't see the big deal about this movie.  It didn't appeal too much to me. The acting was horrible with an exception of Dreyfuss, and the story was weak and cliched.  Yet most of the commentaries on this board loved it. They said it made them cry, and think.  This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.<br/><br/>Mr. Holland who is supposed to be SUCH a wonderful composer, takes a job at some kind of school teaching a music appreciation class.  He is a horrible teacher.  How can you expect some kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be freaking Mozart after one day?  He's completely impatient and just plain mean.  For instancewhen they had their first test, he gave out the student's names and mocked what they put as answers.<br/><br/>Oh and the scene where Holland is helping Miss. Lang how to play her clarinet.  The child has been playing the thing for 3 years and she can't get out a note.  He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.  I know that we wouldn't want him to sit there and analyze every single thing that she's doing wrongbut being a saxophone player, I know that that is completely impossible.  Plus it just added extra cheese to this soppy little movie.  Then later on we find out that Miss Lang has become a mayor and never even used her `talent'.  I also find it hard to believe that the whole class of 75 still has their instruments in perfect condition, let alone still knows how to play them.<br/><br/>The whole scene with the deaf band playing instruments is ridiculous.  What is the point of the board with the flashing lights on it?  They could have kept that money in the budget to keep the arts open in that school.  What was the point of that board?  You don't have to be able to hear to play instruments.  Just blow and read your music<br/><br/>What really made me angry was the lack of any kind of ethnic characters in this movie.  There are two black people in this movie I believe.  On is the dumb, stereotypical football player who needs music because he is flunking all of his classes.  And the ridiculous thing about it is that this black football player has NO rhythm and has to get MR HOLLAND to help him.  What black teenage boy do you know doesn't have any rhythm and need an old white man to help them?  And then later on I guess there were too many black people in the movie, so they had to kill him off in Vietnam.  So then it was back down to all no black people.  Just the way that America likes it.<br/><br/>The acting is below par.  The only people that did anywhere near a good job were Richard Dreyfuss and Jean Louisa Kelly.  Ms. Kelly had a beautiful voice, but that whole thing where she was in love with Dreyfuss was ridiculous.  Glenne Headly couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, and seeing her with Dreyfuss made her look even worse.  Seeing her in that scene where she had a tantrum when she couldn't understand Cole was more funny than emotional.  William H. Macy is generally a decent actor, but his character was so overly stereotypical and nasty that I just didn't care for him.  Olympia Dukakis is usually good, but in this movieshe wellwasn't. Alicia Witt did a good job with the young Gertrude Lang as well.  Joseph Anderson did a very good job as the 15 year old Cole.  Is he really deaf? He made it very believable.  The rest of the castdon't get me started on them"

Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress.<br/><br/>Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes.<br/><br/>Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls ""American Symphony""; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak!

The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, ""inferior"" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world.<br/><br/>One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie."

","An all-star cast headed by Richard Dreyfuss traces the 30 year career of a music teacher. Glen Holland is a composer who takes a job as a high school music teacher as a waystop. His initial days are a flop as he is unable to inspire his students. He begins to put more into his work and slowly but surely his classes and the school band become more time consuming and successful as his composing is pushed to a side project. He and his wife, played by Glenne Headly have a son who it turns out is deaf. This is a crushing blow to a man whose whole life revolves around the sound of music. He has no idea how to reach his son and neglects him. The years go by and the episodic events go on, but these are not just throwaway scenes as they advance the notion that one man's work is not just what he himself produces but what he inspires other's to do with their own lives. Olympia Dukakis, Jay Thomas, William H. Macy, Jean Louisa Kelly and Alicia Witt also star."

","My Age: 13<br/><br/>Glenn Holland, played by Richard Dreyfuss, takes a job teaching music at John F.Kennedy High School to pay the rent while in his spare time he is composing a musical piece.  He struggles to settle in at first but then manages to get his students more interested in the subject.  The film takes place over several years of Mr Holland's life after that.<br/><br/>I don't normally enjoy dramas, I prefer action movies or comedies, and there are only a select few dramas which I find to be good dramas, and this is one of them.  Along with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Apollo 13"", Mr Holland's Opus is one of the better dramas around.  It is a very well done film, with a good central performance by Richard Dreyfuss.  It is interesting throughout most of its long length, and there are some nice dramatic moments.

","I can only recognize the fact that the actors are more than competent, that, technically, the film answers to most professional standards, but, instead of what should have been a tender and strong (not necessarily contradictory) statement about human relationship throughout the decades, we end up with a pretentious and hollow exercise in good intentions. The ending is, to my view, embarrassing; the rest of the movie loses steam almost from the start. I guess the production took on a big, huge gamble: a professor and his different flocks intertwined with recent American history. Too much."

","A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980. *** out of ****"

","Richard Dreyfuss is a terrific actor. His Oscar-Winning role in 'The Goodbye Girl', has remained as a topic. And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum.<br/><br/>As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher.<br/><br/>Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention.<br/><br/>Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable.<br/><br/>On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics."

","Overlong but effective epic of the everyman, with Dreyfuss wonderful as the titular high school music teacher. Good period re-creation, and a nice turn by Headley as Holland's frustrated wife. A few of the subplots are unnecessary, but the inherent drama in Holland's growth as a father, husband, and educator clearly compensate."
"adamshl","5","1","4","14 November 2010"," Too Over-Whelming
","The same problem that plagued ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is present in ""Mr. Holland's Opus."" The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax.<br/><br/>Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional ""peaks."" The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks.<br/><br/>By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, ""Oh please, no more.""<br/><br/>Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools."

","After seeing Mr. Holland's Opus,  I was very favorably impressed with the film (all except it was a little long).<br/><br/>Then, on second thought,  I have decided some flaws exist that keep it from being a truly great film.<br/><br/>1.  Mr. Holland was a little too self-centered.  He was more interested in his career than he was in his son.  His son should have been his top priority.<br/><br/>2.  I did not like the part of the film where it was obvious that he was wishing that he could leave on the bus.  I will not go into this, in order to avoid a spoiler.  Those who have seen the film will know what I mean.<br/><br/>It was still a more enjoyable film than most that Hollywood makes.  I give it a 7, out of a possible 10."

What they could have done instead was just show a few minutes of those segments and then forward a few years later.  There really is a good plot to it.  Richard Dreyfuss is wonderful as the high school band director. It shows how he and his wife have to struggle some with their deaf son.  If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you not watch it all at once unless you really get into it.  That's what I'll do the next time I rent this movie."
"rupie","7","1","4","18 June 1999"," a bit long-winded
","I can see why this movie was such a hit, but it's a bit difficult for me to sympathize with someone who treats his kid so badly. Also, there are a couple of big errors which any musician should pick up instantly<br/><br/>1) emotion is never a substitute for technique. Saying to a student in a lesson ""play the sunset"" just doesn't happen<br/><br/>2) ""Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution, so what do you think of that?"" says Holland to his uptight vice principal. Actually, no. Stravinsky was an emigre from the revolution, whose music was officially disfavored by the Soviet regime. They must have meant Shostakovich. (What the hey; they both begin with 'S')<br/><br/>3) Mr. Holland's long-awaited ""American Symphony"" was a tad short to be called a symphony, and its musical qualities suggest it would work better as background music for an airline commercial than as a vehicle for the concert hall.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie does have its moments. Its montage of news clips shows the passage of time quite effectively, and the growing friendship between Holland and the coach is nicely portrayed. Also Richard Dreyfus conducts quite convincingly; most actors who are called on to perform this arcane skill - Yul Brynner, Cary Grant, and John Cassavetes come to mind - do it wretchedly. Best line: ""We think our football team is lacking something, Mr. Holland.""  ""Yeah. Touchdowns."""
"sugar_daddyo","5","1","6","20 May 2007"," A Baby Boomer's Opus
","Mr. Holland's life is punctuated by the overtly boomer exponent of Vietnam, and John Lennon is constantly revisited like a worn out coda. Yet the producers try to instill some musical integrity by making a reference to John Coltrane, an irrelevant figure for most boomers and especially Mr. Holland as not one Coltrane song figures in this movie. But more importantly Elvis's death goes unmentioned, who arguably influenced rock and roll far more than the over-commercialized, chocolate box, Brit-pop of the Beatles or the period pieces of the anti-war activists of the late 60s and early 70s.<br/><br/>Why is this? First, Elvis only spoke to the very earliest of the baby boomers as he himself actually preceded the boomers. By the 60s he was largely making movies and had been replaced by the British Invasion. Second, Elvis was intensely patriotic by most boomer standards having served his draft notice instead of burning the card. And yet I have a hard time distinguishing Mr. Holland from his boomer pupils.<br/><br/>The biggest irony is Mr. Holland's performance of Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" which serves as a reconciliation with Cole. Not only does it raise serious questions about Mr. Holland's inspiration since he borrows someone else's material to express his deepest emotions, but Lennon released this song on his last album before his death which he wrote for his son, Sean, not the estranged Julian. And juxtaposed to this is Julian Lennon's performance of ""Cole's Song"" which also raises more questions than it answers.<br/><br/>Thus, it is easy to see that Mr. Holland and his students are merely archetypes for John Lennon and his boomer fans. Plain and simple. Whatever that has to do with Beethoven, music in general, or inspirational teaching for that matter, I have no idea."

I have issues with three things about the film: He almost has an affair with a gifted singer (and we never find out if she ""makes it"" on Broadway). Ironically, his only child is born deaf and it takes Mr. Holland over 20 years to realize just how clever and smart his son is. His ""Magnum Opus"" American Symphony is barely 6 minutes long after 30 years of composition? At least they didn't ruin the ending by having musical funding miraculously restored at the last minute. Life doesn't work like that. A superior film, but not everyone will appreciate it. It reminds me of ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and ""The Paper Chase"" which are both about charismatic college professors"

","I like the intent behind this film. Having been a teacher for well over forty years, I know that there is a serious connection between success in school and life and arts education. This is a story of a dedicated teacher (although he is dedicated to the exclusion of just about anything else, including his family). He is played by Richard Dreyfuss and he does quite well, although Dreyfuss seems to play the exact same personality in just about everyone of his films. He touched on classical music before as a young pianist in ""The Competition"" with Amy Irving. Of course, his superhuman portrayal is almost a bit beyond the efforts of the most dedicated teachers. The one thing I do have trouble with is his close relationship with a couple female students. I know that even in the time of this film, Mr. Holland may not have an opus; he would have had another number in front of his picture. He was playing with fire. But all that aside, it portrays an excited, dedicated person who touched the lives of others."

","I can't think of too many movies that transition so beautifully over a long period of time. 30 years in the case of ""Mr Holland's Opus"".<br/><br/>Much of this is down to Richard Dreyfuss as Mr Holland. He seems to age in an unselfconscious manner, covering not only the time span, but also the emotional range.<br/><br/>Mr Holland starts out a little self-focused, but grows in character as he overcomes the hurdles life throws up. He wanted to be a composer, but becomes a music teacher. From an ordinary teacher he becomes a good one and then an inspirational one. His dreams for his only child are shattered, but eventually their relationship becomes stronger through adversity. As he begins to take his wife for granted, he is drawn to a young student whose freshness contrasts with the difficult period he is experiencing. However, he realises where his heart lies, and his relationship with his wife is strengthened.<br/><br/>There are many lump in the throat moments in the film, because it's so easy to relate to. <br/><br/>No doubt liberties were taken with some of Mr Holland's teaching methods, but the film celebrates a love of music as was Mr Holland's intention with his students.<br/><br/>Along with the music of the era, Michael Kamen's score carries us seamlessly through the highs and the lows. I'm sure any film composer would have loved to have composed the music for the film as it is more integral to the story than most scoring assignments.<br/><br/>Richard Dreyfuss has obviously handled some demons in his life, but he has also made some profound observations on the art of acting and filmmaking that sum it up better than just about anyone I've ever heard.<br/><br/>His intuition and insightfulness helped him bring Mr Holland to life.<br/><br/>""Mr Holland's Opus"" captures a truth that was summed up perfectly by Elia Kazan in discussing the work of playwright William Inge, ""He had learned from his own life that you have to accept limited happiness, because all happiness is limited, and to expect perfection is the most neurotic thing of all; you must live with the sadness as well as the joy."""

","Mr. Holland's Opus (1995): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis Alicia Witt, William H.

Tragedy strikes when his son is born with a hearing impairment. Soon he is cut from the school budget and fights a losing battle to regain his place. Detailed story of thirty years but the results are somewhat overrated. It is directed by Stephen Herek, very different than his Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and certainly a superior film in all accounts despite a different genre. Heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss as Mr. Holland in what is the best element of the film. Glenne Headly as his supportive wife is more accepting of her son's condition but the role is more predictable. Olympia Dukakis has the standard role of principal who will be more a setback than an asset. Alicia Witt plays a student who wishes to learn the clarinet. The result of this is also predictable but Witt is very good. William H. Macy provides bewildered humour as a vice principal. While the screenplay isn't as good as it should be, it does point out historical element within those thirty years.
