","Really funny at at times really stupid, Ted is not only extremely well performed by its all-star cast and an extremely satirical and stupidly funny film, its script and direction is also impressive, the music and touch is perfect which all makes for a very watchable and humorous comedy, the movie does still repeat itself and does feel tiring and slow-moving at times."
"manbearpig2","Null","330","517","30 March 2012"," Ted (2012) review
","I just want to state off hand that this is my first movie review, well other than just telling someone what I thought. So if you are looking for a well written, witty review then.. you might want to stop reading now. But since this movie is still in production, this will probably be your best bet for the time being.<br/><br/>I just went to a free screening of Ted at the Greenback theater in Sacramento, CA. And I just have to say off the bat, I LOVED it. A movie hasn't made me laugh that hard in a long time. Now, I'm not going to give you any more information than the description because with the movie not even being released yet, I think that would be a spoiler of some sort. But I will tell you that was so much better than what I imagined it would be, granted that was before I knew it was directed and voiced over by Seth Macfarlane. So if you're a fan of his, you're definitely in for a treat, and even if you're not I still think you would enjoy the innovative comedy that comes from a snarky and crude teddy bear companion. The acting was very solid, from main characters to jerk bosses, and crazy.. well, crazy people.. the acting was very convincing and enjoyable. The story was great, while it might sound stupid to some, myself included, it's very well executed. Definitely not one of the movies that left me thinking ""the idea was good, but they could have done so much more with it"", it was actually quite the opposite. And this is certainly not a low budget film, the CGI animation reflects this. The furry bear voiced by Macfarlane is very realistic and believable. <br/><br/>The only drawback I could possibly see that would cause someone displeasure would be, like a lot of new comedies, this film pushes the envelope in raunchy, vulgar humor. Plus the different amount of drugs used. This movie will receive (most likely), and be very deserving of a R rating. It doesn't rely solely on shock humor though, there is plenty of good old fashioned clean comedy. But if your like me, and that type of subject matter doesn't bother you, then I HIGHLY recommend this film. And if you're a Seth Macfarlane fan, then that's just a perfectly gift wrapped little bonus for you."
"JeffTheBadger","8","226","363","3 July 2012"," A party of a film... not for the easily offended
","I really should start this with a warning: This film is not for everyone! If you are easily offended (by swearing, sexual references, casual racism and various stereotypes) then you should read no further and give this one a miss. However, if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane's other projects (Family Guy, American Dad) and maybe you call yourself an ""80's child"" (so many pop culture references to this time) you are going to love this.<br/><br/>Sure some parts are a little disjointed, the story seems vaguely familiar and the ""moral"" of it kind of gets lost but quite frankly, it's just so darn funny none of that matters. The script is hilarious, the cameos are fantastic and the soundtrack is perfect.<br/><br/>Ted himself is well animated and Seth (apart from sounding a little like Peter Griffin) voices him with the usual competence. Mark Wahlberg delivers exactly what we have come to expect from him, and the rest of the cast seem to have had fun filming, which comes across in the various performances no matter how big or small. The acceptance and interaction of everyone with a living teddy-bear adds to the simple joy of this film, and you find yourself happy to watch and not question why nobody is fazed by this. TED is a laugh a minute, party of a film and I, for one, can't wait to see it again."
"chang-skeee","1","224","403","8 October 2012"," One of the most disappointing movie experiences I've ever sat through
","I like Family Guy. So much, that I've always said that if I were stuck on a desert island, Seth MacFarlane is one of the people I'd want to be stuck there with me. I found this movie horrible, loathsome, and lazy, so much so that it actually made me question Family Guy. That's how bad I thought it was. It made me rethink my entire conception of humor. <br/><br/>I did not find this movie funny at all. The style of comedy it uses is similar to that of Adam Sandler, whom I loathe. There's a lot of yelling, a lot of cursing, and overall, a lot stuff that's supposed to be funny. There are no clever jokes, no sense of set-up and reward. Instead, it's ""oh look, the man is dancing, that's hilarious!"". Not. Or ""haha, that guy just said the f-word'"". Isn't that funny? Kill me. I did find exactly one scene funny- the one in which Ted and Mark Whalberg have a fist fight in a hotel room. That reminded me of Family Guy and I found the idea so absurd that it made me chuckle. But this moment of hilarity is quickly diffused by a ""getting hit in the groin"" joke. Now, I realize that Family Guy uses exactly this type of humor, but somehow I always found it funnier. Maybe that's the problem here- live action is a different medium and the same things that work in the campy universe of cartoons don't work with real people. <br/><br/>I realize that this is a comedy, but I do believe that even low brow comedy movies should have a basic story or plot. This was supposed to be a character driven movie. The idea is simple- Mark Whalberg is a man-child who must learn to take responsibility and grow up. The script screws up this idea completely and instead, Mark Whalberg makes absolutely no change as a person. Neither does Ted. I realize it's supposed to be adorable that a teddy bear smokes weed, but the novelty wore off in 2 minutes. That, and I found the accent horribly annoying. <br/><br/>I was excited to see the supporting cast list on wikipedia. Whalberg is great, but like I said, his character was very poorly written. Mila Kunis does nothing in the whole movie but play a horribly clichéd romantic comedy girlfriend who also has no character arc in the movie. Joel McHale is another cliché in the movie and the fact that he's in the movie is a waste of a talented comedic actor. Laura Vandervoort literally does nothing. I mean, I at least expected her to be the seductress who tries to veer Mark Whalberg off the path of righteousness, but even that doesn't happen. So why even have this supporting cast in the movie if no one's going to do anything? <br/><br/>The plot of this movie was equally weak. MacFarlane uses all of these clichéd rom-com scenes and does nothing with them. Here's a small example. This movie has 2 or 3 restaurant scenes. Now ask yourself- why exactly were these scenes in the movie? Usually, restaurants are used in comedy movies to employ some kind of restaurant related humor. Maybe there's a maladjusted person in an uncomfortable environment, or maybe someone has an allergy and they cause a scene. At least someone falling or something. But the first restaurant scene of this movie simply has Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis sitting and talking. That could have just as easily happened in a living room. So why was the restaurant scene necessary? Why even do that? It's completely pointless. <br/><br/>The ending to this movie accomplishes nothing. Mark Whalberg is supposed to change as a person. The death of Ted should have signified something, and having him come back to life s**ts on the character arc completely and nullifies it. We have no reason to believe that Mark Whalberg will grow up or make any kind of difference in life. <br/><br/>This movie had way too much product placement. Horribly obvious product placement. <br/><br/>Here's what I think. I think Seth MacFarlane is a perfectly competent individual who chose to be lazy. He wrote a horrible script, packed it with TV stars we might recognize, and collected the money. It's not just that this movie had no redeemable qualities. I actually feel like my intelligence was insulted and that I was fooled out of my money. Please don't let movies like this turn off your brain. Think about what you're watching and why you're laughing and don't settle for crap like this."
"jaxbubba","1","285","522","11 July 2012"," Gawd Awful!!!
","I just do not get it!!! This movie is just plain awful, and yet it is breaking box office records for ""R-rated"" comedies. With a running time of 98 mins, I could only manage to sit through the first 40 minutes before turning off this unfunny, quite boring, and quite disappointing film.<br/><br/>The premise of this film is quite simple. At the age of eight (8) years old and with no real friends of his own, little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) makes a Christmas wish for his teddy bear to come to life. Ted and John become life long friends (""thunder buddies""); however, after twenty-seven (27) years of friendship, John must decide on either staying with his girlfriend of four (4) years Lori (Mila Kunis) or Ted.<br/><br/>Ted is the brainchild of Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy / American Dad) and he voices Ted as well. Ted has no redeeming qualities, and is combination of the two characters Quagmire and Brian from the Family Guy TV series. He's a pot-smoking, hooker dating, grocery clerk humping, foul mouth Neanderthal, who Lori (Kunis) feels is preventing her and John from having the adult relationship that she so desires to have.<br/><br/>In the 40 minutes that I managed to sit through, I never laughed, smirked, grinned or even hinted to a gesture of happiness to any of the ""so-called"" comedy being presented on screen because there wasn't any there!!!! Unless you consider a foul-mouth, pot smoking teddy bear as being funny, which I did not. However, the scene in which I could take no more, is when Ted, while working as a clerk out clerk in a local grocery store gets caught ""bopping"" another check out clerk in the store room, and explains to his boss that, ""Last week he screwed her with a parsnip and sold the parsnip to a family of four""  so his boss promoted him. IS THAT FUNNY?????? REALLY??? God, I feel like my dad now, I must be getting old!!!! Anyways, the film is making money hand over fist, and has already crossed the $100 million, and expected to cross the $200 million mark by summer's end. I JUST DO NOT GET IT!!!!!! I cannot recommend this film, I cannot even finish watching this film. It's being marketed as this year's ""The Hangover"", and I can assure you it is nowhere as funny as the ""The Hangover"". I would say avoid at all costs but who am I???? SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""
"super_mario_crivellaro","2","170","304","20 July 2012"," Not for everyone
","I came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time, but I sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind! I was on the verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude. So instead I sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where Ted and John (Mark Wahlberg)have a big fight (surprise surprise) and John's girlfriend dumps him (another surprise -_-) it's just a barrage of clichés to be honest. The humour of the film was well below mediocre. I didn't understand some the jokes because they were referencing a celebrity that I have never heard about. The other jokes are about drugs, swearing and getting drunk. The only time I managed a laugh was when Ted was pretending to be a retard . All in all If you're American you'd probably understand and enjoy this movie more than I did. If not, stay away!"
"lansingjim","8","120","214","20 June 2012"," Crude, lewd and rude = perfect! NOT a kid's movie!
","I got into a screening of this movie thanks to my daughter, after waiting what felt like forever. I saw the unrated trailer on YouTube and couldn't wait to see it. As another reviewer said, if you like Family Guy, you'll like this. In some ways, it IS Family Guy. Wahlberg basically plays a Peter Griffin type character,a likable, but somewhat dimwitted guy. Ted is essentially Brian, smart, witty and self-centered and Mila is sort of a Lois type, hot and the grown up in the story. Be warned, this is NOT a children's movie. Nudity, drug and alcohol use, plus heavy on the profanity. In other words, go see it! Just leave your (little) kids at home."
"aidanratesmovies","10","11","15","4 April 2020"," One of the Best Comedies I've Ever Seen
","A smart, crude, but lively and hilarious comedy, Ted makes the most of its premise unlike any comedy before it, and truly shines as one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Mark Wahlberg and Ted, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, make for a lovely pair, and the two have chemistry I haven't in quite some time for a comedy film. Simply said, the film has it all. Booze, drugs, action, comedy, drama, Flash Gordon, everything. The soundtrack is great, the jokes are hysterical, the script is surprisingly impressive and realistic (for this type of scenario), and the direction is good as well. The pacing never seems to let up, and the film is almost exciting to watch by simply the fact it goes all in on what it set out to do. It's a truly top notch work for MacFarlane and proves to quite possibly be his best work yet. His talent shows in the film like never before, and he makes something truly delightful out of it. Ted isn't just rude and obnoxious, the film is full of heart too. And though the film may have a hard time taking its own matters seriously from time to time, when it needs to get emotional it does, and the film takes the risks it needs and accomplishes them. As with Ted coming to life in the film, this comedy is nothing short of a cinematic miracle, and proves to be one of the best experiences I have ever had watching a movie in my life (and I've seen over 1,000).
My Rating: 10/10"
"glen2010","6","68","120","12 August 2012"," A standard comedy - but with a teddy bear
","Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. <br/><br/>Having said that, 'Ted' did provide some good laughs, whilst they weren't exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer-generated 3D image. <br/><br/>What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, 'Ted's plot didn't seem to suit it's targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It's good, but nothing overly special."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","173","331","29 June 2012"," Consistently funny and a surprisingly cohesive effort from MacFarlane
","First there was Gollum, then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you thought motion-capture animation was beyond the range of foul-mouthed R-rated comedy, here's your evidence to the contrary. ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level —and the big screen — with ""Ted,"" a story of growing up — at the age of 35.<br/><br/>Fans of MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately (I guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard). It's not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same non-sequitur formula over and over again, but fortunately ""Ted"" is a more comically cohesive effort than you'd ever expect from the king of unexpected random jabs, references and political incorrectness.<br/><br/>If you haven't been curious enough to find out what the film is about already, ""Ted"" tells the story of how young John Bennett (who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), who had trouble fitting in as a kid, made a wish on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes true and Ted becomes world famous, even appearing on the Johnny Carson Show. But as Patrick Stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator: like Corey Feldman and Frankie Muniz, eventually, people stop giving a ****.<br/><br/>Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis), nearly middle-aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s ""Flash Gordon"" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Eventually, John must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become the adult that Lori wants him to be, and Ted is arguably the chief reason for his inability to shape up.<br/><br/>There aren't exactly any curveballs in this story, but that's when you realize you're watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging out with his profane teddy bear. Despite the obvious outcomes, ""Ted"" has to be considered an original comedy.<br/><br/>It's also consistently funny. Sure, the nature of many of the jokes is that they exist in a vacuum and aren't necessarily related to what's going on or what matters, but much of the references actually tie into the plot later on (such as Flash Gordon ... it'll make sense when you see it) and it's far less random than skeptics will come in expecting. That said, some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level, i.e. if you watch this with a group of people, you're bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and vice-versa.<br/><br/>The only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime admirer of Ted's and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight son. You've never seen Ribisi like this and that alone is amusing, but the focus of the film is on how John and Ted's mischief impacts his ability to grow up and get more serious with Lori, and this sort of butts into things.<br/><br/>Yet for all its shenanigans, the amount of heart and sincerity in some of the relationship drama between John and Lori is surprising. Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. (Bear pressure?)<br/><br/>The secret weapon is that Ted really is kind of adorable, and the mo-cap gives him an extra lifelike quality. The film hits some emotional notes early (who can't identify with loving a stuffed animal?) and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the R-rated chaos in between. That ability alone assures ""Ted"" will be seen as better than a majority of foul- mouthed, dirty-minded comedies.<br/><br/>""Ridiculous"" comes to mind as the best descriptor for ""Ted,"" which one has to imagine MacFarlane aimed for in the first place. His performance as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of Peter Griffin (there's a wink to the audience about that, by the way), but more importantly, Ted is treated as more than just an opportunity for a never-ending string of jokes that are simply funnier because ""it's a teddy bear.""<br/><br/>Maybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has helped MacFarlane learn how to tone down his shtick. Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatter-brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. ""Ted"" is as engaging as it is clever, funny and ridiculous. <br/><br/>~Steven C"

"barry_mooney","9","141","272","2 August 2012"," Fantastically funny!
","I am stunned by the number of negative reviews on here. We went to see Ted last night (the UK release date) and it was fantastic. In fact, it was the funniest film I have seen for years! The humour throughout is both obvious AND subtle, with masses of trademark Seth MacFarlane jokes as well as some expansion to his comedy repertoire made possible by having a live action film instead of an animation.<br/><br/>Some people have commented on all the 80s references - that's the joke in itself - Seth always over-focuses on the 80s and he's poking fun at himself by doing it even more! He liked Star Wars, Indian Jones, Flash Gordon, Top Gun etc. So did I - which is partly what makes it all so cool! Fans of Seth's humour will love these little (and not so little) references as they have all been used extensively in Family Guy. You don't have to be 'over 35' to get the references, you just have to get that Seth is a big fan of the 80s and has great fun referencing stuff he likes. Some might call it self-indulgent but I thought it was very funny. Perhaps you have top be on a particular wavelength, I don't know.<br/><br/>To suggest that he's being racist is also to misunderstand Seth MacFarlane - he's actually ridiculing people with stereotypical ignorant racist attitudes. Once again, he has done this in Family Guy and been similarly misunderstood. It's OK to make fun of racism or even the public's lack of knowledge on subjects such as 9/11 - neither of these mean that you're racist or pro-terrorist! <br/><br/>In reference to the acting, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis were very good (especially Mila). Ted was also superbly played (by Seth MacFarlane) and it was interesting to note how after a while you didn't even really think of him as a bear; he was just another character in the film. Lovely to hear Patrick Stewart's voice used again too. In addition, there was a generous use of Family Guy people, who were all great fun (especially the guy who does the voice of Joe Swanson) and looked like they were clearly enjoying the opportunity to be in Seth's film debut.<br/><br/>In summary, if you don't like Seth MacFarlane's humour, there's a good chance you will not enjoy this film. However, if you like Family Guy and you have the ability to look beyond the obvious, then you might well love Ted as much as I did. I thought it was brilliant and can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a cinema!"

Supporting cast is the only part worth mentioning since Flash Gordon absolutely stole the show with the 4 minutes of air time he had, his lines were consistent and witty unlike anything main characters did.<br/><br/>Story in itself falls apart since it is not built on anything real, the movie is completely clownish for the first 1 hour without any character build up and then randomly inserts ""emotional"" parts which left me completely indifferent, it was awkward and out of place.<br/><br/>I could have said something nice about the atmosphere if the movie was consistent as it was for the first half but it started to take itself seriously which ruined the composure.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend any movie enthusiast to watch this terrible movie, and reading movie reviews on IMDb in general I'm sure at least 90% of them as well as votes are sponsored by companies, too bad for this once great site."
"Mrlastlife","6","59","111","4 July 2012"," Really.........it's not all that funny
","I've been excited to see Ted since I saw the first preview. I read some of the initial reviews and it sounded great. I have to admit, it wasn't THAT funny. <br/><br/>First, the voice of Ted. It's freaking Peter Griffin!!! It's like the creators of SpongeBob making a movie and they use the voice of SpongeBob. It's really distracting. And when Ted is making fun of someone, he uses Stewie's voice?!?! Why!?!? Don't you have another voice you can use? The beginning of the film, Ted is a cute and innocent bear. I felt the movie was funnier then. The vulgar, smoking, sexually active Ted felt forced to me.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes fell flatter than a Kansas interstate. Seriously, the movie theater was completely packed and there were jokes that didn't garner one single laugh. Sometimes I couldn't tell if they were trying to make a joke or not. Some jokes were supposed to be kinda mean, but were just kinda dumb. There were times it seemed like the audience laughed because they thought they were supposed to. This is Ted!!! It's supposed to be hilarious!!! <br/><br/>There were some funny parts. But honestly, I left disappointed."

And do we need yet another fat joke, or handicapped joke? If you answered yes, then you deserve to watch this film and lower your I.Q. another 20 points. Honestly, the only real treat was watching Mila Kunis, (and that's some damn fine acting by the way) they must have paid her a fortune to act in this crap.

","This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. ""Ted"" is a foul mouthed nasty rendition of what used to be a symbol of a sweet toy. You would think that Hollywood get a clue about why all of their movies flop. Either movies are redo's or trash like ""Ted""! It amazes me that movies like this can even be shown at a regular theater. My teenage daughter asked to leave and this was the first movie she has ever done that to. I think what is worse is that Mark Walberg the star of the show has young children who will someday grow up and want to see movies their dad has been in. He should be ashamed of himself and I won't be seeing any of his movies in the future since he is going to stoop to this level of worse than B movies."

Ted's completely sexist, homophobic, fat-shaming, and immature.<br/><br/>Then there's Rex who treats Lori like a fetish. There's seriously not a single good role model or decent person in the entire movie. It's simply one stereotype built upon another.

","After seeing the good user reviews for Ted my expectations were actually raised a little. The trailers didn't seem too funny to me, but I'm a big fan of Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane and thought that it would be at least as funny as the average FG episode.<br/><br/>Well after seeing the movie I have to say that Seth MacFarlane, Mila Kunis, and Mark Whalberg have all sunk to new all-time lows. I can't believe a movie like this would get backed by a studio. The jokes are even more low brow than South Park (a show I can't stand) and the plot relies on fart jokes, constant weed smoking, and cliché characters that try way too hard to get a laugh and overact in almost every scene.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that anyone would find this funny, other than maybe somebody so high or so drunk that they find poop on the floor and farting hilarious.<br/><br/>The theater was pretty full for an afternoon show and other than the seriously stoned dudes behind me, there were very few people in the theater that laughed at most of the jokes. I had a few chuckles and a half laugh, but no lol moments.<br/><br/>I honestly started feeling bad for the actors and began wondering if they actually read the script before they agreed to do this movie, or if they just trusted that anything by Seth MacFarlane had to be funny.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It really is bad beyond belief, but if you don't believe me, then check it out and be prepared to see somewhat respectable actors sink to the lowest of lows."

It made me so upset that I actually wasted my time on this. I kept wishing there was some redeeming value to this movie but there wasn't. This movie puts the worst of human nature out there and makes it appear good. Who could come up with such a story line that is so nasty?

"elisaweinsteinhome","1","56","110","7 July 2012"," Awful
","This movie made me ashamed to be American. Our standards for comedy have completely deteriorated. After seeing The Dictator and now TED, I'm completely convinced that Hollywood will never release another intelligent, funny comedy ever again. The sad thing is that I was both a fan of Sacha Baren Cohen and Seth MacFarlane, but I have lost respect for both of them. This was a movie made for complete morons. How many times can you say d**k and have someone take a sh*t before it's not funny any more? Has every great comedic writer completely run out of ideas? It's absolutely pathetic. I could not believe that everyone in the theater was laughing at the worst writing and acting I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The biggest problem was that the movie was BORING. If you're gonna make a movie about a teddy bear, could you at least not bore me to tears? When that chase scene started and they started sewing up the bear enough was enough. I'm not prude or lacking in the humor department at all, but I just think it's really sad what comedy has turned into. I miss comedies that had the ability to make me laugh without saying ""s**k my d**k"" 800 times. There used to be real humor with real thought behind it, it wasn't so cheap and void of any class or wit. Now all you need is someone to take a dump, a famous actor to say ""s**k my d**k"", and a few offensive, unoriginal jokes about homosexuals/Jews/Mexicans/Asians and you've got yourself a golden ticket. People, come on!!!! We deserve more!!!! Is there anyone out there???? Please tell me I'm not the only one who felt this way!"
"lts100","2","46","89","2 August 2012"," Why did I waste my money on this ?
","This is the first movie review I've ever done and after watching Ted it ""inspired"" me to write a review. How this movie has close to an 8 star rated is just sad. This movie is downright awful. I'm not really giving any spoilers because there's nothing to give away. It's pretty much an entire, drawn out recent family guy episode. Mark Walberg gets picked on as a child makes a wish and gets a magical talking teddy bear. How cute. Fast forward to when he's a 35 year old loser and Ted is still his best friend. Only now Ted turns out to be a raunchy lil teddy bear who smokes weed drink all that. It doesn't match up. Mark Walberg doesn't seem like the couch sitting loser he's portraited to be. Mila Kunis is his gf of 4 years and she has her life together. But somehow they are a couple blah blah. She wants more from him and their relationship but Ted is bringing him down with his constant drinking, smoking, all that stupid stuff. Her boss Joel McHale is constantly hitting on her but she's happy with her boyfriend. They eventually break up, she goes on a date with her boss so he can stop bothering her and then she still doesn't want him. Walberg ruins their date by performing a stupid song. Ted goes to have a serious chat with her trying to get them back together. She meets him at a restaurant then their makeup gets interrupted by Giovani Ribisi and his son who kidnap Ted. Ted gets ripped apart at Fenway Park and ""dies"" in a sense. Kunis wishes upon a star and he's magically back to life..the end. I can't forget the mention all the jokes throughout the movie. There was a scene where Kunis comes home to find Ted with hookers and there's a dump on the floor. That was kind of funny I did laugh at that scene. And the other kind of funny scene was when Ted is working at a grocery store trying to flirt with a blonde girl so he takes a bottle of lotion and pretends to ejaculate. Now other than that, all of the jokes revolved around Family Guy. Yeah we get it already you made Family Guy (aside from the first 4-5 seasons isn't funny at all) but was it really necessary to make your film the same exact thing as family guy? The concept could have gone so much better. The cast in the movie is great. Mark Walberg, Mila Kunis, and Joel McHale are extremely funny people. And even Giovanni Ribisi. But this movie does not in any way portray just how funny they are. It was just an awful movie. Completely overrated. Seth McFarlene is just not funny. He was at one point. When Family guy first came out it was hilarious. Just such a funny show but after season 5 it's completely redundant and overused jokes don't do it. I'm not one to be easily offended I even love toilet humor/all that crap but this movies sucks. You can't force offensive jokes down people's throats like he does. Being that I'm not a huge McFarlene fan, I wasn't expecting to be blown away. But after how many good reviews it got, I was expecting something more. Not to sit there wondering what other movies I could leave and go see.<br/><br/>This doesn't appeal to a certain age group because on one end you have twitter/Facebook references, Kim Karshain jokes, and other celebrities from the past 5 years or so yet the movie focuses so much around Flash Gordon. There's even a god awful Airplane reference. Two completely different time periods. Not worth seeing whatsoever. Even if it's free. I found The Other Guys to be 10000000x better. Or no scratch that. The Happening (which also stars Mark Walberg) is funnier than this movie. I hope in my lifetime Seth McFarlene never makes another movie again. Ever."

","Saw this and had the constant feeling of awkwardness on behalf of the people producing it. The timing for jokes is sometimes way off. The storyline doesn't make sense in itself (I know speaking toys don't exist - I mean they are inconsistent with the make-believe stuff they tell you).<br/><br/>I expected clever jokes from McFarlane, political/social satire (great time for it, isn't it). Unfortunately he managed a script that only pointlessly rumbles on from here to there trying to develop something with love story and talking bear... something... something. I laughed a handful of times, but that isn't enough for 100 minutes.<br/><br/>You are just constantly pushed out of it by inept movie-craftsmanship. The casting is ridiculous. A former superhero and another former man in black have a small side role as a 'funny' gay couple. - Problem is a 12 year old makes better gay jokes. The stuff feels really outdated for me. Maybe in the early 1990s such a thing as a man who is gay but can't figure it out was funny. Plus one can see no one gave them useful direction to portray the characters, as they are SO VISIBLE as the actors who did that other movie all the time. If you do this and these kind/level of jokes now you look like a film-school freshman who couldn't afford a professional script-reviewer."
"chicagopoetry","4","26","47","7 July 2012"," A Missed Opportunity
","TED had the potential to be a classic movie like BIG or like ELF, both of which were magical tales about childhood dreams set in the adult world. Unfortunately, TED cops out and goes for the cheap shots with jokes about prostitutes pooping on the floor or a teddy bear squirting hand cream all over its face to suggest to a woman what he wants to do to her (she goes out with him anyway). What made BIG and ELF so funny was how innocent the main characters were in the adult world. But TED is a perverted sociopath. And why? That part is never explained. The plot jumps straight from the bear announcing its presence to the child to the bear smoking pot from a bong on a couch. Are we suppose to love him? How can we, when he's a raging racist, homophobe? Something else that made BIG and ELF funny is how the rest of the world responded to the main characters. Here we are to believe the world just accepts the idea of a talking teddy bear and nobody acts surprised. We are to believe everyone in the world saw the Tonight Show thirty years ago and that makes it all acceptable. Why the writers of this dud chose to do it this way is a mystery. It would have been so much funnier if people actually reacted the way people would actually react to a talking teddy bear. Unlike BIG or ELF, films that live on and can be watched again and again, TED will have its flash in the pan and then it will just fade away. Because it makes no sense. At least in BAD SANTA we understood why this particular SANTA was so perverted. Here we are to believe that sitting around smoking pot and watching FLASH GORDON turns you into a lunatic rapist. Not funny."

","I feel like the kid in the Emperor's New Clothes, but I just saw ""Ted"" and it's one of the worst films I have seen in many years. I was SO disappointed. It has been getting many great reviews while also garnering a few poor ones. I really wanted to like it. Before I saw it, I was thinking that at the worst, I would think it was a stupidly dumb, but pretty funny or even mildly funny raunchy comedy. Unfortunately, it wasn't even that. Yes, it was raunchy, but it really wasn't all that funny. So many jokes landed with a thud. On top of that, the film was so poorly paced. I got maybe 5 or 10 laughs out of it. A reknown local reviewer mentioned that one of the local actors got off, perhaps, the best line in the film. I waited for that line, and after it happened, I thought to myself, ""THAT is the best line in the film?!?!???"". <br/><br/>It started out promising, actually, a bit of a tongue-in-cheek poke at Christmas movies, but that smartness wasn't sustained. To me, a great high/low brow movie comedy like ""There's Something About Mary"" is a model for other movies, being smart and lowbrow at the same time. Even ""Animal House"" has writing which is SO much better than ""Ted"". Again, the pace at times was slow, which is pretty deadly for a movie like this, where the jokes should keep coming, fast and furious.<br/><br/>And then it turned into maudlin, with typical boy loses girl, gets girl back type plot points. I won't give it away, but it was not good.<br/><br/>Too bad. See it at your own risk. Hey, I might be in the minority."

Many gag/jokes were current affairs, politics etc that were just dead. Useless. And the voice of Ted was crap. Just could not endear to it at all. Many of the scenes were just weird.

","I don't normally like this sort of film, being a middle-aged, middle-class Englishman, but being stuck in a distant city with an evening to kill, I thought, why not? I found myself pleasantly surprised. On a scale where anything with Will Ferrell being 1 and Big Bang Theory being 10, this easily ranks 9. The humour is universal enough to travel across the Atlantic, and in between the gags there are real questions about what makes a man more than just a big kid, and how much does love over-rule loyalty.<br/><br/>The CGI and the actors' eye-lines are faultless, the use of stuffed toys and graphics not always being obvious. I loved many of the gags, and being of a certain age, I so identified with the Flash Gordon motif running through the film.<br/><br/>And it is such an original idea. What if a teddy bear really did come alive? The contradiction of Ted's childish appearance with a thirty-something jaded, crude personality gave an added punch to the humour, and Ted himself was not just a cartoon, but showed real pathos and feeling, even though he was a womanising dope-head.<br/><br/>I loved it, and may even try to persuade 'Er Indoors to come see it with me a second time when I get home."

","I was surprised at how utterly awful TED was. It was truly and absolutely terrible. There was essentially no plot. It was one gimmick about an animated stuffed animal who curses a lot and spews a lot of raunchy, sexually explicit comments. It'd be okay for a five-minute sketch -- even a recurring sketch on SNL would have been okay -- but there simply isn't enough to make a full-length movie. I am surprised that the consensus seems to be positive, as this movie hovers at about a third-grade level.<br/><br/>Moreover, I was surprised at Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis -- not to mention Giovanni Ribisi -- all of whom have made quality, substantive movies/shows in the past, opted to be in this crap-fest. Farts jokes and a stuffed teddy bear having sex with a woman only go so far, and at least insofar as this reviewer is concerned, they don't go very far at all.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies I've seen in years."

"rawiri42","1","37","71","14 July 2012"," What a load of rubbish!
","After all the TV hype about the upcoming release of Ted, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. What a huge let-down!<br/><br/>I can't blame this on cultural differences and simply say that American humour is different because I frequently laugh my socks off at Two-and- a-half Men and The Big Bang Theory on TV. Considering the inordinately high overall rating that this film has on IMDb I can only assume that it's me because I don't think I even smiled (let alone laughed!) once during it. The whole concept was ridiculous (is THAT funny?). Like, would the whole adult world happily accept a talking, walking, dope- smoking stuffed Teddy bear? Is this an indication of the world's mentality in 2012? I sure hope not!<br/><br/>I honestly think that, in years to come, Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and, perhaps most of all, Patrick Stewart will deeply regret ever having anything to do with this load of utter crap! They are both excellent actors and I find it hard to believe that they were so hard up financially that they needed the work. I note with particular interest that Mark has no less than five post-Ted movies - and Mila has six - in various stages of production so I wonder what on earth made them demean themselves with this. It's almost like prostitution of their art and talents!<br/><br/>I believe there is a difference between realistic expletive language (like when the story centres around working men or underworld criminal gangs) but the gratuitous profanity in this film has no usefulness whatsoever unless, of course, it makes those of limited intelligence laugh - but do our filmmakers need to pander to this sort of audience? I guess it all comes down to who spends the most at the box-office. (more prostitution!) <br/><br/>Basically, the story-line is absolute rubbish and an insult to the intelligence, the plot and dialogue are NOT the least bit funny and the romantic aspect defies belief. Mila should have run a mile the day she first learned about Ted and never come back!<br/><br/>As usual, I stuck it out to the bitter end, because I am the eternal optimist and live in hope that something enjoyable will develop (as often happens in movies that start out a bit slowly or stupidly) but, in the case of Ted, I wish I had ejected it after the first five minutes! That's over an hour-and-a-half of my life I'll never get back! Sorry, I cannot recommend this movie for any reason - there isn't even any nice scenery in it!"

One minute of laughs during the whole movie would also not be an accurate summary. Yes I may have smiled a couple times when the bear delivers some rude and crude lines but I think that was more the fact that it was a bear saying it. Mark Wahlberg was OK but I personally think he should stick to action movies and do what he does best. The novelty of the walking, talking bear wore off after 5 minutes. I am so glad I didn't pay money to watch this movie cos I would have been undergoing treatment for severe depression otherwise.

"estebangonzalez10","6","35","67","28 September 2012"," Not the comedy I was hoping for
","¨No matter how big a splash you make in this world whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber or a talking teddy bear, eventually, nobody cares.¨<br/><br/>Since 1999 Seth MacFarlane has made a name for himself in television thanks to the success of Family Guy. He's also the man responsible for other successful animated series such as American Dad and The Cleveland Show. He's not only the creator of these shows, he also voices many of the characters as well. In his first venture into live action film he also voices the star of the movie: Ted, a teddy bear that magically comes to life after a lonely boy makes a wish. Ted is an R-rated comedy due to the fact that he happens to be very vulgar and getting stoned all the time. The film has had huge box office success in the United Stated and I was expecting Ted to be hilarious, but I guess my expectations were a little too high because I wasn't blown away by this movie. There were some funny scenes, but for the most part the film felt like an average comedy and it wasn't what I was hoping for. 2012 has failed to deliver a successful comedy, and for now 21 Jump Street reigns as the best one in my opinion. Ted is full of irreverent humor, but it's repetitive and you have the usual sexual, drug, and poop jokes. I couldn't find much originality to it, but I do have to say some of the scenes did work thanks to Ted and his best friend played by Mark Wahlberg, whom I've always said is great in comedies. This is a pretty formulaic buddy comedy where you have the typical two slacker best friends and a girl who gets in the way of their friendship and wants them to mature. The only difference is that this time around one of them is a talking teddy bear. <br/><br/>The film begins with a narration (voiced by Patrick Stewart) about the story of lonely boy who gets his wish one Christmas morning when he asks for his teddy bear to become his best friend. When the teddy comes to life, John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg, and the younger version played by Bretton Manley) discovers that he has found his best friend who he names Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane). Ted becomes an instant celebrity as he is all over the news and is invited to all kind of talk shows. Ted changes young John's life for the better. The film then jumps to the present day where both have grown into adults. John is now 35 and has a healthy relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis). They've been dating for four years now. Ted is still living with John and has also grown up in the same way that his human buddy did. John and Ted like to spend time getting high together and talking about girls, drugs, and Flash Gordon. Everything seems to be going well for the trio until Lori gives John an ultimatum. It's Ted or her. Lori realizes that Ted is keeping John from realizing his full potential since they're always getting stoned and John is always late to work. John realizes that he has to make an important decision if he wants to save his relationship with Lori and the movie moves along from here. <br/><br/>One of the things the film explores well is the transition from child to adulthood. We don't only see John grow up, but his teddy bear as well. Now being an adult doesn't mean you're mature and John and Ted are proof of that. They are irresponsible and practically only care about getting high all the time. They both are very nice people, but really immature. That's what drives Lori crazy, but the good thing about Ted is that these characters aren't stereotypical. Lori isn't a mean person who wants to separate the two best friends, but rather wants them to take responsibilities as adults. Ted also has character development and despite the fact that he's very inappropriate he also has a big heart and wished the best fro John and Lori. This isn't your typical face off between best friend and girlfriend. I was pleased with that aspect of the film. Another thing that worked really well for me in this movie was all the references to different films (especially Flash Gordon and Top Gun) and jokes about them. As a film lover you always enjoy those small references and gags. Some of the cameos were also pretty funny and highlights of the film. What I didn't like as much was the fact that some of the sexual and drug humor got a little bit repetitive and old. There were also several poop and fart jokes which are always a little repetitive in these buddy comedies. Ted is still a funny film, but just not the hilarious movie I was hoping for.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

Not only is it unfunny, it's also sickeningly offensive and quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen, which is not a phrase I'd use lightly.

","First of all I absolutely despise Family Guy and its cheap humour and I might be a little biased but I did give this movie a fair chance. I didn't laugh once. Douche MacFarlane is both a terrible writer and voice actor. The story could be told in 15 minutes but is stretched out to 106 boring, dreadful minutes. Even in this one Douche MacFarlane can't resist to hit people in the face with his annoying anti-religious propaganda. He's such a liberal self-absorbed arrogant douche, he doesn't realise he's not funny at all. Pot smoking might be funny for 15-year old teenager and people who have never smoked pot, but when you are past that phase it's just annoying. Other jokes are a prostitute craps on the floor (how funny...), the bear has sex with a trailer trash chick and when he does something wrong at his job he always gets promoted. Well, isn't that just hilarious. Dear Douche MacFarlane, please retire from the entertainment business. When I see your stuff on TV or in the theater it always reminds me of that Billy Madison speech. ""Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."""

This had the unique achievement of being even worse.<br/><br/>It's just truly woeful. I cannot overemphasise just how dreadful this film is & I grew up through the 80s and loved them. The supposed jokes (and I use the term extremely loosely) are futile, just farts, f*cks & wank1ng, characters completely uninteresting and who you never give a toss about & little if any plot.<br/><br/>Two or three scenes are so cringingly bad you wonder how they ever were even suggested. The restaurant scene where he brushes away a fart and the three businessman create a fuss must have been penned by a five year old. The Flash Gordon scenes were dreadful, the entire kidnapping plot line and the Dad & child should have been removed completely.<br/><br/>Wahlberg said he wished he got Teddy Ruxpin for Christmas instead.

Perhaps it's an American thing but I find it totally impossible to relate to these kind of ""choices"" in real life (being a woman)- between a partner and friends (most people I know including myself have BOTH friends and partners) and nor can I relate to 35 plus men behaving like the main character, unless they are totally losers. There seems to be no point with having a teddy bear as a friend, a part from it's OK to cuddle each other in a boyish way (obviously there just had to be a fart sound to make it OK to stay close when THUNDER comes along) It's SAD and I found it painful to watch as I kind waited for the real plot and some more action to come along, which just didn't happen.

The basic premise is that a bear acts like a dysfunctional adult, compensating for his shortcomings by drinking, smoking dope, being promiscuous and swearing a lot. It didn't really provide a strong enough idea for a whole movie. There are also a lot of 'in jokes' about American TV people, films and Flash Gordon, mostly lost on us.

"jaredpahl","2","14","24","31 August 2015"," Seth McFarlane's Gift For Zany Humor Is Nowhere To Be Found In This Comedic Calamity
","Ted is director Seth McFarlane's first feature film. Now, I think McFarlane is a funny guy. His massively popular TV show, Family Guy, was at one time the single funniest show on television. I am a true fan of McFarlane's brand of irreverent humor, but somehow, his first film is almost 100% devoid of laughs. <br/><br/>Ted is about a lazy stoner, played by Mark Wahlberg, and his talking, sentient, teddy bear, voiced by McFarlane in his Peter Griffin accent. The majority of the movie sees the two of them engaging in all sorts of devious behavior. They smoke pot, they pick up hookers, and they party hard. That description seems to warrant, at the very least, a handful of good laughs; especially with McFarlane running the show. However, McFarlane completely botches the humor in this movie. For example, an early gag shows the two friends using a bong. You would assume that's just the setup to the joke... nope... that IS the joke. ""They smoke pot. Isn't that funny?!"". There are so many of these instances where we're asked to laugh at the premise alone. The idea of a vulgar teddy bear is only so funny, and to hang the entire movie on that premise alone is foolish. I don't think a foul-mouthed teddy bear is funny. If you don't either, then Ted offers nothing to you.<br/><br/>When the jokes don't simply fail, they fall into the raunchy, shock humor trap. Ted himself is incredibly crude, and yet, his vulgarity is not complemented by any type of actual comedy. He's raunchy for the sake of raunchiness. A popular segment, The ""Thunderbuddies Song"" is not clever or funny in any way. It just has a ton of indecent language, so people will laugh at it, right? Judging by its popularity, I guess that's the case, but come on! Are people that easily tickled? Maybe I'm just a square, but I need more than swear words to make me laugh, I need wit. All of these comedic failures would sink this movie on their own., but the movie has another glaring issue.<br/><br/>The second half or so of Ted is when McFarlane just gives up on the idea of making a comedy. The story of a crazed fanatic who attempts to steal Ted takes center stage and the movie becomes a straightforward chase picture. The jokes stop falling flat, but only because they stop showing up at all. The conflict itself is not at all interesting, and it is totally pointless. I don't go to comedies for action or drama, I go to laugh. On that front, Ted is a failure.<br/><br/>I had one or two laughs during Ted. I can do better than that with any single episode of Family Guy, and I'd save myself a precious hour of life. Ted is unfunny throughout, and the second half is totally misguided. The movie is a nasty, extremely unpleasant misfire. I like Seth McFarlane, but I hate Ted.<br/><br/>16/100"

","This is proof positive that what works in cartoons doesn't translate well to live action. In cartoons, we don't have the real world, so the stupid humor and simple bodily-function jokes work, to a large extent. Translate that same humor to a live action movie and it really hits you how dumb and puerile it is.<br/><br/>Ted, for a start, is inherently unlikeable as a character. To make matters worse, Wahlberg's character is equally hard to empathise with. He spends his days smoking pot with Ted and watching old movies. Both are horribly selfish.<br/><br/>As an example of the sort of humor that you are supposed to find funny I give you this: Upon returning home - to her apartment, no less - Kunis' character finds Ted doing drugs with four prostitutes. That isn't the ""funny"" part. The supposed humor comes from the fact that, for a dare, one of the hookers has taken a dump on the floor. Cue lots of laughter, right? No? Oh, well then, you must not find it funny either.<br/><br/>This is the kind of humor throughout Ted. Fart and knob jokes, drug-related mirth and other terribly unfunny lines. I guess when you write, star and direct a film you can start to believe your own press, but this is ridiculous.<br/><br/>McFarlane should stick to cartoons. At the very least, he could have tried to make Ted NOT sound exactly like Peter Griffin. They even crack a ""joke"" about it at one point. Ha, ha! The basic plot is excruciatingly obvious from the start and means you can leave within twenty minutes and know exactly what will happen in the movie. I chuckled a few times, but Ted is far, far, far from funny. Most of the time any attempts at humor fall flat and sometimes the humor is just plain offensive.<br/><br/>Ted is a movie aimed a teens, and pretty juvenile and immature teens at that. It falls neatly into line behind such other recent ""comedy"" classics as Your Highness, and really makes you wonder how films like this can get greenlit by studios. Is there nothing more worthy to make into a film? <br/><br/>SUMMARY: Don't believe the hype! It's overlong, tedious, unfunny and a waste of two hours. Ted is charmless and boring. I've had more fun sat staring at a dead fly in a dentist's waiting room for thirty minutes. Seriously, give it a miss!"

Mila Kunis played her role very well and I do have to say that this is a rather OK performance for Wahlberg. <br/><br/>Overall it's not worth the allotted time, it's disappointing.

Even the opening scene had the audience laughing!<br/><br/>Ted, the carefree, weed-smoking teddy bear has been Mark Wahlberg's one and only friend from the age of 8. At 35, he is having trouble with his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) because of his immature behavior, mostly because of his teddy bear. As the movie progresses, we realize that he must decide between his true love and his beloved teddy.<br/><br/>The jokes include the typical Family Guy sort of humor - ranging from crude and crass to Seth's favorite 80s cultural references. Family Guy fans should enjoy a movie version of their favorite family. The story line is almost too predictable, but we almost forget about the story in the middle of all the humor.<br/><br/>I recommend watching the movie with a few friends and have a nice laugh.

","I won't spend more than three minutes writing about this awful piece of immature, vulgar and childish trash. I couldn't watch it to the end, I stopped about 45 minutes in. I found this even slightly insulting and humiliating : am I supposed to find this funny and entertaining? Does Mr Mcfarlane think I'm that moronic and stupid? Is that what we have become? Finding this idiotic pile of garbage remotely interesting, entertaining or funny makes me feel very sad about the times we live in. Sad to the point where I don't wan't to have kids to spare them the shame of living in a world this mediocre and vile. What ever happened to entertainment industry? How low can we sink? Needless to say this film bombed in Europe, and that only proves one point : American standards are now entangled in the sludgy depths of stupidity and vulgarity. Absolutely awful, enjoying this if you are over 12 years of age should set off all kind of alarms. Grow up McFarlane, your dick and fart jokes amuse no one except yourself and the thousands of brain damaged idiots that gave this absurdity more than two points."

","Doesn't every child want their stuffed animals to come to life and talk? In fact, wasn't that the same idea which made Toy Story wildly successful? For a premise with endless potential, director/writer/actor Seth McFarlane does not deliver a story worth watching once, let alone twice. TED has received more hype than perhaps any other comedy in the last ten years, but has let me down the most.<br/><br/>The humor is crude, offensive and leaves me depressed and hopeless. In many ways, the film is trying harder than it should have to to get a laugh. I would have liked to be in the room when the writers decided ""I have a good idea! Lets make a TV fall on a guys crotch and stab a knife into another guys hand. That'll be funny!"". Though in many ways, this kind of so called ""humor"" is to be expected of the creator of Family Guy, which in itself is tasteless, I expected more of Marc Wahlburg and Mila Kunis. Both actors have previously been very creditable in dramas, Wahburg in The Fighter and Kunis in Black Swan, and both had supporting roles, which were actually funny, in Tina Fey and Steve Carell's Date Night. I kept watching TED with the hope of the end holding a redeeming quality, but it only got worse. Lets just say the best part of the movie was when the credits rolled and I could finally turn it off. I must thank McFarlane for one thing, I now have a sure fire way of telling if a man is worth dating by asking a single question; ""Did you enjoy TED?"". If the answer is yes, he is likely not worth my time.<br/><br/>The idea of a sequel makes me weep for the movie industry, America's intelligence and the fact the future generation will one day be leading this country. I mean, what are we really teaching our kids by portraying their beloved stuffed animals as unsympathetic, sex obsessed and downright rude characters? Nothing worthwhile, I can tell you that. Avoid this movie at all costs, and for goodness sakes, leave the kids at home watching something innocent and actually enjoyable."

Yes, this show was THAT bad. Test it: talk to someone that has seen it, but make sure they are not surrounded by others lest the pubescent peer pressure forces an insincere response.

Sure, I'm partly killing time before ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" reaches the suburbs, but I used to be a ""Family Guy"" fan, and I don't mind some crude cinematic humor when it's broiling out. Trust me, on this front, ""Ted' more than delivers. Fart jokes? Check! Fat kid jokes? Check. (Serious question: Did Seth MacFarlane get beat up a lot when he was young by a fat kid?) Breaking the fourth wall? Check. Random cruel observations about washed up media stars? Check. (Another question: Does Seth MacFarlane get the irony of casting not one, but two, former child stars in this movie? Probably.) <br/><br/>Plot: A friendless youngster in a Boston suburb gets a teddy bear for Christmas and makes a wish that the bear will become real. Because there is no magic stronger than the love between a kid and his stuffed pal, this actually happens. The kid grows up to be John (Mark Wahlberg), and the bear, Ted, grows up to be a pot-smoking, call girl courting, potty mouthed guy, who's still Best Friends Forever and roomies with his pal. John is a slacker, but he's got a good heart, and has been dating Lori (Mila Kunis) for four years. Lori, who wants to get married, gives John an ultimatum: it's either her or Ted. Meanwhile Ted is in danger (of a sort) from a stalker (Giovanni Ribisi) who wants to purchase Ted for his spoiled son.<br/><br/>""Ted"" has some hysterical moments, but the humor is uneven. When ""Ted' is funny, it's very, very funny; when it's not, it falls flat. It's the kind of movie that turns sentimental and mushy at the end, which doesn't really go with the rest of the over-the-top crude scenes. I did enjoy seeing the Boston landmarks, though. Joel McHale also did a superb job as Kunis' slimy boss, Rex."

If it weren't for the teddy bear with the foul language and sick sense of humor (which I love), it would be another boring ""guy in love, pisses off girl, and wins her back"" story. Seth's humor is usually more thought provoking, and no doubt stifled into mainstream slapstick here by the film studio and/or other powers that be. I wasn't expecting too much from Mark Wahlberg, since in my opinion he is a very one-dimensional actor who happens to be cast in excellent roles. I did, however, expect more from Teddy, who could have benefited from more creative use of the CG technology, and a little more ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor as opposed to the gratuitous and crude slapstick doled out here. The novelty of a foul mouthed teddy bear wore off for me within 20 minutes, leaving nothing but an ""after school special"" caliber plot. The fight scene between the teddy bear and Wahlberg was pretty f***ing funny, though."

Their only connection seems to be the desire to smoke pot.... something else I don't have a problem with... or did at one time if you catch my drift... either way... those jokes aren't funny either.<br/><br/>I spent the last two weeks stopping at nearly every rental machine in SE Tennessee to find this thing because it looked to be right up my alley.

Also, one minute Ted is 'Brian' for Family Guy and the next he turns into 'Peter Griffin' from the same show (despite his denials). I thought both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis did a good job; both of their characters were quite believable. Ultimately though I did find it lacked the one thing it so desperately needed; heart. Still, I'm sure the many devotees of 'Family Guy' will love this one but for me, sadly, it's a bit of a dud.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (unless you're a really big fan of Family Guy, in which case why haven't you seen it yet!)<br/><br/>My score: 5.3/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","Have you ever wondered what Peter Griffin would sound like with a Boston accent? Well the talking teddy bear Ted is the answer in Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut, Ted. MacFarlane provides the voice of Ted in this raunchy comedy about a young boy who makes a Christmas wish that brings his stuffed teddy bear to life. But, as the boy grows up, so does Ted. Jump forward twenty years to the story of a grown man balancing work, a girlfriend, and his best friend Ted the teddy bear.<br/><br/>Ted is raunchy, vulgar, crass, and culturally relevant. It's a comedic styling much in the vein of Family Guy or any of MacFarlane's other shows, just pumped up with R-rated steroids. From the start with this film's wacky premise we know that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is really only here to deliver the laughs. It's a fairly predictable film and it's plot is very Hollywoodized at times, but it's also pretty damn hilarious. MacFarlane's off brand humor is where this film is successful, as one would expect. However, in about five or six years half the jokes in Ted will no longer be relevant as there are a lot of pop culture references littered throughout this film that will mean nothing in only a few short years.<br/><br/>But for now practically all of Ted is absolutely hysterical. It's lots of foul language, plenty of potty humor, and a plethora of dirty sight gags that make Ted tick. Also, a fine helping of cameos keeps the humor fresh and increasingly hilarious, whether or not it makes any sense at all. Sometimes it's really just Seth MacFarlane showing off how far his Hollywood star power tentacles can reach, but none of it falls flat. In fact, very little of the humor in Ted falls flat. I really enjoyed this film. It's nothing more than another raunchy comedy, but it certainly entertained me, and what more need I ask for?"

Sure, there are a lot more in Family Guy, but they work because it is a cartoon, which is not real. Any person who experiences real life can look at this film and think ""Who says stuff like this?"" It just distracted me from the film whenever a character would say something pointless, which happens a lot.<br/><br/>The story is predictable and I don't understand who the film's audience is. It makes references to Twitter and Katy Perry, then makes Flash Gordon jokes throughout. These things are from different generations, so that prevents your audience from understanding half the jokes in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, a good premise is let down by poor writing.

The trailers don't give away any of the proper funny jokes as well, Which is something I detest (you knew every funny joke in the hangover 2 because of the trailers) and to top it off the bear is probably the cutest thing I have ever seen.

"Joshua_Barry","8","20","39","8 July 2012"," Ted is one hilarious movie.
","So It's school holidays and I decide to go and see a preview screening of Ted at 7pm. The cinema is full and I am entirely surrounded by teenagers, sucking furiously on their frozen cokes and jittering around in their seats as if they were under the influence of some extremely high uppers. The movie begins, yet the kids don't settle down at all. Now normally this would completely annoy the hell out of me, and to some extent it did (hence me still thinking about it now), but it didn't take anything away from this farcical comedy written and directed by the very talented Seth MacFarlane. <br/><br/>Ted, voiced by MacFarlane, is absurdly hilarious, with his crazy antics, insane innuendos and the occasional racial slur, it is hard not to laugh out loud. This is all created by the wonderful sound of Seth's voice. I really don't think it would have worked half as well if they have of got someone else. The rest of the cast bounce off him wonderfully. Mark Wahlberg as Ted's best friend for life, fits the bill perfectly and Mila Kunis is great as the girlfriend. For me though, Giovanni Ribisi, when he arrives on screen, plays creepy, camp and evil all too well. He is a joy to watch. (maybe joy is the wrong word here).<br/><br/>This is an intelligent and very cleverly thought out comedy. Don't get me wrong, I know the image of a little teddy using the F word and smoking dope continuously, is going to be funny no matter what, yet doesn't sound like it would have to be too clever. The script is 10 out of 10 and this coupled with the perfect pace of the film means never a dull moment. My problem with most comedies is they can't keep the laughs going for the full running time. Here the jokes are very witty, insightful and out of the ordinary and stays that way for the full 106 minutes. The fact that this movie is about a teddy bear whom magically comes to life and then seamlessly blends into day to day life, for me, has failure written all over it. Yet, MacFarlane creates a world where all this doesn't matter and the viewer takes the magic for granted and goes along for the ride. And the ride is most certainly worth the trip.<br/><br/>And lets not forget the animation. Ted never looks out of place. The special effects are seamless, even in high action fight scenes, they don't miss a beat.<br/><br/>Ted is one hilarious movie.

"TheSeaLion","4","10","17","30 July 2013"," From the creator of ""Family Guy"": What were you expecting?
","When I first saw this film and wrote up my original review of it on this site, I only viewed it as a dumb, unfunny comedy created by Seth MacFarlane that I had an extreme hate for. After so time passed, I came to realize that my problems with ""Ted"" came from more than just the fact that I did not find it to be all that funny. To be fair, I will say ""Ted"" is one of Seth MacFarlane's better works, easily surpassing his animated TV shows ""Family Guy"" and ""The Cleveland Show"", but not reaching the level that ""American Dad"" is at.<br/><br/>After thinking about it a little, I realized that my main problem with the film was not the humor, as the first twenty minutes and the last thirty minutes had sufficient enough humor from me to warrant at least a positive view of the film. The middle of the film is bogged down in so much of the humor style that MacFarlane has become known for that I lost interest in the humor and moved my full attention on the plot, which I had even less interest in.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is not too original for a comedy film. It is a typical romance versus bromance where John's (Mark Wahlberg) girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) wants Ted (MacFarlane) to move out of the apartment in hopes that their relationship will become more mature. Ted does move out but John finds himself blowing off Lori and other parts of his life to hang out with Ted. When John ditches a party thrown by Lori's boss (Joel McHale), it's Lori's last straw and she breaks up with John. John, with occasional help from Ted, tries to make up with Lori and rekindle their relationship.<br/><br/>There were several problems I noticed with the middle chunk of the film when the comedy died down to almost nothing with a few chuckle-worthy moments every now and then. The biggest problem was that John and Lori had no chemistry together. I did not buy the fact that they were a couple and I could not muster an iota of investment to their story. If the film had focused on John and Ted trying to remain friends because of John's relationship with Lori, the film would have worked because the two had good chemistry. I never felt like John and Lori were emotionally connected on any level, so I did not care if they got back together or not.<br/><br/>Next, the film felt like an elongated episode of ""Family Guy"", but with a beginning and an end that was at the very least a little funny. The film was filled with pop cultural references and other comedy that MacFarlane has become known for, a really stupid plot line with bad attempts at drama, and scenes that try to be emotional but are either ruined by trying to insert comedy or played for laughs. The beginning of the film is not like this and the ending tones it down a little, but for the most part, the entire film is like this.<br/><br/>While my opinion of ""Ted"" has increased to a level where I can see what people find funny about it and why some do like it, my opinion has not changed to the point where I actually like this movie. It is still dumb and boring with nothing to care about, complete with the usual junk that gets worked into MacFarlane's work. It had some fun moments and it shows that MacFarlane can be funny, but that is about it."

However about halfway through the movie there's a party sequence and they do shots and then it's hinted they do cocaine. After all the dumb crap Seth MacFarlane hinted at about what would happen to you if you tried mushrooms on Family Guy, he has the nerve to show people using cocaine right after using alcohol. One of the things they tried stressing in our minds in high school was to not mix the two, because it is cardio-toxic! As if people weren't stupid enough. Other then that Mark Walberg get's kind of annoying when he openly decry's the c-word.

I did like the idea that briefly Ted's incredible story was big news and he became a minor celebrity, but they really went nowhere with that. Ted's being a living toy ceased being relevant to the plot. We could have been watching Damon and Afleck running around Southey. Even the prologue and Patrick Stewart's narration falls completely flat. It sounded as if it was written by an 8th grader. ""And then they grew up....heh heh....and things became shitty.....heh heh.

","Ted is foul and offensive, but that is expected from anything from Seth MacFarlane. Ted has it's moments, but there are not many, that are funny. The funny moments are found in the first couple of minutes of the movie though and then the movie slides down the garbage chute into a murky, pile of dung. There are so many wasted characters and terrible unnecessary moments that have no bearing on the characters, that take away from the moments that could be funny and are there for shock value (but do not make it). Patrick Warburten is wasted in this movie. Warburten is one of the funniest men on television and Ted is just a waste of his comedic abilities. Warburten's homosexual relationship with Ryan Reynolds has no bearing on the story and wastes screen time that could be used for something else. Patrick Stewart's narration is wasted and unnecessary and again has no bearing on the story or the outcome. Joel McHale's character chasing Mila Kunis again has no bearing on the story and is dull and lifeless. The worse part of the movie is Giovanni Ribisi and his obsession with stealing Ted for his son. This obsession provides the absolute worse part of the movie and destroys any chance of this film from being tolerable. This movie is a complete mess and it was not worth the effort to film it."

It seems to be part of the steady downhill slide of SM's work. But, hey, at least Seth Rogan wasn't the star! When I approached those ""friends"" that told me how great this film was and conveyed my disappointment, THEY AGREED! Once again, this seems to be a film that you feel obligated to like. I didn't but I still recommend it because it is funny at times. As far as the high ratings on IMDb, I have to ask, ""really?"""
"Aqua_Fresca","3","7","11","31 December 2012"," If you like this type of humour...or maybe if you don't...
","Ted is the type of movie that's bound to attract a lot of teenagers or young adults, and it's not solely based on swear words, drugs/alcohol use and politically incorrect jokes (though that is an attraction). It has a lot to do with the type of humour the film employees (as well as Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy): random.<br/><br/>It's the idea that as soon as something funny comes to mind, you might as well just say it; or in this case, put it in a movie. The same goes for intertextual references and celebrity guest appearances, where the joke lives or dies based on whether or not the audience recognizes the reference and/or the star/historical figure; whether the logic of the situation allows for said reference to be made is another story.<br/><br/>But in short, this is what the humour of Ted is: a bunch of ideas and references strung together. A lot of the connections don't make much sense and the jokes can drag on a bit longer than they should (again, like in Family Guy).<br/><br/>Speaking of Family Guy, if you're a fan of that show then odds are you're likely to enjoy this film, as it's really just a live-action version of that show with new characters and setting. Similarly, if you've never encountered this humour before then you could very well be taken (pleasantly?) by surprise at what you see and hear.<br/><br/>Personally? I'm not much of a fan. I used to like this humour, and I admit, I even engage in it with my own friends sometimes, but that's the difference: this humour, I feel, works best in isolated situations as opposed to being forced into a some kind of story (unless, of course, it's a spoof). And yes, there is a story; the bare bones of one, but a story nonetheless.<br/><br/>If I had to estimate how many of the jokes figure into the situations presented in the story, I'd probably say somewhere between 15-20%. The remainder are just ideas thrown at the screen by MacFarlane, seeing what sticks.<br/><br/>Does this make it a bad film? Well, that largely depends on your sense of humour. When it comes to a lot of comedies, no one really cares about the story or characters being super great (though having those can't hurt), they just want a film that can make them laugh. So if you find this humour funny then odds are you will laugh & you'll likely enjoy this film. As for my rating, the reason it's not lower for me is because some of the jokes I did think were rather funny. I'm disappointed the entire movie wasn't as funny as those jokes, but what can you do? In short, if Ted sounds like it's for you then check it out. Unfortunately, it wasn't for me."
"Hellmant","8","19","38","4 July 2012"," Mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.
","'TED': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Seth MacFarlane (the creator of 'FAMILY GUY') makes his feature-length live-action directorial debut (with some computer animation)! The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis with MacFarlane voicing the computer animated title character. MacFarlane directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with two other 'FAMILY GUY' writers (Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild). The film is a fantasy comedy film about a teddy bear that comes to life to grant a child's wish and becomes a burden on his romantic relationship when he's a grown man. The movie is surprisingly well made for MacFarlane's first feature effort and more hit than miss with laughs. It's mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.<br/><br/>Wahlberg stars as John Bennett. As a child John was an outcast and had no friends so when his parents get him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas he makes it his imaginary best friend. One day he wishes that the stuffed bear could talk back to him and a falling star grants him that wish. The two grow up together and the teddy bear, known as Ted (MacFarlane), helps John overcome his insecurities. Their friendship is finally put to the test though when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Kunis), wants John to stop spending so much time with Ted so they can further their relationship together.<br/><br/>The movie is crude and vulgar but nothing more than one should expect from the creator of 'FAMILY GUY'. MacFarlane's direction is surprisingly impressive and the jokes for the most part work (which is more than I'd say for 'FAMILY GUY'). Wahlberg is good and likable in the lead and the movie actually has a lot more heart than you'd expect from it. It's actually a positive story of friendship that could have played out the same way even if one of the characters wasn't a magical stuffed bear. It's about how much love and time you give to those who are most important in your life. It's also of course extremely raunchy and hilarious at times but there's definitely heart to it and it's a good, well intentioned buddy film!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAxZQ69Tess"

","I can't stand Seth MacFarlane so I guess I am to blame for not really liking this movie. As with other MacFarlane entities this one has the same non sequitur, completely random head scratching references in jokes that just fall flat. It's not that I don't get them, its just that they don't fit the context. At one point Ted the Bear sets up his own joke just to use a Pink Floyd lyric reference in which he actually has to say it's from PF so that the 90% of the people in the audience who didn't memorize The Wall are somewhat informed. The entire movie is circled around the Flash Gordon movie from 1980, which is real topical, and I'm sure most of the lines go right over anyone's head under age 35.<br/><br/>There is so much cursing in this it's becomes awkward, I could see people squirming at the disgusting jokes, which I have no problem with as long as they are funny, these weren't. Many homophobic and anti- Semitic references for some reason, more nervous laughter from the audience.<br/><br/>I actually felt like leaving I was so bored. About 3 funny jokes in the whole thing and one of those was a fart. There was a fat couple sitting near me who laughed out loud all through the last 15 min of the movie, at what I don't know. Maybe they dropped acid before the show. These are the same people who keep Family Guy on the air.<br/><br/>Not for kids under 15."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","2","2 May 2016"," Finally, a good use for CGI...
","This is the story of a 35-year old guy named John Bennett, played by Mark Walhberg, who's victim of such a common syndrome in people of our generation, he's an ""adu-lescent"", basically, an adult who refuses to grow up, and keeps on enjoying a hedonistic life made of sex, drugs and house parties. I don't know if the word is used in English, but anyway, think of Judd Appatow's comedies' male protagonist and you'll get the point. And this John Bennet leads his hedonistic life with Ted, his 27-year old best friend. But John has a job and a beautiful girlfriend named Lori Collins, and played by Mila Kunis, who wants to make plans with him, but he must show that he's capable of being an adult and convincing Ted to let him live his life. That's ""Ted"" in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and Ted is a Teddy Bear. One of the most memorable CGI creatures of recent years, who provided Mark Walhberg one of his greatest roles, in the same vein of touching weirdness and comical performance than the late Bob Hoskins in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".<br/><br/>I can imagine Seth MacFarlane pitching the film to the producer, a few sentences and you can hear a cash-machine sound in the background. Just when you get the story, a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear, you understand it is a comedy of opposition, think about it, a big, smiling, cute and fluffy teddy bear, symbol of childhood and innocence, acting like a horny foul-mouthed animal party, this is an offer a producer can't resist to. But from our experienced viewers' perspective, as promising as the synopsis sounds, we wonder how long such a gimmick can be maintained before losing its appeal. MacFarlane is a terrific writer when it comes to animated sitcom episodes (such as ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"") but there's no fundamental difference between the premise of ""Ted"" and ""Howard the Duck"". ""Ted"" could've been a disaster.<br/><br/>Or ""Ted"" could have been 'just a good film', but guess what, it's slightly better than that because of how surprisingly good it is. Actually, what could have been the basis of a sketch or a ""Family Guy"" manages to drive a story-line of a hundred minutes in an exciting and entertaining way. And this is owes a lot to the fact that Ted is handled like a full and three-dimensional character from the very start. The film opens in 1980 when a friendless boy (so alone he's even mocked by the poor Jewish kid who's getting his annual Christmas beating) and when he gets a Teddy Bear, he makes a predictable wish which predictably becomes real. Ted speaks, much to his buddy's delight and his parents' horror, but then the magic of Christmas operates, what happens next, within the film's fantastic universe, is handled with very smart realism.<br/><br/>No, the parents don't hide Ted, why should they? Ted becomes a local oddity then an instant celebrity, invited to the Johnny Carson's show, and so forth. And then like many 80's wonders and other 90's stars such as Corey Feldman or Frankie Muniz, he sadly sunk into oblivion. And after that, this is where the film won me. I thought John would get rid of Ted and then the teddy-bear would come back to his life, but would have that made sense? Why would you even lose your best friend, one that understands you perfectly, one that grows an intense complicity with you and one who was raised on the same cult-programs than you? No, Ted remained his friend and very much his friend for 27 years, and when we meet them, they act together like true bros, Ted might be a gimmick for us to discover, but he's a fully developed character nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film takes a departure from films like ""Howard the Duck"" or ""Paul"" where the strangeness relies on Sci-fi elements. The fantasy here allows the film to get away with all the 'why's and 'how's and spare us some distracting special effects. Here, the plot centers on relationships, and the way love can undermine friendships and vice versa. And when you suspect it will be impossible for Ted to leave John's life because he's got nowhere to go, the film takes you by surprise by making his independent life absolutely possible. The screenplay, written by Macfarlane is the best asset of the film, because it creates unpredictable situations out on predictable material. There's no scene that hasn't been seen before, but in ""Ted"", it works because it doesn't try to be original, it just sticks to Ted's irresistible personality and the contrast with his appearance.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot of things happening in the film, a mysterious buyer obsessed with the Bear and played by a creepy-looking Giovani Ribisi, there's Lori's boss and occasional stalker whose efforts to conquer her hearts always meet with answers you never really see coming, there are also one of the most memorable cinematic parties with a mysterious guest star, and of course, there are some delicious interactions between Ted and characters of female persuasion, even a nice cameo as one of his ex's, one you never see coming. This is a film that is really caring about making us laugh and manages to take a concept à la ""American Dad"" (one of the best written animated shows) and make a story out of it, one full of crazy one-liners, raunchy but never vulgar dialogues, or never vulgar at the expenses of humor, and one of the funniest concluding voice-over monologue.<br/><br/>And beyond the laughter, Ted is humanized in such a way you can't look at him as a Teddy Bear, but he's so cute and adorable you can't ignore that. What a fascinating paradox!"
"LeonLouisRicci","6","2","2","28 January 2013"," Farts and Poop = Yuk Yuk
","It seems utterly useless to complain about the current modern infatuation with flatulence and poop. Last week there was an entire BoB's Burgers (Animated Fox TV) episode about ""The Mad Pooper"". <br/><br/>MacFarlane's The Family Guy (Animated Fox TV) has been a mainstay on Sunday night for over a decade and frequently uses such toilet stuff ad nauseam. So there must be a market for this boring and repetitious yuk. But one just has to ask. How many times can hearing a fart or seeing a pile of poop get a laugh?<br/><br/>So it is there not for a laugh, but for shock. A cringe. A way to embarrass those who think this kind of stuff is disgusting. To separate you from them (like a kid's club). Anyway back to Ted. If every fart and poop joke and scene were removed from this movie; would it still be as funny? Absolutely. What, if anything, did the scene with the hooker taking a dump in the living room accomplish? Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>It is a kind of charming, clever, interesting, infantile comedy, or maybe sophomoric would be more appropriate. There is enough here to entertain and as always the creator's sharp Pop Culture wit is amazing. The movie is so good when it's good but when it's bad it stinks.<br/><br/>But here it is. Obsessed with the anus. So it is infantile. For that it is quite a disappointment, not just here but in a all of its modern marketing. So if you are up for it, hold your nose and take a chance."

","Starting as any ordinary Christmas story: When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), an isolated friendless kid, wishes for his teddy bear to become real a simultaneously falling star transforms the cuddly toy into a living being, thus becoming best buds ever. However life goes on after childhood, as time goes by, age catches on and the child becomes a man. Ted (Seth Macfarlane) was something of a celebrity back in the days, as a walking-talking-thinking teddy with no place in our scientific-based reality. Now foul-mouthed and wise-cracking his body has remained unchanged, but inside has grown up. Still living with John they form an inseparable duo, much to the chagrin of the latter's girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis). Perpetually attached to his childhood teddy bear, John fails to grow up and take on responsibility, instead working at a dead-end job and lacking any sensibility or push to alternate his existence.<br/><br/>Admitedly a fan of Seth Macfarlane ""Ted"" seemed like a match in heaven - an intriguing premise, a stellar cast and the great comedic artistry of Macfarlane. Alas the sense of humour is a drop below his high standards, somewhat more crude and less whimsically well-placed than normal. Typically non-politically correct the overall concept works well, but lacks the substance and content for the long run, making the screen time enjoyment peter out. Most of the humour focuses on the cute teddy being lewd, heavy on drug use and apt to sexual endeavours with prostitutes or various pop stars. Inasmuch as it works for the character it doesn't make up enough backdrop for creating the holistic script. Wahlberg and Kunis do add some presence, but there just isn't enough meat on this comedic bone to make it work throughout - the silliness starts off as being charming, but just ends up tiresome."

","This is for the unrated version on the DVD.<br/><br/>It is supposed to be a romantic comedy, right? But right off the bat, it's shocking how much foul language and obscenity is used throughout the movie, even those coming out of the bear.<br/><br/>The obscenity did not enhance the humor, the plot or the romance. If they removed the obscenity, it could be a perfectly good family movie, or at least PG. I almost quite watching the movie because of the obscenity.<br/><br/>The plot is more or less predictable. But there are two major plot holes: The first one is change of personality, which often happens in movies and which I hate: the girlfriend of the bear's owner used to hate the bear, but in the middle of the movie, she suddenly became very concern for the bear's well being. What gives? Also, at some point in the movie the bear was able to beat up his owner who is pretty well built, but later on when his life is at stake, he turned into a wimp.<br/><br/>It's an OK movie if you're OK with the obscenity.

","First, let me start this review with a little story: When I walked into the movie, it was PACKED. So packed, the only seats left were in the dead front row. Now, a couple seats over from me, there was this couple with their child--who looked no older than 6--sitting on their lap. I just looked and gave a quick face-palm because I know that kid had no business watching this movie. 30 minutes into it, the mother gets up and leaves, assuming she's going to the bathroom. However, 15 minutes later, the father gets up and takes the kid with him.... They never came back. Now, those parents are stupid because this should have known this movie was rated R. I mean, from looking at the movie poster you should assume three things that it is not a film for kids: *The fact that it is from the creator of FAMILY GUY. *Ted is holding a beer bottle. *LOOKING AT THE RATING!!!<br/><br/>Now, to the movie. There have been movies that are raunchy with no sense whatsoever. There are comedies that have a good story, but not that hilarious. Let me say that this movie Is raunchy, hilarious, and has a very well-put together story from it! I have have laughed really hard at movies, but very rarely will there be a movie in which I laugh so hard that I almost bust a gut. The last movie to do that was 4 years ago in 2008's Tropic Thunder. (I did that in The Avengers as well when Hulk smashed the crap out of Loki, but that was one little scene, so it doesn't count).<br/><br/>This movie is like Family Guy on steroids, however it is very hilarious, very well-put together, and the amount of heart in it is shocking. You'll be very surprised. Mark Whalberg does a great job and it looks like he brought out the kid in him as well. Mila Kunis is wonderful as well, and Seth outdid himself. Using cast members from Family Guy, and there was something that seemed like a homage to the Peter Griffin/Chicken fights when Ted started brawling with John.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie. Just DON'T BRING KIDS."

","Im a huge fan of Seth Macfarlanes work but this movie was absolutely terrible on all aspects of film making. Even judging this movie only by the characteristics of comedy movie, it was still a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Seth macfarlane likes using a lot of American pop culture references uses a lot in his TV shows (Family Guy, etc) which people will get the jokes and make connections with how MacFarlane views the world. The problem with making a lot of pop culture references, its basically a hit or miss with the audience. They will either get it or they will not get it, and most of his ""funny"" references were mostly ""misses"" with the audience. Probably because i wasn't born in 80's time period, but for the most part all the jokes were bad. <br/><br/>Basically Seth MacFarlane's signature or style of comedy is trough pop culture references, and also he uses a lot of frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby type of classy music for his score/soundtrack. Thats Macfarlanes signature in every episode or movie.<br/><br/>Movie was mostly a drama then a comedy."

","I have to confess that I have seen many bad movies in my life. This (so-called) comedy really makes the highest ranking so far. The director/screenwriter/narrator of Ted demonstrates a very restrictive and particular sense of humour that insists on highlighting sexual extravaganza over and over again. Believe it or not, there is actually a love story. By confusing ""being funny"" with ""being vulgar"", that story however gets lost pretty quickly. I saw no point in watching this movie till the end... to what end anyway? Since religious language is also abused all the time in pointless dialogues, maybe a prayer will serve as an appropriate conclusion: O Lord, have mercy!"

MacFarlane wrote the screenplay with his Family Guy colleagues Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, and they must have thought there were writing for a cartoon, because some events that happened were totally ridiculous, a teddy bear and sex, that is both loony, perverted and ridiculous in so many ways.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: as the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's (Mark Wahlberg) teddy bear, Ted, came to life, as John grew so did the bear, in attitude voice and reason, but things started to change when Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into the picture, John has to grow up, but Ted keeps him grounded.<br/><br/>Acting by the leads is an A+ from me; i was actually impressed by Mark Whalberg, not saying he is bad at what he does just saying i was impressed. Directing and screenplay D-, some scenes were just too dull for me.<br/><br/>Whalberg was in Contraband and The Fighter (with Christian Bale) before this movie, i was not too much of a fan of Contraband, but the fighter was just a legendary movie to watch.

And in fact, only a head as damaged and distorted like his could think of ruining the teddy bears, a symbol of our childhood and innocence, putting one of them to do a huge amount of obscenities in a two-hour movie. The film puts Ted to behave like an idiot, to swear and say profanities as if he were reciting Shakespeare instead, and to use drugs and drinking as the world were to end tomorrow and the best thing to do was to turning back in human evolution. In addition to this authentic apology to animality, imbecility and consumption of drugs and alcohol, the film also puts Ted practically defending the ""theory"" that being a pervert is simply great, and a great proof of manhood.<br/><br/>I don't consider myself an ultraconservative nor a moralist, but the truth is our society didn't need this kind of movies. There are more interesting ways of doing comedy. To making people laugh isn't need to attack the moral and social values ​​in which we create our children and stand our nation.

","While I enjoyed some of the jokes and laughed a couple of times, it felt like McFarlane was trying to be politically incorrect for the heck of it. Especially since the incorrectness is actually rather clichéd and will not be hurting many people's feelings, at least here in Europe.<br/><br/>To make doubly sure that no feelings get hurt, McFarlane wraps the jokes in a tidy package of harmless romantic comedy with cardboard-cutout actors, predictable plot and corny happy ending, that will soothe and reassure the viewer with the palette of emotions that he is accustomed to find in most Hollywood blockbusters.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor -- skip this movie and watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail (for the 100th time) instead!"
"eschetic-2","4","8","15","30 September 2012"," A question of taste
","It boils down to a question of taste. This film takes a well worn but clever idea (a child's Teddy Bear is given the gift of cognition and speech in response to a wish) and instead of going in the predictable, maudlin direction of the child inevitably outgrowing the toy (as in I.Q.), it goes in a different direction. The child (Mark Wahlberg) never out grows the toy and the toy never outgrows the child, but both age into foul mouthed ""everyman"" working class jerks (with, inexplicably, the toy having better luck (but worse taste) with ladies and drug suppliers than the boy - one wonders where the boy got passably adult standards (and Mila Kunis) even to this extent - possibly by watching episodes of MacFarlane's FAMILY GUY which is much more consistent and disciplined in its humor, possibly because it's on network TV.<br/><br/>The problem isn't the language. When the shock value plays satirically against expectations (as in the definitive answer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as a Christmas movie, THE REF) it can be bracing and fresh. Here though, it is not only all pervasive but as inconsistent as the story telling (adults and Ted swear right up to the point where a swearing father says ""you shouldn't swear in front of children."" Ted, the toy, is treated as a real person by EVERYONE but the possibility of selling him to a psychotic father - Giovanni Ribisi in a change of pace role - of a horrible child who wants him is treated as reasonable. The stuffed bear is shown taking a bubble bath with no realistic issues of absorption or drying out). EFFECTIVE fantasy must be grounded in some reality or at least consistency. The only consistent thing here is the overly broad Boston accents (Southey might consider defamation suits.) If gross-out comedies where prostitutes dedicating on your girlfriend's floor on a dare and your girlfriend's reaction thereto is considered ripe material for comedy in your world, add another couple stars to my rating - if not, deduct two stars.<br/><br/>You will still want to go along for this particular ride so badly because the acting (Whalberg and various unbilled supporting character actors - one nice cameo with Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds offsets a lot of implied homophobia - and even Seth MacFarlane's voice for the well CGI'd Ted) is so good and the idea has such potential, but if you make it as far as the cameo of Sam Jones (from the campy FLASH GORDON remake) without being as high as the lead characters, or switching to the essentially more innocent (and funnier) HAROLD & KUMAR films, you may want to consider counseling.<br/><br/>You're definitely not going to feel comfortable watching TED with pre-teens around (one of the reasons it tanked in the theatres) and I have to wonder who else the film makers had in mind when they green lighted it. Who else would laugh at the idea of Lance Armstrong's testicle (lost to cancer) being bronzed and displayed by a collector - not to mention followed by the obvious line from period Mounds/Almond Joy commercials.<br/><br/>The traditional fight scene between the best buddies (and the whipping of Whalberg's half naked ass by said best buddy) is a moment or three I will long remember, but all in all I cannot honestly recommend the film as a whole. Whalberg in song (not too long after the fight scene) will probably recall Cameron Diaz's challenged vocalizing in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING for many, but without the warm romantic pay-off. Nothing in TED has that kind of pay-off, and that's the real problem."

","While there are many funny moments, ""Ted"" tends to run into the same problems that one would expect out of an almost two hour episode of ""Family Guy""; a simplistic story with some extremely clever jokes and hilarious one liners mixed equally with niche 80's references and jokes that bomb miserably. With the assistance of many of the actors from Seth MacFarlane's own animated creations (Family Guy, American Dad) and Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), the uber-talented MacFarlane writes/directs and does the voice of the talking teddy bear himself, in his first feature film ""Ted"".<br/><br/>Using his own satirical take on New England culture, MacFarlane crafts the story of an inanimate teddy bear named Ted, who because of a wish from a child named John, becomes a vulgar talking teddy bear who smokes pot and loves the ladies. But years later as 35 year old John and Ted's juvenile relationship continues, John's girlfriend Lori wonders if there is any hope for her relationship with John to become serious as long as Ted is constantly hanging around. While this super simplistic buddy comedy storyline is accentuated by various comic detours (or bits) that are good for some out loud laughs, the demo audience (depending on how young they are) may not get a substantial amount of the heavy 1980's references, such as a constant (but well crafted) cameo from Flash Gordon himself, Sam Jones.<br/><br/>Problems arise in the second half of this film when the comic momentum is all but lost, due to a combination of necessary story arch sentimentality, an overuse of 80's reference and a ""bad guy"" element that not even an immensely talented actor like Giovanni Ribisi (Boiler Room) could salvage. There is also the visually distracting fact that Walberg is so much older than Mila Kunis (who plays his long time girlfriend) but, I digress.<br/><br/>Final Thought: I will say it again, MacFarlane is undoubtedly one of the most talented people on television (in the 30 minute format) and while ""Ted"" showcases why his fanbase is so large, his feature film directorial attempt isn't as strong as other animation geniuses turned filmmakers, such as Mike Judge (King of the Hill, Office Space). Go see ""Ted"" if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane, otherwise seeing a movie like this, may turn out to be only an above average and far too hit and miss of a movie going experience."
"David65536","5","3","4","4 August 2013"," Entertaining but lazy comedy by Seth McFarlane
","I am a McFarlane fan but the movie seemed to me too hung to Family Guy's cast and regular jokes. So I was disappointed to see that the teddy bear was made ""funny"" out of being a total jerk based on a combination of Quagmire-Peter Griffin from Family Guy. The idea of a teddy bear partier foulmouthed could be funny if the character wasn't so mean and utterly despicable. <br/><br/>As a Seth's follower I appreciate his 80's references and some of the comedy situations come from cameos from actors from Seth's favorite 80's movies: Top Gun and Flash Gordon. Those were classical McFarlane so I didn't dislike them. But the movie doesn't get out of the jokes and you never get a reason to like either Ted or to cheer for John Bennet, he never gets how disgusting his friend is to his girlfriend of four years. The movie includes a grotesque scene that IMDb doesn't like in Bennet's apartment which the girlfriend has to clean (!) and the teddy bear having sex with a coworker over food in a grocery store and getting promoted for it as a joke on corporate America I suppose... is not that the humor is too brown is that is not that funny in my opinion. <br/><br/>There is a competitor for the love of Mila Kunis character, but the guy is a total jerk all the time so we never see her falling for him, unless she is a total idiot too as she would be better alone. The denouement of the movie is not too bad, but you have to be a hardcore Family Guy fan to like the movie as it seems a long episode of the series. In the future I would like McFarlane to try some humor without trying to make an offensive joke every sentence or at least not fall for the easy ones, we have Family Guy for that: R-rated stuff that IMDb does not allow me to write... sometimes when you break taboos I consider them fine, but FamGuy has a tendency to try to be over the top and so we have enough of this in that cartoon series so it looks bad in a movie that otherwise has a good premise and a good cast."

","I was a fan of Family Guy, but emphasize the use of past tense. I thought its first three seasons were pretty consistently hilarious; after that it was uneven, but pretty funny when it was good; yet then it took a turn for the worst and just became unbearable, so I stopped watching. Before going to Ted, I tried to watch a new episode, but I couldn't sit through it. However the good reviews that this film was garnering told me that maybe, just maybe, it might be better than I had previously hoped. Alas...<br/><br/>It was pretty awful. From the start, I knew what I was in for, but I had hoped that over the course of its relatively brief runtime, it may pick up, and I would find myself in a state of hysterical laughter; yet I could only dream of it. We've seen this kind of clichéd plot before, usually without a bear, yet that didn't bother me going in, but some of the 'romantic' and 'heartfelt' were so generic and unoriginal I was bored to tears! I like Mark Wahlberg - brilliant in Boogie Nights and The Departed - but here, all he could do was work with what he was given, and that wasn't much. I'll admit, he made me guffaw, only once. The acting overall was nothing special and at times unengaging. There were a few nice cameos (hello Norah Jones, hello Sam Jones), but they were unfortunately wasted.<br/><br/>And as for, the 'comedy'; it was nasty, obnoxious, crass, etc. Now, don't get the wrong idea, that I'm prude or anything, I love everything from Wonder Showzen to Trey Parker and Matt Stone's work to Bill Hicks, but I've seen the jokes here countless times in the past, and didn't find 'em funny the first time round. I adore risqué humour when it's trying to make a point or convey a message, not when it's there for a cheap laugh. A teddy bear humping a cash register is not funny. A teddy bear on weed is not funny. Obnoxiously insulting Brandon Routh is not funny. Especially six years on! If you're gonna make a joke about a celebrity try and do it when current and relevant. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this at all. If, for some godforsaken reason you still think Family Guy is great, then you'll probably lap this up, but if you thankfully don't, well then, steer clear of this turd. While watching this in the cinema, the audience were in uncontrollable bouts of laughter, while I had a bad taste in my mouth. With his live-action debut Seth MacFarlane had an opportunity to prove himself a great comedic talent, he's wasted it and opted to the lowest common denominator of unfunny, unoriginal and eye-rolling cheap laughs. If you want the comedy of the year so far, go watch 21 Jump Street."

Overall this one was just a so-so effort. I think it also could of been somewhat shorter in length as the funny lost its way and at times really dragged.

About 10 minutes into the movie, I was regretting that decision. Why, you may ask? Well.....basically, this movie did little more than bring the Family Guy animated show to a live action movie. Many of the actors from the TV show were in the film, and the entire cache of jokes seemed to center around smoking pot, partying with loose women, and being immature and irresponsible. There wasn't even the distraction of the homicidal baby to take your mind off the ridiculous clinging to college days.<br/><br/>I can only assume that Mila Kunis agreed to do this film as a favor to Seth MacFarland, as she has become MUCH to good of an actress to lower herself to this level. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, has had a string of disappointing films, so this is right up his alley.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, I was forced to suspend disbelief as to why the entire world believes in a walking talking teddy bear, and why/how he can do some of the things he can do. Much like I'm often left wondering why nobody finds it odd that the dog talks and drinks martinis on the TV show.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there were a few moments that made me chuckle, but nothing to make me feel I got my money's worth.

","As a huge Family Guy fan, I was excited to see Seth MacFarlane directing a live action feature. The humor is exactly what you would expect, however, Family Guy is a 22 minute show and Ted stretched a single gag for way too long. Family Guy is quick and hits you with joke after joke, but the timing for Ted became painful. I felt MacFarlane hung himself with the R rating. Free of network censorship, it felt like he tried too hard to try and shock an audience that's already been around the block a few times. My ADD checked out halfway through the movie and I drifted into boredom. People will argue and say ""what about that scene"" or ""I loved the part when they did this"", but wouldn't you think a feature movie would have more than 2 or 3 funny parts? Would you watch Robot Chicken if it were only funny for 15 seconds and the remaining 10 minutes were boring?

It's been said that all the jokes Seth couldn't get away with on Family Guy show up here; while that may or may not be true, it's a great script, well acted, and again, gut busting funny. Anyone who has spent time on the East Coast (particularly NYC and Boston) will recognize the cadences and attitudes. The plot is simple and straightforward; guy loves girl, guy loses girl, guy moves heaven and earth to get girl back. All with the help of a talking blue collar bear! But the script is terrific - just like Family Guy, NOTHING is sacred here, and that really appeals to me in our politically correct world. You can't even tell a Helen Keller joke anymore! On second thought, if you have to ask who Hellen Keller is, then is isn't the movie for you. I'm sure Lion King is playing somewhere.

Plus, Seth MacFarlane didn't attempt to give him a voice different from Peter in Family Guy so every time Ted spoke I imagined Peter from Family Guy. That's just lazy on Seth MacFarlane's part. And I find Peter one of the least likable characters on Family Guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie. The plot is not good.

","I've given this film 1 star out of ten because it's the lowest possible. If I could I would give it a minus number. I thought this film was horribly unfunny and after seeing that it holds a score of 7+ on this site, I felt a bit sad for the state of mankind. I wonder how so many people can enjoy this total rubbish. <br/><br/>The idea of a talking bear is fine but wouldn't that be more suited to a movie for children? Ted is for myself at least, a totally unlikable Neanderthal much like his owner. They are lazy, stupid and nasty and some of the 'jokes' leave a really sour taste. 10 minutes into the film I knew what it was going to be and I could easily have turned it off. <br/><br/>I am not a fan of the director's other work but I actually didn't know he was involved until halfway through the film. I'll be sure to avoid anything else which he turns out in the future. After seeing this work it seems to me that he is quite an ignorant, spiteful and cruel person who will say or do anything to get a laugh. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend that you avoid this one."

","Everyone watched it and everyone liked it and deemed it to one of the best comedies ever. I'm personally pretty shocked by that, because I've rarely seen such a stupid movie. Now I really have to wonder if it's me or society that something's wrong with.<br/><br/>But let's begin with the good things about the film: At first the concept is pretty good (a teddy bear who was sweet once, but now is an alcoholic who trips out sometimes). Secondly, the cast is very promising, too. Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane are all household names in Hollywood. And third, some jokes are funny - every now and then even exceptionally hilarious.<br/><br/>And with that I immediately build a bridge to the bad side of the film: Some jokes are perhaps good, but most of them are just dumb. I really don't get what's so funny about watching people who are saying the f-word in every other sentence. A scene in a supermarket with a blonde woman, a sausage and Ted himself (I don't want to give you too many details) is just disgusting and especially at that point I wondered how this film was rated for eleven or twelve year old children in some countries. OK, to make it clear to you I have to tell you the ending of this little scene (it's at the beginning of the film and no important part, so not really a spoiler): Ted f***s the woman (my goodness, now I even use this word ...) - I mean, come on, how for goodness' sake is this amusing?<br/><br/>Now that I have complained about the weak jokes enough, I want to mention the other two big blunders of the movie: The completely bog-standard plot could have been told in about ten minutes, and you know from nearly the first minute on how the story more or less will develop. Two of the three main characters aren't really likable either and I felt really sorry for Mila Kunis' one (though I don't understand why she lives with two drug addicts, one being a teddy bear, by choice). <br/><br/>This is all I can tell you about this movie at the moment. For me it's one the biggest movie disappointments ever. So, overall four out of ten points, because at least the idea was good and I laughed sometimes."
"trevor-mcinsley","5","5","9","3 May 2013"," Typical Family Guy Writing...
","For every genuinely funny joke you have to sit through ten minutes of pointlessness. Then you've got the generic over the top fight scenes which they seem obsessed with and piles of pop culture references which are just pop culture references... without any attempt to turn them into proper jokes. Same with all the bizarre celebrity namedropping. The film even ends on one as if that is the lasting memory it wishes to instil in its audience.<br/><br/>The opening five minutes is probably the best part of the film and the narration works very well, but after that it is mostly a downward spiral of drivel. The initial premise is fantastic but it was fairly predictable where it would go from there and a lot of the scenes just feel like filler.<br/><br/>There are a few genuinely hilarious lines. The exchanges with the grocery shop owner and the Flash Gordon bits are great... it's just a shame it gets buried under a mountain of mediocrity and a stock plot. Also they totally failed to play Queen's wedding march from Flash Gordon at the end...<br/><br/>The writers need to realise that just because one of the characters is a talking teddy bear... everything it says does not turn to gold. The dialogue that works especially well is when it is actually in relation to him being a teddy bear. Writing angry letters to Hasbro about having no penis for instance is something which can only work in this film, and indeed works well. So much of the rest however is just very generic stoner/buddy film lines which have nothing to do with him being a bear. They would not be funny when delivered by a human and just because he happens to be stuffed and furry... they do not suddenly become so.<br/><br/>There is a certain amount of humour to be mined from portraying a children's character in an adult theme and parodying the endless well of 'lonely child befriends an alien/toy/talking animal' films from the 90s (I really need a better name for that)... but it quickly gets old. I feel you could edit out a good thirty minutes of content from this film without actually losing anything. That is never a good sign.<br/><br/>Paul is a film with a similar premise and target audience which ultimately delivers far more effectively and does not disappoint."

","This is my first review so please forgive me if it gets a bit ""all over the place"" I liked this movie. But IMO, it could have been better.<br/><br/>A movie about a crass, pot smoking, dirty minded teddy bear was always going to be funny. And it delivers in that aspect.<br/><br/>There were some brilliant one liners and some fantastic dialogues.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud A LOT (but I also LOL a lot at the Avengers too) BUT...it was only funny because of the filthiness and crassness of Ted and the people around him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found the story a bit blah. IMO, it seemed like it was planned as ""a bunch of things a teddy bear could say that no one would expect"" and at the last minute they though ""shit, better put a storyline in"". And then they just created a basic, done before plot which didn't fit together all that well really.<br/><br/>I loved the interaction between Mila and Mark. I thought they mde a fab couple.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that everyone will laugh at (providing they aren't easily offended) and enjoy then Ted definitely fits the bill. If you want something with a decent story to go alongside the comedy then you will be disappointed. Not for young kids, my 12 year old daughter wanted to see it and after I saw it, she is not allowed to watch it, some very rude bits (funny for me, too rude for 12 year old eyes) Overall, I did enjoy it and I laughed at it a lot and I would recommend seeing it.

As stupid of an idea as a man attached to a living teddy bear may seem, that's the point of the comedy - I get it. I just thought it was dumb and didn't work.<br/><br/>What I expect is not only laughs, but a good story to support those laughs and more emotion for the characters (i.e. stakes) to make it that much funnier and enjoyable. Mark and Mila's characters had absolutely no basis in their relationship (there was nothing concrete actually keeping them together, nor was their union) so when ""Ted"" compromised that and everything went to hell, I didn't care one way or another. Nor did I care about Ted and what happened to him near the end either.<br/><br/>The story was weak, the characters were weak, and that made a weak comedy - no matter how funny the jokes."

","Possibly the least funny 'comedy' I've ever had to sit through, which was a shock for me, since the creators of Family Guy, a show I love, were involved.<br/><br/>I think this entire movie falls on its own rump if the novelty of a swearing, weed-smoking teddy bear wears off at any point. For me it took about five minutes.<br/><br/>After that it was just a slew of simple, crude 'jokes' that never hit their mark due to their reliance on the teddy-bear vehicle.<br/><br/>The bear itself was an irritating character, completely unlikable in every regard, and what was up with Mark Wahlbergs' accent? Are there really Americans with dialects as ridiculous as that? It sounded like he was chewing words rather than saying them.<br/><br/>All in all, juvenile, and not even funny with it."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","7","16 April 2013"," This movie and me are Thunder Buddies for Life
","In his theatrical debut, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane makes his big leap from television with Ted. Always pushing the boundaries with his own style of humor, the movie Ted is truly downright hilarious. As the director, producer, co-writer, and voice artist behind the title character, MacFarlane makes offensive laughs on pop culture, drug culture, religion, sex, bodily functions, and all things '80s. Yes, there are extremely foul language, some racism comments, and some homophobic jokes, but I wouldn't say it was really crude enough for the audience to hate the characters. It's pretty tame compare to the television shows that Seth MacFarlane created such as American Dad and Cleveland Show. Some of the jokes do fall flat in my opinion. Example: 'The Airplane!"" type scene. Why make fun of a parody that makes fun of another movie and don't add anything to it. John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is an adult who still lives with his childhood Teddy Bear (Seth MacFarlane) who came in life when John's childlike wish came true. John still acts like a child with Ted despite the fact that his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) wanting him to be more mature. I thought Mark Wahlberg did a good job as the movie's likable goof. As the movie go on, John must choice a successful life with Lori, or a life full of fun with Ted. While the same time, John stands to lose it all, with Lori's sleazy boss, Rex (Joel McHale) trying to hook up with her and Ted's crazed fan Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) wanting to kidnap him for his son. All the actors did a wonderful job in their roles. I have to say, that Joel McHale was good at being a funny scum ball role. Giovanni Ribisi was just creepy in his role as Donny. The scene with him dancing to Tiffany's 'We are alone now' is disturbing. About the plot, I give it a B. The story is your usual rambling Seth McFarlane script with lots of cultural references that makes sense or doesn't add anything to the story. I love the running gag about Ted & Jon being huge fans of 1980's movie Flash Gordon. There was even a cameo by the main actor from the movie, Sam Jones. There is a lot of cameos from MacFarlane's cartoons shows playing supporting characters as well. I love Patrick Warburton as guy. I don't get what the guy is saying, but it's funny. The animation on the film was great, as the CGI bear look life like. One thing is that if you do decide to watch the Unrated Version, it's doesn't give you anything new, but lame jokes that deserve to be cut. So don't watch the unrated version, unless you have to. Like the title suggests, this is an R-rated film. This film isn't for small children. I think most teenagers probably heard or saw this movie already. Most of young teens would have heard this kind of language and dialogue at school or college, but still it's shouldn't be watch with any children, not mature or adult like to watch. Don't take the movie too serious, just enjoy."

"alex-caruso1","Null","4","7","11 January 2013"," Now I understand all the bad reviews.
","Yep, this movie was a PURE disappointment. Just got this movie on DVD last night and watched it. Sure enough, I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. In fact, I barely laughed at all to be quite honest. Everyone probably knows what this movie is about, so I'm not going to jump into that. All I know is that the dialog was bad, I barely found any of the jokes funny, the story and plot didn't seem to go anywhere. It was just another poorly thought through comedy that tried to be funny. Like just because there is a dirty mouth-talking teddy bear in the movie we are supposed to laugh at everything he says? I really didn't find Ted that amusing at all. The love relationship thing between Mark Wahlberg's character and Mila Kunis's character was just the same old mushy crap. The couple have their struggle's because Ted interferes too much with their lives, they break up, but because they save Ted at the end of the movie, that finally makes them realize that they were meant for each other. Just the same old love story, you knew they were going to get back together didn't you? Jew jokes, homo jokes, sex jokes...BORING!<br/><br/>Or how about at the end of the movie during the climax when Mark Wahlberg punches the fat kid in the damn face. Oh yeah...haha. There's not really much I can say that hasn't already been said by all these other reviews. Mark Wahlberg wasn't that great in this movie either, the acting just wasn't good. I'm not just talking about him, I mean the whole cast. I don't even get the villain in this movie either. He was just some lame-ass psychopath with a fat son who wanted to kidnap Ted, and we barely get any background information on that character. <br/><br/>In conclusion, its sad to admit that the trailer for this was funnier than the movie itself. My favorite parts in the film were probably the party scene, and the motel fight scene between Mark Wahlberg and Ted, THAT WAS IT! Don't hold you're breath people, because this movie is not what you think it is. 3/10."
"jen_2953","1","4","7","10 January 2013"," Worst movie I have ever seen: Total trash (warning: possible spoilers)
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>First off, let me preface my review by saying the following. I do not mind crudeness in a film. I believe, if done in an appropriate manner, a moderate amount of crudeness can be quite funny. Now, having said that, I need to say the following. This may have possibly been the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and I've seen some pretty terrible movies. My husband wouldn't even finish it. Where do I even begin? One, total lack of a thought out story. Yes, the teddy bear was wished to life and they grew up together. Maybe if it were an Indie flick I could buy it as a social piece but no, it was far from that. Secondly, the acting was pretty unbelievable, as in, literally unbelievable. I have seen quite a few flicks with both Whalberg and Kunis and they are wonderful actors. I couldn't buy it in this film. Third, somewhere along the way, Seth Macfarlane decided that the only avenue to humor is through disgusting crudeness. There are reasons you can do thing was in an animation that you can't do in real life. He should have kept that in mind here. I mean, really, who WANTS to see a grown woman have sex with a teddy bear? I imagine the same sick-minded person who would find this movie at all good. It was filthy and completely tasteless. As I said, crudeness can be funny or it can be icky and this went head on for the latter. I almost have to question the intelligence of anyone who could find this movie entertaining, unless of course they are a teenage boy, then maybe I could see it. I immediately returned this to redbox. I wasn't spending another dime on it."

How can these actors think - WOW - this is a movie I would love to be in??? by 1/2 way through the movie I was trying to look for a spot that I actually thought was funny. I was working at trying to laugh and could still not find anything to laugh at. This ranks up there with Little Nicky and Zoolander as one of the worst movies I ever watched - and paid for viewing it to add insult to injury. My advise - don't bother.

The target audience are 14 year old kids or just simple minded retards. This movie is terrible, there were a very few funny scenes and the plot was horrible, it was way too simple and predictable. If your more for the comedy in the film then i recommend you to just watch the trailer, it basically shows all the funny scenes. This is basically like watching Family Guy, just worse!

","If you take the humor from Family Guy, the simple plot of any romantic comedy and the drama from Toy Story, put it in a blender and mix it, you get TED.<br/><br/>It is a good movie, and you will laugh quite a lot when reading it, it is definitely a Sunday movie. However, my expectations were higher. I was hoping so see some kind of masterpiece from Seth McFarlane, yet for me, the story was way too simple for that to be reached. A romantic comedy is definitely not what I was expecting.<br/><br/>If you take away the humor (taken from Family Guy) and the kidnapping drama (taken from Toy Story), you get just another romantic comedy where there is a couple that is in love, then the guy makes its mistakes, they get mad and after a bit of drama, they go back together to live happily forever after. That exactly is where McFarlane might have sold its soul to the money. Romantic Comedies are generally a silver mine (its not gold, but you can still sell it), and it was way to risky to do something else where his humor could fit.<br/><br/>Aside of that, the FX, music and acting is quite good."
"nathanschubach","3","4","7","5 August 2012"," A talking bear, pot/fart jokes, and random pop culture. Meh.
","I just got back from seeing this movie. It was only OK. There's nothing mind-blowing about much of the movie other than the CG effects used to create the talking, ever-partying bear. The story is basically a mixture of the plots to ""Toy Story 3,"" ""You Me & Dupree,"" and ""I Love You Man"" but with a talking bear as the best friend. Why? Don't ask me. It doesn't really make sense, but it's touted as being a fantasy movie as much as it's a comedy as well.<br/><br/>I didn't like the idea that Ted was an aging being who slowly progresses into being a ""bad boy"" type as his human owner/friend ages alongside him. He just comes across as weak and a bad friend overall, in that regard. The whole being and backstory of Ted is ridiculous though, so you can't read too much into the character other than he sounds like Peter Griffin and has the personality of Quagmire.<br/><br/>I felt that Seth MacFarlane is the real person in this production who was looking for a friend, though. His never-ending compulsion to keep bringing up past pop culture references sounded like a cry for someone to understand what he thinks is funny. I get itTiffany on the TV, multiple obsessions with Flash Gordon/Sam Jones, a Knight Rider/Star Wars ringtone, Indiana Jones music, and on and on and on. He really is South Park's idea of what the Family Guy writers room is like: random thought bubbles mixed together and fed to the audience as humor. It's debatable that this is the truth because after a while I was like, ""OK! I get it! Move on!"" in my head. And there are tons of celebrities and cameos to digest throughout the film, as well. I don't know if it's Seth's idea of a power trip to include famous people he knows or what.<br/><br/>Joel McHale was probably the funniest part of the movie, which isn't saying a lot because they write the same fart jokes for him that they did for Mark Wahlberg. I just like his delivery a lot better than everyone else's.<br/><br/>If you're not picky about joke-writing or tropes that you've seen in movies 1000x over, Ted feels like a surreal romantic comedy. If pot jokes, multiple penis and fart jokes, or jokes involving animated creatures humping humans doesn't bore you, you just might like it. I thought it was all stuff I've seen before, though."

","Seth MacFarlane's irreverent humor may not be for everybody; but those who love ""The Family Guy"" will adore ""Ted,"" whose running time equals about five ""Family Guy"" segments,yet, amazingly, maintains a more consistent level of humor than even one average episode. ""Ted"" even trumps ""Family Guy"" by also being a romantic comedy superior to most. A pretty amazing accomplishment,if you ask me; and, I hope the Motion Picture Academy recognizes this by nominating ""Ted"" as one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>I have always considered Mark Wahlberg a middling actor with great taste in scripts, as he has made some really fine movies. Mila Kunis is not only beautiful, but a great ""straight man,"" as the antics in ""Ted"" would have rattled any lessor actress. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific in a small role, saving what is easily the weakest part of the movie (which is still better than your average movie). However, who would've thought Sam Jones(!) would steal every scene in which he appears? NOTE TO Hollywood: Give this guy another chance.<br/><br/>Ted's animation is so astounding you actually come to accept him as a living, breathing creature, and the fantasy sequence recreation of ""Flash Gordon"" is spot on, an more amazing accomplishment considering the film's relatively small budget. Likewise, kudos to whoever effected the ""appearance with Johnny Carson"".<br/><br/>As a bonus, Nora Jones, one of my favorite singers, also appears; and, she proves she is not only a great singer, she is sexy-beautiful and funny.<br/><br/>""Ted"" stands along with ""Duck Soup,"" ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""The Whole Nine Yards"" as my all time favorite comedies.<br/><br/>I give ""Ted"" a ""10""."

I'm going to do you readers a massive favour and tell you all what happens at the end so that you don't end up wasting your time and money watching this drivel! I cannot find any redeeming feature in this film! No, I tell a lie there is one and only one, and that is the clever way Ted has been made to look real.<br/><br/>It's a tale about an eight years old boy who had no friends that was thrilled to get a stuffed cuddly bear as a Christmas present. Once received he then wished for it to come to life and so it did. Now as far as I can tell, in a prosperous country such as American and in a middle-class neighbourhood such as John Barratt was in the last thing an eight years old boy would be thrilled to receive is a stuffed teddy bear! Any way he got it, he made the wish, it came to life and became famous but didn't earn anything from being famous. that all happened pre credits. during the credits there is a montage of them growing up to adulthood and him in a job which even though he is always late for it and is hardly ever there he is still in line for a promotion. I wish I could find a job like that! Time and time again the bear ruins John's relationship with his girlfriend causing them to eventually split up. the two get drawn back together when they go chasing after Ted who has been kidnapped by a creepy man that is obsessed with him. The man wanted him for his son and after hearing Ted make a phone call to John takes Ted on a car trip. John and his now ex girlfriend Lori are in the car together on their final time together when the call is received work out where Ted is and head over to the house. As they get closer they see Ted in the man's car and give chase to a football stadium. The creepy man chases Ted up a stadium light stand and as he grabs hold of Ted's foot. On pulling Ted down ted is torn in two and his stuffing comes out. At this point I was so hoping the film would end but no there was still more rubbish to come. John and Lori grabbed all of the bits rushed home with him and stitched him back together. Guess who wished him back to life? Yes that's right Lori! The person whose life he had effectively ruined for the last four years by her boyfriend always putting the bear before her. the one that on coming back from their four year anniversary dinner to find a turd on the floor claimed it was there courtesy of one of the three very attractive ladies he was sitting on the sofa with! <br/><br/>The film is too awful and how it managed to do so well at the box office is beyond my comprehension! There are lots of appalling films that do do well at the box office leaving me struggling to work out why.

","This film is basically Wilfred, but instead of a dog, it's a talking bear and instead of being funny, it's not. It doesn't get one star because Mila Kunis is so ridiculously good looking that she would warrant a star for standing still and silent for two hours. This is not massively surprising since the director / writer / whatever, thinks that humour can be achieved by repeating lines / entire scenes from various cult artifacts of popular culture verbatim. I think flash Gordon is cool, I didn't need to watch half of it again though in the guise of another film. I think my personal final straw was when they actually reference Family Guy. Presumably there will now be an episode of Family Guy, which will feature a scene from Ted. Maybe Ted 2 will reference that scene. Unlimited material for the genius Macfarlane."

So, I am going to be brief about this...This movie is a combination of Family Guy and a rehash of movies that have already been made. Boy meets girl, boy has obnoxious friend that holds him back from his marrying potential, girl lays down ultimatum to ditch the loser friend, boy repeatedly keeps going back to the friend, tells girl to give him one more chance, which she does, guy screws up one more time, girl breaks up with him, guy realizes she is the love of his life and THEN decides it is time to ditch the loser friend, only one last crisis with friend makes both guy and girl realize that the loser friend is a necessary part of both their lives. Blah, Blah, Blah. There, you have the movie in a nutshell. No need for a spoiler alert in this movie critique because you have already seen this movie in watching other movies. Also, most the funny parts are in the trailer so the scant few that aren't in the trailer aren't worth the cost of a ticket to see it. If you are a brain dead stoner, you might enjoy this movie. If not, don't waste your time on it."
"BharatSamra","1","5","10","8 August 2012"," I didn't think my low expectations could have been disappointed. They were
","It almost feels necessary to reciprocate the vulgarity of this so called 'comedy' in order to express my distaste for its unoriginality, offensiveness, and ability to absorb incessant laughter from a mass audience, excluding myself. I will however restrain and refrain from reducing myself down to that level, in comedic terms, that level being beneath the basement of laughter.<br/><br/>The fact Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut is categorised as a comedy is quite tragic. If 0ff-colour humour and flatulence are primary appeals for modern audiences, then we can unfortunately (or not if you enjoy it) prepare for a future comedy genre flooded with idiotic and stale humour. Every laugh in the theatre possessed a sense of shock, prior to genuine laughter because of the crude nature of the every ever predictable and tired joke, which were exhausted even before the opening credits.<br/><br/>Take the attempted humour away from Ted and what are you left with? Other than a slightly more bearable two hours, the remains would be shorter than the amount of time it took me to want to leave the screening, which was not long at all. With all three of our main character's motives established early, their actions only become increasingly obvious, so obvious that one could probably predict the events if they were to have held a glass to the door of the screen with one ear at the other end and just listened rather than watched. They would have most likely had more fun than I too!<br/><br/>While having a strong dislike for MacFarlane's three hugely popular animated series, I find my reasoning behind this similar to that of my loathing for Ted. These, in my opinion, pathetic excuses for the moving image, embark on what I can only describe, feels to me like being trapped on a one way train filled with loud, obnoxious passengers who are engaging in ignorant disputes, throwing useless insults at one another. The little steam it had prior to boarding is quickly diminished because of the engineer, MacFarlane's lack of skill to sustain a working locomotive.<br/><br/>Despite the above, perhaps harsh criticisms, there were few positive elements to the worst film I have seen this year, maybe any year. The combination of live action and animation looks superb, to a point where you do not even question the reality of the character Ted's existence. It would have complemented the film more had we seen more emotion displayed by the character in terms of facial expression and body language, as it is solely dialogue which makes him feel like any more than a child's teddy bear. Overall though, the Tippet Studio visual effects team did a terrific job. Back to reality, or well, a real person in Mila Kunis playing a fictional character. The most convincing of all characters due to the genuine emotion she appears to convey.<br/><br/>The only way in which the eyes that are looking over the hands typing this review would once again witness the film that is Ted, would be if Universal Studios decided to pay me. Those who are fans of MacFarlane's work on Family Guy and subsequent almost identical series will be prone to enjoying another very similar tale of pointless storytelling. I personally would not recommend this immaturity to anyone who does not appreciate the director's other works."

","I am getting increasingly anxious about the type of films adults call comedy. For pubescent boys, I can see the appeal of the film, but an awful lot of adults and reviewers seem to be stuck in puberty as well.In fact to find a fascination with scatological references you can even include 3 to 5 year olds. <br/><br/>Ted is a grungy version of Peter Pan and he belongs in Never Never land with the other lost boys. I would dearly love to see more popularity of cinematic portrayals of grownups dealing with the serious problems America is confronted with today. <br/><br/>That world also has its joys and benefits. We all need to listen to our inner child on occasion, but it shouldn't rule our lives."

After years of watching Family Guy and American Dad i couldn't help but check out the trailer for this movie. And what i saw was really satisfying! I bought my cinema ticket and went straight to the cinema to watch this thing. And it turned out great! It is one of the funniest movies i've seen this year, and for Seth's first full lenght film, it was really great and the jokes were not forced at all! I simply loved it and didn't regret the money spent on this. In fact, i think i might even go see it again. While this movie has a great plot, it is also a good dramatic film too. BUT, the humor used in this movie will often only apply to those who like the satiric Family Guy TV-show, and those who does not like vulgar and satiric humor should stay away from this one.

It is down-right funny and it feels like a cartoon of his. It's got fantasy sequences and jokes that revolve around pop culture. It has a ton of language, drug usage, and sexual references which is why it is given an R-rating. So check it out.

","I have been watching this film for about 30 minutes. I have yet to smile , let alone laugh. it just proves to me that Hollywood will and does do ANYTHING to make money. Mark Wahlberg is not my favourite actor but he has made some good movies. Why oh why did he make this piece of crud? The special effects are pretty good but it is the only special thing about this movie. What is all the fuss about Mila Kunis? She is average looking and no better or worse an actress than any other. It is symptomatic of modern so-called ""comedies"" that no-one can say anything without foul language. This thing is just so crude it is untrue. I am not a prude and have no problem with bad language, I just object to it when people think crudity is funny in itself. There is nothing witty or clever about this script - how it got commissioned is beyond me."

","I love teddy bears and other stuffed animals. I really dig that kind of wacky, inappropriate humour that makes Family Guy so outrageously funny. Mark Wahlberg won me over in Boogie Nights and I have been watching Mila Kunis's career with great interest since That 70s Show. Romantic comedies with a touch of magic are my thing, too. Naturally, I had high expectations for Seth MacFarlane's feature film debut.<br/><br/>The first couple of minutes are just about perfect. I am a lifelong Star Wars fan, so seeing Ted dressed as Yoda queueing for the premiere of The Phantom Menace was a real treat for me. (And I happen to be a huge Kiss fan, as well, so another box was ticked when I spotted a Kiss poster on the wall.) Unfortunately, that's about it. The novelty quickly wears off, the pacing is very uneven, the script is all over the place, and most of the jokes are shallow, overly gross and/or unoriginal.<br/><br/>There are some memorable moments, though. The stoned party with Flash Gordon or the fistfight between Ted and John are hilarious (the latter undoubtedly being sort of a cinematic milestone), but the movie as a whole is not nearly as funny as it could have been."
"bugandlolly","1","3","5","21 July 2014"," Utterly awful
","This is an absolutely awful film and it is not even remotely funny. I have no idea why it was so well received. Personally I gave it a 1. I like both of the actors (Wahlberg and Kunis) and I thought the premise had potential but I couldn't even watch the entire thing and I very seldom stop a film before it is done. This one was simply more than I could stand. I have no problem with raunchy humor so long as it is amusing and I am seldom offended but this movie is simply not funny unless you happen to be delighted by farts, poop and vomit. It is stupid, obvious, contrived and offensive. It relies on grade school humor, something I find utterly boring. One reviewer compared it to ""Paul"" but ""Paul"" was actually funny and the characters were likable unlike any of those in ""Ted"", including the bear. It has to be truly difficult to make a teddy bear so completely distasteful but this movie certainly succeeded. I disliked this film so much that I decided to read almost all of the reviews on IMDb. There were an extraordinary amount of ""1's"" given, pages and pages of them in fact, and I find it hard to understand this film's rating.<br/><br/>Sadly I guess I was expecting something like ""Harvey"". Well, ""Harvey"" this certainly isn't. Do not waste your time or your money. This is the worst film I have seen in a very, very long time."
"serincan","7","3","5","1 January 2013"," Enjoyed a lot
","John Bennet (Mark Wahlberg) an antisocial 8 year old wishes on Christmas that his bear Ted could actually talk with him. A miracle happens and his wish comes true. At this point you might expect an E.T.esque movie like nobody else knows anything but little John and the bear. But it becomes a legend with Ted appearing in Late Night Show and being the talk of the nation. When John is an agent at a car rental company in his 30s, Ted as his sidekick (with the voice of Seth MacFarlane) grows up into a full functioning adult living in Boston, smoking pot, messing up with girls and cheering for Bruins, Patriots and probably Celtics. They all live in John's girlfriend Lori's (Mila Kunis) apartment in a posh downtown neighborhood. John is cool with his low- profile job and irresponsible lifestyle with his best buddy Ted but a problem is likely to occur when Lori wants him to be more serious with his life and proceed to a next level in their four year relationship.<br/><br/>With all the absurdity it suggests, this is how the movie develops into something spectacular. Ted is not your ordinary comedy movie. We know Seth MacFarlane and what a great job he does in Family Guy. With spontaneous jokes, unexpected flashbacks, awkward moments and profanity at the right places, this movie is like Family Guy in live motion. Yet you don't get a hint of Peter Griffin or Brian although the voice is the same as Ted's.<br/><br/>This shows how well the character development of Ted in this movie is thanks to MacFarlane as the writer and the director. Not only a humanoid with bad habits, Ted even has some political views given away by his racial comments about Jews, Mexicans and Muslims like a random dude somewhere in the US would do. You don't see Ted as a toy anymore, nor is the plot surreal. The film somewhat owes this to the computer graphics team. The animation is so good that it feels like there is an actual toy robot doing all the acting. <br/><br/>Also the chemistry between John and Ted is a big contributing factor for this. Surprisingly he has a better chemistry with Ted than he has with Lori. Actually that is what is supposed to be in the movie. Wahlberg is more sincere with his partner in this movie than he has been in his previous ones including Fighter. <br/><br/>One thing I don't like about the movie is the lack of consistency. The movie has touches of comedy, drama, action and thriller but all served separately. First hour is a near perfect silly- comedy, maybe the funniest of the year but then the drama kicks in and the pace of fun drops quite a bit. Finally the film turns to be a thriller at the end. The last part contributes to the absurdity and adds up to the movie but there could have been a better mingling between these parts.<br/><br/>Having said that, MacFarlane does the thriller part brilliantly. It feels like good and evil from a typical Disney cartoon incarnated in the heroes and villains of this movie. In a sense the director is transplanting the movie to a cartoon in the viewer's perception and memory. In his debut motion picture, Seth MacFarlane shows a great skill and a big potential to spice up the genre.<br/><br/>One last note With all the profanity, drug use and sexual content you probably don't want to see the movie with the kids! For more of these see the unrated version if you have any chance."

","Ted<br/><br/>Typically, when an adult male still resides with the teddy bear he grew up with, the toy has since been grossly perforated with penis holes.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the stuffed-animal in this comedy appears to have all the correct orifices; however, one can converse.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years after wising his inanimate Christmas present to life, 30-something John (Mark Wahlberg) now lives with the foul-mouthed plush Ted (Seth MacFarlane).<br/><br/>But when John's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) grows tired of Ted's debauchery and gives John an ultimatum, Ted's left to fend for himself.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a rabid fan (Giovanni Ribisi) that obsessed over John's possessed plaything growing up plots Ted's abduction. <br/><br/>Conceived by the creator of Family Guy, Ted contains the same rudimentary comedy elements as its brethren: talking animals, odious behaviour, and laugh free jokes based on referencing stuff from the 1980s.<br/><br/>Besides, wouldn't a boy from the '80s rather wish to life his sister's She-Ra doll?

"bob the moo","Null","3","5","10 November 2012"," Really depends on whether you like Family Guy or not (SPOILER)
","The plot here centers around a bear that magically came to life due to the wish of a young boy. After a brief introduction where we see this bear be a celebrity and the world be captivated by him, we jump forward in time where the world has gotten used to it and life has gone on and now the boy and his bear are still friends but friends that some week, work in low-level jobs and try to get their lives together. In terms of plotting this is focused on the relationship between John and Lori in regard how Ted messes it up – it is a very simple plot that allows for lots of crude yet funny escapades along the way. A sub-plot about another family who wants the bear seems to exist solely to provide a dramatic conclusion and doesn't really fit.<br/><br/>This very simple plot means that the film will stand or fall based on the viewer's sense of humor. If you like Family Guy with its non-PC characters, crude tone and constant reference points then the film will more than likely work for you, if not then it probably won't. The reason for this is because the wit and humor is very specific; it is unfair to suggest it is not intelligent just because it is crude, but it is worth saying that this isn't Woody Allen any more than it is as basic as pratfalls or fart jokes. The majority of the jokes come from the creation of Ted – specifically that he is a teddy bear who says terrible things, does drugs and hangs out with hookers – it is a simple character in that regard and the humor follows that pattern. The delivery is what makes it work though.<br/><br/>MacFarlane may be rather one-note, but that note is a good one. His writing and delivery of lines is generally very funny and it is telling that I never even once thought about what a good ""special effect"" Ted was (although he is) because I was too busy thinking of him as a character. Wahlberg also deserves a lot of credit; as daft as the film is or as demeaning as some of his performance is, he always goes with it and his performance with his invisible co-star is really good whether it is in dialogue scenes or in the more physical scenes. Likewise Kunis goes with it really well and manages to do enough to carry the actual plot while also helping the comedy.<br/><br/>It isn't a brilliant film though and even fans of MacFarlane will acknowledge there are bits that don't work or that really force the point. For example as a child of the era, I loved the Flash Gordon references and the silly extent to which it takes them, but mostly it wasn't particularly smart so much as it was wonderfully silly and as a result I imagine many others will see it as tiresomely silly. The plot is simplistic and messy, the humor is mostly crude and the references are generally heavy, but it had me laughing and the performances from the lead three are all strong as they ""get it"" and their delivery really helps the whole thing hang together."

I could not believe that I have finally seen something that was truly won't-stop-laughing-until-it-is-over funny. All the actors did an amazing job.

","If you are not a Family Guy fan then stop reading and leave immediately.<br/><br/>If you are easily offended by crude, offensive, racial jokes stop reading and leave immediately.<br/><br/>If you are going to attempt to figure out why there is a talking teddy bear and nobody seems to care then stop reading and leave immediately.<br/><br/>Ted is basically a live-action spin of the Family Guy school of humor---full of obscure and blatant references, full of absurd and ridiculous humor, subtle satire and finally even a little bit of heart (Although only the first two seasons of Family Guy contained such a thing). Just like the show, the plot and premise is very simple—the draw is all that happens within the timeframe; that's what keeps you entertained. And Ted fits this billing too.<br/><br/>Basically Ted is about a man whose inability to grow up stems from his continued relationship with a teddy bear turned to life during his childhood. All in all it's an adult fairy tale, with all the crass jokes, dialogue, and insanity that you usually get from your R-rated frat pack comedies. Except this time the humor gets flung at you in massive clusters at a rapid ADD pace that may prevent you from breathing at times—while at other times you are just begging for them to throw a new funny sequence.<br/><br/>This movie feels so much like Family Guy and not just because it's from the same writer/director and contains the same types of jokes as the cult hit---a good portion of the staff can be seen/heard here. Mila Kunis, Patrick Warburton, Seth MacFarlane himself (voicing the bear with a Peter Griffin accent), and even the musical score comes from the same composer as the show (Walter Murphy).<br/><br/>To sum this up nicely, if you enjoy (and can tolerate) the Family Guy brand and the times they do miss their jokes, then there's no reason why you couldn't enjoy this. While the third act really bogged down the entire picture with a boring subplot that actually bares minimal continuity to the first half, I can't deny it's a fun ride and a great debut from Seth MacFarlane.<br/><br/>Let's be serious, any movie with a dozen Flash Gordon references has to be entertaining."

Anyway, not being American does not disqualify me from reviewing this title. OK, so I started to watch this movie after few decent trailers and as it's with trailers, all were lies. The movie is NOT funny, not at all. It has few decent moments when you could laugh, but it's hardly anything more than 5 scenes. All the rest is pathetic, childish and vulgar display of what? Immaturity? Stupidity? Obscenity? I don't get it - why EVERY movie in last few months I have seen must contain massive load of scenes with 1/ smoking pot 2/ doing coke and doing hookers 3/ swearing, in pretty much extreme way? Oh, I have forgotten, in ""Ted"" a hooker takes a dump on the floor, so it's always something new and refreshing (sigh...). to be honest, for the first 45 minutes the movie is terrible, simply terrible. I caught myself staring at this movie with my face muscles so tense that it looked as if I watched some II world war atrocities! It was embarrassing to watch those ""funny"" jokes, gross language, smoking pot for like every 5 scenes back and forth? Watching this movie is exhausting, it will make you just tired, not relaxed. There is no good humour, there is rotten foul language, it will make you feel BAD. Did you maybe see ""Bad Santa"", with B.B.Thornton, few years ago? That movie was vulgar, with characters swearing, treating women in a bad manner but in the end the outcome is that under the skin of the meanest son of a b... there is a good spirit and warm heart. Here - well, here, last 20 minutes leave some hope, but it won't save the movie, it's too late. First hour ruins this movie completely. <br/><br/>OK, I might be old, I am in my late 30s already and maybe I don't understand Western world. But I miss the days when a good comedy was warm, relaxing experience, when you could think a little and smile, hug your girlfriend sitting next seat and not to be ashamed with watching some disgusting jokes about eating pu..y, c..m on someone's face made out of dish washing liquid? <br/><br/>Don't waste your time for this move, as I said, it's nice animation and not much more, all the rest is simply disgusting<br/><br/>My rate is 3/10, and its mostly due to animation, not much more."

","Here are the bear facts: The comedy ""Ted"" is quite a treat, and it's one of the best ""laugh-out-loud"" comedies of 2012. Director Seth MacFarlane's concept of a raunchy talking bear is something that might sound silly on paper, but it's quite amusing on screen. ""Ted"" stars Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett, a Bostonian who as a result of a childhood wish, caused his toy bear Ted to come to life; too bad he did not have a Bikini Barbie. Consequently, the talking bear Ted becomes an instant celebrity as a result that he is a talking bear. John and Ted become best buddies throughout John's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. John and Ted do all those things that guys do with their toy bears like smoke pot, rent hookers, get drunk, and talk smack. Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, gets impatient when she continuously observes that John is not willing to mature into a matrimony state mainly because of his man-child behavior with Ted. So therefore, John and Ted's friendship is put to the test. I will not divulge more on the ""Ted"" narrative because it is something you have to see for yourself; if you have not already. But let me tell you this in in a flash, the 70's sci- fi remake of ""Flash Gordon"" and its star Sam J. Jones play an important part in ""Ted"". Again, you just have to see for yourself, if you can bear controlling the laughter of this uproarious inclusion. ""Ted"" is MacFarlane's baby, and he excels in his hilarious scribe of the picture and his pinpoint direction; and I should also voice to you that he voices Ted riotously. Wahlberg proves again that he can depart from drama to comedy with ease in his performance as John. Mila Kunis was efficient in her work as Lori. And by the way, Mila could bear hug me any time! Like that's going to happen! But it was Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, yes Sam J. Jones, who came out of nowhere to deliver the top ""far out"" performance of the picture. ""Ted"" delivers the bear necessities for a comedy to shine, so give it a bear chance. ***** Excellent"

","The idea of a foul mouthed teddy bear is a great one (and has a long tradition in comic books).<br/><br/>But I think the idea should have stayed in the bar where it was discussed - the script is weak and the execution is overlong. The whole thing would have worked as a 40 minute extended sketch but as a film? Pants.<br/><br/>If I had to level a main criticism - it wasn't rude enough.

Now I know the plot usually isn't the strong point of most comedies, but the movie started and ended in exactly the same place, the main conflict was never resolved, so really everything in the middle of the movie turned out to be pointless.<br/><br/>This movie wanted to be a live action family guy type, but part of the reason family guy works so well is because it is a cartoon. In a regular movie the jokes don't hold up very well and the plot isn't strong enough to get into it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie isn't worth seeing, there were a couple funny parts, but it's nothing I would call hilarious or rate as almost an 8. Generally it wasn't very interesting."

","There's often a fine line between funny and stupid. Family Guy is mostly funny, but occasionally stupid. This movie was occasionally funny, but mostly stupid. The plot was thin, the writing and acting were weak, and the whole thing was so tedious that I couldn't wait for it to end. A crude teddy bear is funny for about 5 minutes, but I was surprised to hear people laughing at the same repetitive shtick after 90 minutes. It makes me a little scared for our society. And not because of the crudity, but because of the stupidness. I've lost some respect for Mark Wahlberg with this one, though Mila Kunis did a decent job with the role she was given. She had the only character with any legitimacy. Family Guy is funny; Ted is stupid."

And since we're quickly dealing with the consequences of living the simple life, this often feels more like a sequel whose predecessor had a much breezier ride. Because the scenes where Wahlberg and Ted (voiced by writer/director Seth McFarlane) sit around doing nothing are what makes this truly worthwhile.

","I did not want to watch Ted when it came out because of the commercials that were harassing us every 10 minutes with the trailer. I felt like the whole movie was shown in it. Plus, the prepubescent humor did not make me smile. Peer pressure finally overcame me and I played it with a Bud in my hand (you might as well lean into it). I finally changed my mind about the movie: it is hilarious! For starters, the whole movie isn't in the trailer. Ted is kind of a UFO gathering different genres: scary scenes with a borderline psychopath? Check. The mandatory love story? Check. Action-packed scenes, sex, or comedy scenes? Check. It is a nice blend of everything that the screenwriters could think of and of what could appeal to the largest audience. It's an entertaining movie for sure with adult-only humor. In my opinion, the best part was all those references to Boston and its people because I used to live there. I don't know how much it speaks to others but the locations and the accents were delightful. Mark Wahlberg is obviously a good pick for the lead part since he is from Boston... I mean Bahstun. Seth MacFarlane proved he could direct one of the best American comedies in the recent years before showing us he could also be a great Oscar host. Is this guy ever gonna stop? I certainly hope not. I want more Boston stories! If you thought your kids might enjoy it because it features a teddy bear, please reconsider. This X-rated bear smokes pot, gets drunk, has sex with prostitutes or co-workers in places you don't want your food to be. This movie is politically incorrect, crude, and morally questionable: in other words, it is 'wicked' cool! <br/><br/>1 reason to watch: if you are from Boston, you won't stop laughing.

Even though there is at least one central theme running through it, I still felt it was more a collection of funny sketches than a well crafted story, hence my low rating. But, Ted is almost certain to make you laugh if you aren't easily offended. I laughed out loud at least 7 or 8 times and chuckled quite a few times. If you get Seth MacFarlane's humor - give Ted a go, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. But if you are expecting a film with great plot and character development, you will be left wanting.

"Robert_duder","5","2","3","12 December 2012"," For all the insane hype...I really thought I'd like it...
","I'm not a huge fan of comedies, I'm even less of a fan of dirty raunchy comedies and not because I'm offended easily, you couldn't offend me if you tried...they just aren't funny. As an adult I am not amused by fart jokes and yelling body parts to get a laugh. However, that being said...I really looked forward to Ted. I know it would be raunchy and dirty but I thought Seth MacFarlane might bring a certain level of intelligence to the silly comedy genre like he does with Family Guy. I was sorely disappointed. Ted spends more than half of it's run time being outrageous stupid Adam Sandler-esque humour that resorts to the most juvenile of sex jokes and drugs. Half way through I thought I would be scoring this a 2 if it was lucky. However, surprisingly so the film does turn itself around slightly in the latter half. I really thought Ted would have a good story to go with the raunchy comedy but the good story doesn't really start until more than three quarters of the way through the movie. I also give the film kudos for the insane amount of 80's media nods from music to film to Television because that is a lot of fun for anyone who loved the 80's.<br/><br/>The cast is almost surprisingly good considering how bad most of the script is. Mark Wahlberg continues to prove his diversity as pot smoking, life struggling, and often lazy John. He has an undeniable chemistry on screen and the banter with Ted is really amusing sometimes. Mila Kunis plays her role well although it's a simple enough role. Her and Wahlberg have good chemistry and her character is a little basic but she does well. Seth Macfarlane is our Ted. Obviously the guy is a multi-talented comedian and can do MANY voices. I am a little confused why he chose Ted's voice to be one and the same with Peter Griffin though they do make fun of that at one point which was amusing. Still you can't doubt Macfarlane's comedic talent as Ted's voice. He nails it. The supporting cast includes Joel McHale (why does he always play a sleaze-bag in comedies?) and a skeezy and perfectly villainous Giovanni Ribisi. The cast all work well together and probably pull the awful script out of being completely lost.<br/><br/>I suppose I wanted Ted to be nasty and dirty but also have some heart. And in the end it tries to do that but its way too late. It relies far too heavily on really juvenile jokes that don't really work. It jumps from shocking jokes about racism to sex and I did laugh, I even hazard to say I laughed a lot but it meant nothing because the film leaves you feeling very empty. This film got really hyped up by so many people and I heard nothing but how amazing and hilarious it was so I'm sure my expectations were probably high going into it but the film remains a sub par effort in the dirty comedy genre. 5/10"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","12 October 2012"," A few good laughs (nothing to do with ""A few good men"")
","The prerequisite for enjoying this movie is acceptance of it premise. This is not just talking about a stuffed teddy bear coming alive at a child's Christmas wish. It is also that after the initial excitement, the entire world loses interest in this ""miracle"". In where it happened, Boston, people walk past this walking, talking teddy bear just as if he is another John Doe in the street. Yes, occasionally, Ted still gets the celebrity nod, in being asked to take pictures together. But that would be as far as it gets.<br/><br/>For the audience to fully enjoy the movie, it is actually best to forget for a moment that Ted is a stuffed toy, but consider him to be a real human being. After all that is where the story become really familiar, a guy's choice between a childhood buddy and a girlfriend. And that is indeed possible, with the excellent animation and voice provided by director Seth MacFarlene (BOTH excellent, that is). Some of the scene (e.g. heart-to-heart talk between the rivals i.e. girl and bear) are downright poignant.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, cast entirely out-of-type (you only have to think of ""The departed"" and ""The fighter""), comes through remarkably well as the clueless kidult. Mila Kunis (best remembered from ""Black swan""), while playing third fiddle to an animated stuff bear and Wahlberg (in that order), still manages to leave quite an impression, and not just because she is so good-looking. A small but good support role sees always reliable Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy man with a childhood complex fixed on Ted.<br/><br/>It's not that the movie fails to meet expectations to deliver a few good laughs. The funniest moment, however, may well be at the very beginning. In an establishing scene at Boston during Christmas (just before gets his magical Ted), several WASP kids follow their annual ritual of chasing down the only Jewish kid in the neighbourhood, pushing him on the lawn and start beating him. Our ""young"" (meaning the kid version) protagonist pushes open his front door, sees it action, approaches and asks ""can a play with you guys""? The bunch adjourns briefly their proceeding, turns around and, seeing him, yell in unison ""John Bennett, get lost!"" The Jewish kid lifts his head briefly from the ground and joins the chorus ""John Bennett, get lost""."
"richy1024","6","2","3","27 September 2012"," Show your kids this and they'll never want a fluffy toy again!
","When the initial news of Seth MacFarlane's Ted circulated it unquestionably turned people's heads. A fluffy, cuddly and heart warming harmless bear became centre stage. A boy's Christmas present becomes his life-long wish, to speak, to move and enjoy human life with him as he struggles to fit within human society. On that note it wouldn't be recommended to compare this with former living toy spirits such a Pixar's Toy Story, far from it as Team Woody and Buzz, unless off-set, pose smoking weed and mouthing off like an animal. <br/><br/>The question that's poses is whether Ted is a majestic creation. Would the jokes be considered droll and tolerant if a soft toy wasn't in the picture? MacFarlane has brought the unusual to our screens by being imaginative, expanding beyond his marathon of Family Guy episodes and turning Ted into a triumphant persona when considered the topic of dialogue amongst those who have become intrigued by the comic of a talking, homophobic, self indulgent teddy bear. Counteracting this, Ted is not an original act; we've seen puppeteers and all spent time in reverie of waking up to a cuddly friend. As would be expected, if this was reality the bear would become famous, but after a while the bear becomes ancient history and left to mound up with those folks forced to convert to everyday life, parallel to his opposite number performed by Mark Wahlberg. I doubt this will be one of Wahlberg's most honoured and remembered lead acts in front of the camera as the teddy is primarily centre stage. Mila Kunis is plainly staged for prettiness and zilch else. Indubitably she has acting talent but is purely the mechanism for a love story or acceptably becoming a symbol of lust for Ted to gawk whilst being John's (Wahlberg) paramount Thunder Buddy. Ted basically replaces the languid yet significant friend who clings to his middle aged underachieving chum, who is adoringly attached to Mrs attractive. Circumstances become unsettling and John has the thorny decision of choosing between Mr Fluff or the love of his life.<br/><br/>The film does boast a number of pure hilarity components, particularly the scene of prostitute excrement and a few interventions with Ted's employer. The enjoyment factor can be notified within this film but will incontrovertibly struggle to pose any bona fide prominence in years to come. MacFarlane's efforts here will become dreary after purchasing the DVD and left mounted in alphabetical order, sandwiched between titles such as Squeamish and Tedious. Let us hope it doesn't turn into a cult faction where exasperating cyclic Family Guy aficionados quote the screenplay phrase for word as they daily perform with the animated television series."

","The story tells the story of a teddy bear. Technically, from the very beginning of the movie, I started to wonder a question: how to be credible?
A teddy bear is full of character and can talk. So how did the story begin?
Fortunately, the story started well. On Christmas Eve, the child got a bear, and the bear could talk. After experiencing the media's buzz, such a bear began to become sparse and ordinary, the days were as sparse, and the taste became even heavier.
Fortunately, I didn't see a story about Toy Story 3."

Now that they are in their 30's neither one has grown out of their immaturity with Ted becoming an increasing problem.<br/><br/>John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) demands that either Ted leaves or she goes. The humor is what one would expect from watching ""Family Guy"" with a lot of adult language. It spoofs other films and is critical of many aspects of society. It is politically incorrect.

Ted is a film I think is brilliant, the film is literally an brilliant comedy for millions of reasons, the film is not just a crouched up comedy, it has loads of heartbreaking drama to it aswell which also makes you feel your watching a drama aswell and laughs, oh, Jesus! The laughs! Ted is hilarious, no other words, the film supplies you with so many jokes that work on so many levels, there is literally not a joke in this film that did not work, it was all so funny, the acting in the film was also something to praise, the acting from Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis is brilliant and Seth MacFarline is also brilliant as the talking Ted. Ted is honestly just a brilliant comedy you should really see if you love Family Guy!"

","This movie has surprised me with a good number of refreshing and unexpected moments. Without over-analyzing the story scenario itself (a conscious, living and intelligent teddy bear co-existing in today's society), I am claiming that Seth MacFarlane has created a believable setting, as believable, as can be.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg are doing a very good job, with the later doing an excellent performance explicitely, considering the special bond to his living teddy bear. It's one example of Mark Wahlberg's diverse performance capabilities, considering the long way he's come from ""three nippled Calvin Klein underwear rapper"" to someone who can make me relate to his history to Ted. If someone would have told me before that I would enjoy and buy an emotional relationship and laugh my butt off during an intense fighting scene between those two I would have been convinced easily. This is also credited to MacFarlane's prior experience with writing and Family Guy that can make any ridiculous idea work. <br/><br/>The movie is sometimes brave, sometimes silly, but all in all well crafted and if you're enjoying a good laugh you should definitely try it without friends and family that are too sensitive about nudity and moderate profanities."

","'TED' - 2012<br/><br/>Directed by Seth MacFarlane<br/><br/>Starring Seth MacFarlane, Mark Walhberg and Giovani Ribisi<br/><br/>Plot Overview: When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he made a wish that Ted (Seth MacFarlane), his beloved teddy bear, would come alive. Thirty years later, foul-mouthed Ted is still John's constant companion, much to the chagrin of Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Though Lori's displeasure is exacerbated by the pair's constant consumption of beer and weed, she's not the one who's most disappointed with John; it may take the intervention of John's boyhood toy to help him grow up at last.<br/><br/>Should this movie work? Perhaps. It has an alright premise but is dragged down by MacFarlane's frequently criticised brand of humour. I myself do enjoy the earlier seasons of 'Family Guy'{Even though it sucks now}. The balance of what it's quality SHOULD have been is right in the middle. And honestly, I like this movie. It's not an Oscar bait movie. It's not gonna change your life but I think if you sit down and watch it, and can tolerate MacFarlane's humour, you will be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>What worked for this movie. Well for starters I will compliment the cast. Seth MacFarlane does an excellent job at voicing Ted. You can argue that it's just a carbon copy of his Peter Griffin character and there is 100% some merit to that statement. But honestly, I'd argue that there are some noticeable differences between the two. The CGI for Ted was also pretty well done and reasonably convincing.<br/><br/>Mark Walhberg was also great in the movie. He doesn't deserve Oscars or critical acclaim but he provided a good enough performance. The supporting cast, which includes Mila Kunis, Giovani Ribisi and Jessica Barth, was also pretty great.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's greatest merit is it's awesome premise. The simple concept of a toy coming alive to be your friend is simply incredible. The story surrounding this premise was pretty weak but it wasn't awful. I wish it had gone through a redraft just to refine it a bit and to fix the awful ending, but it isn't atrocious.<br/><br/>Humour is a subjective thing. A film can neither be funny nor unfunny, objectively. So if I tell you this movie is hilarious(which I personally think), you may not think so. All I will say is that I personally found it hilarious. If you do not, then that is your opinion. I cannot recommend this movie for the comedy but that is purely a subjective thing.<br/><br/>My flaws with this film? As stated before, the main two are the general plot and the ending. It is way too sappy and way too ridiculous. Comedy is also a factor but I cannot recommend it based on that. If you enjoy some of MacFarlane's other work, then I recommend this movie. The premise and acting are both solid so if you like MacFarlane's humour, you've got a trifecta of reasons to see this movie. If you cannot stand MacFarlane, don't touch this with a 10ft pole. I'll rate this film 7 'Tubby McFat***ks' out of 10."

","John Bennett is a lonely child who receives a teddy bear for Christmas called Ted. As unusual as it sounds, Ted comes to life and becomes John's best friend. All goes well but inevitable, John gets old and has a girlfriend (Lori) so his relationship with Ted shouldn't be as it was, but it's actually stronger than ever. Unfortunately for him, Lori isn't happy with them so John must choose between her and Ted.<br/><br/>It's the sort of movie which doesn't take itself seriously so neither am I. It's a complete joke, set to make you laugh with everything the characters do. The simple fact of having a live teddy bear, cursing and smoking all the time is awesome! You have a bit of drama and some sober scenes to change the ""mood"" a bit but nothing complex. Most of the time, it actually is funny but you have the impression that it tries too hard. A plot with more complexity and a better end could have made it a great movie. Still, it's quite a laugh!"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","1","9 July 2015"," A movie for a specific demographic
","Seth MacFarlane is a multi-talented guy and this is totally his movie: it is his story, he co-wrote the script, he co-produced, he debut-directed and he voices the titular bear. The two main human characters - Ted's childhood friend John and John's live-in girlfriend Lori - are played engagingly by Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, but it always comes back to the furry one. <br/><br/>MacFarlane turns upside down and inside out the conventional notions of the teddy bear with the most foul-mouthed dialogue you can imagine. It is crude, rude, racist, irreverent and often very funny and there is a fight sequence that it the most hilarious since the one in ""Borat"". But this is a film for a specific demographic: the younger you are, the more you're likely to love it; the older you are, the more you're likely to find it juvenile."
"Sandcooler","8","1","1","8 July 2015"," Great bathroom humor with some unexpected extras
","The most surprising thing about ""Ted"" is that it features an actual story rather than dragging itself from one joke to the next. It's a simple story, but it definitely has some degree of fairytale magic and leads to some genuinely touching scenes in the third act. That's something you don't really expect from Seth MacFarlane, because storytelling isn't exactly his strongest point. I was expecting this to be just as filled with non-sequiturs as ""Family Guy"", and I would have been fine with that. But all of a sudden MacFarlane understands how to write interesting characters you can side with, and that's a nice plus. The most important thing is the humor though, and ""Ted"" has plenty of laughs. The voice acting is kinda lazy because Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin, but the screenplay is good enough to make you forget about that. Not bad for a debut film."
"robsta23","8","1","1","5 July 2015"," Good Fun, but Just as Simple as Family Guy
","If you're looking to watch Ted by Seth MacFarlane, just don't expect it to be filled with ""smart"" comedy. Notice it is the exact same type of humor you can find in Family Guy or in any of his other shows, except this time it is done in a live action fashion.<br/><br/>The premise is that John Bennett is an outcast as a kid (which is hard to believe when he grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), and on Christmas he receives a teddy bear and wishes for it to come alive which it does the next morning. This isn't a moment just thrown into the beginning to set up how the profane, obnoxious, titular bear came to be - this sequence has some top notch MacFarlane humor to it to give us a sense of the comedic tone of the movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot is pretty much to give the movie a plot around all the comedic bits - John struggles in a relationship with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) since Ted still lives with them while an obsessed fan of Ted's wants him for his son Robert. That's it.<br/><br/>As I said, the tone is reminiscent of Family Guy in that some of the gags are clearly in the same layout as the cutaways in Family Guy. With Ted sounding very similar to Peter Griffin (but not exactly like him as MacFarlane explains in an interview), at points Ted becomes a meta-film, especially when Ted specifically states ""I do not sound THAT much like Peter Griffin."" <br/><br/>In a sense, this movie is kind of like Pinocchio... except for grown-ups... and not as smart. Put this movie on if you are just looking for something simple, yet enjoyable."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","21 June 2015"," Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg splash their comedic energy in this vulgar, yet devilishly funny buddy comedy
","Comedy fanatics can always count on Seth MacFarlane, creator of the hit animated series 'Family Guy', to put on a good show, even his raunchy humor may not be your cup of tea. This movie, marking his first major film debut, takes his patent for vulgar humor and audacious delivery of crass innuendos and cranks up a notch with this story concerning a friendship between a man and a furry childhood friend with the mouth of a sailor. That childhood friend happens to be a talking teddy bear. For a movie featuring a cuddly little toy as a faithful companion, you would believe if you are in for a kid-friendly treat. But as this is Seth MacFarlane working behind the camera, this raunchy comedy is anything but that. It is an exercise of crude, R-rated humor and profane dialogue complete with innuendos that put the humor in 'Family Guy' to shame. Ultimately, it is funny and infectiously charming to the point where it is only expected to keep you laughing almost consistently. This film follows John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg), a 35-year old man who shares an apartment with his foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear named Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) who he brought to life as a result of wishing upon a star when he was a child. When their infectious friendship, however, threatens to come between his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Lori (played by Mila Kunis), he must decide how to balance his their friendship while maintaining a good relationship with the woman of his dreams. <br/><br/>There is plenty of joy to be found in Mark Wahlberg crashing on the couch with a talking teddy bear while smoking pot and trading profane one-liners about sex and drugs. If there is anything that hinders in your one's enjoyment in these scenes, it is, of course, Seth MacFarlane's tendency of pushing the envelop with his vulgarity, his frequent excess of four-letter words, and cracking jokes on some occasionally sensitive subject matter. Nonetheless, this movie fully embraces the audacious comedic spirit MacFarlane granted in the 'Family Guy' series. And when it comes it the chemistry between the titular character and Mark Wahlberg, that is where the film peaks. Wahlberg, who has done a few comedic roles in the past such as 'The Other Guys', shows off with his infectious comedic muscle that greatly pays off in nearly each scene he comes on screen. He is also given a chance to show his serious side when the story dives into more dramatic territory which involves the crisis between his relationship with Mila Kunis. This portion of the plot is perhaps the lesser element of the story as it serves the purpose of giving the cast some time to breath from the consistent comedic absurdity that fills the air. Nonetheless, Wahlberg and MacFarlane succeed on delivering the laughs almost consistently. Sure, there are a few jokes that fall flat. But that is only occurs few and far in between. <br/><br/>Ted is a wildly funny and entertaining enough keep viewers, particularly those of the Seth MacFarlane fandom, engaged from beginning to end. It is also very vulgar and crude to point of taking its R-rating to its peak. In this case, the conservative crowd will be left in an uncomfortable position. But for everyone else, it scores a fun, laugh-out-loud exercise."

","A typical boring story that's only interesting because a teddy bear is in it. It's your typical Seth MacFarlane fashion. Lets put a bunch of dated jokes that people of his generation get mix them in with some current jokes so the kids of today will get add it on with a typical story that nobody will notice how boring and typical it is and make one of the main character a talking animal or in this case a talking teddy bear. Is the film terrible? No but it's no where near as good as some people are making it out to be and waste of time and money.<br/><br/>So do yourself a favor and rent actually funny movies that put effort into their writings. Not this boring movie who Seth has to get all his friends in to have his fans go ""OMG SHE'S THE VOICE OF MEG AND HE'S THE VOICE OF JOE."" Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
"StevePulaski","9","7","18","30 June 2012"," Brings us back to laughing at something just because
","After nearly claiming ownership of the ""Animation Domination"" lineup Sunday nights on Fox, Seth MacFarlane makes the leap to the theatrical stage with Ted, which has the marketing concept and appearance of Winnie the Pooh with all the innocence squeezed out of him. The character, Ted, is unabashedly crude, and every time he speaks, you feel the need to take a bath. He utters some of the most foul and disgusting lines any film character has said this year.<br/><br/>And yet, I laughed. Again, I'm not proud of what I laughed at, but I did. Ted is the funniest raunchy comedy we've been given this year, and MacFarlane proves he can extend his wit for an upwards of one-hundred minutes. He's created three animated programs and while Ted sometimes feels like it might drum up a forth one, but I don't believe that's the goal here. It appears that this was an idea MacFarlane had floating around in his head for a while, couldn't find a way to make it work on any of his three shows, needed the theatrical freedom and liberation to do and say whatever he wanted to, and thus, penned a screenplay with two others, and created a comedic exercise similar to one by Judd Apatow, but with the additional element of pleasant fantasy.<br/><br/>MacFarlane has been put down by remarks that he is too heavily reliant on pop culture references and presents us with characters we can never take seriously. I don't believe he has ever been credited for being strangely sentimental in his programs, and has the skill to create a setup, a climax, a solution, and even unrelated cutaway gags his shows are known for, in the matter of twenty-two minutes weekly. His talent deserves recognition, and I believe Ted is nothing but faithful to his name.<br/><br/>In 1985, in Boston, eight-year-old John Bennett was a lonely kid who wished for a close friend to have and trust. When his parents bought him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas, he wished that the bear would come alive, and miraculously, it did. The bear, named Ted by John, went on to be a celebrity, yet never forgot his first and best pal. The narrator then tells us that just like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber, eventually, nobody gave a s***.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years later, John (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) spend their days in an apartment, watching movies and cartoons, particularly Flash Gordon, smoking a bong and eating junk food. John is a used car salesman, who has been dating the beautiful Lori (Mila Kunis) for four years, yet is reluctant to propose. She likes Ted, but feels John has been too clingy with childish things that need to go. John is indecisive about choosing the love of his life or his friend he promised he'd be with for life. The setup isn't too far from one possibly existing between long-dating couples with a human who has become too intrusive.<br/><br/>Despite given free range as well, MacFarlane doesn't immediately jump on the ""TnA"" bandwagon, or even the gross-out gags wagon either. Frankly, the only wagon he jumps on is the appropriate one; unrestricted verbal wit. He reconnects us with familiar faces and voices, with Mila Kunis (""Meg"" on Family Guy) in the supporting role, his ""Peter Griffin"" voice as Ted's (it doesn't come off as distracting as Seth Rogen's in Paul), and even the voice of the handicap character, ""Joe,"" from Family Guy, Patrick Warburton, is given a minor role in the picture. It keenly reminds me of how Trey Parker and Matt Stone utilize their recognizable voices in their films that are distant from their South Park comfort-zone. Between the verbal wit and the pleasant familiarities, MacFarlane still gives himself enough leeway to function within his newly found theatrical boundaries, without resorting to childish gag jokes.<br/><br/>But let's not forget Wahlberg and Kunis in the central roles. If there's one actor who has efficiently restored himself from goofy kid to a capable character, it's Wahlberg. He, along with many other actors this year, such as Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street, have touched on the comedy genre and have proved worthy of recognition. Wahlberg and the foul-mouthed bear have a kind bromance in the picture that manages to carry itself through the entire film, never running out of steam or resorting to tireless old fluff (no pun intended). Kunis, per usual, is exuberant in her role, providing character where there is usually caricature, and proves her determination and stunning appearance take her further than many other actresses that are on the same, or even a higher, level.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I contemplated my thoughts on if many of the references, jokes, or one-liners would be as funny if they came from a human character, and the answer is probably not. They probably would've triggered laughs, but not the riotous ones this picture gets. It is next to impossible to rewrite Ted with a human character in the bear's place, and second, the film resorts back to that old formula of laughing at something just because. Seeing a human swear, drink, smoke, and act crass in public is typical, but seeing a bear do it all is touchingly hilarious, when done properly. Especially when it is done with a wide range and an enormous heart. I believe it's safe to say Ted is the first big comedy hit of the year.<br/><br/>Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane, Joel McHale, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Stroup, and Patrick Warburton. Directed by: Seth MacFarlane."

","Absolutely hilarious. I gave this a 10 not because it's perfect - nothing will ever be. But boy, does this movie deliver. America - your favorite writer gets to the big screen with a bang. The writing for this movie is laugh out loud. I haven't been on IMDb for a while and writing reviews was a distant memory. Ted showed me why I used to love comedy movies. My only problem with the movie was the incessant laughing from the crowds - sometimes drowning out dialogue. I will probably see it again making sure the theater is empty - will take a while. That being said, it's R. Leave your kids behind. And overtly PC people will also have trouble with certain scenes. All round, MacFarlane poured his soul into the movie making - it's quite hard to weave tender moments into a movie as raunchy as this, but he did it anyway and one will never imagine this is a first for the director. My kudos and a big recommend to all movie lovers out there."
"lt98023","10","6","15","30 June 2012"," Funniest movie of the year. Doesn't disappoint!!
","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be really funny or really dumb. I am a big fan of Family Guy so I figured it wouldn't disappoint. Hilarious from beginning to end! Everyone in this movie does a great job. It was fun to see Mark Wahlberg take on a role of a funny guy. Some of the humor might be very offensive to some but I couldn't quit laughing. I was amazed about how many children were in the theater I was in. Definitely NOT FOR THE KIDS. There are several culture references in this movie that makes it really enjoyable. There were a few parts where you could kind of predict where they were going to run with it, but it was still funny either way. One part I found pretty funny was the parody of the dance scene in from the movie Airplane, although when I looked around it didn't seem that very many people understood the reference (there were lots of teenagers there). There were many more references that the younger crowd could understand though. It had a nice balance of humor to entertain younger adults and teens and older adults like myself. If you want to laugh, go see this movie. I was hurting by the time I left."

","Seth MacFarlane's Box-Office Blockbuster 'Ted' is a Hilarious, Laugh-Out-Loud Comedy, that hits the right notes in every department. The Writing is strong, The Jokes, featuring Ted are ROFL & The Performances are simply remarkable. <br/><br/>'Ted' Synopsis: As the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's teddy bear, Ted, came to life and has been by John's side ever since - a friendship that's tested when Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, wants more from their relationship.<br/><br/>I had blast watching 'Ted'. Its a genuinely hilarious film, that never loses pace. The Screenplay by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild is strong & comes in-tact with ROFL moments all through. The Potty-Mouthed Teddy-Bear is its trump card! MacFarlane's Direction is fabulous. Cinematography, Editing & Motion-Capture are excellent. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: MacFarlane is simply superb as Ted. Mark Wahlberg is terrific, as always. Mila Kunis is flawless, a very, very good performance. Giovanni Ribisi is marvelous as the menace, while Bill Smitrovich & Joel McHale are pitch-perfect. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Ted' is A Winner All The Way! Very Strongly Recommended!"
"usernamehasbeentaken","8","7","19","2 July 2012"," Movie is watchable more than two times in a row.
","To me, a movie that instantly feels like you can watch it continuously, end on end, etc. is automatically worthy of a 10 out of 10. Even more deserves a 10 out of 10 when you feel that other people can do the same. And that's exactly how I feel about Ted. <br/><br/>Some reviews I've seen give it a bad rap and then a bad rating just because there's a great amount of crude humor. However, there's warm, heart felt moments, and not just crude humor in some parts that balance it out and make this movie a fantastic comedy and one heck of a time at the movie theater. <br/><br/>And that is another reason why this movie gets a perfect score from me. <br/><br/>Plus Seth MacFarlane might be my long lost brother cause the things they (the characters) say in the movie are exactly some things I would say. Just jokes and poking at society and thoughts on Hollywood I think everyone with get a kick out of. Even though it's so reminiscent of family guy (duh), who cares. Its a great time at the movies. Enough said. <br/><br/>Hats off to MacFarlane. A great movie."
"filmcritic3","8","7","19","28 June 2012"," Chock full of laughs
","Not since last year's THE FAMILY TREE has a comedy kept me laughing from beginning to end. TED does just that. I laughed loud and hard during Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut. TED is far and away the funniest movie I've seen this year. It's nasty, irreverent, unexpected and laugh out loud funny. <br/><br/>MacFarlane is best known for his impertinent, sometimes sacrilegious animated ""Family Guy"" cartoon series. He utilizes the same approach in TED. MacFarlane leaves no one or no topic unskewered. Jews, gays, Boston girls, drug users, grocer store managers, car rental businesses, liberals, conservatives, Christians, Indians, Muslims (especially Muslims), all feel Seth's wrath. A criticism against MacFarlane is his penchant for over playing the liberal and gay agenda. His characterization of Stewie on ""Family Guy"" was receiving extremely poor reactions from the fan base and an alteration, though subtle, was instituted. MacFarlane's tone and attitude have mellowed slightly and more conservative mores are appearing in his scripts. Maybe this is because he's older and wiser, and maybe it's because he's been hanging around with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh. Who knows? The bottom line is the comedy is an equal opportunity laugh fest. The nefarious doper-slacker comedians can and should learn well from MacFarlane; you can make a funny movie with more than three bathroom humor gags repeated for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>John Bennett, played by Mark Wahlberg, is the kid no one likes. The opening sequence sets his pathetic scenario during the annual beating of the neighborhood Jewish kid at Christmas time. Wahlberg is solid in this role. After a series of yo-yo like performances in action flicks, he dives into this part with relish. I've been rather critical of Marky Mark of late, but he's climbed up the ladder of impressiveness with his performance in TED.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is Lori Collins, John's girlfriend. She is rather nondescript in the part, but with her exotic looks, all she really has to do is make love to the camera with her deep swimming pool eyes. Of course, MacFarlane knows this well and doesn't waste time in mocking her appearance in the guise of sleaze ball boss Rex, played by Joel McHale (""you have that smoky, Baltic something lookÂ…?"") In addition to an extended cameo by McHale, Ryan Reynolds, Sam Jones and the rest of the voice cast from ""Family Guy"" all appear in TED. The only one missing is Jennifer Tilly. It's a shame; she would have fit nicely into this flick.<br/><br/>MacFarlane is the voice for TED. Admittedly, there are times when he sounds too much like Peter Griffith, but most of the time the laughs compensate. The effects for TED are top notch. Credit Production Designer Stephen Lineweaver and Special Effects Supervisor Adam Bellao and his crew for bringing a teddy bear to life. It's a solid blend of puppetry and animation. <br/><br/>KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. THE HOTEL FIGHT SCENE 2. MEETING SAM JONES (FLASH) 3. NORA JONE'S DRESSING ROOM<br/><br/>There are numerous one-liners in TED. Like the old Peter Sellers comedies, they are so plentiful you will miss many of them while you are laughing at the initial one. This is a good thing, because it will enable you to pick up something new through repeated viewings.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint, it's probably the pervasive drug use. It's the only running gag McFarland overplays. Perhaps if dopers weren't causing so much havoc in schools, in neighborhoods and on roadways they would be more amusing. Now, however, they are just wretched.<br/><br/>Still, the concept of a young boys wish for his teddy bear to be real presents a plethora of mirth-provoking plights, and MacFarlane pokes most of them. As narrator Patrick Stewart says: ""There is nothing on Earth more powerful than a little boy's wish on Christmas Eve, except the Apache helicopter...""<br/><br/>THE RATING FOR TED = B"
"kenjha","3","4","9","9 March 2013"," Unbearable
","A grown man lives with a talking teddy bear, which makes his girlfriend unhappy. The stuffed toy not only talks, but he spews profanity, drinks beer, smokes pot, and is sex-crazed. Isn't that hilarious? This movie is for those who find this concept irresistibly funny. The keyword here is ""concept,"" because other than being foul-mouthed, the little guy doesn't say anything funny. The dialog and situations are painfully lacking in humor and the film goes on much too long. Not only is Macfarlane's script lacking in wit, but he wallows in phony sentimentality and sappy romance, making it unbearable. Wahlberg is a limited actor who is not suited to dumb comedies. He should stick with dumb action movies."

It pokes fun at just about everything and everyone and is the opposite of politically correct.<br/><br/>We are not fans of Family Guy, however do love American Dad.. Ted is a great example of the hilarious comedic writing (& acting) Seth McFarlane is capable of.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Ted 2!"
"JohnRayPeterson","7","4","9","19 November 2012"," Delightful Disney for adults
","To use Wahlberg's expression, from the movie and interviews, his character John Bennett and the teddy bear Ted both have potty mouth dialogue. It was with some reluctance I decided to watch a movie featuring a teddy bear come to life; this sort of thing doesn't appeal to me. But given the interviews I saw with Wahlberg, promoting it, and the fact I like most all his movies, I did see it and I hope you do too. It was simply a fun movie to watch. It's not the first comedy I've seen Mark Wahlberg act in; he was good in Date Night and The Other Guys, though I did not think much of those movies, not enough to recommend them. However, this one, as ludicrous as the story may be, is funny and delightful. I think it is because the players took their comedy seriously and performed their parts as well as anyone could have. If you can get passed the idea of a talking teddy bear, and a foul mouth one at that, watch it on DVD or on WebTV. If on the other hand you can't get past that idea, you have more sense than I do, but you may not be much fun."
"Staffenburgen","7","4","9","21 August 2012"," Surprisingly Hilarious
","I went into Ted with mixed expectations. Most of the reviews I had read criticized the film for being formulaic while most of my friends praised the film for its originality. Given the obvious contradiction here, I really had no idea what I was about to see, and in hindsight, I'm really glad that was the case. <br/><br/>Five minutes into the movie, I knew this was going to be funny. It's almost stylistically identical to Family Guy, and it translates really well to the big screen. If you're a fan of Seth Macfarlane's unique brand of humour, you will love this movie. <br/><br/>As far as the cast is concerned, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are both fantastic. As Ted, Seth Macfarlane is just awesome, relentlessly delivering hilarious lines of dialogue in rapid succession. There are also a few cameos in this film which are genuinely hilarious, both for the obvious and subtle humor that they add to the film. <br/><br/>My only real concern with the movie is that it loses focus at times in the middle. Most of the scenes are hilarious, but there are a handful that focus more on the drama of the story then they do on the comedy, which bogs down the laughter a little bit too much. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a really funny movie. Yes, it does have a very formulaic plot and yes, it does lose focus at times, but with a brilliant cast and excellent writing, this movie will keep you laughing and entertained. <br/><br/>RATING: 7/10"

"jonnyfendi","8","3","6","21 January 2013"," Crazy in A Very Good Way
","What's wrong with a teddy bear that can talk and interact with the normal world? Welcome to Seth MacFarlane's world! He is the creator behind adult TV cartoons like ""Family Guy"", ""American Dad"" and ""Cleveland"" where dog can talk and an extraterrestrial alien as a family member. It all started when 8-year-old John Bennett made a wish that his beloved teddy bear Ted would come alive to be his best friend forever and it came true the very next day. Afterwards the scene shifts to the present day where Ted is now a bear who smoking pot and dating many girls. Meanwhile, John (Mark Wahlberg) has a job at the rental car agency and serious relationship with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). Somehow, it's time for John, to choose between his best friend and his lover. My appreciation goes to Seth MacFarlane who made the script, directed the movie, voiced and motion-captured Ted. MacFarlane brings us to a whole new level of dimension that we never go before. It's sometimes weird and another time is funny. Macfarlane would do anything to create laughter, breaking all boundaries and mocking almost everyone in the industry. In short, his humor works pretty sick and well! Now, let's talk about Mark Wahlberg. All thiz time, I always think that Mark Wahlberg is always Mark Wahlberg in all of his movies. He seems only capable of delivering one same look, acting and character. But, in thiz movie, he gives me a different perspective. Eventually, Mark Wahlberg is one of the Actors who depend on his strong charisma and attractive personality. In fact, I also just realized that almost all his movies reach significant box office success. Thiz is an undeniable proof that people love him. The next in spotlight is Mila Kunis. Kunis is one true example of modern girls who can say anything she wants while still looking classy. She's not afraid to look silly. Quite the opposite, she gives the impression of smart, flexible and fun. There are also some cameo appearances involving the old aged movie star Tom Skerritt, the Jazz singer Norah Jones and Flash Gordon himself Sam J. Jones. Actually, it's quite refreshing to see a foul-mouthed teddy bear partying with 1980s sci-fi cult icon. Everything is just spiralling out of control and it seems that they are not afraid of being laughed at. Thiz is crazy in a very good way. In the end, what if I tell you that Seth MacFarlane initially intended to voice hi-tech Japanese robot cat, Mark Wahlberg was originally meant to play Nobita and the movie title should be ""Doraemon"". Well, if you believe that, then you can accept anything, including thiz movie. It's not as absurd as it sounds. Maybe sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy ^_^ <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Not every film and theme needs to be grounded to reality - when your story premise is a talking toy bear with cotton stuffing, the reality ship has sailed off the horizon.

Twenty-six years later after his wish was granted John and Ted (Seth McFarlane) are drug taking alcoholics that can barely been motivate each other to make it to work on time. John's girlfriend of four years Lori (Mila Kunis) wants to move forward with the relationship even if that means Ted has to leave. <br/><br/>Review: Writer, director, producer and actor of Ted, Seth McFarlane creator of Family guy, Cleveland Show and American Dad makes his first live action movie, bursting with lots of laughs or so the advertising campaign will tell you, not only is the movie predictable but the best of the jokes are given away in the trailer leaving only pop-culture references and toilet humor remaining. After years of being a Family guy fan I'd have liked to have seen this film and loved it. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are good in their roles and Lori isn't being horrible when asking John to give up Ted as he isn't actually having any positive effect on John's life. Seth McFarlane comedy timing is as good as it is in his television work, the jokes are played out well even the not very good jokes work however with ill effect. The CGI on Ted works well throughout the film only with one or two moments of blatantly obvious CGI. The story is the main problem, predictable with too many characters not either given enough to do and I couldn't relate to any of the main characters being only two-dimensional. <br/><br/>There are a few laughs to be had though; Patrick Stewart opening mono- log is very funny and how Mark Wahlberg takes out one of the films villains towards the end of the movie made me laugh a lot. I could relate to Ted as a character asking myself a few questions throughout, ""Why does the drinking or smoking affect him, not having any human organs?"", ""Why didn't he stay the cute bear from the beginning?"" and ""how come he's able to get a job?"" also I think as in Family guy when Stewie (Baby) and Brain (Dog) characters talk mostly to the world no understands them and on reflection they are only making baby sounds or barking, if Ted was more part of John's imagination and the film being about adult acting like a child, It could been more plausible and maybe the humor may have worked better. <br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Family Guy, Cleveland Show or American Dad <br/><br/>Verdict: A lot of hype made about this film, at sixteen years old I would have loved it, as an adult I can appreciate the work and what it was aiming to do, however I didn't enjoy it."

","I'm not the biggest fan of family guy so i considered not even watching ted but after reading some good reviews i though why not and boy am i glad.<br/><br/>There's only one problem i have with this movie and that is the casting of Mark Wahlberg, there are so many actors out there that could of better filled this slot but i do feel that Mila Kunis did a great job and she was perfect for this role.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is about a young kid with no friends who makes a wish, this wish brings his teddy bear to life and very quickly does it show them in the future getting high and partying together.<br/><br/>There were times were i couldn't breath from laughing so hard, i would recommend this movie to anyone of the right age although i do stress that this movie should not be viewed if you offend easily, the humor isn't for everyone.<br/><br/>A teddy bear that gets high and parties harder than Charlie Sheen? why wouldn't anyone watch it."

","Went to watch this movie with a lot of expectations. I'm not the type of person that goes too comedy movies in cinemas but every once in a while I give it a shot. To bad I gave this movie a shot.. Im from Holland so the fact that I paid 10(!) Euros too see this movie made me stay after 30 minutes of TED. It got so bad i almost felt ashamed that i made my girlfriend stay because I chose too watch this movie.<br/><br/>Mark should stick with the action/thriller movies and shouldn't be able too make 1 more in-movie funny comment in his live. Its not his fault i generally like the movies he acts but his timing was way off.<br/><br/>Ofcorse it didn't help that he had too talk to an non-existent imaginary teddy-bear but even so a truly funny actor would have made this movie a little better.<br/><br/>I can be short on the fun part.. Does rudeness equal funny? Don't get me wrong i just LOVE Family Guy and rude jokes if timed correctly but not if rudeness itself is the standard for making jokes it just lacs inspiration. <br/><br/>I have to admit that the one time I really smiled, the movie was playing his last 5 minutes and Ted's face was hanging like a retard.<br/><br/>The fact I rate the movie Bridesmaids, that I watched as a making-up deal with my girlfriend, about 10 times more funny should really say something about TED. I'm sorry i wanted this too be funny."

","OK i should have known better than to go see this film, it wasn't a personal choice instead i was dragged along by a female friend who thought the idea of a talking Teddie was cute, this really isn't my idea of cute, and this teddy isn't even likable, its much more of an irritant. the boundary pushing comedy from Seth Macfarlane and his use of racial stereotypes in his comedy to get a laugh is juvenile and tedious, I'm really not a fan of his humour and writing, if your not a fan of his avoid this film like the plague. On the other hand this really isn't my type of film in the first place so maybe I'm being a bit harsh, fans of Seth Macfarlanes juvenile humour will love it... i guess?. this is just the opinion of someone who would never have paid to see this film in the first place, but as i had seen it i thought id give a quick review."
"dfle3","7","3","6","17 July 2012"," Disney meets Family Guy meets porno meets spooky...75%
","This comedy starts off like a Disney movie or something...a lonely boy wants a BFF and his teddy bear (""Ted"") fills the breach. It's not as stupid as it sounds, as the boy - John Bennett (played by Bretton Manley) - makes a wish...on Christmas...with a falling star in the vicinity. Writer/director/voice of Ted Seth McFarlane obviously knows his stuff, as this plausible scenario is better than just about anything...save John's teddy bear being hit by lightning or something. In any case, Ted is now alive and John's BFF. We then catch up on John many years later, as a 35 year old (played by Marky Mark Wahlberg) with a beautiful girlfriend - Lori Collins (played by Family Guy regular Mila Kunis) - and Ted...as a bad influence on him.<br/><br/>""Ted"" works as a comedy film with a narrative arc which sustains it. That arc concerns whether John will live happily ever after with Lori, or whether Ted drives them apart.<br/><br/>For some reason, Mark Wahlberg has a strong Boston accent...I'm not sure if that is acting or...everyone he plays has a Boston accent...because he does...or something. In any case, Mark and Mila have a nice chemistry in this movie and the presence of Ted in their world feels believable...I particularly like Ted's gait...as soon as I saw it, I though ""Yeah, that looks right"". Joel McHale as Rex - Lori's boss - does a nice turn as the office sleaze. <br/><br/>As a movie, it's funnier than Seth McFarlane's lesser cartoon ""American dad"" and about as funny as an average episode of ""Family guy"" (so, there were many laugh out loud moments in this movie). Despite the Disney-esque aspects to this movie, it's really not suitable for children...really, really, really not suitable for children. There are simulated sex scenes between Ted and a checkout chick, bong smoking and some creepy people who become part of the story later on. In other words, it's the kind of territory explored in Family Guy...if you're familiar with that, you'll know the kind of humour to expect in this. Fortunately there's nothing that really drags in this movie, as there was in Family Guy...that whole over-flogged 'Stewie as an evil genius' plot arc...which I was glad to be rid of!"
"cosmo_tiger","9","5","13","10 July 2012"," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. So un-pc which makes it funnier. Believe the hype..A must see comedy. I give it an A.
","""Sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years oldI just wish I'd gotten a Teddy Ruxpin!"" John Bennett (Wahlberg) is a lonely eight year old kid without many friends. For Christmas he gets a teddy bear and wishes he was real. When he wakes up the bear is talking and he finally has a best friend. 20 years later John has been dating Lori (Kunis) for almost four years and things are starting to get serious. The only thing keeping John from taking the next step is his friend Ted. I am a huge ""Family Guy"" fan and next to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" this is the summer movie I was looking forward to the most. I had very high expectations going in and was not disappointed in the least. I think it was actually funnier then I expected. Like most of MacFarlane's humor this movie is so over the top with off the wall references (a whole plot point is devoted to the Flash Gordon TV show from the 70's) and extremely un-pc jokes that you can't help but laugh at. I could go on and on about how funny this movie is but this is something you just have to see for yourself. I highly recommend this and this is the funniest comedy I have seen since ""Anchorman"" one that I will buy and watch over and over and over. Overall, an absolute must see movie (unless you offend easy...then avoid this at all costs). I give it an A."

","Saw the movie last night at the Arclight in Hollywood. If you enjoy Family Guy, you'll more than likely enjoy the movie. If not, you definitely won't.<br/><br/>From top to bottom, the humor and structure is similar to what you would expect from MacFarlane: lots of cultural references (that figure into the plot), plenty of crude toilet/violent humor (much tamer than Family Guy, though), cutaway gags, and a lot of heart. Even the music has that weird happy-go-lucky Family Guy twist to it.<br/><br/>The characters are performances are what largely keep this movie grounded. Wahlberg does an OK job, but MacFarlane's voice acting and Kunis' performance anchor the film and make you care for the happy ending for these characters.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the movie has a lot of emotional moments. The problem is that unlike Family Guy's sharp wit, the humor is not nearly as sophisticated or fast, and a lot of zingers fall flat. Overall, it's a good, not great comedy with great dramatic elements, but given the strength of '21 Jump Street,' the writing and pacing of the jokes could have been a lot better."
"Libby628","7","4","10","23 June 2012"," I enjoyed it
","I went to see Ted at an advanced screening yesterday. This movie is exactly what I expected from the trailer: a good, fun, dirty movie that a group of friends can go and enjoy.<br/><br/>The story centers around Mark Wahlberg's character John who makes a wish upon a star for his teddy bear to come to life. Ted (voiced by Seth McFarland) arrives and they become friends. The movie then quickly jumps to 27 years later at a time when John and Ted sit at home smoking pot and avoiding real life responsibilities. Somehow (and the movie never really convinces me why) John has managed to date Lori (Mila Kunis) for 4 years. She is a hard working, PR executive who tries to convince John to grow up, let Teddy live his own life and become more serious about their relationship.<br/><br/>I thought all of the main actors did a decent job (neither Kunis or Wahlberg brought anything extra to their characters but they weren't bad) Not surprisingly, Seth McFarland stole the show as Ted. Sounding almost exactly like Peter Griffin, he manages to make Ted a foul mouthed/disgusting/crude character that you end up caring about when he's in danger at the end of the movie. Ted really cares about John, and the second half of the movie really shows their strong relationship. Unfortunately the second half of the movie is also when the movie loses steam. While most of the movie is adult fun, the final act becomes as equally cheesy and conventional as the opening sequence. There is nothing wrong with a movie trying to tug at the audiences heart strings but after spending so much time playing off the idea that this is not a kids movie (and there is no question this is not a kids movie), I would have liked an ending that wasn't seemingly written for a small child.<br/><br/>Other than McFarland's voice acting, the best part of this movie is the supporting characters. Ted's girlfriend (Jessica Barth) has possibly the funniest scene in the whole movie when she freaks out on Lori. Giovanni Ribisi is great as a crazed father wanting Teddy for his son. He delivers an incredible amount of creepiness and some great acting skills. Patrick Warburton (although only in a few scenes) delivers some good one-liners and is one half of a great couple (the other half is an unexpected guest star). Sam Jones had some of the funniest scenes in the movie and it was nice to see an actor playing them-self really go all out in the role. I think he's going to pick up some extra Flash fans after the movie comes out. The only person I was disappointed by was Joel McHale who just wasn't given as much good material as everyone else. He didn't do bad in the role but as a Community fan I was hoping his character would have left more of an impression.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you enjoy Family Guy you will like this movie. The movie even seemed like a live-action ""Family Guy"" at some points. Like Family Guy, the movie will someday become very dated due to the constant recent pop culture references and one-off jokes. But that is okay, Seth McFarland knows what works in Family Guy and he keeps the same humor throughout the movie. There's some truly funny moments in ""Ted"" and it will keep you entertained even if it's not the future classic comedy people may be hoping for."

","This seems like one long family guy episode. well it is. <br/><br/>I loved this film. I wasn't expecting a complex story with many plot twists or intense action scenes. all I wanted was a good laugh. the movie starts strong with a good ol' Jew joke. then the first swear comes in. <br/><br/>the construction of this film is pretty simple; dick joke, fart joke, racist joke, sex joke, dick joke, fart joke, racist joke, sex joke etc. towards the end it actually becomes sad. bad stuff happens to the main characters and the jokes stop coming. that was actually a good decision from Seth. even though the only reason I paid to watch the film was for jokes, the sad moment evened the movie out. so now the movie wasn't just something that was created to let the writers show they are funny. it also showed they had hearts.<br/><br/>good movie, good movie"
"UberGoober1411","8","5","14","29 June 2012"," Ted makes you laugh ""hahdar"" than you have laughed in a long time, while still maintaining relate-ability
","I do not give 8 out of 10's often; I am not trying to seem like a pompous ass, even though I'm listening to Kate Bush singing ""Wow"" as I write this review, but 8 out of 10's are hard to come by. Well, at least they're hard to come by with the scale that I grade movies on. And 8 out of 10 comedies are even harder to come by due to the recycled nature of all 2000's interludes post-Anchorman/Dodgeball. That being said, Ted deserves this honor (if you can call it that) wholeheartedly and without question. And here's why.<br/><br/>""Stupid comedies"" with ""stupid humor"" have been a part of American culture since Judd Apatow first took his directing reigns and graced the silver screen with his comedic genius in 2004 and Ted certainly falls into the category of ""stupid humor"" - at least at times. But how does Ted separate itself from everything that has been done and is already shopworn? Enter Seth MacFarlane, the brains and voice acting behind the hit TV show Family guy who not only directs this work of art with class and ingenuity but also adds in some Family Guy-esque humor, a brand that we are all so familiar with, in all the right places.<br/><br/>Everything you need to know from this movie you can find out from the preview, therefore a summary (and spoilers) is not necessary. Mark Wahlberg plays John, a 35-year-old rental car center employee who has a stuffed Teddy bear and a girlfriend who clearly deserves better in Mila Kunis. That being said the humor starts as soon as the beginning credits roll and doesn't die down until the conflict of the movie. Only a stone-faced GTA mom will sit through this movie and never donate a smirk. The plot is filled with hilarious one-liners and quick-and-quirky comedy that will have you in stitches; that already divulged comedy is peppered into an actual plot, stellar acting performances (including Ted's) and completely random and unexpected spouts of hilarity.<br/><br/>Although the plot is actual, it isn't strong. Clichéd is the best word for it, but I was not expecting a Stephen King or Martin Scorsese screenplay. The movie follows a basic outline of background information, setting-up of plot, conflict, rising action, falling action, and climax. And the climax will make anybody who is a child at heart tear up - yes, I had to hold back tears because of that oh-so-wonderful Teddy bear. The plot adds onto the character ""models"" nicely and the audience develops a care for the characters, something that is missing from almost every recent film and is an absolute afterthought when making comedies. The biggest thing that makes you care about one particular character in this movie is the fact that he's a Teddy bear. Simple as that. He's adorable, funny, and despite having a 38-year-old Connecticut man's voice, cute.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg once again steps out of his ""cop, fightah, cop"" comfort zone and plays a comedic and sometimes awkward funny-man, similar to the one he played in The Other Guys. Oops, he was a cop in that one too. Regardless, his performance deserves mention, as does Kunis's. She plays a stunning girlfriend extremely well and the chemistry between her and Wahlberg is a nice touch to the playful plot. However, Ted steals the show despite being 100% CGI. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone for the movie is titled after the fuzz ball. The emotions evoked in the bear's face really display a forward progress of computer generated graphics and the fact that Wahlberg had to talk to, essentially, nothing for the length of the movie is respectable.<br/><br/>What else do you need to know? You don't need to be a certain age to enjoy this movie. All you need is an open heart and a soft spot for stuffed animals. And the latter is optional. Although the comedy dies down within the second half of the movie, the twists kick in and it's a stellar ride to the end. Few smudges, on an otherwise paramount comedic performance, make Ted an enjoyable film for anyone. You will want to dig up your old Teddy bear after watching this movie - I did.<br/><br/>+3 for comedy gold <br/><br/>+3 for Ted himself <br/><br/>+1 for Wahlberg/Kunis <br/><br/>+1 for inclusion of plot"
"fmshaw1971","3","3","7","11 November 2012"," If you are twelve and naughty words make you giggle, this is THE movie for you!
","I thought I loved Seth Macfarlane. Early Family Guy is some of the funniest TV I have ever seen. I love the snarky humor and obscure cultural references. Sadly this movie pales in comparison to Macfarlane's other work.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how this works for anyone. Pre-teens who get smacked by their low class parents for using vulgarity in the home would laugh riotously at this movie. Anyone old enough to understand the Flash Gordon significance, however, should have outgrown that by 1990. Is it a Boston thing? Do Bostonians still laugh any time the word ""f*ck"" is used 75 times in a movie? Was this movie made for the inhabitants of one city? (Okay, two if you count Philly)<br/><br/>The Sam Jones scene was the only worthwhile moment in the entire movie. It's not that I'm too old to enjoy the movie. Rather it's that I grew up. It appears most people who rated this did not."
"rodneill-1","3","3","7","21 August 2012"," Not sure why this film was made
","I'd have loved to seen Seth MacFarlane take apart the Rom Com – god knows they're an easy target – but instead he's just gone and made Friends with Benefits 2 only with an episode's worth of Family Guy jokes sprinkled about at random. Oh and one of the Characters is a bear. For some reason.<br/><br/>It's not that the jokes aren't funny (they are) it's that there are large stretches with zero jokes – just an apparently earnest attempt to make a Rom Com. And once you get past the mildly amusing idea of a swearing, pot-toking teddy bear (which gets old within about 30 seconds) the Ted Character just becomes another cliché – the love interest's slacker buddy.<br/><br/>If you like Family Guy just watch Family Guy. If you liked Friends With Benefits then go f*ck yourself (You may also enjoy this film)."
"TheSquiss","3","3","7","7 August 2012"," The ideal date film for easily pleased, drunk students.
","I first watched the trailer for Ted while waiting for A Fantastic Fear of Everything to begin. It started, I wondered, I smiled, I laughed out loud and then I noticed the loud silence beside me.<br/><br/>Alas, my companion for the evening does not take kindly to profanity and is more easily offended than I. Either my offence threshold is substantial or I'm debauched and immoral. I'll leave you to decide. However, the point I'm making is that Ted is very likely to offend if you're extremely Christian, shocked by obscenities and sexual depiction or just an innocent Aunt Nelly. Written and directed by Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy and American Dad, Ted steps further over the line, delves deeper into the realms of bad taste and would disturb the late Mary Whitehouse far, far more than Dennis Potter or A Clockwork Orange ever did, if she were six feet higher and in better shape than is currently the case.<br/><br/>So, Ted will succeed in offending those who choose to be offended but is it any good? Yes, but not amazingly so. Is it funny? Again, yes, but not as funny as it could have been. There are a few moments that prompt muted guffaws but it stands a long way behind the delights of last year's The Guard or even Goon from earlier this year. The funniest moments are the snap reactions (a certain punch in the final act, the horror of Mr. & Mrs. Bennett when they discover their son's bear is alive) but, though there are regular moments to exercise the lungs, there is never a danger of split sides.<br/><br/>Ted should be very funny. The core idea is funny: The lonely, bullied, eight year old John receives a teddy bear for Christmas and wishes it to life so that he can have a friend for life. Ted becomes an American celebrity then falls from grace and the two friends settle into a coach potato life of drink, drugs and unrealized potential. All of this occurs in the first few minutes and is explained through a narration from Patrick Stewart in a below-par version of Tom Baker's outstanding Little Britain commentaries. And that's pretty much how the film runs: below par.<br/><br/>Much of the comedy is vulgar and puerile but that was bound to be the case. However, it should also be clever and it isn't; it could be subtle but it's almost always over-egged. Once we get past the initial, superb set-up, the story is really quite simple and plods along bypassing every offshoot that offers depth and substance. There is little of either here and that isn't helped by the actors. Mark Wahlberg, as the adult John, wanders through Ted on autopilot delivering his lines with almost the required amount of emotion but less like an actor and more like one of a group of friends roleplaying in college improve club.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis, playing his girlfriend Lori, similarly plods along without any real impact. Ten hours later I can barely remember any significant scenes involving her let alone killer lines. The highpoint of her career so far, Black Swan, seems very far in the past. Joel McHale plays a greasier, less sophisticated and more unlikeable version of his Community hero, Jeff, and even the reliable and reliable quality fallback, Giovanni Ribisi is wasted as watered-down familiar crazy. Although far from perfect, the standout is actually the voice of Ted, MacFarlane.<br/><br/>There are some fun cameos, one of which is an absolute delight, one short and sweet and one dragged out, strung out, wrung out and washed out. These three cameos say a great deal about Ted. When it's sharp, it's bang on the money but far too often the team just doesn't know when to cut and move on. There have been many examples of when having a one person star, write (or adapt) and direct works admirably (Keneth Branagh's In the Bleak Midwinter, Hamlet and Henry V, George Clooney's The Ides of March, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto) but Seth MacFarlene is none of these and this is a classic argument against such control (or ego).<br/><br/>If you're an easily pleased drunk student you'll probably love it but for anyone else, it probably isn't worth the effort. And whilst much of the bad language is merely punctuation and down to lazy writing rather than for comedic effect, it isn't a reason to be offended or avoid Ted. The reason to avoid Ted, if you choose to do so, is that it isn't anywhere near as good as it should be or thinks it is.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

","I had read many spoiler-free reviews prior to seeing Ted. I typically do that as I am sure many of you have. I'll start my review by saying one thing... It was not as funny as I had expected given the reviews I'd read. I don't want to be misunderstood though, this is a very funny film. That being said, have I watched funnier episodes of Family Guy? Yes.<br/><br/>This film is basically an adult fairytale made for children of the 80s. It is chocked full of 80s references that will make you giggle. I was entertained from beginning to end. I can usually let go of the real world when watching a film, but even I was curious to see how they were going to pull off a Teddy bear living in the city. They did it wonderfully. Never once did I think it was beyond belief because of they way people interacted with Ted. The acting was great from all members of the cast. Similar to Family Guy, it's possible to be offended if your not a fan of that show. The humor was crude and over the top, but worked very well here. I didn't laugh the entire time, but that's probably just me. I was entertained though and that is what I want from a film in the end. There were also many great cameos that were very surprising. I'm also glad to see Joel McHale getting well deserved screen time. He is a treat. See this film, but don't let the teddy bear fool you... leave the kiddies at home."
"kwignall","4","3","7","15 July 2012"," Something must be wrong with my sense of humor
","Well, I just got back from watching Ted (against my better judgement I might add), and I find myself wondering is something has gone wrong with my sense of humor, because for the most part that movie was simply NOT funny...but here's the thing... I was among the few who WEREN't laughing... that's right the large majority of the audience laughed their heads off.<br/><br/>I started out by asking what was wrong with my sense of humor, so let me say a little bit about the type of comedy to expect in Ted. Most of the comedy is in the dialogue, and the physical comedy plays a supporting role. A witty script is usually the type of comedy I like, but in this case it just wasn't witty at all. The comedy in Ted is like a magic bear doing stand up comedy, only he it's in a movie and not on stage. To get the jokes in Ted, you have to be au fait with American pop culture, American history, American TV, American cinema, American social structure, American current affairs, American celebrities, racism etc, because for the most part, the jokes take jabs at events from these topics/groups. And don't get me wrong, it's not that I didn't get the jokes, I got most of them (there were a couple references which I wasn't familiar with so I wouldn't get it), they just weren't that funny. When Ted and the rest of the cast weren't taking cheap shots at the afore mentioned topics, they were simply using the 'F' word or making sexual references, saying something about anal sex or something going up someone's ass (which surprisingly the Jamaican audience found to be very funny... I guess our culture is changing), the bear was making sexual gestures, or simply just an unapologetic attempt at crude humor, which for the most part fell flat...to me any ways...the rest of the audience seemed to be in to it...so who knows... maybe you might also be into it too. Of course the ubiquitous gay reference/couple isn't missing from this movie either...what R rated comedy these days is complete without it? I am told that this type of humor is a staple on Family Guy (Director Seth MacFarlane's claim to fame), you know the type of humor that simply takes an irreverent approach to everything and holds nothing sacred. I have no problem this type of comedy, cuz nobody gets hurt and it's all in good fun...I do require that it is actually funny though.<br/><br/>My last comment on Ted is that the story did not seem as if it was something that was well thought out, but rather something that was thrown together real time while filming, like they were ad libbing it or something: let the bear do this or let the bear say that... there was just a natural flow that was missing."
"thestash_16","Null","3","7","8 July 2012"," A movie that inflicts more damage to our broken society.
","In reality, this movie is terribly unfunny and plain stupid. The envelope has been pushed - all the way down the sewer. There is nothing smart, intelligent or witty about this movie. From what I can tell, this movie stoops down to the intelligence level of a 5 year old to come up with this absolute trash that people are amused by. <br/><br/>The story line has heaps of potential, the actors are great. But this movie is littered with weak, desperate attempts at humor. The casual swearing is uncalled for. The 'R' rating? I guess it's so insulting to what it means to be mature, it should be rated 'G' since I hear a lot of 12 year olds with the same sense of humor.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is an utter disaster, evident by the fact that everyone seems to love it. I learnt that people are amused by hookers, dirty sexual gestures, drugs and human excrement along with mind numbing casual swearing. Wake up people. If you have even the slightest hint of maturity and intelligence, then this movie is not for you."

","I laughed pretty hard throughout the entire film. So that should tell you it's worth watching.<br/><br/>So yeah straight to the point, I had no clue that Family Guy's humour could actually translate so well into live action. The cutaway gags, pop culture references, the non sequitors, the New England backdrop it all works here.<br/><br/>The character Ted to me is a cross between Peter and Brian Griffin. He's like Brian because he's this little fuzzy thing you're not supposed to take serious but you do. And he's like Peter because, you know... the voice.<br/><br/>The film doesn't revolve around Ted as much as it revolves around Mark Wahlberg's character and his relationship with Mila Kunis who are both very likable.<br/><br/>If you like Family Guy or just have a really good sense of humour this is for you."

Throughout the film there is constant laughs; of course there is typical family guy humour which also adds to this films perfection. I couldn't help but listen out for the many voices of the popular family guy characters; such as Meg, Joe and Stewie, and I did worry that 'Ted' wouldn't stand out from all of these characters but he is in fact distinctive in his own right and is a smart, likable and hilarious character."

Third, if you like really dirty humor, and less dirty humor and just plain funny dialogue and situations this is a perfect movie for you. Certainly, it is Family Guy on overdrive and without the network in the way. My son and I were in tears at times. In an audience of twelve we all clapped at the end. I clapped!!!!

"brad_the_metalhead","10","4","11","14 July 2012"," Hilarious!
","This film is absolutely gut-busting funny, even though it has its emotional and sad moments, it is always broken with the comedy.<br/><br/>Seth MacFarlane did a fantastic job with this film. He really proved that not only can he make hilarious adult cartoons, but also make very funny movies that actually have a good message to it.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that a lot of people went into this movie thinking that it would only be filled with sexual and inappropriate jokes(Which it does have a lot of), but the film actually has a very good message. It shows you how complicated life can be at times, and how hard it can be when your in a relationship. Also it shows you how sometimes friends can hold you back from moving on with your life, and that everyone needs to grow up and not act immature all the time.<br/><br/>Even though it has a good message, the movie is extremely funny. I came out of the theatre saying: ""finally a comedy that is actually funny"" i'm not going to give away any of the scenes because I really don't want to spoil it. This film really does not disappoint. But if you are easily offended I wouldn't watch this movie, because there are a few jokes in this film that may offend people. But if you have a great sense of humour you won't take it to heart.<br/><br/>The film is also narrated by Patrick Stewart, and I must say he did a good job. He has a great narration voice, and even the narration is hilarious because Patrick Steward even says funny things that will have you in knots laughing.<br/><br/>I can't express enough how funny this movie is. All I can say is go see this movie, you will not be disappointed this film will actually make you laugh."
"werefox08","5","4","11","6 July 2012"," Something About Teddy
","A comedy is supposed to be funny...this is funny. A teddy bear who delivers X rated one liners does not seem like much fun, but in ""Ted"" ...it works. Something About Mary has a cult following(a few rude men) ...because of its gross out scenes. So why not a little bear who smokes, drinks and has a girl friend..?? The ""hard core"" jokes come thick and fast...and they don't ease down...during the whole movie. I am not as enthusiastic about this as most other reviewers. There is a touch of desperation when you need a teddy bear to deliver obscenities (and to divert the audience). The only real certainty is there will be a Ted 2 , and it wont be as funny as the first one (they never are). This humour is an acquired taste, particularly when it is flung at you for 1 hour 45 minutes. Its like eating chocolate / fudge ice cream for 1 hour and 45 minutes (you become sick). This is a movie for people who enjoy crass humour. What next ?? Barbie Dolls Hangover at The Richard Pryor Show. ?"

This is a great movie to watch in theaters; you get to burst out laughing as loud as you can because literally everyone else is doing the same thing.<br/><br/>2. The plots of comedies are hardly ever very good because the main focus is laughter, but Ted will keep you glued to your seat. I had to pee so bad halfway through I could barely stand it, but I didn't want to miss any of it so I waited.<br/><br/>3.

","If anything was going to kill the Family Guy wicked fun and laughs I just love in the work of Seth McFarlane, it would have been Hollywood dumbing down a sharp, slapstick, bad taste, politically incorrect satirist by making his first feature film (ugh) M or even worse - PG.<br/><br/>Ted works on so many levels. For genre mash-ups to work, each genre has to work equally as well as the other. EG a romantic comedy has to succeed as a romantic story and in the funny stuff. A mystery thriller has to have a great mystery with proportional thrills.<br/><br/>But Ted is a four-way mash. <br/><br/>It succeeds as a fairytale - most kids wished their favourite toy or pet could talk to them.<br/><br/>It succeeds as a love story - Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis (the voice of Meg in Family Guy) have chemistry that plays out with a fair whack of reality.<br/><br/>It succeeds as a stoner bromance - Ted and John are clearly best friends with a long, colourful history loaded with hilarious stories to repeat as they get smashed and run every red light down Memory Lane (thank you Dire Straits for that metaphor).<br/><br/>It succeeds as a coming of age story - John needs to grow up and put the bear down (not with a veterinarian 'green dream' shot.) l mean he has to put the bear aside - re-draw the boundaries of how they spend time together now this he is a grown man and Ted can remain and a wonderfully bad bear for the rest of his magical life.<br/><br/>But I would not go so far as to describe it as a homo-erotic plushy love story. The love that Ted and John share is hetero at its heart.<br/><br/>It was great to see Joel McHale in the film along with Putty - Elaine's meathead boyfriend in Seinfeld. And boy oh boy - who know Giovanni Ribisi could dance like that? His hips can bust porno moves.<br/><br/>Was there too much screen time given to the campy 80s film Flash Gordon? Possibly. But it still worked.<br/><br/>And - I cried. <br/><br/>My other favourite part was homage to the Family Guy's running gag of Peter Griffin's fight with a giant, angry chicken.<br/><br/>The live action animation is seamless with only one sneaky giveaway - when Mark Wahlberg rattles off all the girls names to Ted on the couch, you can see his eyes reading autocue. Otherwise, the performances of the actors with the bear are seamless.<br/><br/>Go see Ted. He's a lot of fun to hang out with for a couple of hours - at least.<br/><br/>4.5 out 5."

","Seth MacFarlane writes and directs; and if you don't like his brand of humor...I'm sure he would probably tell you what to do with yourself. There comes a time when some guys wish that his childhood best friend and companion could come alive. Well, here we go. John Bennett(Mark Wahlberg) wishes his teddy bear Ted could come alive. Low and behold, a Christmas wish comes true and John and best bud Ted really become more inseparable. Oh yes, Ted can really talk; and he is not shy with his opinions on life and how John should live his. This juvenile movie is of course about the animated bear with the crude, foul mouth. ""Potty"" humor is nothing compared with more absurd and vulgar things that spew from his mouth. John all but cripples his life with his devotion to Ted; to the point he has to choose between his lifelong friend or to keep the relationship with his beautiful girlfriend (Mila Kunis)alive. The pervasive, sexual position and ""poop"" laden humor may be more than a bit much for some viewers. Definitely not a kids movie. And you had better like the music of Queen.<br/><br/>Sophmorionic, crude and lewd rated R. Yes, there are some funny scenes; but nothing to sustain a good belly laugh. Ted is voiced by his creator McaFarlane. Supporting cast: Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, Jessica Barth and Matt Walsh.. Patrick Stewart narrates and there is face time for Norah Jones, Tom Skerritt and Sam Jones."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","2","4","26 June 2013"," A blend of 80s nostalgia and modern stoner movie, it's heart keeps it from becoming as irritating as Family Guy is now.
","I didn't have much expectations for this film, especially after seeing the trailer (not the R rated one) but I hoped not to be bored and it succeeded for the most part. I like Seth MacFarlane in moderation, I've pretty much seen all the Family Guy worth watching to death and I like American Dad. I'm pretty sure he's a guy who's said all he wants and needs to say but he still makes stuff because it makes money. Whatever, it's fine. Ted is a long Family Guy special and follows all his own storytelling traditions and tropes.<br/><br/>It's a half 80s nostalgia movie and half modern party/stoner movie which is an interesting blend, though it means some of the references go right over this audience's head. It's typically vulgar and soaked in pop culture and most of it is enjoyable, though there was a ""tribute"" to Airplane! which was just a remake of the scene rather than anything new. It also has cutaways, fantasy scenes and a little slapstick of which I'm glad was minimal, saving it for one big fight scene. It taps into ideas, albeit not particularly profound ones, very effectively. The prologue scene was the highlight and then I slowly got back into it throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I'm always fond of Mark Wahlberg but the glaring age difference between him and Mila Kunis was pretty distracting though only because they had supposedly been together for 4 years already so she must've been like 18 while he was 30. I don't know. I liked McHale and Ribisi (though he came late to the party besides a few appearances). The rest of the cast were shoehorned in during their introductions and pretty much proved inconsequential. The whole film was pretty much a series of predictable sequences which could've been a lot better if they had been piled on top of each other rather than one after the other but the climax was on the right note.<br/><br/>While this is not a creative decision, it's become clear that digital cinematography is something that's here to stay in Hollywood. Unfortunately I just don't think people have figured out how to use it properly yet. Some shots are great but others are not cinematic and the production of the film becomes clear as day. It's not as bad as something like Public Enemies but it's incredibly distracting and dramatically decreases a film's production value and magic. Maybe it's a post process or its a lighting issue but it just doesn't look good enough for cinema yet. The Social Network did it right but maybe it's because they used Red Epics.<br/><br/>Anyway, yeah, standard affair. Easy to sell thing. Couple handfuls of laughs. Pretty forgettable. No big complaints. Certainly worthy of a 5 paragraph review. I liked it. <br/><br/>7/10"
"pjveerman","6","2","4","19 February 2013"," It won't waste your time
","To me Ted is one of the best examples of a typical Hollywood comedy. I think most people got to see it because it's Seth McFarlane who made it. So it's not weird to expect something as funny as Family Guy. Well, i just couldn't laugh my pants off. I DID enjoy the movie but that's just because it's somehow entertaining. Same as The Hangover, Paul and Due Date, I think this movie is just, okay. Just as lame and predictable as most of this kind, but yet, it's enjoyable. And actually there wasn't any moment where I expected it to be more than just enjoyable. Definitely not as funny as Family Guy (most of the time) is, but way less awful than the unnecessary spin-off ""The Cleveland Show"". If you're chilling with some friends, drinking a cold beer of whatever, go watch it. You'll probably laugh a couple of times. But you're wasting your time if you're expecting a strong and original comedy."
"cherold","6","2","4","31 December 2012"," sweet, occasionally funny
","Ted is a movie that defies a couple of expectations. First off, it's a movie about a magical thing in which that magical thing is made ordinary. Normally, if a character starts talking to a ghost, or his computer develops sentience, or he adopts an alien, the movie focuses a lot on how difficult this is to hide. But in this movie, the magical Ted is just a fact of life that everyone accepts.<br/><br/>The other surprise is that even though the movie is from the guy who does Family Guy, it's not just a crazed series of sick jokes. Instead, it's a genuinely sweet, though often outrageous, movie about a man's reluctance to grow up, with his attachment to childhood portrayed in an ingeniously literal way.<br/><br/>But while Wahlberg and Kunis have terrific chemistry and the movie has some really funny scenes (notably a double date gone wrong), I never really got into it. The humor is mild, and once you understand that it will veer into sudden perverse jokes now and again, just a tiny bit predictable. <br/><br/>I appreciate that the film's creator wanted to do something more than twisted Family Guy-style comedy, but I don't feel he nailed it. Without the sort of I-can't-believe-I-just-heard-that comedy of his series, this is just a cute take-off on a kid's movie that never quite catches fire. <br/><br/>But it's so likable that I feel guilty for not liking it more."
"saadgkhan","7","2","4","4 December 2012"," FUN Flick, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in it
","Ted – CATCH IT (B+) Wishes coming true in Hollywood movie are not a new concept; we have seen plenty of movies where wishes come true and do something magical into the wisher's life. What brought change in these movies is defiantly is the r-rated comedic genre. Since the blockbuster success of The Hangover and previously Judd Apatow's factory movies Knocked-Up and 40 years old virgin have given Hollywood a hope that a person can make millions over r-rated movies these days. Ted is also one of those wishes coming true movie but with its R-rating and a teddy talking nasty made is hilarious and entertaining. I would not say that it's the finest R-rated comedy but it sure is entertaining. Mark Wahlberg is great in Ted, many people think that Ted steals the show but if you watch carefully you will realize that Mark Wahlberg went out of his comfort zone and at times totally outshine Ted (Seth MacFarlane). Mila Kunis is gorgeous; I think that's why she was in it. The supporting cast is good Jessica Stroup was wasted; poor girl needs to leave 90210 and start auditioning for movies. In the end, it may seem like a one man or teddy show but it's not. It defiantly a fun flick with a funny idea."

Sure I enjoy Seth McFarlane's brand of comedy but they are too few and too far.<br/><br/>John (Wahlberg) is a lonely kid and wishes for his Teddy Bear to be able to talk to him and his wish is granted. Skip 25 years and the Teddy Bear (Ted (voiced by Seth McFarlane)), now a pot smoking foul mouthed ex-celebrity is still living with him and is coming in the way of him moving forward in his life and relationship with his long term girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>The comedy genre is very similar to that of Family Guy mixing together Peter, Stewie and Brian according to the situations. The premise is quite familiar and does not go adventurous. Wahlberg has a good comedy timing and Mila Kunis sleepwalks through the role that she is quite accustomed to. Have to commend the CGI team for perfectly blending in Ted to make him feel real.<br/><br/>It is nowhere near as funny as it should be."
"tieman64","Null","2","4","21 July 2012"," Teddy's too tame
","Seth MacFarlane, creator of ""Family Guy"", directs ""Ted"", an unfunny comedy which pairs actor Mark Wahlberg with a foul mouthed, CGI teddy bear. The film's trying to humorously clash its wholesome, Christmas miracle plot with R rated humour, but all of its jokes fall flat. This type of juxtaposition is routinely done better in ""South Park"", the ""Family Guy"" specials, Kevin Smith's flicks, or films like ""Bad Santa"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and even junk like ""Harold and Kumar 3"".<br/><br/>Our heroes are a couple of weed smoking slackers, but their plot takes a slow ten minutes to get going. When it does, the result is mostly a string of clichés, and none of our duo's antics are as funny or outlandish as even the worst stoner comedies. The film has one good joke in which our heroes discuss whether or not its offensive to invite Jews to a party, the assumption being that specifying that Jews are allowed is itself anti-Semitic. Most of MacFarlane's jokes, however, aren't rude enough, extreme enough, weird enough or smart enough to keep up with the cutting edge of today's humour.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's an underrated actor. In ""Ted"" he essentially plays the same character he did in ""The Other Guys"", a funnier comedy which saw him playing a wounded, doe-eyed and bizarrely earnest guy. Mark makes ""Ted"" bearable.<br/><br/>Like the ""South Park"" crew – Trey Parker and Matt Stone - MacFarlane seems to have difficulties transferring his brand of humour, which is typically more hyper-intensified than live-action comedy, to live-action movies. He tries to make Ted as ""realistic"" and ""three dimensional"" as everything else in his film, instead of making the film itself as flat as Ted (ie a cartoon). This was the problem Parker and Stone struggled with in their early live-action comedies, most of which were unwatchable, until they ditched actors altogether in favour of cartoonish marionettes and puppets. <br/><br/>4/10 - Worth one viewing."

But it really doesn't need to be! To be honest if we had more of Mark Wahlberg and Ted's antics throughout I'd give this movie a 9/10! Mila Kunis' character is slightly confused in her convictions and plays an annoying over bearing girlfriend whose only role is to smother her boyfriend and take away from what is actually funny about this movie: TED!"

Most of the jokes land and the CGI on the bear is pretty good.<br/><br/>What I disliked about the film is the story. I really didn't care about Mark Wahlberg and his girlfriend. All I wanted to see was TED and Mark doing some crazy sh*t, and whenever they decided to cut back to the ""main"" plot, I was bored.<br/><br/>The ending is also pretty bad, it is not funny and it tries (and fails) to be dramatic, so it just leaves you with this weird ending that feels like it belongs to a different movie."

","Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing ""TED"". When you are a fan of ""Family Guy"" and/or adult humor in general you get excited when you see a new RED BAND trailer for a comedy like ""TED"" and let me tell you I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation for this movie and watched the trailer several times showing it to my friends and laughing every minute. My high expectations where my downfall Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... ""TED"" was funny but not hilarious, I liked it, but I didn't love it. I expected more and maybe even too much, I wanted to have fun with this one, I wanted to feel like the cast & crew of ""Family Guy "" where going to elevate themselves to the big screen and get a standing ovation. I liked the movie; don't get me wrong but maybe they shouldn't have tried so hard to NOT be like ""Family Guy"" would it be so wrong to add a little more ""Family Guy""? even some cutaways would have been great. It's a fun movie and has its cute parts and is a pretty good buddy comedy, especially if you are a child of the 80's and know your movies, there are awesome references in there of some of the greats oh and ""Flash Gordon"" too. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis where great together and have a nice balance and chemistry on screen, Ted was funny as I expected him to be and the three of them do create a good comedic balance. Oh and let's not forget the amazing party scene and one of the best fight scenes ever captured on film, I mean it's right up there with the bath house fight scene in ""Eastern Promises"" what? You haven't seen that movie? Well get a bottle of vodka ready and watch it! It's amazing! Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says ""TED"" is a tough one, when making a movie to please the fans you have from a different form of media (Movie from TV show) you either have to add more of that media or nothing at all there is no in between. When Trey Parker and Matt Stone did ""Team America"" they added tons of ""South Park"" and got a great comedy. When Mike Judge made ""Office Space"" he added nothing of ""Beavis & Butthead"" or ""King of the Hill"" and people didn't respond well. Not until a new cult following that has revived one of the greatest movies of all time. But in 1999? It was disappointing, and now with ""TED"" I think we needed more ""Family Guy"" not just a couple of hint voices here and there and seeing the cast in live action form but a lot more! Or nothing at all. I Love Seth MacFarlane but it took me a while to start retraining my brain to believe I was not listening to Peter Griffin's voice but Ted's voice! Giovanni Ribisi is a great actor but oh boy did he make this movie awkward at times, I wanted to laugh! Not feel uncomfortable. Oh and Jack ""The Parent"" says Take no kids to this movie! Well maybe if you have a cool teenager and you want to have a hang out night with them, there are some raunchy jokes in there that might make the living room on family movie night get real quiet and awkward. Late teens will probably get more of the jokes than you do and in that case you might want to take one with you to explain things. God bless the internet!"

","""Ted"" is an American 105-minute movie from 3 years ago and it was successful enough to make a sequel very recently. The writer, director and voice actor for the title character is Seth MacFarlane, the creative mind behind the long-running television series ""Family Guy"". And I felt the humour in this film here resembled the one from MacFarlane's trademark television show a lot. ""Ted"" includes an uncountable number of funny one-liners from start to finish that successfully distract from the actually pretty dramatic story involving a longtime relationship possibly ending and a kidnapping plot by some psychopaths that almost results in murder.<br/><br/>This movie brought MacFarlane also an Academy Award nomination for a song by Norah Jones the very same year that MacFarlane hosted the Oscars. But back to the story. A young boy makes a wish that his teddy bear would come to life and that exactly happens in a night full of thunder, not full of shooting stars. The result is the expected. Early on, the teddy bear is harmless and lovely, but 25 years later, he has become a weed-smoking television addicted punk. However, his friendship to Mark Wahlberg's character John is as strong as ever. Sadly, it gets in the way of John's ambitions in life and relationship to Lori (played by Mila Kunis). In order for the trio to sort things out, it is necessary that Ted gets abducted by a complete lunatic, played by Giovanni Ribisi, and his sadistic son.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, there is actually quite some drama in this movie, but all in all, it's still more of a comedy. Quick shoutout to the hilarious Norah Jones cameo. Love her as a singer and she shows some decent comedic talent in here as well. All in all, there are a couple weak moments and even some plot developments that don't make too much sense, like Ted beating the crap out of the pretty buff John on one occasion, but not defending himself against the fat boy and his father when they are coming for him. Still, the positive outweighs the negative and in terms of realism, we should not forget that this is a story about a talking teddy bear. So it's all very absurd and lack of realism shouldn't be a problem. However, if you imagine the teddy bear being a man in his 30s, this could actually have been the exact same film. No surprise Ted only sleeps with female humans. He is pretty much a human himself apart from his physics. Good movie and I recommend it. I will probably give the sequel a go as well at some point."

","Ted (2012): Dir: Seth MacFarlane / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Barth: Voice: Seth MacFarlane: From the creator of the hit animation Family Guy comes a most unique buddy flick that opens with a boy wishing that his teddy bear comes to life. This whole bit makes no sense but it results in some unique comedy situations. The big joke regards the boy growing to become Mark Wahlberg who hasn't really grown up, and Ted becoming a pot smoking teddy bear whose miracle in the spotlight, including a guest shot on Johnny Carson, has faded. Central plot regards Wahlberg's girlfriend, played by Mila Kunis who desires that they move ahead in their relationship. She wants Ted to move out and get a job but instead Ted wrecks havoc on their relationship to the point where all three go their separate ways. This all concludes with a riveting climax where one party must correct a mental notion that benefits everyone. Seth MacFarlane provides the crass vocabulary of Ted who is a visually intriguing character in his movements and expressions but this is no kids movie. Parents could make that same assumption as done with Bad Santa. Wahlberg is appealing as Ted's owner who struggles with forging ahead, while Mila Kunis moves above typical girlfriend role to someone dealing with a flirty boss and cleaning sh*t off the floor after Ted invites over four hookers. Giovanni Ribisi plays Ted's creepy stalker. Jessica Barth steals moments as Ted's girlfriend and co-worker Tami-Lynn who has a sassy tongue. Theme regards the fine line of growing up and different fazes of friendship. Score: 8 / 10"

","Anyone familiar with the work of Seth MacFarlane will know what to expect: a lot of 80s references and some very crude comedy. Here both aspects are ramped up to 11.<br/><br/>Here we have so many 80s ""tributes"" that I wondered if I was watching Hot Tub Time Machine by mistake. There's Johnny Carson, Return of the Jedi, Knight Rider and 80s pop. The homage to Airplane is actually a direct rip-off and Flash Gordon is embedded into the film's DNA.<br/><br/>The comedy is crude and tasteless in the best Family Guy tradition although lacking the wit and inventiveness of that series better episodes. Generally there's a few big laughs but long mediocre patches. Another problem I had was MacFarlane's Ted tended to sound rather too much like Peter Griffin, I thought that he would have more in his vocal locker.<br/><br/>I guess Mila Kunis relished her bigger part, being relegated to virtually one line per episode in FG.<br/><br/>Overall an OK movie, enjoyable if not very memorable."

","Seth MacFarlane is one of those guys who splits everyone. People either love him or hate him. And this tale of a wise-ass Teddy bear almost certainly did so. ""Ted"" is fun to watch just because it knows exactly what kind of a movie it is and lets everything out, as did MacFarlane's later ""Million Ways to Die in the West"". There's pot-smoking, defecation, and high jinx at work. This must be what people mean when they say Boston strong! <br/><br/>Basically, it's an excuse to let your inner thirteen-year-old.

"troyputland","7","0","0","21 June 2015"," Depends if you like Macfarlane's humour or not!
","Even the most sophisticated of people can have their immature days. Their isn't a soul out there who doesn't have a childish materialistic possession or hobby. Ted (mostly) shows how difficult is to part with it... via a talking bear. Wahlberg's character John Bennett is more man-child than sensible adult. On one side his (often) lovable fuzz-ball best friend Ted (Seth Macfarlane) is a bad influence on him. On the other side his girlfriend of four years (Mila Kunis) wants them to move further in their relationship. Ted's story is about friendship and how far that friendship can be pushed to the limit, and push others away. Wahlberg's a funny front-man, (he proved how comical he can be in The Other Guys), Seth Macfarlane has more difficulty conveying jokes through the animated toy. Thankfully most soar. There's a lot of filler jokes to bulk up the running time, and the humour can be crass, rude and often bawdy. Being a fan of Macfarlane's popular adult-cartoon Family Guy helps, but understandably his humour isn't for everyone."

","As a fan of the Family Guy series, I came into this movie aware that Seth MacFarlane would employ the same style in his writing and he did exactly that. Upon reading a few of the reviews on IMDb I couldn't believe that people would say that this is nothing like Family Guy. This movie is essentially written in the same manner as Family Guy.<br/><br/>But we are not here to compare this movie to Family Guy. I thought this movie was extremely well done, with a well thought out plot and clever dialogue. The performances by Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis were extremely well done considering that the majority of their acting was done by speaking to a stem with two fake eyeballs on it. And Seth Macfarlane did exactly what everyone expected of him by nailing of his lines (all of which had to be recorded in a studio). And that fight scene in the hotel, totally Seth Macfarlane style. Need I say more.<br/><br/>Definitely a good movie. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a couple hard laughs, and maybe a couple of dem feels, this movie is for you."

","A teddy bear that swears? Priceless! Ted is an adorable and funny movie. It's also perfect for anyone who likes to see characters that are typically supposed to be cute, turn into raunchy little foul-mouthed, smart alacks. Mark Walhburg was a good choice for the role of John. He made his role as the ""loser, immature, pothead boyfriend"" convincing. His accent for the movie made me laugh. Especially the way he pronounced the word, ""teddy bear"". Leading lady Mila Kunis did a great job portraying both the serious side and the sarcastic side of Lori. Walhburg and Kunis have really great chemistry in this film. Whether they are hugging, kissing, or arguing, they made it believable that they were a real couple. Kudos to the production team. They did a fantastic job with making sure that the actors looked like they were looking directly at Ted instead of their eyes drifting off in another direction. Lastly, Seth MacFarlane's talent as a voice actor was the key element in creating Ted. The accent and tone of Ted's voice really gave him personality. If he had a softer voice, or didn't have the accent, I don't think he would have enough attitude or spunk and he wouldn't have gained as much popularity with audiences. Over all, I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend seeing it."
"Seraphion","6","0","0","30 January 2015"," Funny, with a lot of maturity warning
","The story opens up like it was meant for kids. This opening kind of takes place for almost twenty minutes or so, pretty long for a movie designated specifically for adult maturity. And then it strikes back at you, especially if you haven't been noticing the transformation montage video, in which the bear turns from a boy bear to a schmuck. The jokes are crazy and most are with very bad sexual intent. But hey sure are very funny and enjoyable. The acting overall is slightly above standards. Mark Wahlberg shows that he can handle crazy comedies beside his usual action roles. Seth MacFarlane's voice to his own writing is just a pure laughable crazy comedy. Mila Kunis adds nicely to the conflict angle. Having Sam Jones is a nice touch to the target age group's nostalgic link."

","Summary: Ted is an above-average comedy with some funny moments. 52/100 (C)<br/><br/>Ted is a comedy film written and directed by Seth MacFarlane, starring Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane (as Ted's voice). I was so pumped for this movie and I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I thought. Ted squanders its potential with an uneven, weirdly written script. The simple fact of being a movie about a talking bear is interesting, but this bear is a douchebag and I don't like his voice; MacFarlane's voice is so annoying, his voice just doesn't match with the likable appearance of the bear. As we go, the black humor was tedious, although I'm pretty sure that a huge part of the audience will enjoy the tone of the movie. To me... it's just a too vulgar film.<br/><br/>On the upside, the opening scene is fantastic, very enjoyable and quite touching. I also liked a scene near the last act where Ted and Mark Wahlberg's character are fighting each other, it was hilarious. There's another funny scene where Mila Kunis' character has to lift a piece of crap, and I found it wickedly funny! The special effects are great, the bear looks realistic and its design is so well done. I laughed and had fun with Ted, but I can't say that is a good film! Ted is just a well-acted romantic comedy that has its moments, some of them astonishingly funny. I also liked most of the characters, the cinematography and the camera work. Also, the musical score is jazzy and quite pleasant.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love Ted, but its story is kinda uninteresting and some of the jokes are horrendously offensive. It had potential for being a great PG rated film, but come on... it's directed by Seth MacFarlane, so there will be a lot of profanity and blasphemy in it. It works as a romantic comedy, but it is a very vulgar one to me. The script is filled with boring pop culture references and racist gags. I just can't take this movie seriously. Also, the ending is very silly and predictable. It is a comedy for a very specific audience, I'm sure that fans of MacFarlane's previous work will be satisfied with this one. Anyway, I still give it credit because at least there's chemistry between the characters and it made me laugh at times. (C)"

","The reviews about this movie here are way too negative. The only purpose of this movie is to make you laugh. And it did just that whit me. I think many of you expect too much from this. This isn't a movie that makes you think or make you feel thrilled. It's just about a teddy bear getting in hilarious situations like getting arrested while putting his middle finger up to the camera. Those scenes made me laugh so i think it succeeds in being a comedy. At first i feared that it would be too melodramatic but it's not. There are few sad scenes and even those scenes tend to be funny. To the people who haven't seen this one, just keep in mind that you don't have to take it all too serious. This movie could be ideal for watching it whit friends while drinking beer. I'm sure you will find it funny and have a good time whit it."

","2012'S comedy hit, and deservedly so. It has all the ingredients that make it work, the main one, of course being our big cuddly, crude, and blasphemous Teddy. The laughs and gags are non stop, making for one of the funniest film in years. Wahlberg fans will like this too, where he plays a guy who works at a rental car place, where his best friend and thunder buddy Ted, still reside with him and his girlfriend. Now comes a stage where three's a crowd, where Wahlberg must make a choice. This movie is very crude and offensive to some, and the manipulator of the teddy, knows his stuff, that lovers fight between bear and Marky Mark, I felt in many painful spots. There is one repulsive scene involving trashy hookers and faeces, and the film becomes quite climactic, and serious near the end, as Ted has been bear napped by a psychotic father (Ribisi, who gives great meaning to the term 'character acting') and his chubby son. The dig concerning Sam 'Flash Gordon' Jones's acting was acutely funny, where it was great to see him make a comeback at 63, while bringing some Flash memories too. The script is gold, Kunis is hot, Ted is side splittingly funny, and Wahlberg with not much to work with character wise, does nice with a mellow performance, while I liked 'The Soup's' Hale as a Kunis's sleazy boss, Rex, who's trying to get into every girl's panties. Wahlberg's singing was really bad, of curse does purposefully, but was really bad, posing the question, could he be, while being the hottest guy in Boston, be the worst singer in Boston. One killer comedy treat, that will never have you looking the same way at a teddy bear again. By the way, I would really like to know what Lou Garrett's disease, actually is."

"MaximumMadness","6","0","0","26 April 2014"," While it's jokes are hit-and-miss to the extreme, and it is too reliant on crudeness-for-the-sake-of-crudeness, ""Ted"" is salvaged by good direction and a lot of charm.
","People's opinions on the works of Seth MacFarlane tend to mainly fall within two camps. Those who like/love his work... and those who hate it with a passion. Very few people seem to fall in-between.<br/><br/>I'm one of the few who fall in between.<br/><br/>I think Seth MacFarlane is a really talented person, and a very charming guy. In particular, I enjoy his music and interviews, and some of his producing work, such as the recent reboot of the classic Science television show ""Cosmos."" And to an extent, I do think that there are a handful of episodes of ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" that are phenomenal. (""Road to Rhode Island"", as far as I am concerned, is one of the best episodes of any animated series I've seen since it's premier nearly 15 years ago) However, despite really enjoying some episodes, I don't view ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"" as particularly strong comedies. For me, they are basically take-it-or-leave-it. And I do have to say I really do not like ""The Cleveland Show"" at all.<br/><br/>So for me... I'm a casual fan of Seth MacFarlane, but far from a hardcore fan or a hardcore hater. I'm in between. I like some of his work... while I dislike his other work.<br/><br/>So I went into ""Ted"" fairly open. I was interested in seeing how MacFarlane's style would translate to a feature-length, live-action (well, MOSTLY live-action) film. And I am pleased to say that overall, I think ""Ted"", while flawed, was a successful film.<br/><br/>We follow John (Mark Whalberg), a 35-year-old man who has spent his life living with ""Ted"" (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane), a teddy-bear that was magically brought to life when John was a child. While the existence of a living teddy-bear initially made Ted into an overnight celebrity, like many people, his 15-minutes-of-fame quickly dried up, and Ted is now just a regular old crude guy. He enjoys spending his days getting high and trying to pick up women. This causes issues for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's longtime girlfriend, who (rightfully) believes Ted's childish, immature ways are holding back she and John's life together. And so, the story kicks off, as Ted and John try their hardest to grow, mature and be able to separate themselves for the sake of John's relationship, all while a creepy fan of Ted's (Giovanni Ribisi) tries desperately to get him... even if it means he must kidnap the teddy-bear of his affections.<br/><br/>The cast is a lot of fun. Whalberg and Kunis are a joy on-screen and have a great chemistry. Ted's voice by director MacFarlane is a lot of fun (although I think MacFarlane throws in too much crude humor through Ted, which does make him start to feel unlikable at times), and supporting roles by the likes of Ribisi, Matt Walsh and Joel McHale are also a lot of fun. In fact, I found some of the secondary characters (particularly McHale's slimy character) to be some of the most amusing.<br/><br/>I was very surprised by Seth MacFarlane's visual direction, considering this was his first major live-action production. I found his direction to be quite slick, concise and even stylish at times. It was a refreshing change-up from the grittier or ""more realistic"" approach that too many movies (even comedies) try to utilyze these days. And I will admit that story-wise, MacFarlane's script (co-written with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) does have a fairly solid structure, providing a decent (albeit basic) storyline where all major protagonists receive a fair balance of screen time and development. Also, the effects used to create Ted are fantastic. While he is a CG creation, the effects are life-like enough that once you get into the story, you forget that Ted isn't real, and just believe he's in the scene with the other actors. Wonderful effects work.<br/><br/>However, despite a strong production and a likable cast, this film does have some major flaws, which is where it has to lose a few points, sadly. And it mainly boils down to its humor and content.<br/><br/>MacFarlane has a very specific style of sort-of ""random comedy"", and his work does have a large amount of crudeness to it. And that was a big problem here. Too much of the film's humor was simply crude-for- the-sake-of-being-crude. And it felt like the film was struggling to prove how rude-and-crude it could be. And too many of the jokes were far too hit-and-miss. (Usually as a result of the crudeness.) Now, I have no problems with crude humor. But here, it just felt contrived at times. And unnecessary. And it does take you out of the film to an extent when such crass, rude humor is being shoveled into your face for no reason. I'll admit, I laughed at a lot of it, but there were several moments where I wouldn't laugh for 5-10 minutes, and would just stare at the screen, thinking ""Wow, they are trying TOO hard to be edgy and gross with the jokes, and it's just not working."" I really think the film would have been stronger if it pulled back during a few scenes and didn't shoehorn in so much contrived crude humor.<br/><br/>And sadly, that's what took this film down from a very good 8 out of 10 for me, to a slightly above-average 6 out of 10. I really enjoyed this film. But the fact that it is so hit-and-miss from trying to force in so much crude humor is a big problem for a comedy. I can't on good conscience give a comedy a higher score if there are so many dead-spaces without laughs. But I stress that I still do really enjoy this film. And I hope the sequel has a better balance with its humor."

","Ted's an odd movie, which is a good thing. Seth MacFarlane brings his style onto the big screen and it is a welcome refreshment. Unfortunately, it is not odd enough.<br/><br/>It feels like the script of the movie was written by two people. The one who wrote the funny stuff is good, although the jokes do have a Family Guy feel about them so if you do not find that funny thenyou're wrong obviously. But then it is like there is a second guy who wrote the emotional part of the story and that guy is not as good. The really serious dialogue, that is mostly in the 2nd part of the film, can be terrible. Every now and then there was a line so cliché and bland that my brain could not believe that the makers were just going to leave it like that and I kept expecting a follow-up statement or a punchline of some sort from the character, but it never came. And it does not help that it is difficult to take anything seriously that involves a talking teddy bear.<br/><br/>It was also weird to feel like a psychic, as the plot was becoming increasingly predictable. As a whole, I would not call the plot to be stereotypical, in fact the concept is quite fresh, but in many parts it was easy to guess what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>That said, the actors do their job OK, Giovanni Ribisi especially awesome as the creepy villain; the movie is funny and for most part quite smart; and it has Mila Kunis in it."

I'm not Wahlberg's biggest fan, but the guy really does a pretty good job convincing us he's not acting against a CGI placeholder. I was hoping for more Ralph Garman, but the dude only had one flippin' scene. <br/><br/>But you've gotta respect MacFarlane for getting Patrick Stewart to narrate this silliness. A flick about a talking stuffed bear dabbling in potty humor . . . Patrick effing Stewart. That the guy even has a chummy relationship with such an unparalleled god means MacFarlane has mounted his own golden chariot and is racing towards similarly lofty heights.

Sure, a person could just say, ""Why isn't there something new that can be worked into this movie other than the regular offensive humor and shock jokes?"" Then again, with the cast, crew, previews, it would seem that anyone with common sense would know that this flick would fall nothing short of a Seth Macfarlane, ""Look at me go!""

When he's 35 he's still hanging out with his bad-mouthed teddy bear friend, much to the annoyance of his girlfriend who wants him to engage in an adult relationship.<br/><br/>Although the story is shallow, filled with clichés and the forced happy ending made me cringe, there are actually quite a lot of funny moments. The crude, vulgar tits-and-ass kind of humor and the as ever gorgeous Mila Kunis are the only reasons to watch this movie. If you're into this you're probably going to enjoy the movie. If not you'd better steer clear of this one."
"jadepietro","6","0","0","7 February 2013"," Too Much to Bear
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's raunch-fest, Ted, a smutty little R- rated comedy that became one of this year's biggest hits. However, the film's real star is a foul-mouthed but lovable teddy bear named Teddy. He's kinda a cross between Snuggles the Bear and Chester the Molester. Depending on your own personal taste, this comedy will either be an outrageous laugh riot or just a gross turn-off. ( I was somewhere in-between. ) <br/><br/>The slim story goes like this: One day a little boy named John Bennett wishes that his cuddly bedtime companion would come to life and, sure enough, his wish comes true. Twenty seven years later, a grown-up John (Wahlberg) and his bud are still together, although John begins to rue that day as the rowdy Ted fills his life with enough debauchery and lewdness while ruining his romantic chances with Lori (Kunis). Of course, complications and embarrassing moments beset the characters and their bromance, including drugs, prostitutes, and other hedonistic pursuits.<br/><br/>That's the basic premise in this formulaic comedy which does have some funny and clever lines but more not-so-funny and, frankly, very predictable scenes as one would expect to find in this type of film. Still both Wahlberg and Kunis provide a nice chemistry and there is solid comic support by Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, and the original Flash Gordon and ex- Playgirl model, Sam Jones as himself. MacFarlane deftly voices Ted and co-wrote the hit- and-miss screenplay ( with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild ). This film also marks his directorial debut and MacFarlane has done a commendable job in all of those departments. The best moments come from the CGI which embodies Ted with the right facial expressions and movement to give him a winning personality and make the character come alive.<br/><br/>Ted may be off-putting and offensive to some moviegoers, but if you have a high tolerance of this sort of off-colored brand of humor and sophomoric shenanigans, the film just might be enough fun. Too often the film went for shock value and cheap laughs with a forced vulgarity as its primary goal. The film never bothers to explain or delve into Ted's transition from the cute little teddy bear of yesteryear to the profanity spewing furry lout of today. ( Now that exposition could have made the film far more interesting.) Anyway, anything goes in this movie. Everything is fair game and a comic target for MacFarlane. Ted doesn't always hit the comic bullseye, but it does aim to please those liberal-minded moviegoers in the audience. GRADE: B-"
"griffolyon12","6","0","0","7 January 2013"," A Quick, Nutshell Opinion of ""Ted""
","Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane makes the jump to features with his movie, Ted, telling the story of a boy's teddy bear who came to life, but now the boy is a man, and the bear has become a dirty mouthed, pot smoking slacker. Like all of MacFarlane's work, Ted is rude, crude, and socially unacceptable. Some of what MacFarlane finds funny could be seen as poor taste, but occasionally there are moments that are so ridiculous they are funny, such as Sam Jones, the actor who played Flash Gordon in that ill-fated '80s movie making a cameo appearance. Bottom line, if you're a fan of MacFarlane's television work, then you'll be at home with Ted, where MacFarlane can push the envelope even further at times with an R-rating. Personally, I find MacFarlane's sense of humor often offensive, in particular his religious jabs and his jokes about those with mental handicaps, but as I said above, often Ted is just so ridiculous, it is funny.<br/><br/>I give Ted a 6 out of 10!"

","I was a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy early on, and even quite liked it for at least the first two or three years of its return, but, man, has it ever gotten tired since then. I was hoping this new project would rekindle some talent, especially given its success with both audiences and critics. Frankly, though, this just feels like more of the same. There are, I must admit, some huge laughs in the first half or two-thirds of the film. The gags are very Family Guy-like, and it's about as ramshackle as your average episode of modern Family Guy, but, still, it's funny. The Giovanni Ribisi subplot especially just doesn't work in any way whatsoever, and it completely takes over the film in its final thirty minutes. The relationship plot line that drives the rest of the film is better, but it's not great, either. Neither Mark Wahlberg nor Mila Kunis ever feel like real people, and Ted himself gets old pretty quick. I won't say there wasn't some enjoyment - in fact, if you're interested at all, I'd say it's definitely not painful or anything - but it's pretty weak."
"Roweee","Null","0","0","18 November 2012"," Good idea with average execution
","I was looking forward to TED after hearing generally positive reviews and good word of mouth. I'm not a big fan of writer/director Seth MacFarlane's other works like FAMILY GUY, American DAD and THE CLEVELAND SHOW but I have found them amusing at times.<br/><br/>This film suffers from similar issues I have with those works. The comedy is often random, mainly one liners, packed with pop cultural references and toilet humour. If you go in with this understanding there is quite a bit to enjoy.<br/><br/>But the plot is wafer thin, predictable and the characters undeveloped. The third act seems to be thrown in for some action sequences. It's all about the gags in the end but I really expected more laugh out loud moments. It's a good concept that could have been executed so much better. In the end you might have some fun but it's ultimately a forgettable film."

One of those movies is Seth MacFarlanes Ted. I have been a fan of Family Guy since i started watching it a few years ago, and I was excited for Ted when i heard that MacFarlane was going to be doing it, but to be honest, i wasn't suspecting something as great as it was.

Remember 'Drop Dead Fred', the crazy imaginary friend of Pheobe Cates who caused all sorts of mischief, well TED is real and TED is a party animal, literally. He drinks, smokes, dances with hookers and has never left the side of his best (thunder) buddy played by Mark Wahlberg. As time goes by Mark and his amazing girlfriend played by Mila Kunis want to live alone without TED. Havoc erupts creating some amusing scenes not soon forgotten. TED is a comedy that the recent debacle starring Adam Sandler 'That's my Boy' failed to be, edgy, unique and most importantly, funny. See this now, Go Flash Go."
"charliep1998","10","3","8","21 September 2013"," Overall Ted is a great comedy film.
","Ted tells the story of John Bennett, a grown man having to deal with his drugged up child-hood friend who is a teddy bear and keeping in a stable relationship with girlfriend Mila Kunis. I personal think that Ted is a great film that could easily be one of the best comedy films of all time especially because of the fact the film contains such a comedy genius like Seth Macfarlane playing the main character himself. However, without Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis also starring alongside in the film I personally think it wouldn't have been such a huge success. Amazingly Ted earned $549,368,315 making it Universal's highest grossing film in 2012 and the only one to pass the $400 million mark. Also in the film are many guest from great actors like Ryan Reynolds and Sam Jones (Flash Gordon). Overall I would recommend Ted to anyone that likes a adult comedy film or anyone who likes TV Shows like Family Guy or American Dad which are created by Ted's Seth Macfarlane."

So I definitely lowered my expectations a lot before watching this movie. Boy, was I wrong! What I forgot to ask my friends about, was; Do you like Family Guy? I'll bet they doesn't. Otherwise they wouldn't give this movie anything else than sparkling stars.<br/><br/>You can say a lot about Mark Wahlberg's acting, and as usual he should have stayed a model for Calvin Klein instead of going to acting classes. However, Seth MacFarlane's twisted sense of humor carries this movie to perfection - and of course the hottest girl on earth; Mila Kunis.<br/><br/>The plot it self is not something spectacular, and you have a feeling through out the movie, that you already know the ending. It is the very classic ménage à trois, triangle drama. The childhood friend who hold the main character back from dealing with real and grownup life including his true love. BUT - this is not the purpose of the movie. The purpose of this movie is to make you laugh. And it does. There are so many awesome references to different characters from the 80's, Family Guy, etc.<br/><br/>It took me about 10 minutes to abstract from the familiar voices of Family Guy (Joe, Peter and to some extend Meg - you know Mila Kunis face and voice, so not so much her), but as soon as you let the movie and characters suck you into this vortex of dark twisted humor you have a hard time of letting go.<br/><br/>I gave it 10 out of 10.

"Thomasdinnegan75","5","3","8","1 August 2012"," Over advertised, over rated and not as funny as it is made out to be !
","After watching the trailer of Ted like 5 months ago on youtube, like a lot of people, I was very excited and wanted to see it, I thought it was a good idea and the trailer looked hilarious, and after wanting to see it that much I went today, its first day in cinema and i have to say I was terribly disappointed ! <br/><br/>The sad truth is that in this movie there are very few funny moments, in fact most of the half decent funny bits are all in the trailer, so when you see them you don't find them all that funny at all, and the rest of the humour is forced ! most of the jokes I found stupid, not because I'm sensitive and don't like rude words or drug references etc, in fact I think they can be funny when used right, and how can you have a hilarious movie without some swear words ?, but for me, I just think that the director goes overboard and its almost like he becomes lazy, and thinks we'll throw in a few f**ks here and there and a few scenes with weed and drink and thats it, we'll be sorted, they're bound to laugh! that however isn't true ! <br/><br/>Half the script is about insulting other celebrities which is fine once or twice, but it becomes repetitive and soon happens every 2nd scene, which ends up boring the crap out of you, its just like the director made those scenes for the trailer and said yeah we'll release this and it will attract people and then he just wrote the rest of the film while drunk or something ! or else he got completely lazy and thought its a film about a 35 year old man and a teddy bear, people wont expect a masterpiece, yeah thats true,i didn't expect a masterpiece,I expected a movie that would be stupid and silly and just make me laugh the whole way through however i was really disappointed as it barely made me laugh twice ! The ending is good, and about 3 scenes in between are OK, but in truth I would say that this is one of those over advertised Hollywood films that for some weird reason most people love and it makes a huge sum of money ! if i were you I wouldn't bother going to Ted, it truly is hard to explain how bored and disappointed i was with this movie, it defiantly is a massive disappointment, and the biggest one in years for me as i expected so much more !"
"linpaws","5","3","8","16 July 2012"," Disappointing
","One of the few joys left in my life is watching ""The Family Guy"" and re- runs of it. I was instantly fascinated by it's satirical humor and unrelated references and cutting-off-to-flashbacks and extempore- breaking-into-song-sequences and while I was painfully watching it's sheen and gloss fade away, I was still hopeful of a few flashes of genius from the man at it's helm. So, it was obvious that ever since TED was announced and subsequently released, I was waiting eagerly.<br/><br/>The movie let me down! Big time! Here're the reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>May be I had too many expectations when I was hoping to see a bit of Family Guy rub off on the big screen, sort of, Stewie-Brian banter and chatter, their rantings, experiences, travels etc. This had nothing of the sort! Ted was no Brian and John (Mark) was no Stewie! Yeah there were expletive-filled rants and tangential chatter but nothing as endearing as the real thing. May be, just being wishful here, if Seth had Stewie dub in for Mark, it'd somehow had gotten everything to fall in place including the original camaraderie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mila Kunis is the center-piece of this story! Come-on now, having seen Family Guy for all these seasons, who'd like Meg to be the main character!? Every time John would go shout at Ted for not letting him be with her, I would cringe in my seat! The moment I heard Mila utter her first word, all I could see was a girl with round specs in a purple hat all the time! And Mr. Seth, you just can't let Meg have that attention! She's got to get trashed around! And the bit that killed me: it's like Meg and Brian are being held at the same level vying for John's attention! I don't care if it's John or Peter or whoever! You just can't hold Meg and a character like that of a Brian on the same ground!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the hall, I had a Jew sitting in the front, an Asian on my left, a Mexican on my right and a black man behind me. So, even if I wanted to, I couldn't laugh at lot of places. If you're wondering how I found about the Jew, well, he was laughing the hardest in the first kid scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No impromptu songs! I half expected TED to be a musical but too bad it wasn't. The only thing that came close was Mark's singing on the stage and if that's the excuse you give me for a musical, I would rather watch a TFG episode starring Meg alone!</li></ul><br/><br/>So, there you go Mr. Macfarlane. Not so successful directional debut and yeah, while you'd be singing your way to the bank, you've lost some more respect among your TFG legions."

"brunowangtaiwan","10","4","13","29 June 2012"," MacFarlane Genius on the Big Screen. Must See
","I will tell you up front that I am a huge fan of Family Guy and MacFarlane and that I give this move a Bruno Wang 5 out of 5 stars. This movie is without a doubt one of the funniest films released for this year. The acting is superb and the entire premise, music, gag lines and some of the visual humor is outstanding. Even if you are not a Seth MacFarlane fan, you will definitely like this film. <br/><br/>I don't know exactly what it is about this film, maybe it is just the insane idea of a teddy bear that talks, but the movie will have you laughing from the get go and keep you laughing for about 1:45 mins. From a production standpoint, the idea of the big screen as a canvas for one of today's top animation geniuses is intriguing enough. MacFarlane pulls it off with finesse, style and raucous humor. <br/><br/>The film is about John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg) who is a misfit kid who can never make any friends. At the age of eight Bennett gets a teddy bear (Ted, voiced by MacFarlane) for Christmas and then wishes the bear was real so that he could have a friend for life. 27 years later Bennett and Ted are living the life of a Bohemian 35 year old partier and his teddy bear sidekick. Bennett's girlfriend feels it is time for Ted to go out on his own so that Wahlberg can grow up and get a life.<br/><br/>There are a lot of drug references and a fair amount of potty humor, but Ted never really goes as far as even Family Guy does in terms of the shock value humor. Instead, we are treated to the MacFarlane genius...the rapid fire use of quips, cultural references, oddly placed cutaways, perfectly placed musical themes and actual character development. <br/><br/>It is true that the three main characters, Wahlberg, MacFarlane and Mila Kunis (who plays Bennett's love interest Lori Collins) hold this film to a higher standard. The acting is very believable and there are actually some genuinely touching moments (more MacFarlane genius). In addition, Giovanni Ribisi plays an ultra freaky lifetime stalker of Ted and, in his pursuit to 'own' Ted for his overweight son, puts on a compelling performance as the creepy, whacked-out stalker dude. Patrick Stewart is the narrator and that just adds to the bizarre twist of class that MacFarlane brings. <br/><br/>The main thing about Ted is that it feels really fresh. In a sea of predictable raunchy-comedy that has flooded the cinema the past few years, Ted stands out as a true creative genius. Yes, it has some raunchy humor and 'poo-poo' type jokes, but it excels in layering smart and sophisticated humor with guttural bawdiness. This is not a 90+ minute Family Guy episode and it's not just a set of running gag jokes, this is a solid comedic milestone. Somehow MacFarlane has us totally sucked into the reality of a world where a fuzzy teddy bear can talk, smoke pot, talk dirty and have a heart. We are even treated to a monumental fight scene between Wahlberg and Ted that is extremely lifelike even though it is a grown man in a fistfight with a stuffed animal. <br/><br/>You can easily put this film on par with films like Team America from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It is the modern-day Lenny Bruce-like humor that, while being dark and crass, shines a light on the parts of American culture that many would rather pretend do not exist. This is the true comedic genius of MacFarlane, he shows us what we all know, but want to deny, exists and does it is a way that makes us laugh...out loud.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough that, if you see one movie this summer, make it Ted. You will laugh repeatedly for an hour and a half plus and walk out of the theater feeling much lighter for having done so. Bruno Wang will be seeing Ted more than once as the rapid fire humor of MacFarlane requires more than one viewing to get all the short little quips and one-liners."

It didn't even seem all that over the top like I was expecting it to go, cause if it was at least chaotic humor. Than it might have at least somewhat stood out, but there is nothing witty about the humor. Toilet humor is fine if it's funny but that just isn't the case for this flick. Somehow I think some viewers are just forcing themselves to like this movie cause they like Family Guy. But some viewers that enjoys Family Guy came out disappointed with this movie as well. I just laughed at one part in this movie, it was mad stupid but funny but that is about it. Everything about this flick was so darn shallow and sometimes don't make any sense in a negative way. You can basically sum up the whole movie just by the trailer except with few more jokes thrown in than and there. This movie does have it's audience cause there was a guy in his 60's that couldn't stop cracking up but it just isn't for me. Might have worked if the jokes were at least more inventive and more consistent. In one scene this flick actually has the nerve to insult ""Superman Returns"".

","There isn't much to say except if you love Family Guy or you're a fan of or remember the 80's, you will thoroughly enjoy this. It has all of what makes Family Guy so popular: crude and childish humour with pop-culture references and unbelievable situations. Even if you don't completely understand the 80′s references, you won't feel lost with this film (Flash Gordon, Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall"" OK, that was 1979. Sue me! and others).<br/><br/>It's a fairly simple layout: lonely boy wishes for a friend and finds it in a foul-mouthed teddy bear voiced by Seth MacFarlane (who is also the writer/director). They become friends for life complete with pot smoking, swearing and bro-ing out. There's a myriad of surprise guests and cameos of varying eras including a large portion of the cast of Family Guy and Patrick Stewart as the dry and witty narrator.<br/><br/>Straying slightly from the path of the Family Guy formula, Ted stacks on the Hollywood via rom- com elements. But fans of Family Guy need not worry, as there's filthy humour, pop culture references and insults of all ages, gender and cultures aplenty."

It reminds me of watching a porno movie; you keep watching in the hopes that it might get better, but it never does. What a sad excuse fora comedy. I'd like to blame Seth McFarlane since he wrote it, created it and directed it, but there are too many unfunny references to Jews which offended me too much.

"kyle-christopher-beck","8","2","5","24 April 2013"," Story line
","The movie I will be reviewing is Ted. The director/ voice of ted was Seth MacFarlane, it was his first time on the big screen in a movie, he also has several shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and a few others. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis were also key actors in the plot of the story, Mark played as John Bennett and Mila played as Lori Collins.<br/><br/>The film started when John was just a kid, he didn't have many friends and not a lot of people liked him, for Christmas he received a teddy bear. One night he wished upon a star for the bear to come alive and the next morning ted was alive. Many years down the road, they are still best friends even after all the fame and troubles ted was involved with. John and Lori were in a relationship and ted always seemed to get in-between them and caused several fights and even a break up. Ted had a weird guy stalking him and kidnapped him which brought John and Lori back together. Ted was severally injured and they tried to save him but failed, and Lori wished upon a star and ted came back to life in the end.<br/><br/>The scene was in Boston, and Mark did a good job keeping the accent fresh and kept it going. He seemed really enthused and made a good act out of it. Mila you could somewhat tell she was acting in some parts of the movie, but the rest was overall good acting. And Seth ""as Ted"" kept character and accent good the whole time. There were some parts of the movie I felt as if the actors were talking to themselves and not Ted. But over all they acted as if they were actually living and the fights, anger, and other parts seemed realistic.<br/><br/>The movie expressed several scenes where music, back grounds, and other effects seemed to go along with the story. In the beginning when they were older, the movie was very bright, happy back ground and so on. When ted was kidnapped, the house was dark, gloomy, older house with a creepy background like from a horror film. When Ted died, it was a stormy night and lightning and thunder filled the sound and screen, which made it a sad/ angry day.<br/><br/>I would overall say it is a good movie, from the review you probably think it is a kid movie but it is far from that, there is drugs, alcohol, adult comedy and should not be viewed by a younger audience, but I would highly recommend this movie to someone wanting to see a comedy."

Now try figuring this out and imagine a story in which a girl can't get rid of her whining doll - and now ask yourself whether this would be fun for a guy and whether he would put up with the woman and her doll. I hope the answer is not.<br/><br/>This could have been a sweet comedy about how this 35-year-old man cannot let go of both his childishness and his adultescent sense of irresponsibility -instead, it turns into a pathetic portrayal of a pathetic man... and into a message for us, girls, to accept guys like this no matter what.<br/><br/>We, of course, must be mature and responsible for them, and, well, their teddy bears. No dolls."
"bkoganbing","7","2","5","1 February 2013"," Me And My Teddy Bear, we got no worries and we got no cares
","Watching Ted it took me all the way back to my long ago childhood when I had a Teddy Bear. I certainly envied Mark Wahlberg for getting his Christmas wish. Of course the story involves Mark possibly outgrowing the need for a talking Teddy Bear. And that song from my childhood Me and my Teddy Bear kept running through my head.<br/><br/>Ted is a charming fantasy about a young boy who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg wishing for and getting his Teddy Bear to turn into a live creature. The bear named Ted of course grows up with Wahlberg and the childish pleasures they shared, are now adult pleasures. Some very adult pleasures.<br/><br/>All this is coming between Wahlberg and the girl he loves Mila Kunis. She gives him an understandable ultimatum, me or the bear. <br/><br/>As Ted is truly a unique creature, no one in the history of planet earth was ever faced with that choice. How Mark resolves it is for you to see in the movie.<br/><br/>If you do see it, I'd think long and hard about taking minor kids to it. Ted is funny, but funny for adults.<br/><br/>I have to single out Giovanni Ribisi and young Aedin Mincks who if Wahlberg is ready to give up Ted, they'll have him. These two will creep you out and no one I would hold near and dear would get near them. Also Seth McFarlane was great in his creation of Ted both in voice and animation.<br/><br/>Nice enjoyable film, but not one for the kids."
"kindtxgal","2","2","5","19 January 2013"," Dead Ted
","Would've loved to given the film more ""stars"" due to a pretty nice story line .. however, as usual, Seth McFarlane just can't resist showing viewers how much garbage can be showcased out of one person's mouth & mind (notice I didn't say brain).<br/><br/>There's something really sick in an unhealthy way when someone messes around w/a child's most wholesome toy and drag it through such porno-laden filth. I'm more worried about McFarlane's fantasies than Kevin Clash's current alleged misdeeds...in my mind, the Academy stooping so low as to nominate any part of this film for any award at all shows how sad their standards have fallen.<br/><br/>McFarlane's ""creativity"" is so unevolved, it's an insult to viewers who hoped for some redemptive power to attach itself to an otherwise nice story by turning it into a hate fest against any type of decency in any level of relationships. Mark Wahlberg and Patrick Stewart -- shame on you for wasting your time and talent on such a low-down piece of cinematic filth & waste of celluloid. Particularly offensive after reading a recent People's articles on how ""wholesome"" and ...well, whatever Wahlberg hopes to be as a ""family man"" for his kids. Uh huh. Yeah, move over Wahlberg..creating filth like this does little to make that believable."
"Hayjohowe","8","2","5","1 January 2013"," Still funnier than Pitch Perfect
","Ted is A Family Guy Fans dream. Its a feature length film filled with fun characters played by the actors of family guy, what more could you ask for? The feel to the film is a lot like a long episode of family guy: Ted is often a slow witted but comedic guy, a lot like Peter Griffin. I find it fitting how they're voiced by the same guy. There's a lot of swearing, drinking, silly humor, profanity, and sexual content, much like an unrated family guy episode. The characters even seem to originate from family guy. There's John who is like an older version of Stewie, with Ted being Ruebert the Bear. Lori is like Lois, and her boss is like Quagmire or Brian, constantly after her. There's a creepy fat kid who is like a mix of Chris and the Jewish kid, and his father is like Mort. But it is still original and Seth MacFarlane does a good job at directing a feature length film. Unfortanatley I've seen a lot of reviews for this movie that don't appreciate its crude and slap stick comedy, but fans like me consider it to be one of the funniest movies ever made, so i say check it out."

","Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's debut feature is crass and sexist. It wallows in nostalgia, flirts with racism, spends too much time scampering after a plot. It's also the funniest film of 2012. A raucous insult to good taste and good sense that warps the template of the American boy-man comedy into horrible new shapes.<br/><br/>Ted – a cuddly toy bear brought to life after a wish upon a star – is a miracle turned sour. The public got bored of sentient ""Teddy"". He's become a grizzled former celebrity – a tired little weed-smoking, beer-swilling teddy bear. He spends his days on the sofa, distracting his childhood buddy John (Mark Wahlberg) from committing to his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>It's been said that MacFarlane will aim his vicious wit at anyone except the white middle-class male. But Ted is as much about the frustrated nature of wastrels like John as it is a showcase for the world view of a gratuitously obscene teddy bear. MacFarlane makes it clear – after all the cruel jokes and bitchy asides – that John isn't happy, hasn't been for a long time. And Ted's the reason. John starts to see Ted for what he is: a weary Boston meat head, made funnier and sadder for being trapped in the body of a children's toy. It's in the dissolution of their long-term friendship that the film really bites.<br/><br/>If you need to intellectualize your enjoyment of MacFarlane's comedy further, you could point to the tragedy of Ted's ageless existence. Or the director's skewering of a society that so quickly tires of an anthropomorphic teddy bear. Or you could just laugh until your stitches burst at a whacked-out cuddly toy extolling the merits of a strain of weed called ""They're coming! They're coming!"" i did."
"alex-369-867786","2","2","5","15 December 2012"," What happened?
","What the hell happened to the sharp, topical, intelligent, genre-bashing and generally hilarious humour we have come to expect from Renaissance Man (and part-time crooner of Broadway show tunes) Seth MacFarlane? Instead we get a big budget, low-intelligence, loud, crass, insulting mess of a film. Mark Wahlberg was horribly miscast, and slept-walked through the entire thing, usually wearing a tight t-shirt that showed off his big biceps. Mila Kunis was perky, yet p*ssed-off throughout, though she gets one star for her unprecedented use of the C word, but that can hardly be seen as a redeeming factor, in the grand scheme of things. And the main protagonist, Ted, had a very short humour shelf-life. I would probably had a more enriching experience sitting though an episode of The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin, which incidentally (and perhaps inevitably) gets quoted by Ted in this big fat waste-of-blood-and-organs of a film."
"Floated2","8","2","5","30 November 2012"," Funny and enjoyed it
","From Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comes a very solid comedy about the over-dependent relationship between John (Mark Wahlberg) and his walking, talking, swear-happy, bong-smoking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane). His girlfriend (Mila Kunis) is unhappy with Ted's disruptive influence and john has to make the uncomfortable decision about having to grow up. While merrily delivering all the coarse anti-PC humour the Family Guy fanbase have a right to expect, the best thing about Ted is also its biggest surprise - it has real heart. In lesser hands this could so easily have been a throwaway one-joke movie, yet Ted actually develops into a full-bodied tale about friendship as MacFarlane actually makes you care about the relationship between John and his boyhood bear.<br/><br/>The film's top-shelf visual effects go a long way to making the premise work, but what ultimately sells it is the quality of the direction. Despite the fact that he's a stuffed toy he's actually more credible than the cardboard characters that populate most rom-coms. Beneath all the naughty jokes and signature pop culture references - just watch the sales of Flash Gordon DVDs skyrocket! - you really care for this bear. As a rewatch 06 14 19' then again 06/08/20' Ted remains a highly entertaining comedy."

Amazingly hilarious. I love the plot, plus with every good-looking, awesome, famous stars in it. Lot of amazing special appearances I might say. It was well done, and a bit emotional. You gonna love it, though it wasn't some kind of movie you will be dying to watch. I still remember some part where I can't stop laughing for a quite some times.

Now, I am the biggest Family Guy fan and always get it's humor, and wonder why Seth McFarlane hasn't put the damn Fam Guy movie out yet? Don't be like the Simpsons and put out the movie long after people stopped watching the show! Ted was OK, but after watching Family Guy since 1999, it just wasn't that outrageous to me. There just wasn't anything I really guffawed at, only a few chuckles. I would rather even have had an American Dad movie than this. McFarlane did at least give many Fam Guy actors and writers parts in this movie, but, again, they would be better in a freakin' Fam Guy movie! Ted..It's worth a rental, but that's about it."

","Last night I went to watch the movie ""Ted"", which is Seth McFarlane's first attempt at a feature film. And in this case ""attempt"" is actually a more accurate term than ""film"". The humor is decent at times, and I remember laughing out loud at a few scenes, but the movie feels so empty and hollow. It feels like it's not an actual movie, and more like a long episode of Family Guy, especially considering that the only funny jokes in this movie are the flashbacks the characters have (a Family Guy trademark).<br/><br/>The plot is very slow moving (if there is one in the first place) and the movie never picks up any pace, it never excites you or surprises you. The ending is one of the cheesiest endings in film history. Sure, the character work is alright and none of the actors are bad at what they do but the film is overall a huge letdown which leaves nothing behind, I had brought up my hopes for this one. If you just want to watch something mindless on a Saturday night, Ted is a nice option but if you want to watch an actual movie, go see Batman instead."
"LaurieMann","7","2","5","8 July 2012"," Rare Comedy That Doesn't Give It All Away in the Trailer.
","Liked much of the movie very much - not every plot point is revealed in the trailer, for one thing. For another, while it was raunchy and foul-mouthed, it wasn't disgusting (well, except in one part), so it didn't annoy me quite as much as Bridesmaids did last year. It makes many insightful comments on mid-'80s culture (or lack thereof) and on celebrities. It does fall apart a little about 2/3rds of the way through when it generally stopped being so funny and started taking itself a little too seriously. While I don't care for Seth McFarlane's TV work, I enjoyed most of Ted, and think he, like Ben Affleck, has a great ear for the South Boston style of speech and attitude."

I really didn't pay that close of attention to character development in this film because I was laughing so hard. Mila is always hot and can act too so she was awesome as the leading lady.

If you like what you see in the trailers, you will love this movie. I have not written a review in quite awhile on IMDb but this movie has to be seen. I have not laughed so hard in a theater since the first Hangover came out. I was lucky to be able to see an advanced screening of Ted tonight and cannot wait for it to hit theaters. I will definitely go see it a few more times for sure.<br/><br/>The movie centers on Ted obviously, but all of the little things make this movie so good. Giovanni Ribisi was fantastic as a creepy-teddy-bear-stalking freak. Aedin Mincks (Young Alan in Hangover II) was just as good playing the junior stalker. The background music, what toys the kids opened on Christmas in 1985, everything contributed to the feel of this movie. Even Patrick Stewart detailing the abilities of an Apache helicopter was hilarious.<br/><br/>If you have a chance, see this movie. Twice. Or three times. You will not regret it."

","I immediately voted this a 9-star. But a day later, I've upped my opinion to full 10-stars. I cannot think of a way to improve TED. It was simply hilarious.<br/><br/>As you might suspect, there's a lot of stupid humor in TED. When I saw the dumb jokes coming, I would mentally prepare myself to simply hold my breath until it was over, knowing that more intelligent humor would follow. But more often than I care to admit, the ""dumb"" humor wore me down until I burst out laughing like I haven't laughed at a movie since PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES or FAMILY VACATION. In my opinion, TED is an instant classic like those movies.<br/><br/>Sure, TED is offensive and gross. But it's freakin' funny.<br/><br/>I heard the ""FAMILY GUY"" connection only *after* seeing the movie. I had no idea who Seth MacFarlane was, nor this movie's relationship to FAMILY GUY. Full disclosure: I cannot stand Family Guy. I tried watching it long ago, like three times. Each time I lasted about two minutes and had to turn it off. Just terrible. But TED is hilarious. So if you hate Family Guy, that doesn't necessarily mean you won't laugh at TED.<br/><br/>There are lines, entire scenes, and facial expressions re-running through my head all day today.<br/><br/>Full-stars, thumbs up, all that. If you can stand some foul language, and foul jokes, and you enjoy cultural references (going back to 1980), then run, do not walk, to see TED."

It is easily the must see comedy of the summary if not the year. The writing from director Seth Mcfarland is nothing less then I expected from him. I am not a regular viewer of Family Guy although I have caught a few episodes here and their but I have seen the last few Comedy Central Roasts in which he has hosted and he is among the funniest presents in that series I have seen.<br/><br/>In short, I urge anyone who has not seen this yet and is questioning whether to go see it, to not hesitate for a second and definitely go out and see it. It is obviously not intended for children so do keep that in mind, other then that, prepare to lose a few calories through laughter."

"xThe_Fury","8","3","11","29 June 2012"," Ted - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","""Ted"" is a slap stick comedy by Seth MacFarlane that asks how far can a little boys wish go. It also asks how far can a comedy go in terms of crudeness. After one box office success, 21 Jump Street, and one failure, That's My Boy. Let's see if Ted can bring back crude comedy to the top of the box office this week and for weeks to come.<br/><br/>When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he received a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas and upon receiving it he wishes that his new bear could come alive and talk in real life. When his wish is granted, his new friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) comes alive and they share a bond that they will share forever. John is now 35 years old and Ted, now a celebrity, is still around and living with John. Now John has to balance his life between his job, fun with Ted, and his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) and encounters tons of road blocks in making his life balanced.<br/><br/>This being Seth MacFarlane first live action film, I thought the camera shots he used were very good and the comedy was laugh out loud hilarious. MacFarlane's voice work is amazing, even similar to Peter Griffin (Family Guy), his voice went well with Ted's personality and demeanor. Mark Wahlberg was gold in this movie and did a good job acting, especially in scenes with Ted, who was a CGI generated bear. The comedy in this movie was vulgar, grotesque, and racist; but this being a Seth MacFarlane feature the audience should be expecting that. The film had a good pace; it never seemed slow. Near the last third of the movie, the film did a little genre change. It went from crude comedy, then a little bit drama, and then near the end there was a cool little action adventure sequence.<br/><br/>Even though I prefer comedies that aren't vulgar and crude, this one was definitely worth price of admission. It was hilarious on all counts. I think there are jokes in here that can be offensive to any type of person, but you knowing Seth MacFarlane you shouldn't be surprised. This is one of the best comedies of the year up there along with 21 Jump Street. This film had everyone rolling. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>bkstaReviews.blogspot.com"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","6","7 September 2012"," Better than its peers
","John(Wahlberg, with his usual ""not the brightest bulb but nice guy"" charm) had trouble making friends as a child, so at 7, he wished for his plush bear(MacFarlane, playing it like a nasty jerk who does have some empathy) to be alive, and it was granted(and this wisely has everyone know that it is, so he doesn't have to be hidden and dressed up for the entirety, with that lame material we've seen countless times for several decades). They both age over the years, and when we rejoin them, he's been dating Lori(Kunis, not coming off like she's nagging, and who can laugh with the other two... we believe they would get together and stay together, it's not a ""what is she doing with him"" kind of thing so typical in recent American fictional media) for 4 years, and she wants them to go to the next level. All three relationships are very credible, as are most of the characters(except for the ones that are just there for us to laugh at) and their logic. As he tries to develop more maturity, we of course indulge in plenty of juvenile fun, albeit this has almost even amounts of genuinely sweet and/or dramatic moments(it has serious heart, and the ending may very well make you cry... in spite of the unnecessary parts of the climax). This is raunchy, with lots of strong language, mild violence and brief nudity... we get jokes about various sexual, religious and ethnic groups, and this tries to offend absolutely everyone. It is hilarious(it really doesn't try too hard), and yes, there are one or two gags there to push the boundaries; it's an R-rated comedy, it's expected... with that said, this is miles above the usual outing in this genre. The writing and performances are where this shines, with the plot being the weakest(though it is done well), as it is so simplistic and obvious... we've seen it so many times already. And as already mentioned, the third act is... a tad off. It doesn't fit with the clever ""symbol of stunted growth"" concept. There are pop culture references, parodies, and excellent guest stars. The FX are impeccably integrated and animated, you fully believe what you see is real. I recommend this to any fan of the director(who fares rather well for his debut), the cast(McHale is great as an insufferable boss who won't accept that he can't date Mila, and Ribisi is fantastic... note that Warburton is barely in it) and this kind of movie. 8/10"

While the trailers had pretty funny moments, and reviewers and friends alike were giving the film glowing reviews, I was a tad worried I'd be in for another ""cute but naughty thing that shouldn't be talking"" story, as seen in Alf or Paul or Look Who's Talking? orwell, let's just say it's been done before. In fact, there's a good amount of evidence to support that Seth MacFarlane would tell that story when you consider the characters of Stewie and Brian in Family Guy, Roger and Klaus in American Dad, and Rollo in The Cleveland Show.<br/><br/>But like those characters (specifically Stewie and Brian), MacFarlane navigates skillfully between obvious jokes that come from having a character be a baby or a dog or, in Ted's case, a teddy bear, and jokes that are actually hilarious because of well-crafted characters. While the ""cute but naughty thing that shouldn't be talking"" has been done before, MacFarlane's handling of it is fresh, funny, and surprisingly touching.<br/><br/>Ted begins with us meeting young John Bennett, who will grow up to be the loveably dopey Mark Wahlberg. Poor John has no friends except for an over-sized teddy bear who he never lets leave his side. One night, John wishes for Teddy to be alive, and wouldn't you know it, a shooting star magically grants him his wish. John is ecstatic his wish came true and that he finally has a friend, and while his parents are initially scared shitless by the talking toy, they quickly accept him as a miracle and part of the family. Soon word gets out about this living teddy bear, and he becomes an overnight worldwide sensation, appearing on the cover of Time Magazine and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. But as the years go on, the phenomenon fades and Ted becomes another celebrity who's fifteen minutes of fame have ended.<br/><br/>But one thing doesn't change, and that's Ted's friendship with John. The two are still the best of friends, living and smoking and watching Flash Gordon together. Ted is not John's only friend anymore though, not since he started dating Lori (Mila Kunis) four years ago. With Lori and John's relationship beginning to enter the next level of commitment, John must learn to grow up and put away childish thingsonly he doesn't want to, and neither does Ted. Even after Ted moves out, John's constant hanging out with him and irresponsibility begin to drive a wedge between him and Lori. And if this weren't enough, Lori's asshole boss, Rex (Joel McHale) is continuing to make advances on her, and a creepy fan from Ted's celebrity days named Donny (hilariously played by Giovanni Ribisi) seems to be stalking the talking bear.<br/><br/>For the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/ted/"
"moviemaniac008","9","2","6","6 July 2012"," Hilarious film!
","I haven't reviewed a film in forever, so I thought to myself ''Why not review the last movie I have seen?''. Well, last night, my trip to the theatre was to see Seth MacFarlane's TED. I'm pretty familiar with Seth MacFarlane's comedy, and while I'm not always fond of it, I do kind of like it. However, with MacFarlane, it's usually a love-it-or-hate-it kind of comedy. As a result, TED could have easily gone one way or the other. Luckily for us, Ted goes in the right direction, and while undeniably very raunchy and very crude, those who are not offended by such humour will be in for one very, very funny ride.<br/><br/>John is the least popular kid in the neighbourhood. One Christmas Eve, he is given a teddy bear, and while the teddy bear isn't alive per Se, it automatically becomes John's best friend. One night, little John wishes for his bear to come alive, which is exactly what happens, and the two are now really best friends. It's a really cute story at first, but what happens 27 years after? Well, John (Mark Wahlberg) and his bear, ''Ted''(voice of Seth MacFarlane himself) are stoners and John, at 35 years old, works in a car rental company. John is in a relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), a very patient and mature girl who, despite loving him too, believes that Ted is a nuisance to her relationship with John. In order to get the best of both worlds, John lets Ted go, helps him find a job, and other things like that...<br/><br/>I'm not saying more. I could go on and on about the plot, but I don't feel like spoiling anything. What you do got to know though is that TED is a very, very funny comedy. It works on pretty much every level. Seth MacFarlane's branch of humour is worthy of the early Family Guy episodes, back when it was any good. It is also easily recognizable in TED. Whether he's bashing Jews on a Christmas Eve or having someone pick up a piece of sh!t from the floor, there are many gags you could actually picture seeing on television. Of course, there are many pop culture references as well. However, those don't always work as well as the other gags, but still, when they work well, they're very funny. I'm thinking of an opening gag and a closing gag aimed at some today and past stars which had me up in stitches, and that, long after the movie was ended. The movie also kind of feels like a thriller near the end with a pretty tense car chase. A few other parts, near the end mostly, emotions were present. Not in a crying-your-heart-out kind of way, but more like a Aww-that's-sad kind of way. <br/><br/>Of course, both leads are great in their roles. Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly solid, constantly replying with perfect comedic timing and sometimes a surprising amount of emotion to...well, a teddy bear, who doesn't even exist. Mila Kunis also has her funny moments, but besides a climatic decision and being the one who wants Ted and John's bromance to end, she doesn't really bring anything useful to the movie (I blame the way the character was written, because Kunis was perfect for the role.) Undeniably, the real star of the movie is Ted himself. Not only does he look surprisingly realistic for a CGI teddy bear, but he's quite the entertainer. And while most of what comes out of his mouth is profane, it's also very funny. In fact, if Ted were an actual comedian, I wouldn't hesitate one minute to buy tickets for his one-man show. I'll give a special credit to Giovanni Ribisi (who also starred in Contraband, opposing Mark Wahlberg earlier this year), who is awesome as a stalker, but I won't say much more.<br/><br/>Overall, like I said, TED goes one way or another. For me, it definitely went the right way. It was hilarious and entertaining enough to warrant a full price ticket at the theatre. Let me put it this way. TED is up there with 21 Jump Street in terms of 2012 comedy. MacFarlane fans, you do not want to miss this movie. MacFarlane haters, enter with an open mind and you might exit pleasantly surprised. Average moviegoer looking to go on a date or to go see a movie? Why not try out TED? Before I used to give 10's out as a way to say ""Highest recommendation"", but I don't give 10's out like that anymore. 9 is a really great mark, and that is what I'm giving to TED, because that's exactly what it deserves."
"papabearEG","7","2","6","2 July 2012"," Aside from some annoying stereotypes, it's worth the price of admission.
","It was much better than I expected and I laughed the whole time with few exceptions. It has a much more mature plot than I expected and has touching moments offset with raunchy humor. All in all a good investment of time and money for an evenings entertainment.<br/><br/>-------Spoilers --------<br/><br/>Pro: There are some inventive routines and imagery that's just soooo wrong... It's terrific. the animation and rendering of Ted are spot on. I only stopped laughing a few times and felt disappointed in Macfarlane for a few things that left a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>Con: The raunchy humor in this film is hysterical and I am by no means a prude. I draw a line though, when it comes to deeply offensive stereotypes used to bully people, particularly at a time when bullying is epidemic. How do you tell kids to stop bullying and not to use certain phrases when they are constantly used in Macfarlans shows? Macfarlane can't resist the old worn out gay jokes or racist characters. If he could just avoid rehashing tired old routines, his shows would be much better. For example, I have a hard time with animated shows that continue to use ""That's so gay"", giving teens the impression that it's acceptable to use this phrase. That one really grates my nerves and I only hear it repeated continually in South Park and Macfarlanes shows. These kinds of gay jokes went the way of black faced Minstral shows a long time ago. Additionally there are a few obnoxious racial stereotypes in this film that really bugged me.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with my brothers adopted Korean daughters. An obnoxious and deeply offensive Asian stereotyped character made them very uncomfortable and tarnished an otherwise wonderful evening.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Aside from these few ridiculously over done routines, the show is fresh and very funny. I had a great time watching it and left the theater wondering when I can see it again."
"cadillac20","7","2","6","29 June 2012"," Not The Perfect Comedy, But Pretty Damn Funny
","Ted has been on my list of comedies to watch since I started hearing about it. The idea is great and I do enjoy Seth MacFarlane's style of comedy. Sure enough, that is what Ted is. I've heard it be called a long episode of Family Guy, and while that isn't accurate, it does say a lot about the kind of humor Ted evokes. And I had a pretty good time with it.<br/><br/>MacFarlane voices the titular character, best friend to Walberg's Jon. When Jon makes a wish as a kid for his teddy bear to come to life it does, becomes a sensation, and becomes Jon's best friend. If you were wondering how, exactly, the whole teddy bear come to life thing works in the real world sense, it does, and the history of Jon and Ted is told early in the film in a pretty damn funny narration. I will say that, while Ted may be a very interesting idea, and the whole notion of a raunchy teddy bear acting like a man-child is pretty funny in and of itself, Ted could easily have been replaced by a normal person, and the film would be as funny. It's Seth's writing and humor that shine here.<br/><br/>MacFarlane has always done good voice work on Family Guy and American Dad, and it translates here pretty well. Ted is obviously the voice of Peter Griffin, and you can't shake that feeling, but Ted also comes into his own as a character. The idea of a raunchy, foul mouthed, man-child teddy bear faded on me pretty quick, which goes to show how well the film was done. Ted's interaction with people never feels weird or out of place. It comes naturally and everyone does a great job of interacting with him. Props to Mila Kunis and especially Mark Walberg, who once again proves that he can do great at comedy. This is a role uncommon for Mark, and where he was a funny guy in The Other Guys, he's even funnier here.<br/><br/>MacFarlane proves fairly adept at taking to the camera for the first time and directing his actors. Nothing here is spectacular, I'd even say the film is fairly predictable, but the comedy is gold here. It doesn't hit with a continuous rhythm, but when it hits, it's laugh out loud funny. But, like I said, it's a lot of the usual MacFarlane humor, pulling out some odd pop-culture references here and there, making lingering jokes, and even some very odd, wtf moments. I did, a few times, raise my hands in a wtf gesture. Luckily, the film also has heart. Ted is a little bit too obvious as an object for Jon, who has trouble putting away childish things, but Ted and Jon's relationship shines as honest and natural. Even if Ted is a teddy bear, you still accept what he and Jon have.<br/><br/>Ted certainly isn't a perfect comedy. A number of jokes fall flat if you don't get the pop references or are into some of the ongoing bits, like those involving Flash Gordon (although, I did find all the Flash Gordon stuff pretty amusing). The script also has a few issues being a bit cliché and staying too long on certain jokes. Much like Family Guy, some stuff here just isn't that funny or stays on too long. But, the majority of the film is funny. I certainly laughed out loud quite a bit. So, if you enjoy the MacFarlane brand of humor and find yourself at a loss for comedies this summer, Ted should entertain you quite a bit."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","5","23","12 July 2012"," Awesome comedy!
","It takes a lot for a comedy to truly make me laugh but this movie succeeded more than once! Guess this is really a movie that speaks to me, not so much with just its story and concept but more with its references and other little things that can be found in this movie.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie probably doesn't sound all that appealing to most and actually also lets this movie sound like a very typical, predictable and childish, gimmicky movie, that relies solely on the premise of having a talking teddy bear in it. But the movie is surprisingly clever and doesn't become a predictable or lame on in any way. It also most definitely is not a childish movie. Quite the contrary! It's an at times rude and cruel movie, filled with plenty of sex, booze and drugs as well.<br/><br/>In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie. It really doesn't have an all that complicated story to it but it still remains a well written movie, that flows well and barely has any misses or other weaknesses in it. It's a very consistent movie you could say, that doesn't ever goes overboard with anything and somehow manages to keep things fresh, interesting and funny, all throughout.<br/><br/>The movie really has some great and fun characters in it, which is also being one of the main reasons why this movie remains such a likable and fun one. It doesn't just center on the Ted character but also on the human character played by Mark Wahlberg. And this movie is finally being one in which Mark Wahlberg is playing a different and certainly also very likable character. Honestly, if you are a Mark Wahlberg hater you still might very well end up liking this movie and even Mark Wahlberg in his role.<br/><br/>The movie of course also works out well because Ted is being a convincing character in the movie. He really is a walking and talking teddy bear, that doesn't look fake in anyway. The movie uses some great effects for him!<br/><br/>No matter how bad or silly this movie might sound to you; just give it a shot! Changes really are that you will end up liking- or maybe even loving it.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","4","17","8 July 2012"," Family Guy: I love Boston
","If there is something I discovered opening day of Ted: do not underestimate Family Guy and American Dad fans. Seth MacFarlane has a bigger fan base than I thought, not to say I didn't know that he wasn't famous, just didn't realize how big he was. When I saw the trailer for Ted, I knew my fiancé would love this movie, he always tells me about what I missed on the new episode of Family Guy or American Dad or The Cleveland Show. I'm the average watcher of Family Guy, I'll watch a couple episodes that re-run on TBS at night, and of the three, I'll find one bad, one OK and one absolutely hilarious. In Ted, the jokes just keep coming at you, for every one that misses, the next one is a hit. This was made directly for the fans of MacFarlane's humor. After all, the poster does say ""from the creator of Family Guy"" and the cast is mostly a typical work day for MacFarlane. But over all, Ted does work as a comedy that I'm sure you could get a kick out of.<br/><br/>In 1985, in Boston, John Bennett is a lonely child who dearly wished for his new Christmas gift, a large teddy bear named Ted, to come to life to be his friend. That wish coincided with a falling star and Ted is brought to life. After John's parents got over the shock, word of the miracle spread and Ted was briefly a celebrity. Twenty-seven years later, John and Ted are still lazy but loving companions enjoying life even while John is pursuing a years-long relationship with a level-headed office worker, Lori. As their fourth anniversary of their relationship approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but she feels he can't move ahead with his life with Ted around, who has become a vulgar, obnoxious wastrel. John is resistant to making his lifelong companion leave, but he is finally persuaded that night to act when the couple discover Ted at home with four prostitutes. Ted is fine at first on his own, but still wants John to still party with him causing problems in his relationship once again.<br/><br/>Like the shows, there are some jokes that seem to go too far. I don't mind 9/11 jokes every once in a while, but MacFarlane just throws a few out there and some are a little too much. His relationship with Mark Wahlberg in the film is similar to the relationship between Peter and Brian on Family Guy. And sort of in the spirit of Kevin Smith, who is an obvious fan of Star Wars, MacFarlane is a fan of the 80's and is trying to bring a B-Movie back, Flash Gordon. However, I can't deny that I seriously did laugh quite a few times with this movie. We have a good comedic cast that works and one of the things I really appreciate on MacFarlane's part as a writer is that he didn't make Mila Kunis' character a one-note jerk girlfriend who everyone hates. You understand her character and even Mark Wahlberg's. Heck, he even makes Ted, a bear, very believable as a friend who is still stuck in the party mode in life and takes his best friend down with him. There are two villains in here, one is a large child and his dad who will DO ANYTHING to make him happy, almost like Silence of the Lambs style, this dad is just plain creepy. The effects for Ted were great and the story, despite being predictable, was still very decent. I got a few good laughs from it and would say that it is very much worth the watch. If you're the average viewer of the shows of MacFarlane, I think you'll like it too. If you're a die hard fan, there's no question that you're going to love Ted.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The story about a living teddy bear is nonsense, but his behavior and sayings are funny."
"zkonedog","10","1","2","7 March 2017"," Legitimizing The ""Family Guy"" Humor Set
","Because the ""Family Guy"" TV show has been on the air for over a decade now, there is an entire generation of comedy fans who have grown up with its raunchy, celebrity-bashing, voice-acting, frat-party style of humor. As such, a film like ""Ted"" can now wildly succeed in a contained theater format, and it does (in this case) with hilarious results.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ted"" sees young John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) giving life to his childhood teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) via a magical wish one long-ago Christmas night. Fast-forward about 26 years, however, and suddenly Ted is now a pot-smoking, wise- cracking, babe-chasing celebrity who keeps John from realizing his full potential. When girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into John's life, John must ultimately choose between her and Ted in order to figure out what his future will hold.<br/><br/>Quite obviously, this movie is made for the ""Family Guy set"". I mean, practically ever FG voice makes some kind of appearance here, and the jokes are of the same sort of crude/sexual/celebrity/juvenile nature. As such, I know a number of individuals who would walk out of the theater in disgust. For those who ""get it"", though, it is absolutely hilarious. I don't want to go into any details and ruin the fun of many of the film's best jokes, but suffice it to say that you'll never go more than a couple of minutes with a belly-laugh.<br/><br/>Besides the jokes, the acting is also tremendous. Kunis is fast becoming the ""Queen of the rom- com"" and turns in another great performance here, while Wahlberg is convincing as a sort of ""Peter Pan"" character who is in no hurry to grow up. MacFarlane's voice of Ted (in which can be heard all of Peter, Brian, & Stewie from FG fame) never gets old either.<br/><br/>Also, there is more to ""Ted"" than just comedy. It contains some impressive action sequences, as well as some character development and drama surpassing that which one would expect in movies that SHOULD showcase those things. This movie, despite the humor type, takes itself very seriously at its core and strives to provide more than just the laughs that one knows will exist coming in.<br/><br/>In essence, ""Ted"" is a sort of ""coming of age"" for Seth McFarlane's unique set of skills. Whereas he once was thrown off FOX's airwaves for being a little too crude, he can now make a movie about a pot-smoking, expletive-spewing teddy bear that leads its opening weekend at the box office. Why the switch? Because, after years of honing his comedic style, MacFarlane found the right mix of actors and tone to produce a movie that stands up well on its own merits."
"DJ_Shilo","8","1","2","8 June 2016"," When you wish for a Talking Teddy Bear
","I laughed my head off at Seth MacFarlane's new comedy ""Ted."" Seth is the guy who created a popular adult animated sitcom called ""Family Guy."" If you have seen the show, you know what you're getting into with this picture. Raunchy humor, gags, and a stoner Teddy Bear. Let me just say that, this film is not for kids at all. It's very adult and the concept of a talking teddy bear might be appealing to younger audiences but it's very much an adult film.<br/><br/>It's about a lonesome child, John Bennett, who makes a wish at Christmas time that his new teddy bear come to life and be his friend forever. The wish comes true and Ted comes to life. Word spreads the he is alive and he becomes a brief celebrity. Years go by and, John (Mark Wahlberg) is 35 years old and living a hedonistic life with Ted as his roommate. With his anniversary approaching, his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis), wants to marry John but fears if Ted is always around, he will never move forward. When Ted moves out on his own, a creepy dad takes a twisted interest in the bear and it's up to his old friend to save him from being bear-napped.<br/><br/>Seth makes his directorial debut with this film and If you've ever watched ""Family Guy,"" then you're aware of the raunchy humor and this picture is no different. Peter is the boozy slacker, Lois is the dirty wife, Meg is the dork, Chris is the dummy and Brian is the brainiac. Seth is able to create a family of characters that never seem to run out of steam. There is always a cutaway gag, a laugh or a joke that will make you howl. The show has been running for years now and it doesn't seem like it's going to die out anytime soon. ""Ted"" is the same as ""Family Guy."" It's funny enough to keep you entertained and it never runs out of steam. Ted's foul mouth is enough to make you laugh but the situations he finds himself in with John are hilarious.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart opens the film with an explicit narrative and we meet young John. He's the kid that nobody likes in the neighborhood and wishes for a friend. When his parents, Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein, who voices Lois from ""Family Guy,"" gives him the bear, he makes the wish under his sheets with a flashlight and the bear comes to life. Now the question I had is ""How is a talking Teddy bear going to be funny?"" I got my answer. Most of the laughs in the film comes from the bears dialogue. He's incredibly vulgar, he inhales vast amounts of weed from a bong and has a childhood hero in the form of Sam J. Jones from the 1980 film ""Flash Gordon."" He has a love for drugs and hookers and he offends everyone he comes in contact with. He ends up getting a job as a cashier at a local grocery store and has sex, somehow, with one of his co-workers, Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) in the back of the store on the produce.<br/><br/>It takes on the issue of staunch friendship in a hearted way. Ted and John, call themselves the ""Thunder Buddies."" and it has something to do with thunder and a fart. Mila Kunis is sweet as John's girlfriend but she is under-used. When Ted is forced to move out, the real challenge begins. John is always running off to spend time with Ted even though it will get him in trouble. ""How do you say away from your trouble-making best friend?"" There is a sequence where Ted is at a party with John and they dare Sam to punch through a wall to prove he is Flash Gordon. Sam Jones has become a party animal and breaks through the wall angering an Asian man with a knife in one hand and a duck in the other. I actually had to hold my stomach because I laughed so hard. The scene descends into chaos and you will have to watch it to see an amusing fight between Ted and the duck.<br/><br/>MacFarlane has given us a comedy we can finally laugh at but there's a subplot in the film involving a creepy father, Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) who wanted Ted when he was a kid. Now he has turned his sights on trying to get Ted for his spoiled chubby son, (Aedin Mincks). After all the jokes, it serves as the peril for the film. I supposed something has to happen in the end but it's basically a setup to give Ted a lot of time to poke fun at the chubby kid ""Oh, I hear the fat kid."" Even during a peril situation, MacFarlane manages to keep the steam going. I must say he is one of the most talented minds I have seen in a very long time. The film will presumably do well at the box office and you can bet there will be a ""Ted 2."" <br/><br/>This is one of the funnest movie of the year but It's clear to me that this film will be in the crosshairs of younger kids given that it's about a talking teddy bear but it's much more adult than ""Family Guy."" I must stress to parents that the film is very adult and a very R-rated movie. A lot of parents will see the poster and figure a talking teddy bear in a movie could be cute. No, take your kids to see anything but this and enjoy it for yourself."
"vchimpanzee","Null","1","2","21 March 2016"," Entertaining and funny, beginning and end show substance
","The first few scenes of this movie give the impression of a wholesome, family-friendly Christmas movie. Okay, except for the part about beating up a kid because he's Jewish, but that still might have been acceptable in some family movies. Patrick Stewart's narration, like pretty much everything he does, is magnificent.<br/><br/>Things change pretty quickly. I'm so glad I had the sanitized version aired on NBC, which I finally got around to watching yesterday.<br/><br/>Okay, sanitized isn't quite right. Broadcast TV still allows a lot of filth.<br/><br/>Still, I found the whole story quite entertaining, and a lot of it was funny.<br/><br/>And while this could easily be dismissed as garbage, the last 30 minutes or so gave this movie some substance. An exciting adventure and some touching moments, and giving Lori the chance to show how caring she is.<br/><br/>Lori is such a loving and patient girl, despite being so good-looking. Mila Kunis did a fine job. I mean for this type of material. This isn't ""Black Swan"" (actually, I have yet to see that).<br/><br/>John is an appealing enough character and very dedicated to his ""best friend"". I know Mark Wahlberg is capable of better, but he's good enough here.<br/><br/>Seth MacFarlane gives his usual great performance, with one exception. He sounds like Peter Griffin (and this is mentioned), but occasionally, and the first time he talks, he sounds like Brian Griffin.<br/><br/>Joel McHale showed considerably more talent on ""Community"", but he has a couple of good scenes here as Lori's sleazy boss, and he's especially good delivering just one great line.<br/><br/>I know Giovanni Ribisi is considered a respected actor, but I'm not sure what to say about him here. But without Donny and his son, this movie would have been missing some important scenes.<br/><br/>Bill Smitrovich as Ted's boss does a good job, and has a surprising attitude.<br/><br/>A cameo by Norah Jones shows her to be quite appealing, and of course I like her music.<br/><br/>The music is one of the best things about the movie. Walter Murphy does the 50s sitcom-style music for ""Family Guy"", and a lot of the music in this movie sounds similar. There is great music in fine restaurants and at Rex's party. There are exceptions: <br/><br/>1. The two versions of how John and Lori met.<br/><br/>2. When John leaves one party for another, and when he arrives at the second party.<br/><br/>3. Watching the TV series about Flash Gordon.<br/><br/>4. Donny dances to Tiffany.<br/><br/>Is this movie worth seeing? If you Seth MacFarlane's sitcoms, probably. And I do."

","If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane or a child of the 80's then you'll enjoy this. It's filled with pop culture references, crass comedy and fantastic cameos, Very funny (in a 'Family Guy' humour sort of way) and I definitely got my share of laughs.<br/><br/>Ted himself is well animated which adds to the magic, and despite finding his Peter Griffin voice initially distracting (loved that they addressed this) I totally fell for him and his bromance with Mark Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Wahlberg does a good job, he's perfect for the role as a Bostonian who as a child successfully wishes his teddy bear to life. 'John' gets more than he bargained for when the stuffed animal follows him into adulthood, complicating his relationship with (Mila Kunis). Now he has to choose between his girl or his friendship with the crude and extremely inappropriate Ted.<br/><br/>The plot here is nothing special, its familiar, I would even say cliché but it doesn't really matter because events are just so hilarious. On another note, I could definitely tell that Seth McFarlane is (my age) by the bits I found funny or ironic or nostalgic, like the Darth Vader case for all the action figures, Airplane re-enactment, Flash Gordon or Indiana Jones notes played on the stairs. 2/7/16"
"phubbs","6","1","2","30 November 2015"," Ted
","I don't get how some films (mainly comedy) at times seem to take an old actor/franchise and completely flaunt him/it like product placement. In this film for some reason Seth MacFarlane has used Sam L. Jones of 'Flash Gordon' fame in what seems to be some kind of agreement to try and reboot his career. Well that's how it comes across to me anyway, no other reason for him being there really. I'm guessing its in a typical 'Family Guy' style just to have random off the wall moments with cameos.<br/><br/>So Seth MacFarlane breaks into the movies with this 'Family Guy' orientated comedy. I say 'Family Guy' orientated because even though it has nothing to do with FG the main character of Ted sounds just like Brian and Peter from FG (yes I know that's how MacFarlane sounds in reality), he wrote it with FG writers, plus he utilizes FG voice actress Mila Kunis also, so its home from home in a way.<br/><br/>I expected this to be totally downright funny and hilariously filthy, it was but not as much as I hoped for. Yes there are some grand bits of dialog that sound so cynical and sharp with MacFarlane's well spoken tones but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>Even the swearing isn't as cool as you would think. At first you think its gonna be awesome to finally here Peter and Brian Griffin use bad profanity but it wains fast. At first its highly effective but as time passes the novelty where's off. Its like a sexy sultry woman dressed in a tight skimpy revealing outfit, its amazingly hot and never fails to keep you excited. Then you see the same woman completely naked...straight away she no longer becomes as hot because all the mystery is gone, she's right there in the buff with nothing left to hide.<br/><br/>So in other words when we see Family Guy without swearing its actually more effective than if it had swearing, because it makes you use your imagination and I think comes across funnier. It works for this film (at times) I'm just saying hearing MacFarlane swear wasn't as funny as I thought it would be (can anyone beat Cartman in those stakes?). Hope you all get what I'm saying.<br/><br/>As for the rest its kinda average really, nothing much happens in the film until the finale which does get a whole lot better. Kudos to Giovanni Ribisi with his excellent Norman Bates style father character, easily the best thing to watch towards the end. The sequence where he is dancing in front of the TV to Tiffany is creepy as fudge plus hilarious at the same time...yet I'm not sure why, I think it was the pelvic moves.<br/><br/>There are a few weirdly eerie moments in the film, probably down to the fact its based around a living teddy bear. The point where Ted fights Wahlberg is kinda creepy in a disturbing horror type way. I reckon its suppose to be a take on the sequences in 'Family Guy' where Peter fights that large chicken character (seems to use the same sound effects too). Was it suppose to be funny?! Seeing Ted having sex, being with hookers and dating hot women is also rather odd, why would a real woman wanna go out with a teddy bear?? Yes its a fantasy film but really?<br/><br/>Other than that it does satisfy to a degree, its just not as good as it could of been methinks. Ending was sweet but totally predictable lame fluff, Wahlberg was miscast in my opinion (the guy can't act, why does no one see this?!) and clearly MacFarlane has a 'Flash Gordon' fetish. He stuck Sam Jones in there why again? (looks good for his age though, can't deny that).<br/><br/>Sorry for comparing 'Family Guy' to this so much, hard not to really...oh and for typing it a a lot too.<br/><br/>6/10"
"anime68593","6","1","2","3 February 2015"," A little disappointed
"," When I heard Seth MacFarlane, the baby-faced genius behind TV's most hilarious sitcom, ""Family Guy,"" was planning his feature-film debut, I was totally thrilled. I was even more excited to learn the plot would revolve around a foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear magically brought to life via his owner's childhood wish. And when I discovered Mark Wahlberg and ""Family Guy"" regular Mila Kunis were signing on to star, I began eagerly counting the days until it premiered. And when the film finally arrived, my patience is rewarded with ... a gross-out comedy from the guy responsible for creating history's funniest animated series? Yes, there are moments when MacFarlane's clever side intercedes, and those bits are great, especially his biting digs at washed-up child stars and Taylor Lautner. But for the most part, he and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Weld go for the cheap and lazy, like poop-and-fart jokes, and walk-ons by the likes of Tom Skerritt, Norah Jones, Ryan Reynolds and Flash Gordon himself, Sam J. Jones, that serve no purpose beyond providing a knowing wink and nudge to MacFarlane's hippest fans."
"Gerardrobertson61","4","1","2","5 April 2014"," Not as good as expected
","This wasn't quite the movie that I expected, I was actually disappointed with this movie, and gave up watching it after an hour. I didn't find it all that funny. It appeared to be a rip-off of Wilfred the Australian TV comedy, and to be honest, Wilfred was a lot funnier.<br/><br/>Ted was a pot smoking swearing bear, Wilfred was a pot smoking swearing dog, sound familiar. The storyline was very predicable and I found the whole movie crass and offensive. There didn't seem much to the storyline and unlike Family Guy which I have always enjoyed, Ted was a movie that I was basically disappointed in. The movie started off with potential and I thought, this looks promising, but once we went into John's life some 30 years later and discovered he now had a pot smoking swearing Teddy Bear running his life, it all went down hill from their on. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people with dia-agree with me, and that is fair enough, but for Seth Mc Farlane's Ted was very disappointing."

","The movie is comedy/fantasy. Still it is highly un-recommended for children because of lots of profane comedy phrases. Seth Mc Farlane, 'family guy' guy stole the acting (for Ted character) show. Yet his direction falls short, imo. I give my stars for the music department and the songs were cool. Parts of the movie were boring and few jokes were offensive (like beating a Jewish kid and blaming Indians for 9/11). The animation department worked well with Ted's animation. The emotions/ sentiments were ultra-reduced, which actually spoiled the movie's soul (i.e.. there wasn't even a full emotional scene between main characters that lasted over a minute). The movie was totally unexpected from Mc Farlane. I expected less vulgar, less boring and decent comedy."
"mukava991","Null","1","2","17 February 2013"," silly, ridiculous, sometimes funny
","The multi talented Seth MacFarlane has created a silly, ridiculous and sometimes funny comedy about a boy whose teddy bear magically comes to life, talking and acting like a human being (courtesy of MacFarlane's own voice-over) and remains his best friend through the years. MacFarlane's script deftly explains that, yes, a teddy bear come to life would become a media sensation, but like all media sensations quickly enough wears out his welcome with the public and reaches the point where nobody cares any more (like, we are told, the cast of the TV sitcom ""Diff'rent Strokes""). A premise which in other hands might have been turned into cute whimsy, becomes in MacFarlane's hands a gag-ridden hybrid of buddy movie and romantic comedy, half adolescent toilet humor, one quarter post-baby-boom pop cultural references and the remainder divided between wacky Preston Sturges-like eruptions of comic chaos and clever, jabbing satire on human foibles from the point of view of the jaded white middle-class. Some of the dialogue soars.<br/><br/>The male lead is played by Mark Wahlberg, who in recent years has chosen to pump his pecs and biceps to the point where he jiggles when he runs down a flight of stairs. His girlfriend is the sultry beauty Mila Kunis who can really act. Many laughs are generated by a strong supporting cast including Joel McHale as Kunis's arrogant boss and especially Giovanni Ribisi in a highly inventive characterization as a creepy father who, with his overweight pre-teen son, are obsessed with the title character.<br/><br/>MacFarlane's TV show, ""Family Guy,"" has always been good for a few laughs and this movie continues the tradition on the big screen."
"goldenboy2011","7","1","2","2 February 2013"," A Fantasy Comedy, for laugh a lot. Not for realistic people.
","The movie in general is a piffle for laugh a lot; so don't expect a super-production. Just think of the director of this movie, wasting his time, doing this prank, and you will laugh a lot. It's not the best comedy out there but is very funny.<br/><br/>But take in mind that this is not a comedy for realistic people. If you expect to see a movie about our real world, this is NOT for you. In that case, I recommend you something like ""Bridesmaids (2011)"".<br/><br/>Ted is hilarious, is fantastic. Although, the whole movie is a prank, it's a big joke for people who doesn't has anything to do, trust me. But it depends on your personality, if you laugh or not. If you have this kind of humor sense, and a piffle can entertain you for a while, then you will laugh for a good while.<br/><br/>I would give it a better rate, if the movie would have had a better end. I didn't like the end, seriously.<br/><br/>I'm waiting for Ted 2, and I hope that would be for a wider public. Although, I'm sure that Ted 2 would be a very anticipated movie, because Ted let a lot to talk about it."
"wanderleg","6","1","2","24 January 2013"," A mixed bag
","To me, Ted wasn't as good as it could have been, and, given Seth MacFarlane's irreverent sense of humor, was nowhere near as funny as it should have been. I really like Family Guy and, for the most part, American Dad. I agree with his basic premise that there's humor in just about anything. I also have no problem with shock or gross-out humor, as long as it's intrinsically funny.<br/><br/>The trouble with Ted is that it relies too much on strictly shock and gross-out alone. Too much of it has nothing funny about it. A cute, fuzzy teddy bear with a foul mouth is only funny for a short time, if there's nothing humorous about what he's saying. That's the case too often here.<br/><br/>A few of the cameos were funny, some were okay, the rest were stupid. The Flash Gordon thing was carried to a boring extreme, especially the party.<br/><br/>Wahlberg was miscast. His brother Donnie is ten times the better actor. Kunis sparkled in a few places, but was mostly flat (no pun intended). I usually like her a lot. I didn't see much chemistry between her and Wahlberg.<br/><br/>I gave this 6 stars, because I enjoyed it - up to a point - but I do want to underline its flaws. It's a long way from perfect. I tend to attribute it, at least in part, to the co-writers, who may have been aping Macfarlane's style, but couldn't match his humor.<br/><br/>It's worth watching. The teddy bear animation is excellent!"
"stephen-scott83","5","1","2","16 January 2013"," Original! Profane!
","Ted is an interesting comedy - to say the least. The concept is fresh and there are some very funny moments but my overview review is ""eh"" or 5. I really like the first hour or so, but I thought the movie ran out of steam in the end and tried to hard to be funny when the bizarre father- son duo kidnapped Ted. I was VERY offended at the incredibly insensitive and downright nasty comment about the Virginia Tech massacre - that had NO place in the movie - or ANY movie.How could anyone try to find any humor in that - what the hell were they thinking??? This movie is NOT for anyone under 18! The movie could have been so much better - more scenes like Ted crashing the car into the rental ( very, very, very funny!! ) and the banter that went along with it - would have raised this to comedy cult status."
"alinafin101","6","1","2","10 January 2013"," Disappointing
","You'd think that a fan of Family Guy and American Dad! would find this right up their alley. You'd think that someone who admires Seth and thinks he is utterly talented would enjoy his movie. The answer is NO! In fact, the only reason this is not getting below a 4 rating is due to these two factors - i.e. 2 extra points the movie really didn't deserve. The jokes are classic Seth and Family Guy. But what works in 22 minutes and in a cartoon manner of cutaways and scenes with no consequences doesn't work for 90 minutes in a movie. To try and make all of this work they had to make main characters stoners. The female lead puts up with this garbage for four years. And the wicked Giovanni Ribisi doesn't nearly get enough airtime to salvage this mess. The end simply. Just. Dragged. Yeah. Stick with short bursts of comedy Seth."
"ihopetherespudding","6","1","2","30 December 2012"," Seth Macfarlane fans will enjoy this one
","If you like watching Family Guy,American Dad!, The Cleveland Show or anything else to come out of the mind of Seth Macfarlane or at least have an idea of the type of humour he uses,then you're going to have a good time. If not, you still probably will have a good time. Much like The Hangover, Ted's humour tends to rely on heavy innuendos, alcohol, drugs and swearing. But does that make it a bad movie? My personal opinion is no,it doesn't make it that bad a movie. Considering the fact that it's Seth's first attempt at a live action feature length,it is a pretty good movie. The humour can get a bit crude and the language can get a bit much but I'd say it's at least worth a viewing."
"rockiwi","6","1","2","26 December 2012"," Fine, but don't expect anything remarkable
","I watched this movie a few months ago. I had high expectations, though. But I feel that it's not much to tell about it. Nothing more than a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>I cannot deny that the idea it's interesting. Most of the jokes were fine, it had some humour in it. But something was missing. No, I wasn't looking for depth. But maybe for better humour- better than sexual and drugs jokes. It was fine, but nothing special, compared to everyone's hype. There are far better comedies than this- but if you don't take it seriously and don't have high expectations, it's perfect for a Friday night with friends."
"cgkull","6","1","2","21 December 2012"," Review of Ted
","I admit, I went into this movie with very high expectations because I love Seth MacFarlane and his ability to bring non-humans a human-like quality has proved to be comedic genius in the past. However, this movie fell short of what I had hoped it would be. <br/><br/>The character of Ted, and the story of how he came to be living and accepted in the normal world was intricate and enticing, but it's Mark Wahlberg that really brought the movie back a few notches. With most raunchy comedies (Pineapple Express, Hangover, Superbad), even if the main character is a total screw up, he is lovable to where you are rooting for him to succeed eventually. This movie made me resent Wahlberg's character to the point where I believed he deserved all the trouble he'd gotten into and hoped he never got out. His delivery of most lines were cheesy aside from the quick draw of female names from the trailer. <br/><br/>In fact, if it weren't for Mila Kunis as the saving grace, I would probably want my money back. Granted, Ted has some laugh out loud moments and adds some shock value as only MacFarlane can possess, but the overall picture lacked the staying power of what a true comedy movie should embody. <br/><br/>I might watch this again down the road, but it is not near the first movie I would grab when I need a laugh on a random afternoon."
"cougarfan-bridger","4","1","2","11 December 2012"," Great Story
","When I watched Ted, I went into it expecting a hilarious film. I have to say I am a little disappointed. Wahlberg and Macfarland were both outstanding and hilarious, although many of the jokes fell short of expectations. What surprised me though was the story. A story right out of a picture book, I felt a real emotional connection to the character, something that is rare in hard R comedies. I love the character development, and the interactions between characters are outstanding. Like I said earlier though, not near as funny as I had hoped. I laughed at a few parts, and there were a few clever cracks, but nothing near as funny as the Hangovers or Wahlberg's previous comedy, The Other Guys. When you see it, don't expect to be rolling on the floor, but it's an enjoyable film, worth seeing once."
"bennyhagen","Null","1","2","10 December 2012"," Okay, but slim
","Ted is an okay movie. Some of the jokes are really hilarious and in a peculiarly intelligent manner. Seth McFarlane's humor is really one of a kind and his easy approach towards movie-making is something that is worth appreciating. He's just consequently himself without all the BS and that's very refreshing. Ted has a few downsides though. Some of it only got clear to me a few hours after seeing the movie and realizing how kind of forgettable the whole thing is. This might be due to the fact that the script is not particularly rich in content. Compressing character development into feature film length might be unfamiliar territory for McFarlane and most of the characters are pretty slim, with the female lead appearing particularly one dimensional. Joel McHale's character and the promising antagonists of the movie fall unfairly short too and the movie really could have used a lot more work on them. This is especially frustrating seeing so much empty space throughout the movie just screaming for ideas to be inserted and one gets the feeling that McFarlane just didn't really try too hard all together, kind of disrespecting his devoted fanbase. Also, the moral standpoint of the movie was a bit unclear to me and could have been worked out more. I'm not saying that it couldn't have done without one, but if you do have a position and you center a whole plot around it, please make it at least a clear one. Also McFarlane is not a professional director. Considering that, he does an OK job, but it's really not Spielberg.<br/><br/>All together, Ted is not a bad movie by any means and it's kind of lovely, with a lot of good jokes. It's just a bit slim, especially for it's premise.<br/><br/>For the same concept Simon Pegg/Nick Frost vehicle Paul comes to mind as a much more profound movie.<br/><br/>5/10"
"rolanda_woo","2","1","2","2 December 2012"," Fairly rude jokes/behavior, hardly enjoyed
","We gave this movie a try mainly because of the high rating as a comedy.<br/><br/>I laughed only for about 3 minutes in the beginning. Buy when I figured out this Teddy bear is all about dirty jokes and rude languages/behavior, I could hardly stand it anymore. Walked away half way leaving my husband to watch it alone (don't think he enjoyed just he could stand it a bit more).<br/><br/>If a comedy is all about entertain people with dirty/nasty jokes, especially an object associated with children (teddy bear), I would say it's fairly low class and lack of imagination.<br/><br/>Personal opinion. No offense to those who enjoyed it."
"nilshenry","6","1","2","21 October 2012"," Have seen it all before
","I did not finish this movie, because I had approximately the same urge to see how this ended as I have to see whether the sun will get up in the mornings (and I don't live that far north).<br/><br/>In this review, I am going to try to predict what happens. If someone considers this as a spoiler (e.g. someone who has never seen a movie before in his/her life), don't read on after this.<br/><br/>First of all: The beginning was kind of original, and created hopes that this movie is something quite different. But then it started going downhill.<br/><br/>I turned off the movie during the 4-year anniversary dinner between John and his girlfriend. So far, I had seen how she pretends to be happy with her relationship, but that she probably feels that he is immature and doesn't have a good career. Also, her successful boss is always trying to get her to start a family with him.<br/><br/>Now, my guess is: She will probably leave John because she feels the relationship is going nowhere, and John will blame his teddy-bear Ted. So he will leave Ted in hope that this will bring his girlfriend back to him. But he has gotten it all wrong! It wasn't Ted who was the problem in the first place, but just the fact that John apparently didn't thrive for anything more in his life! The girlfriend realises that John has misunderstood, and at the same time, she also realises that her boss is actually not a nice person at all. And so the three of them get back together in the end and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Am I right?"
"TommyT-444-828415","6","1","2","8 August 2012"," Started off with a BANG, and ended with a fizzle. I blame the writers.
","We are starving for comedy, but the powers that be just don't have the mind set to really understand comedy or how to read and approve a comedic script for production. The moment a simple rated R comedy is thrown at us we scramble to the theaters for a desperate attempt to receive something as simple as laughter.<br/><br/>Yes, Ted is funny! The premise is very funny. I was wondering how they were going to pull of the talking bear and make it acceptable in terms of reality and they did a great job. Getting passed the one hurdle of accepting Ted as ""real"" was the only hurdle they had to jump over. The rest should've been all gravy, but it only if they had a SCRIPT.<br/><br/>The movie started off with a fantastic bang! Funny, smart, original, I was sitting there loving this film. They created the ultimate tool, Ted, the talking dirty bear that could say anything, do anything, insult everyone and be loved by all. Wow! What an amazing character. They even surrounded the ultimate device with some inane and almost boring performances, to make sure Ted was the star of the show... and yes, he is the STAR of Ted. So, with all that power and control, what did they do with Ted? Well, they made him say a few dirty jokes in the first 30 to 40 minutes and kept the audience very entertained. His humor was fantastic and his quick lines punched the audience in the stomach over and over again. Then, what did they do with this great talking bear? NOTHING. The movie begins to focus on a poorly over written bit on Flash Gordon, and a sorry empty headed relationship between the two human leads.<br/><br/>WHY?? Why did they move their attention away from the comedy and Ted, and focus on a mediocre love story and a ridiculous car chase that turned the entire brilliant film into something that Johah Hill would've starred in? Like so many films, the writers run out of steam and don't follow thru with what they have started. They assume the could do anything they want because they know they ""gotcha"" with the first 40 mins, so it doesn't matter what happens to the rest of the film. After sitting there after an hour I wanted my money back. It's almost like a ""bait and switch"" where they tease you with the best jokes in the trailer, you buy the ticket and then get ripped off by a film that was never finished.<br/><br/>Why did the ruin what could've been a break thru in comedy? 30 minutes of comedy does not make a feature comedy film.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't walk out on Ted was because I loved sitting there and looking at Mila's close ups. Her eyes pushed me thru this film. Believe me, if Mila wasn't in this film, the last 45 minutes would've been the most boring and inane piece of crap you'd ever seen in a theater.<br/><br/>Shame on the writers for giving up and not finishing what they started. Just because you are brilliant in the beginning, doesn't mean you have the right to give up. The audience isn't stupid. Cutting corners only damages your own product.<br/><br/>I'm assuming we will see a Ted 2 and I hope that one focuses on the ultimate voice of anger, comedy and reason, which the cinema has not seen in years, and not some dumb ass side story about an inane couple.<br/><br/>Ted you are as funny as you are incredible. I just hope your writers do you justice next time."

There's also Mila Kunis (voice of Meg Griffin), Patrick Warburton (the voice of Joe) and some great cameos from people like Ryan Reynolds, Tom Skerrit and Sam Jones (the guy who plays Flash Gordon in the 1980s movie). Ted tells the story of how an unpopular young boy, John Bennett (who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), made a wish on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes true and Ted becomes a famous celebrity who even appears on TV talk shows. Fast-forward to the present day when, a still immature, John Bennett shares his apartment with Ted and his girlfriend of four years, Lori (Mila Kunis). Unsurprisingly, the three-cornered relationship becomes a little strained, with Lori eventually giving John an ultimatum.....""it's either me or the bear"". Story-wise, there are no surprises in this film and I found it all pretty predictable. But this can be excused because it's a laugh a minute.

","Sometimes you know you are going to hate a movie the minute it starts. When TED started, those were my feelings. The movie starts with a fairy tale kind-of narration of a boy's wish which makes his teddy bear come to life, Ted. By this time I was sure I was going to hate this movie.<br/><br/>Teddy Bears usually have an image of being cute cuddly and something that you relate to kids. This movie changes that image in a humorous way. In the next scene the teddy and the boy (John) are all grown up. Both have a mature adult voice, they smoke pod, they talk dirty and still live together. There is something hilarious about a 'Teddy Bear' swearing on the big screen. <br/><br/>The movie is all about how the friendship of John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (Teddy bear) comes between John's love life. John and Ted have a great bond and are awesome together, and so is the pair of John and his girl-friend Lori (Mila Kunis). John finds it hard to let go of either of them and ends up fighting with Ted and kicking him out of his apartment. <br/><br/>What I liked about the movie was the imagination of bringing a bear to life and changing the role of him from just being a kid's play toy. Ted is hilariously funny and his friendship with John is naturally entertaining. Also the chemistry between John and Lori is very charming and real. You will definitely enjoy these two as much you enjoy the other two.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Don't miss Ted; he will make you Laugh your AO! But be sure to not take your kids with you, this is *not* a kids movie."

But it isn't all penis jokes and swearing, there's a lot of light-hearted humour in there too, and plenty of pop culture references and parodies (the Flash Gordon scenes are hilarious).<br/><br/>But, despite it being McFarlane and co's debut feature film, the writing and characterisation are very good, certainly better than any other comedy this year. In fact, even the emotional stuff is pretty powerful and you feel a lot for the characters.<br/><br/>Haters will hate and nitpick all they want, but 'Ted' is hands-down the comedy of the summer, the kind of feel-good comedy with unexpected, hilarious jokes flying from everywhere and just making you want to smile. It's beautiful.<br/><br/>See if you liked: Family Guy (series), American Dad (series), Paul (2011), Superbad (2007)"

","Ted is Seth MacFarlene's directional debut and stars him. It was also written by him. Ted is the story of John Bennet who, when he's young, makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life, when he does, they become best friends and do everything together. Now, 24 years on, their friendship is tested when John's girlfriend Lori asks more from their relationship and the only way to get more is to remove Ted from their life. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film. Seth MacFarlane is hilarious and I love his TV shows. So I was really excited for this. And I wasn't disappointed. It had a lot of funny parts and a few very funny parts. As much as I enjoyed it, it didn't meet expectation. Maybe I thought it was going to be a 10/10 or something, I don't know. But I still enjoyed it and it was very funny.<br/><br/>I am delighted this is rated so highly and also the amount of money it made, because, basically it's a defiant thing that there will be more films to come from Seth and I am really looking forward to them. I really liked this film.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint it's this. There is a few swing and miss jokes. But otherwise it's a very funny film, with good acting, a gateway to more Seth films and A LOT of 80's film references, also, there is a few heartfelt moments and it really adds to the story.<br/><br/>It feels like Family Guy, but it's actually a lot different. But some of the jokes are in the same humor. So, if you like Seth, you'll like this. If you like good comedy films, you can't go far wrong with this either. Because out of all the comedy films released in the last few years, this is up there most defiantly."

","I loved this movie, just excellent all the way through. I have already heard from many people that they thought it was awful BUT THEY GOT NO SENSE OF HUMOR. <br/><br/>I have to say Ted, is one of the funniest animated characters ever. Mark Walhberg suits the role of his character in this movie extremely well, and Mila Kunis what else can you say other then SUPER GORGEOUS! <br/><br/>The movie has continuous laughs by the audience and mind me, I have watched it 3 times and the audience and myself still find every funny quote and actions funny (besides those people who have no sense of humor).<br/><br/>Considering I have already watched it 3 times and I work at the cinemas i still tend to watch as much as I can and still have a good laugh even though i can predict exactly what happens.<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH MOVIE. <br/><br/>Not recommended for peoples under the age of 15 (EVEN WITH PARENTAL GUIDANCE)due to high use of illicit drugs throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I give this one a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>ENJOY!"
"timvance123","9","2","7","22 July 2012"," The number one comedy in recent memory!!!!!
","Let me start this review by saying if you have not seen Ted please go ASAP. Do not wait for the DVD release. This movie is hilarious. The critics worst fear is that the movie will not make sense because a main character is a teddy bear. Well the chemistry between the bear and Marks character is electrifying. Unlike most comedies that just have a few funny scenes, Ted is funny from first scene to the last. DO not pay almost ten dollars for a bad movie. My biggest pet peeve is wasting ten dollars and two hours of my life for a disappointing movie. Ted is not a family movie, however it will keep you laughing from beginning to end."
"HelenMary","7","2","7","21 July 2012"," if children's films grew up - in a word, hilarious!
","In a word, hilarious. Saw this courtesy of work pal at a free screening, and really enjoyed it. Seth MacFarlane was the voice of the bear and brought his own brand of irreverent close to the bone bawdy and profane humour to the shana punim of Ted. Laugh out loud, this is primarily a boy's film (what's the male version of chick flick? actually don't answer that...) with lots of 80s and 90s references, and despite the teddy bear not at all suitable for children. My husband and I seemed to be the only ones in the cinema apparently to get the paraphrase of ""Stay Gold Ponyboy"" but the rest were generally appreciated. A terrifyingly genius turn by Giovanni Ribisi with a Tiffany obsession (""I think we're alone now"") gave the film a dark twist and there were loads of other cameo type appearances Patrick Warburton and uncredited Ryan Reynolds playing scarily believable gay couple, Patrick Stewart as narrator and Norah Jones, Tom Skerritt and Flash Gordon, Sam J Jones. Shockingly gross at times, but also with a good deal of heart to make the fantasy (superb SFX) of the living toy relevant, with a surprisingly welcome Hollywood ending that wasn't too schloky. Wahlberg and Kunis were cute and the acting by Wahlberg opposite Ted was brilliant- especially the fight scene. Watch it and weep, with laughter!!"
"mberker4-382-984374","7","2","7","20 July 2012"," Almost as funny as family guy itself
","just saw it last evening and enjoyed it as much as I though i would. even the scenes similar to family guy are still funny like the scene where mark whalberg is trying to guess TED's girlfriends name similar to stewie and Brian scene. I especially liked the ending and the beginning where there are references to some other child stars/actor. Every family guy should go and see and if there is another movie I am sure it will also be enjoyable. Mila Kunis is as likable as ever. I also like when they reference to where she is originally from. Some cameo kind of appearances with reference to family guy are also superbly done and not over the top."
"zardoz-13","8","2","7","15 July 2012"," Funny But Offense Farce About A Potty-Mouthed, Pot-Puffing Teddy Bear
","The crude but clever Mark Wahlberg comedy ""Ted"" resembles something you'd expect from Adam Sandler. Cretinous heroes, gross out humor, wanton drug abuse, and offensive profanity constitute the primary elements of this witty satire. Indeed, this far-fetched, off-beat, politically incorrect farce is the last thing you would expect from a mainstream actor who specializes in straightforward action thrillers. While it doesn't qualify as the kind of movie Wahlberg typically makes, ""Ted"" is precisely what you might expect from cheeky ""Family Guy"" creator Sean MacFarlane who penned the outrageous script with ""Family Guy"" co-scribes Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. This amusing but brazen, 115-minute nonsense veers from bromance to romance with our hero caught between his pot-smoking, potty-mouthed teddy bear and his drop-dead gorgeous brunette girlfriend. Aside from its impudent title character, ""Ted"" doesn't look like a run-of-the-mill summer movie with its $50-million budget about a walking, talking teddy who delivers the best lines. Not only do Wahlberg and Mila Kunis hold their own against the cuddly CGI hero, but also this unusual threesome generates tangible charisma. Wahlberg and Kunis make their relationship with the eponymous character appear believable even though we know they were not interacting spontaneously with Ted as they do in the finished film. Moreover, MacFarlane and his writers keep things breezing along in this contentious relationship that generates suspense about whether our hero and heroine will survive as a couple. One thing is unmistakable; ""Ted"" has nothing comparable to compete with in the genre of supernatural characters. The closest thing to ""Ted"" might be the extraterrestrial comedy ""Paul"" about an E.T. type alien who lands on Earth and befriends two British tourists in the American Southwest. Some critics have compared ""Ted"" to the Mel Gibson movie ""The Beaver,"" about a depressed, suicidal fellow who wears the puppet of a beaver on one arm and becomes its pawn.<br/><br/>Basically, Wahlberg plays a physically grown-up but mentally immature adult who has put his life on hold to raise hell with his party-animal teddy bear. What sets ""Ted"" apart from other comedies is the unconditional love that a 35-year old loser shares with his childhood plush toy. Our hero leads a sheltered life as a youth in a town just outside of Boston. The neighborhood kids refused to play with John Bennett. When eight-year old John interrupts several kids in the middle of beating up a Jewish boy, all of them—including the victimized Jewish child—send him packing without a qualm. Since he had no friends, John makes a wish on Christmas Eve in 1985 that his teddy would be his best friend. Little does John know that when he made his wish that a falling star plunged from the night skies. Miraculously, John's wish is granted, and the teddy bear talks to him the next morning. Overnight Ted turns into a national media sensation. At one point, he appears as a guest on the Johnny Carson late night talk show. Ted enjoys his fifteen minutes of fame before he resumes living life as usual with John. Eventually, John has reaches a turning point with his long suffering girlfriend, Lori Collins (Mila Kunis of ""The Book of Eli"") who urges John to kick Ted out so they can have a life alone. Evicting Ted proves to be virtually impossible for our hero. Surprisingly, Ted makes the transition from staying with John to landing a job in a supermarket as a check-out clerk and getting an apartment of his own. Nevertheless, although he has given Ted the boot, poor John cannot resist Ted's invitation to visit him daily. Everything isn't fun and games for Ted and company when a creepy admirer, Donnie (Giovanni Ribisi of ""Contraband"") and his weird son Robert (Aedin Mincks of ""Faster"") show up and try to buy him for John. These two characters are obnoxious and their appearance ushers in a grim and unsavory air of reality to the action.<br/><br/>Rookie writer and director Seth MacFarlane has forged the funniest cinematic character in a long time with the wise-cracking, title character. Ted looks cute, but he is rude, crude, and lewd. He curses like a sailor, smokes a bong like a chimney, and likes to date prostitutes. ""Ted"" qualifies as an unforgettably funny, live-action/CG-animated comedy. Happily, the ""Ted"" character is seamlessly integrated into the action, and his shenanigans are consistently hilarious. Whether he is driving his best friend to work with extensions so his short legs can reach the brake and the gas pedals or performing T.J. Hooker leaps from the rear of a station wagon to the hood of our heroine's car, Ted looks as life-like as a CGI character can. The motel room fistfight that he has with John where he pummels him into submission and his amorous stockroom assignation with a sexy cashier emphasizes Ted's rowdy as well as randy antics.<br/><br/>While teddy bears have been fodder for children's movies over the years, ""Ted"" is nothing like ""Winnie the Pooh."" When MacFarlane isn't having fun with Ted and company, he appropriates a cult science fiction film and integrates it as an essential element of this whacky fantasy. Ted and John grew up watching the movie ""Flash Gordon"" (1980) with Sam J. Jones and have enshrined it. However, MacFarlane isn't content merely to insert excerpts from the film. Since both Ted and John worship Sam J. Jones, the ""Flash Gordon"" star winds up making a cameo for two rip-roaring scenes. MacFarlane borrows a mocking scene or two from the spoof masterpiece ""Airplane"" when our hero meets the heroine on the dance floor of a 2008 disco and mimics the movements of John Travolta's ""Saturday Night Fever"" romance. Patrick Warburton of the ""Rules of Engagement"" television series and ""Green Lantern"" lead Ryan Reynolds have a scene where they play two gay guys who kiss.<br/><br/>""Ted"" is never tedious and will tickle your funny bone."

","A comedy, fantasy for an eight year old boy's powerful Christmas wish bring life to a large teddy bear which becomes a lifelong companion into adult hood to a thirty five year old man. Not all teddy bears are sweet, purity, cuteness as this one contains a vile mouth for excessive profanity, drug use (no signs of addiction) and sexual contents. As an avid teddy bear lover, I could not resist but to see Ted.<br/><br/>The CG graphics for Ted is not accurate as all teddy bears do NOT have eyebrows for a stuffed animal!! They do not have thumbs either for that matter, which even BBC's ""Misery Bear"" is truly a teddy bear depicted on screen. I just wonder how Ted secured his employment at a supermarket without proper identification papers (no Social Security, no identification card). Also when Lori was sewing Ted, in a panic to revive him, why did she not sew his whole body as it was not shown his back but only his front? She also never sewn Ted's left ear intact as it was forcefully removed by Robert, the stalker's son. The father and son stalkers originate a broken family who do not treat personal property with great care as a teddy bear.<br/><br/>The scene where Ted drives John to work with his feet attached to stilts to reach the brake petals, which is so funny. He's too short to see thus he plows the surrounding parked cars. It personally broke my heart to see Ted ripped in half and all his stuffing fallen on Fenway Park's lawn.<br/><br/>All in all, Ted the movie ends with a sweet ending as I did shed several tears. I'm happy Lori finally accepts Ted (as is) as part of her life with John. Because best friends are worth it."

From the beginning to the end of the film I couldn't hold in my laughs. It was packed with extremely funny jokes and scenes (IMO). If you like Family Guy and it's humour, you HAVE to watch this movie, it was absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>I have a bad trend of seeing many low grade comedian movies with pathetic jokes *cough cough Jack and Jill*. However, once again, this movie was just amazing. Maybe I'm just immature but this movie just cracked me up continuously throughout the film.

"jordangross","8","2","7","3 July 2012"," Live action Family Guy!
","This is the closest thing you are going to get to a real life Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show, writes and directs one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time. I am so glad that this movie did not disappoint me because it was one of my most hyped films for 2012.<br/><br/>This movie stars Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), Mila Kunis (That's 70 Show, Black Swan), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad), Joel McHale (The Soup, Community), and Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan).<br/><br/>When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) receives a Teddy Bear (Seth MacFarlane) for Christmas when he was little, he makes a wish for it to come to life. So of course, it does come to life. They grow up through the years together as best friends and still are smoking weed, getting drunk, and going no where in life. John has been in a 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis) and Ted keeps getting John to do stupid things that cause Lori and him to fight. Lori has had it with Ted and tells John it is her or the Bear.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was very well written and very funny. Seth MacFarlane always loves to push his jokes out further and as a result it adds to making the movie non stop funny from start to finish. The Ted character that Seth MacFarlane has created is so great, that I believe Ted can turn into a franchise. I highly recommend seeing this film as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review, any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
"Chris_Pandolfi","8","3","13","29 June 2012"," The Story of a Man and His Bear
","Going into ""Ted,"" I fully expected a raunchy comedy. What I wasn't at all expecting was a very sweet, very compelling coming of age story, one that convincingly examines themes of friendship, loyalty, and love. In the best possible sense, this movie completely threw me for a loop. It marks the directorial debut of ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane, who clearly has a sick sense of humor but also has a lot of heart and isn't afraid to show it. Yes, you will see a teddy bear smoking from a bong, drinking beer, swearing like a sailor, and squirting hand lotion on his face to simulate a pornographic money shot, but you will also see a buddy story, a romance, a climactic battle to the finish on a Fenway Park light tower, and ultimately, a happy ending. That MacFarlane somehow balances all this is nothing short of astonishing.<br/><br/>Taking place in Boston, the story begins in 1985, when a lonely eight- year-old boy named John Bennett (Mitch Haggins) makes a wish that his Christmas gift, a teddy bear he named Ted, would come to life and gain the ability to talk. Thanks to a shooting star, his wish is granted, and Ted and John make a pact that they will be best friends forever. Word of the miracle quickly spreads, and for a brief time, Ted becomes a celebrity. During the opening credits, we see a montage that shows Ted and John growing up, all the while staying inseparable, just as they promised they would. We finally arrive at the present day, when a now thirty-five-year-old John (Mark Wahlberg) is about to celebrate his four-year anniversary with his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis), a successful office worker.<br/><br/>Although he has found love, John and Ted (a computer generated character voiced by MacFarlane) still live together and have adopted a somewhat hedonistic lifestyle, getting by almost entirely on pot and a deep love of the 1980 film ""Flash Gordon."" Ted is essentially a slacker, and John isn't too far behind; he barely makes due working at a low-end car rental office, and he's frequently late and will often make excuses to get out of work early. Lori understands that John and Ted have a special bond, but she also knows that John will never fully mature so long as Ted is living with them. It doesn't help that Ted has become foulmouthed, obnoxious, and incredibly vulgar; it comes to a head when he freely invites a group of prostitutes up to their apartment and lets one defecate on the floor. She wants him to move out.<br/><br/>John complies, albeit begrudgingly, and helps Ted move into an apartment above a Chinese restaurant. This requires Ted to get a job as a cashier at a grocery store; strangely enough, all attempts to get himself intentionally get fired result in promotions. This sets up the final act, during which: (1) John and Lori will break up over the former's lack of judgment; (2) Lori will be pursued by her rich, handsome, and conniving boss, Rex (Joel McHale), a man so clueless that not even continuous rejection can faze him; (3) Ted and John will have a falling out, resulting in a brutal hotel room brawl; and (4) Ted will be kidnapped by an obsessed fan (Giovanni Ribisi), who desperately wants to please his bratty overweight son. Sam J. Jones will also make an appearance, as will Patrick Warburton, Ryan Reynolds, and Tom Skerritt.<br/><br/>One of the best decisions MacFarlane made was to not dwell on the miraculous nature of Ted sentience. Like the Muppets, he's assumed by the general public to be real and is not made an object of wonder or ridicule. I think that accounts for why audiences can see and respond to his friendship with John; not only does what they share feel completely genuine, we're actually made to care about them both. In a lesser comedy, the filmmakers would regard a friendship between a grown man and a taking teddy bear superficially; there would be no heart, only inane jokes. In this case, MacFarlane understands that touching, meaningful subtexts can indeed lurk beneath a sea of unremitting crudeness. Without that sense of drama, I seriously doubt the film would work as well as it did.<br/><br/>Learning to finally grow up is another ever-present theme, one that could have easily been choked out by meaningless toilet humor but is instead examined with wit and intelligence. It isn't so much about a manchild weaning himself off of his childhood possession; it's more about finding those healthy relationship boundaries and maintaining an emotional balance. Of all the lessons this movie could have taught me, this was the absolute last I expected. ""Ted"" is one of the best summer blockbuster surprises of recent memory â€“ a crass comedy that can make you laugh while at the same time tug at your heartstrings. I honestly didn't know such a thing was possible, given the failure of most previous attempts. If you need an example, look no further than the wretched ""That's My Boy,"" which is no more a father/son bonding story than I am a rocket scientist.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"Darkknight951","10","3","13","29 June 2012"," My take on the truly dirtiest Teddy bear movie you'll ever see in your life
","Ted was absolutely breathtaking and the funniest movie I've seen in years the story was great and Seth macfarlane just has a touch for comedy that few actors/directors have in Hollywood today the jokes were funny the fight scene was the best part of the movie the full fight the trailer is great showing the fight and all but it does it no justice the movie is so much better with the fight and it's just funny as hell and even flash Gordon himself Sam Jones gets in on the fun and it's just a he'll of a ride throughout but what it's mostly about is a 35 year old man growing up and being responsible in his life their is a tragic scene at the end of the film that kids would tear up at but the ending is funny as hell I just can't give it away but this is a film for adults I mean it's just downright surprising and funny when Ted nails one of his co workers and gets promoted and mila kunis and mark walhberg have such great chemistry that can't possibly be ignored there's not much romance in the film but just enough especially a scene where mark walhberg sings in a scene. But all and all this is a great film don't let haters keep you away from it sure it's not for everyone kids cough it has some vulgar language in it but not a ridiculous amount I really hope they give this a sequel or let Seth Mcfarlane direct another film because he's great at it and deserves to have a long career in Hollywood dark knight 951 out."

","One has to wonder that it is quite hard to make a truly funny ""conventional"" comedy movie, so how on earth can a non-animated movie about a walking-talking teddy bear succeed? This stuff works fairly well for a certain kind of audience when it's animated as director MacFarlane's ""The Family Guy"" has shown, but with live performances, and no animation, one would think the pitfalls to be insurmountable. That said, the fact ""Ted"" succeeds in an even more mainstream way than MacFarlane's previous productions is a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The movie is rich in satire and detail (the kind in which you'll catch additional humorous connections with second and third viewings), but has a real beating heart underneath the veneer of its unique combination of raunchy humor and political incorrectness (most will likely be at least somewhat offended at some point) - which is pure MacFarlane! The jokes are continuous and the wit is sharp enough to blot out the occasional dead-spots. Beyond the writing though it would still likely be impossible to achieve such a level of success if it were not for the cast. Simply put, the cast is uniformly excellent â€“ like an ensemble with great chemistry. Plus, outside of the outrageous Ted there's the great device of the Patrick Stewart narration which treats the story as if it is a heart string pulling Disney family movie â€“ until it veers into the profane, but laughable.<br/><br/>Ted is even more over-the top than you'd expect in a come-to-life hard partying 30-something slacker teddy bear. Ted is actually a sweetheart underneath the smart-ass exterior. How the directors managed to make Ted look as real as the actors is for lack of a better description, amazing. Playing out the love story sub-plot, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis certainly have that special something commonly called on-screen chemistry. They have to make it work because they are a couple that is simply meant to be and the viewer feels something for them. Add the fantastic characters they're surrounded by and the sum total is movie that manages to combine ribald humor with heartwarming story telling in the most unconventional sense. This movie blazes its own totally unique path. If you like comedies and are not easily offended it is an easy recommendation because it is certainly the best comedy of 2012. Plus, nice seeing Tom Skerrit back...He, he!"

","When a little boy wishes his teddy bear could actually talk to him, he wakes up the next morning to see his wish come true. Best friends/thunder buddies for life they say. Flash forward 25 years or so and now that little boy is Mark Walhberg and that teddy is Seth McFarlane. Mila Kunis is Walhberg's girlfriend and when things get out of control says it's either going to be her or the bear.<br/><br/>I know that going into this film that it was going to be 90 minutes of Family Guy jokes and that's a pretty accurate description. So if you love Family Guy style humour, you'll really enjoy this. I think Family Guy 'use' to be funny and ever since it came back from cancellation, it's been stale. Ted, manages to be both. A lot of the jokes misfire and a lot of them hit. I have to give McFarlane credit though, he only used one flashback gag.<br/><br/>Family Guy is notorious for having jokes about random celebrities and you either get it or you don't. That's the same with Ted. A Brandon Routh joke and numerous Tom Skeritt jokes get no laughs, but plenty of others do. McFarlane, a fan of the 80's, plants numerous 80's jokes here. Flash Gordon being a big one. I found myself laughing more times than not, but when a joke falls flat, boy does it ever. <br/><br/>Ted gives McFarlane more room for crude humour. There's plenty of cursing in this film. A bear that swears is funny for a short while, but when the film tries to get a laugh out of him simply standing there and saying the F-word, then you know it's stretching. Sex, drugs and language fill this film, so it's certainly not for kids, even if the young ones do watch Family Guy. This is McFalane's first venture into the film world and it shows. He has no cinematic eye and doesn't know when to leave a scene. The end result is a wash.<br/><br/>Many of McFarlane's friends and co-workers show up here. Mila Kunis, if the most obvious one, she has a starring role, but the supporting cast is basically a who's who of McFalane's shows. Patrick Warburton, Patrick Stewart, Alex Borstein and Ralph Garman just to name a few. Friends helping out friends I guess. Joel McHale plays Mila Kunis' jerk boss who always makes advances at her, that subplot literally goes nowhere. Finally Giovanni Ribisi amps up the creep factor and takes the story in a totally different direction in the third act.<br/><br/>In the end, Ted is a funny film. The best way for me to recommend it is based on Seth McFarlane's comedy. He wrote, produced, directed and voices Ted. It's got his mark all over it. If you like his comedy and television shows, Ted will be a laugh riot. If not, I would probably say avoid it."

","Everyone knows when you enter the world of Seth MacFarlane that it's fun and his work is a joy to watch. As his concepts bring out the kid in you as his fairy tales remind you of your childhood he likes to showcase that dreams do come true! With this work rightfully titled ""Ted"" it shows that a fairy tale film can be a heck of a lot of fun especially when it's blended with funny brash and outspoken talk, and in the meantime it tells a touching story of love and friendship! ""Ted"" is a tale about a childhood wish that came true for a young boy John Bennett who after receiving a teddy bear one Christmas wishes it would talk and magically it comes to life! As John(Mark Wahlberg)grows up into an adult Ted is right by his side living the party life and worshiping ""Flash Gordon"". Now at 35 John has a love triangle his lady friend the cute and more job successful Lori(Mila Kunis)wants John to grow up and end his attachment to Ted. However friendship and your love and memories and promises from childhood never change as this is one little fur bear that a grown man's love will not run from! Overall this film even though it has such a fairy tale theme is one feel good watch it's funny and brash while it teaches a good message about friendship and love proving accept everyone for who they are and live together happy ever after! And the concept is so clever and adorable of a talking teddy bear growing up with a boy into manhood!"

","Being an avid Bearophile of many years, my wife and I went to watch this movie after only having seen a short promo clip on the TV 'Sunrise' show earlier the same day. What a ripper! It's got the lot - comedy (lots off), romance, violence, bad language, car chases, high drama, drug use, prostitutes, homosexuals and of course, a teddy bear. Who needs more? As long as you're not some 'born again' who can't tolerate bad language but want to be taken back to a time when a trip to the movies meant pure escapism, then this is the movie for you. I LOL'd at this one, something I haven't done at movies for a long time. The animation of the bear is superb, so good in fact that you don't sit there thinking ""Gee, these guys with computers are really clever"" - This bear is real - Go see it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","25","3 July 2012"," Terrific Comedy with Non-Stop Laughs
","Ted (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Hilarious comedy about a friendless young boy who wishes that his teddy bear would come to life, which he does but as an adult, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) finds his relationship with his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) on the rocks because he can't settle down and quit partying with Ted the bear. Seth MacFarlane's comedy, as you could tell from the trailer and its R-rating, is raunchy, dirty, profane and at times downright insane but any film could do this. What TED does is that it not only delivers on the laughs but it also has a tremendous heart and I think this is what really separates it from the countless R-rated comedies that are being released each year. There's no question that not every joke works but I'd say the overwhelming majority of them hit the spot and deliver much more than your highest expectations could hope for. There are some hilarious jokes about various dory things from STAR WARS to FLASH GORDON but the stuff dealing with Gordon give some of the biggest laughs of any comedy in recent years. The jokes with Sam J. Jones and the party sequence are downright hilarious and the events that happen with the neighbor had tears rolling down my face. I won't spoil what happens but the entire sequence is one major joke after another. One of the keys for this film working is its heart but a lot of this comes from Wahlberg who delivers another very good performance. It's rather amazing being able to see how Wahlberg's career has developed over the years and I really don't think anyone could have said when he started that he would still be acting and still delivering high performances. His tough guy image is certainly put on the line here and he's such a good sport with countless childish jokes that you can't help respect him for putting that image on the line. Kunis is also good in her supporting role and she has some nice chemistry with the lead. Then there's MacFarlane who really delivers with the voice of Ted. The comic timing is pitch perfect and really delivers. Even better is the animated Ted character who always seems like something real and not just some CGI creation. TED scores on pretty much all levels and it's clearly one of the best comedies in recent years."

","I saw Ted expecting a raunchy, crude, mean-spirited black comedy. Yes it can be raunchy and crude at times, but this movie couldn't be further from mean-spirited. This movie, although adult-oriented and not child friendly (to say the least), is actually big-hearted, and uplifting. It tells the story of a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear named Ted. But since he is 35 years old now, his relationship with Ted is interfering with his relationship with his girlfriend. It's laugh-out-loud funny (I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh this much) and yet still is able to tell a great story of love and friendship. It's too bad this couldn't have been dialed back a bit to appeal to a younger crowd, but that probably would have taken something away from this gem of a movie. Highly recommended. 10/10"

","After creating the brilliant 'Family Guy', the hit- and- miss 'American Dad!, and then the horrendous 'The Cleveland Show', creator Seth MacFarlane brings his off- colour, surreal sense of humour with the wonderful 'Ted'.<br/><br/>I'm just going to come out and say it, this wasn't as funny as 'Team America: World Police', but it was funny in it's own right, some of the jokes worked very well and I did laugh at them, some other jokes just seemed too 'Family Guy', and even were actually in the show. The story was very good and I followed it well, it was actually a very well paced story for a comedy like this. Another good thing about the film is that it didn't try to be overly vulgar, from what I remember there was only maybe 2 dirty jokes and situations, but I'll let you find them yourself. When the novelty of a talking, junkie, foul- mouthed teddy bear wears off, and the crude jokes, of course, the film is very heart- felt with a nice story about relationships and friendship and when it's a good time to grow up.<br/><br/>The performances were ALL done well, with Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett stealing the show (even if he shares scenes with Ted, the REAL highlight), he is funny, charming and acts very dramatically for when it's needed. Mila Kunis as Lori Collins was probably one of the weak points of the movie, but that doesn't mean that she didn't deliver a good performance. Giovanni Ribisi was hilarious as creepy dad, Donny and has a very funny but small dance scene that I loved, he had a lot of funny lines. His son, Robert (played by Aeden Mincks) was equally as funny, but just wasn't as funny as Donny. Joel McHale was the king of hateful characters in this film as Lori's perverted boss, Rex, throughout his scenes you really despise his character and wish that Mark Wahlberg would punch him in the face or something, and I'm glad that he was a hateful character because it balances the film and story arc out. Patrick Stewart, Matt Walsh and Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) are thrown in as small characters, but add a lot to the film. Finally, Seth MacFarlane's performance as pint- sized Ted was very funny and believable, too. He looked real and blended in with the scenery, and I don't know what everybody else was talking about, he did NOT sound like Peter Griffin.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film, and advise anybody with a sense of humour to go see it! <br/><br/>'TED' <br/><br/>Directed by: Seth MacFarlane <br/><br/>Written by: Seth MacFarlane, Alec Sulking & Wellesley Wild <br/><br/>Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, Patrick Warburton, Matt Walsh & Patrick Stewart"

","Even though Ted is a Seth MacFarlane movie, I was hesitant to see it. A thirty year old guy who lives with his foul mouthed teddy bear?! I was expecting another Paul, but MacFarlane isn't British, and THIS film was hysterical. Ted is a raunchy real life living teddy bear, who combines the traits of every MacFarlane character. It was pretty awesome, sometimes you saw him as Peter, other times Brian, and so on. The real surprise of this film was Mark Wahlberg. I can't remember ever seeing him in a comedy and I wasn't sure his rather dry personality would work with MacFarlane's brand of humor, but he fit in like he's been doing this for years. I mean he was Marky Mark, he must have some personality in there somewhere! As for the story, it's not much different than a really good episode of Family Guy. Of course, it a lot more raunchy and it's not animated, but there are certainly many parallels, and defiantly some hysterical lines. It's not the kind of film I usually go for, at points, it's more than a little stupid, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I laughed my butt off throughout the film."

","Getting Patrick Stewart to narrate a movie that starts off like a kid's fair tale is perfect way to start this. In a way this is like a grown up version of those Shrek Ogre movies. That is the main frame of reference I can come up with, but even then this movie breaks that mold too. Some of the elements are in place to make it like live action Shrek, but it is so much more adult.<br/><br/>Sam J Jones reprises his Flash Gordon role in this movie. While he received a Razzy for being so terrible in that one, here he threatens the Academy with a nomination for best supporting actor. Mark Walberg is Johnny who wishes his teddy bear to life and gets his wish. He gets Mila Kunis as his girlfriend and love of his life. Along with the bear, these together are the ultimate male fantasy.<br/><br/>Ted, the bear, voiced by Seth who wrote the script, makes no effort to do a different voice from Peter Griffin. That's OK though because hey, in a way this is a different story line but has a lot of the same characters in a different situation.<br/><br/>I envy Ted the bear. Can't figure out how a Teddy Bear would really get stoned, but hey with the dream life he has of nothing but parties and work promotions I have to envy anyone who can get a raise and promotion at work in this economy.<br/><br/>Getting the women he gets makes it even more of a dream. Ted, your sort of the ultimate bear life as you do much better at getting women then Yogi ever did at getting picnic baskets.<br/><br/>Yes, you need to put your brain into entertainment mode. Still this movie has Mila Kunis looking all great and not playing a real bitch which is a women's role much over done in movies today. Here she is the introspective beauty with the golden heart and the child's sense of humor.<br/><br/>What surprised me here, pleasantly, is that in spite of all the adult themes, it doesn't show as much skin as you might expect. Wonder if they are saving that for the Uncensored DVD? With the good looking women in this, that could make this the hottest selling DVD ever.<br/><br/>This movie successfully bridges the gap from fractured fairy tale to crazy while crossing a few lines Seth has never crossed before. Years from now there will be an entire generation of adults who will be so glad those lines got crossed.<br/><br/>Happy 100th Birthday to Universal Studios whose logo is on this film. Thank you for putting out pure entertainment for 100 years, this film continues that tradition."

","John Bennett gets a giant teddy bear for Christmas when he's about 10. He wishes it will be his best friend for life. The next day the bear magically comes to life and can walk and talk and promises to always be John's best friend. Cut to 25 years later. John (Mark Wahlberg) lives with his hot girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and Ted (voice of Seth MacFarlane) is living with them. Lori makes an ultimatum--Ted or her. John picks her--but can him and Ted live without each other? Funny and not as crude as you might think. This is being pushed as a comedy with a foul-mouthed teddy bear. Granted--Ted makes crude, racist, homophobic and sexist jokes but not that many. He's comes off as a funny and sweet bear (I can't believe I just typed that!). In many ways this is (story-wise) very familiar. It has a guy in love with a girl but his best buddy is always around. She makes him choose. He picks her. The best friend leaves. Tragedy strikes etc etc. It's very obvious how this will all end. Still I did laugh long and loud more than once.<br/><br/>There are constant reference to one of my favorite movies--the 1980 version of ""Flash Gordon""--John and Ted love it too! They take scenes and music from the movie and Sam J. Jones (Flash) pops up also.! As I said before most of the jokes are offensive but VERY funny. This was shot in Boston and I've never seen Boston look so GREAT on the big screen! They perfectly use the locations. Also Kunis is great (and very beautiful) in her role. Wahlberg is no more than adequate but it works. Also look for cameos from Ryan Reynolds (he doesn't have a word of dialogue) and Tom Skerritt! And Ted is just adorable and VERY likable (even when he's swearing a blue streak). Predictable but funny. I give it a 7."

Add to all of that the unnecessary over the top vulgarity and I cannot recommend this movie in any regard."
"sarandivyam","9","1","3","28 March 2020"," Ted both parts review by Divyam Saran.
","All things considered, a few motion pictures are with the end goal that they are adored by crowds of each age gathering. The film about which I am going to discuss today falls under that class, Ted and Ted 2.
The film rotates around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who during his youth days, on the event of Christmas Eve wanted that his teddy springs up and it works out as expected. This film at that point manages the further existence of John as a grown-up, how Ted turns into a necessary piece of his life and how he influences his own life.
This film, as I would see it, doesn't exhaust you and holds you till the end. It is pressed with amusement, sentiment, and some exciting activity as well. Although there are some scenes unsuitable for children, for example, when John and Ted smoke together or there might be some private minutes among Ted and his sweetheart, which gives this film an ""A"" rating yet at the same time I see this film as extremely engaging.
The initial segment, Ted (2012), rotates around the life of John Bennett, his relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) and how Ted unfavourably influences their relationship.
The subsequent part, Ted (2015), managed the life of Ted and his relationship with his better half Lynn (Jessica Barth). Right now, the film, Ted likewise faces a personality emergency as the American Government will not consider Ted as a typical individual.
Seth MacFarlane has offered a voice to Ted and has likewise coordinated the establishment. His course is excellent remembering that it is his presentation directorial adventure. The screenplay and the story were additionally generally excellent.
And if I say something about dialogues then they are very well written. Be it be dialogues of Ted too and the dialogue delivery is also really very entertaining and impressive.
This was not the first occasion when I saw a film of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis cooperating. Separately just as together this pair unquestionably functions admirably. I prior saw them in the film Max Payne (2008), where Mark assumes the title job and Mila assumes the job of Mona Sax. I truly regard these individuals as entertainers a great deal.
Seeing a delicate toy come into life is a different encounter for me and I imagine that it would engage all of you as well. Although the film has become very old I think it has not lost its engaging variable.
There are many things which we can learn from every movie and that is the case here too but I would state only one thing which I found out to be the most important. It is based on the priorities set by an individual in his or her life. Priorities are dynamic; they never remain fixed. John should have realized the same point. He should have felt that since he is in his 30s or 40s, Ted should not be his prime priority now. I know Ted is his best friend and they are so-called 'thunder buddies' of each other but they can maintain it but now through a certain distance. He did not realize so which adversely affected his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins and which (though temporarily) spoilt his relationship with Ted, but that's not always the case in real life. Relations in today's world are very tender and need to be taken care of and for that right steps and the right time needs to be taken place to maintain every relation and lead a balanced life.
By and large, these two movies, as I would like to think, merit watching work."
"beegalindo","8","1","3","20 February 2020"," If you are an adult male watching movie with one or more of same, it's hilarious!
","I've been a fan of Seth McFarlane's animated comedy shows as a great, end of the day escape, turn off the brain and laugh at how silly we are when we try to take ourselves too seriously. As a middle-age, middle-class American man, the humor and even cultural references hit my funny bone.
Ted has some similar hooks, like the self-deprecating, lovable loser ""head of household""- John Bennett in Ted, although not yet married with kids, is a bit like Peter Griffin in Family Guy or Stan Smith in American Dad. John's quirky friendship with his childhood teddy bear Ted, who has magically come to life, is funny by nature much like the Griffins with their dog Brian in Family Guy, or the Smiths and their ""pets"" (or hostages) Roger the alien and Claus the fish in American Dad. Rather than these ""pets"" being simply cute and innocent, they cuss, have sex, and sometimes seriously screw with the lives of their owners.
McFarlane must have realized A cute stuffed animal can get away with saying things or doing things that would seem disturbed, vulgar, or prejudiced if done by a person, and McFarlane gets a lot of mileage out of that setup!
After Ted gets a job at the grocery store, there is a hilarious progression with Ted talking back to his boss and (literally) screwing around while on the clock, and it results in his boss promoting him. There is satire throughout the movie on how the characters relate to their work, and the power relationship between bosses and workers. Lori and John's bosses have inflated view of the social status bestowed on them via their job title, not realizing no one else takes them seriously. John needs to get serious about work and can't conceive that maybe hanging out with his teddy bear and getting high might be screwing up his life!
Meanwhile Ted could care less about work, but gets away with everything and even get promoted.
Another funny scene is when John and Lori come back from a nice dinner and Ted is partying in the apartment with a group of prostitutes, as Ted sits on the couch surrounded by these scantily-clad women he says something like, ""somewhere there is a group of horrible, deadbeat fathers out there I'd like to thank for giving me this night with you girls."" This little sociological insight is actually kind of sad, but it comes across as hilarious when spoken by this cute little teddy bear.
Beneath the surface of funny lines and sight gags there is this layer of comedy about social class and conflict, dead-end jobs, relationships, and even sociopathic over-indulgent parenting.
Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis both gave solid performances, also want to mention Jessica Barth in perhaps the best performance in the movie as Ted's girlfriend Tami-Lynn."

","Ted,a film by Seth MacFarlane , is a adult comedy that required a parental guidance
There is really only one joke in ""Ted"" - a toy bear comes to life and turns out to have a filthy mouth and a taste for weed - but the movie's attempts at humor can nonetheless be sorted into a few distinct categories. There are jokes that are funny only because a stuffed bear says them, jokes that are not funny even though a stuffed bear says them and jokes that may or may not be funny because of Mark Wahlberg. Mila Kunis is also in the movie, but she can't be funny because she's a girl, and her job is to be amused, tolerant and pretty.<br/><br/>Tolerant amusement is pretty much the best this harmless little picture, directed by Seth MacFarlane from a script he wrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is able to manage, even though it strives for obnoxious hilarity. The cleverly animated ursine title character, voiced in an exaggerated Boston bray by Mr. MacFarlane himself, is a fire hose of vulgarity, ethnic insult, homophobia and misogyny. In the modern, meta manner he (that is, Mr. MacFarlane) wants both to indulge and to deny the offensiveness of this material, to wallow in ugliness and make fun of it too. It's a wasted effort though. The sin of ""Ted"" is not that it is offensive but that it is boring, lazy and wildly unoriginal. If Triumph the Insult Comic Dog ever got a hold of Ted, there would be nothing left but a pile of fluff and a few scraps of fur.

","As the result of a childhood Christmas wish, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) has been best friends with his walking, talking, very-much-alive teddy bear Ted (Seth MacFarlane) for the past twenty seven years; together, they hang out and enjoy the finer things in life, like quality weed and repeat viewings of camp sci-fi classic Flash Gordon. Things look set to change, however, when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Mila Kunis), suggests that the time has come for her boyfriend to become a more responsible person and for Ted to finally find a place of his own.<br/><br/>With Ted, writer/director/performer Seth MacFarlane has made one of the few films to star Mark Wahlberg that I actually like (the others being Fear and Boogie Nights). Of course, my enjoyment of Ted has very little do with its leading man, but a lot to do with MacFarlane's laugh-out-loud, unapologetically politically-incorrect script, his confident direction and hilarious voice-over work. It doesn't hurt either that the film features the lovely Mila Kunis as John's love interest, a brilliant self-mocking cameo from none other than Flash Gordon himself, Mr Sam Jones, and top-notch special effects that ensure that the film titular character is someone (something?) you can really care about.<br/><br/>7.5/10, happily rounded up to 8 for having Ted beat the crap out of Wahlberg."

","So, why don't I find a movie about a perverted teddy bear to be funny? Hmm, let me see... maybe it's because I don't find crude humor funny, I find crude humor to be immature and trashy. Maybe it's because I think Seth MacFarlane is a loser who got rich only because other losers love him. Maybe Ted is just a terrible and pathetic movie that tries to be funny but just ends up playing out like a Jim Henson puppet show thrown in a blender with a pornographic VHS tape. The whole movie was full of swearing, pervy sex jokes and toilet humor. What the hell? You'd think that people would have more common sense and not be such morons. That's what happens when somebody who makes nasty cartoons like Family Guy gets the chance to make a feature film. I don't know, maybe I sound like a prude, or maybe I'm offending all the crude humor fans out there, but I honestly don't care. I think this kind of thing is incredibly dumb and I think it's pathetic that this movie has such high ratings over better movies that came out this year. Sinister came out in 2012 and it was amazing, but its rating is currently lower than Ted's ratings. Society is degrading, and to make matters worse this load of crud is having a sequel made."
"Stompgal_87","7","1","3","10 May 2014"," A decent comedy that quickly goes from cute to irreverent
","I remember this film being promoted two years ago and in the television advertisement for this, I liked the line, ""My bad! I was sending a Tweet,"" which for me is one of the funniest and most memorable lines in this film. One of my housemates rented out this film in the same year it was released but I only watched about the first fifteen minutes of it at that time. More recently I rented it myself and when I watched it the whole way through, I was slightly more satisfied despite the film dragging on from the middle and it was also a little overlong.<br/><br/>For a start, Ted was well-animated and comically voiced by Seth MacFarlane who brought us 'Family Guy.' Speaking of which, the irreverent dialogue in this would appeal to fans of the said animated sitcom and Ted's mention of Peter Griffin was a cracking fourth-wall joke and pop culture reference rolled into one. Other pop culture references I noticed were to other films distributed by Universal such as E.T. and Jurassic Park and I figured that they could pay homage to Universal's centenary in 2012. Back to 'Ted,' the titular character's animation was one of the best assets of the production values as were the cinematography and some beautiful uses of scenery, particularly John's snowy childhood neighbourhood (plus also the lens flare effect over it) and the park. While the incidental music was pretty grand for the film's genre, the music accompanying Ted falling down after having been torn in half was simple yet suitably chilling and dramatic. I also liked the song played over the opening credits as well as the use of the Flash Gordon theme, Norah Jones's ' Come Away with Me' that she briefly performed live and Tiffany's 'I Think We're Alone Now.' Both Joneses (Sam from Flash Gordon and Norah) were surprising additions to the cast and what surprised me even more was Norah's dialogue since I never saw her to speak in a tongue-in-cheek way but Sam's appearance was more worthy, especially when he demonstrated his Flash Gordon actions. With regard to the leading human characters, the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis may have been typical rom-com cliché but their bonding with Ted has made this chemistry somewhat new. The narration from Patrick Stewart was engaging and almost as irreverent as the film itself.<br/><br/>Overall 'Ted' is a worthwhile comedy that has its cheeky moments but funny ones too, albeit its sluggish pacing and long running time. 7.5/10."

Long, hard and often. It starts as some kind of stupid run-of-the-mill Disney output, but beautifully deteriorates into one of the funniest goodie bags of bad language and down right hilarious one-liners I have laid my hands on for as long as I can remember. It's as predictable as a calendar, but taken for what it is: a comedy classic."
"Cat-Wings","5","1","3","11 March 2013"," Not bad but Not good.
","Here's my review about a film called, ""Ted.""<br/><br/>It was a nice story overall, but it's not as entertaining if you were a parent looking for something to recommend their kids to watch. The story starts off with a boy named John who has no friends and is given a teddy bear on Christmas Eve by his parents. The boy wishes that the stuffed bear could speak like a human, and the next morning, the wish comes true. Over twenty years later, John is 35-year-old and has a girlfriend Lori with whom he has had a four year relationship. The teddy bear is still with him and has grown into a ""guy"" who likes parties and smokes weeds. As Ted always causes trouble in John and Lori's relationship, John asks Ted to leave his house and starts his own life.<br/><br/>Problem with Ted's new life still drag John in. A bad parent tries to steal Ted to be his child's toy, and the relationship between John and Lori nearly breaks because of Ted, and so on. The story gets a little serious towards the end.<br/><br/>As I said, the story itself wasn't so bad. But it's not something I would expect because there was a lot of talk about weed and cocaine at parties, swearing and discrimination. Yet it supports a gay couple, which makes me wonder if the film is trying to gain a wider audience."

","Ask yourself who thinks potty humor is great? Think of the stuff you avoid reading on bathroom walls. The type of humor juveniles think is funny about abusing women, sex, drugs, and lots of curse words. If you are still wanting to see Ted, go ahead watch it or rent it.<br/><br/>Now that you watched it, if you replace the ""magic teddy bear"" with a pal or even an adopted brother, is this movie still funny to you? I didn't find this an amusing movie at all. In fact, my friend rented it and I was under the assumption it was made for ""little kids"" under 12. Boy was I wrong. I am so glad I wasn't the father who dumped his kids off to go see the magic talking bear, movie while I went shopping in the mall.<br/><br/>OK why I gave this movie the 3 stars it truly deserves is the on screen actors. It is nothing to stand in the studio and read lines for voice overs and spout off bad jokes. But there was some talent at work for all the actors who had to sit and talk to an invisible bear and make it look real. I have no issues with Seth MacFarlane, writer/director of this crap, who will continue writing turds like this on TV. He is the voice of Ted and other voices on his adult cartoon shows. This man has been degrading the value of TV for the past decade since I was a child."

","Have you ever had a friend who held you back? Someone who encouraged you to blow off your responsibilities and abuse drugs? What if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be? What would you do?<br/><br/>John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.<br/><br/>Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film. Not particularly intelligent, mind you, but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star? Shakespeare? I won't say it's perfect; it isn't. I will say it was worth the price. See it."
"tomgillespie2002","4","1","3","22 November 2012"," Disappointingly lazy experience
","It was only a matter of time before Seth MacFarlane, creator of ""it's like that time when we..."" cartoon sitcom Family Guy and the vastly superior American Dad! got a shot at the movies. After all, Family Guy spends most of its time playing homage to, referencing or mocking the movies, while at the same time stealing most of its ideas from them. Clearly an avid viewer of popcorn cinema (as well as the musicals), MacFarlane reverts back to the 1980's with Ted, when buddy-cop action- comedies ruled for a prolific yet short period of time. Only rather than, say, a loose-cannon white cop and a buttoned-up black cop, here we have a pot-head man-child and his wise-cracking teddy bear best friend.<br/><br/>Young outcast John Bennett has trouble making friends, and after being bought a giant teddy bear for Christmas, he wishes for his new friend Ted to be his friend forever. The magic of Christmas (or something) grants his wish, and he wakes the next morning to find Ted alive and speaking. He becomes a national celebrity, only twenty-seven years later, John (Mark Wahlberg) is stuck in a monotonous job while Ted (voice by MacFarlane, sounding like Peter Griffin) has become a beer- swilling, bong-toking layabout. They are still best of friends, and John is happy in a relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), only Ted's behaviour goes too far one night when he brings back a party of hookers, one of whom s***s on the floor, that leads to Lori growing increasingly impatient with John's childish attitude.<br/><br/>If there's one good thing that can be said about Seth MacFarlane, is that he knows how to write buddy moments. Stewie and Brian's Road To... episodes in Family Guy prove some of the series' headlights, playing on the bizarre and unconventional aspects of their relationship, bringing originality to the tired idea of a mismatched duo that care for each other deep down. It also manages to show a warmer side to his generally unpleasant (yet often funny) sense of humour, and this is one of Ted's strengths. John and Ted's interactions tend to be warm and amusing, as they share their love of pot, beer and Flash Gordon (1980), that brings the best out of Wahlberg's underrated subtle comedic talent (something was best displayed in I Heart Huckabees (2004)).<br/><br/>Yet the familiar story of a romance getting in the way of a bromance provides no originality, especially in terms of set-pieces. It resorts to a lazy car-chase finale that wraps up a rather silly sub-plot involving Giovanni Ribisi's creepy Donny abducting Ted to give to his even creepier son, that lacks anything resembling imagination or inspiration. Another sub-plot includes Lori being hit on by her generic rich-boy boss Rex (Joel McHale), a character that looks as if he's walked straight out of Family Guy. It's all just a rather disappointing lazy experience, given MacFarlane's obvious knowledge of his medium, and really only has one memorable moment that involves John meeting Flash Gordon himself, Sam J. Jones. The rest is a mish-mash of crude humour that works less favourably on screen than it does in a cartoon, spouted by the frequently annoying Ted who is nothing more than a more obnoxious Peter Griffin. Kunis is sweet and likable as ever though, and Wahlberg's likability plus a (disappointingly minuscule) appearance from Patrick Warburton provide some warmth.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"paul_haakonsen","6","1","3","9 November 2012"," A teddy bear with an attitude...
","Initially I had expected a bit more from ""Ted"" in the sense that the movie didn't really cause me to have all that many laughs throughout the entire feature. Sure, there were some great moments here and there, but they were far apart.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, because ""Ted"" is not a bad movie, far from it. It is actually a quite good movie. It has a nice storyline that will appeal to both a younger and a more mature audience. Plus it really helps that the CGI animation of Ted himself was really amazing. All throughout the movie, he was real and life-like, which was really important to make a movie like this work.<br/><br/>Plus they had also cast some good people to fill out the roles for the various roles in the movie, and Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis actually had some good on-screen chemistry and that worked out quite nicely. But again, the animation of Ted and his entire personality was really the fuel that made the movie run so well. And it was also nice to see Ryan Reynolds make a small appearance in that role as he did. And it was also nice to see Sam J. Jones in the movie. I don't actually think I've seen him since ""Flash Gordon"", at least not that I can recall.<br/><br/>For a comedy, then ""Ted"" really didn't fully deliver the goods. The story was solid, good and well executed, but it just lacked that one-step-beyond comedy that would have made the movie explosive. Personally, I had to look far for the laughters in the movie. I was thoroughly entertained by the movie, though.<br/><br/>""Ted"" could have used some improvements on certain aspects, but all in all, it is not a bad movie."
"ani-for-prez","6","1","3","9 November 2012"," Funny but ends up being what it makes fun of
","I've not seen much of Family Guy and the episodes I have seen remind me mostly of Simpsons but of lower quality and an extreme reliance on stereotypes, racial humour and slapstick. Not to say that isn't funny but it gets old fast. When I watched the trailer for this movie and saw that Seth MacFarlane was directing it, I expected more Family Guy humour and lots of the same formula. I was right but I was both delighted and disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie has lots of great, crass and disgusting humour. I don't turn away from raunchy jokes IF done right and the first half has a ton of good jokes. I was laughing all through the first half and I was entertained. But it wasn't just the humour. There was a great quality to the story. It felt a bit more original. It was shaping up to be better than the clichéd story of choice between friend and lover and had much more to do with the relationship of Ted and John than the conflict. Even after the break-up the scene where Ted blames John for his poor choices rather than having to take the whole blame was nicely done and I felt this movie was going places.<br/><br/>Then the second half happened and I was disappointed. MacFarlane proved he didn't have much material apart from his rigid humour and the story fell into the dumb formula it was making fun of in the first half. Jokes here were bad and emotional scenes really fell flat. This guy doesn't have the imagination and the variety that Matt Stone and Trey Parker have or the broad political satire of the Simpsons writers. He sticks to the tried and tested and that gets very old very fast.<br/><br/>Disappointed by the second half but I'll recommend the first half to any fan of the wacky humour present in all of MacFarlane's works or anyone who enjoys these sort of raunchy comedies."
"aimz-s","6","1","3","7 August 2012"," Good, but could do better
","Ted had one of the best trailers available to see from early 2012, an original idea, (for live action at least) and a cast who can deliver. From the start of the film it was obviously the work of Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy humour oozed throughout the film, even using a few cut scenes which Seth and his crew have turned into an art form.<br/><br/>The story line was fairly simple and linear, which was one of its downfalls, but it was very entertaining with lots of 80s references and crude humour bringing you as the viewer closer to Mark Wahlberg and Seths characters and their friendship.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gave a great performance acting alongside a animated character, easily letting you as the viewer forget Ted wasn't real and getting the most from the story.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis was good but I feel she has given better performances in other films, sometimes it seemed she was a little uncomfortable, and Meg gave an appearance once or twice which was hardly surprising given the Seth connection.<br/><br/>The side story, which was bought by the always fantastic, and in my eyes under-appreciated Giovanni Ribis, felt a bit unnecessary until the very end. The same goes for Milas boss, I got the impression he could act but was unable to pull off Seths humour.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film but can understand why some wouldn't, if you like Family Guy and feel good films, chances are you will enjoy it too."
"cm_anon76","7","1","3","29 July 2012"," Too real to be absurd, but good acting
","In this movie Mark Wahlberg's character has a buddy who is a living, breathing Teddy bear. <br/><br/>In order for this movie to be funny you have to find the idea of a crude teddy bear to be ridiculous. <br/><br/>For this to happen, you need to be able to associate the voice of the voice actor with a CGI bear. <br/><br/>The voice was a little too real for me. I could imagine in my head what the voice actor probably looked like. I hard a hard time identifying the voice with the CGI character. <br/><br/>So, instead of seeing an absurdly crude voice come out of an absurdly cute bear, I just saw them separately. <br/><br/>But there was still some great acting from Mark Wahlberg, and a few other actors. And some interesting Boston-related humor. The actress who played his trophy girlfriend was forgettable though."
"dfranzen70","5","1","3","28 July 2012"," Ted: comedy cred but movie dead
","Think of Ted as an R-rated version of the latest Muppets movie. Ted is a stuffed bear who magically comes to life when an eight-year-old boy makes a wish while a shooting star passes by (he doesn't seem to know about the star, though). The bear and the boy become best pals, through childhood and into adulthood. You can also think of Ted as an even raunchier episode of Family Guy, or even the short-lived series Greg the Bunny. <br/><br/>Fast forward 27 years, and John (Mark Wahlberg) is now a 35-year-old slouching slacker who's happiest just sitting on his couch getting stoned with, yes, Ted. I mean, the dude does have a job at a car-rental place, but he's clearly going nowhere. He does have one truly awesome thing going for him, though - he's dating Lori (Mila Kunis), who's as down to earth, raw, and crass as Ted and John, so she fits right in. Trouble is, she and John have been dating for four years (!) now, and he's getting the impression that she's ready for more. <br/><br/>It's a tug of war. Does John jettison Ted in favor of Lori, who feels (very rightly) that Ted is holding John back. Sort of like how, in the Muppet movie, Amy Adams is a tad uncomfortable with Walter the Muppet coming between her and Jason Segal. Anyway, Lori gives John chance after chance to get his act together. At one point, Ted moves out, into a seedy apartment. Eh, it's okay, though, because there are plenty of hookers around. The bear gets busy, you know what I mean?<br/><br/>As with most Seth Macfarlane projects, there is a ton of pop-culture humor. You can't escape it. Some of it works, some of it doesn't work at all; luckily, even some of the bad stuff comes off as self deprecating, as if Macfarlane knows the humor ain't quite there. There's an interesting homage to Airplane! at one point, and it works. <br/><br/>Now, the reason the Muppet movie could take this approach and make it work was that it was sweetly sentimental, an homage to a bygone era. It was cute and funny and mainly for kids or adults who can't let go of the past. Ted, on the other hand, takes the same approach and just amps up the adult content. You want drugs? Yep. Drink? Yep. Naked women? Of course there's naked women, and there are plenty of references to what Ted (uh huh) can and will do to them. It's weird, it's creepy, and it's expected.<br/><br/>The plot itself is pedestrian. Everyone needs someone. Ted needs John, John needs Ted, John needs Lori, Lori needs John. Ted leaves, John feels bad, Ted convinces John to party, Lori finds out, Lori leaves John, Ted gets kidnapped... oh yes, there's a kidnapping, too, with a seedy dad (Giovanni Ribisi) and his needy kid. It's a side plot that's really unnecessary except to give us a car chase and a race up the Green Monster at Fenway Park. <br/><br/>Have I given too much away? Of course not. The plot isn't that big of a mystery, anyway; it's the jokes you come for. Okay, let me put it this way. If you like Family Guy but always felt the creators (Macfarlane) were holding back because of TV censors, then you'll find plenty of laughs here, scattered though they may be. If you've never been a Family Guy fan, you probably won't get into this too much anyway. Sometimes the pop references are funny on their own but make zero logical sense. For example, Ted at one point brags about having met Norah Jones at a Belinda Carlisle party and having sex with her in a closet. Considering how close Ted and John are supposed to be throughout the movie, it really isn't likely that the teddy bear would be off at Hollywood parties while the human is stuck in Boston. Yes, you read me right. I accept a talking stuffed animal, but that's it.<br/><br/>If I were to pick just one thing that I loved about the movie, though, it would be the ethereal-yet-humanistic Mila Kunis, who makes for a terrific girlfriend. She's not a caricature (a bit of a surprise); she doesn't demand things from John, hates to issue ultimata (but of course does have to), can joke as nastily as her male counterparts, and is an all-around good person with real feelings, characteristics I wouldn't expect to see in a Seth Macfarlane movie. Maybe it's to make up for all of the crap Kunis' character Meg takes on Family Guy (never seen such a hated character). In any event, Kunis is terrific, better than the material, by far the best part of the entire movie. It's nice to be beautiful, I'm sure, but it's wonderful to be talented.<br/><br/>Ted was never meant to be for everyone, that's for sure. You love raunch, well, then this movie is drenched in raunch dressing. And off- color, non-PC jokes. Some of it is painfully unfunny (who thought having Mark Wahlberg sing was a good idea). Some of the scattered references do stick a little, so it's not a wasted effort - as long as you count yourself among the intended audience."
"napierslogs","7","1","3","8 July 2012"," Offensive, wrong and childish, ""Ted"" is hilarious and then it becomes a Hollywood rom-com
","The great thing about ""Ted"" is that they know their target audience. And they hooked us from the very beginning. It starts with a fairly well written narration about how in 1984 on Christmas eve, all the Boston kids would gather together and beat up the Jewish kid, and then the next morning they would open their presents. One little girl got a Cabbage Patch Kid — the identical one which I got on the exact same morning. They had similar clips for the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>John (Mark Wahlberg) got Ted, a teddy bear, who became a real, live teddy bear. ""A Christmas miracle, just like baby Jesus."" That should give you a sense of what the humour is like. It's blasphemous, homophobic, racist and culturally offensive. For those who don't get offended easily it's actually pretty funny.<br/><br/>As John grows up and Ted becomes famous (he is a walking, talking teddy bear after all) they settle down for a life filled with childish behaviour and lots of pot. One morning, John is too stoned to drive to work, but behind a blue haze of marijuana smoke, Ted says it's okay, he can. And so he does. I couldn't help myself but laugh.<br/><br/>A lot of people seemed to be delighted by the fact that there was a story to the movie ""Ted""; somehow expecting that there wasn't going to be one. As much as Hollywood would prefer to not have to tell a story, they always at least try. But don't let the fact that there is a story confuse you into thinking it's a good one. It's not. It's a simple romantic comedy about a guy who can't grow into a man because as long as he has a teddy bear he will always be a kid. That is paraphrased directly from the movie.<br/><br/>The novelty of the humour does wear off as the story builds up. Most of the lines remain funny, but I would like to think that they could have made the plot funny too. An element which makes ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) a better movie than this.<br/><br/>Wahlberg essentially plays himself, minus the singing ability, so he was very natural but his reactions weren't as funny as in ""I Heart Huckabees"" or some of his other comedies. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, does not play himself – I hope! And he hasn't been funnier. He plays that creepy guy from the park with the kid who could be his son or who may be his lover.<br/><br/>Some scenes I was a bit too creeped out to laugh, some scenes were so damn funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and some scenes should have been made funnier. Which is probably what most people would expect to get out of a movie like ""Ted'."

"arranhicks","10","2","10","24 August 2012"," Seth McFarlane is officially a comedy genius.
","For the last few years, Seth McFarlane has graced television screens with 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad'. Two animated comedy shows that leave me laughing for 23 minutes straight with its new idea of wit, one-liners and hilarious cutaways which brilliantly reference other TV shows and movies.<br/><br/>So when I saw 'Ted', I had seen all the trailers and was absolutely buzzing, particularly with the all-star cast, which includes McFarlane. After laughing so hard for the next 106 minutes, it officially ranks as one of the funniest movies i have ever seen, and officially makes McFarlane a genius.<br/><br/>First thing that makes it great: The cast. I said it's an all-star line-up, but the cast are just so good. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis have such good chemistry on set and looked a perfect match. McFarlane lent his terrific voice acting skills to the role of Ted, and, despite sounding a lot like Peter Griffin (which, for the record, I have no objection to), he was probably the only person who could ever make the character come alive. And his relationship with John (Wahlberg's character) is absolutely brilliant, even though it has absolutely no right to be. The supporting actors were great as well. Patrick Stewart was probably the only person who McFarlane would ever have considered giving the role of the narrator to, and his voice really adds something to the movie. I also loved the jobs Patrick Warburton and Giovanni Ribisi did, and Sam Jones as himself was just too funny!<br/><br/>Second thing that makes it great: It's the McFarlane Formula. He took what he mainly does on 'Family Guy' and made it into a feature-length movie. I have no idea how he makes it work, it has no right to work, but goddammit it works!! The scene where Lori asks John what he thinks his dance moves were like when they first met, the way he spoofs the infamous 'Saturday Night Fever' scene, despite the fact it's already been done in movies such as 'Airplane!', had me in hysterics for the whole thing. It was just perfect. It's weird because quite a few of his jokes centre around pop culture, and when the god awful movies of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are released containing these jokes, they're always slated (but for good reason, they are dreadful). I guess McFarlane knows how to get things right, not make jokes drag out too much or make them repeating themselves, and the timing is key, which he always gets right.<br/><br/>So yeah, this movie flat out rocks, and, unless your sensitive to very vulgar language and terrorist and racist jokes, drag yourself down to the nearest theatre and watch this movie!! :)"

","When you first look at this movie, you think it would be a kids movie because it's the story of a teddy bear and a grown man's friendship. Then you're like amazed that it's rated R instead of G or PG. Most parents would think 1st it's a movie for their children. But it's weird that it's not. It's funny how grown men like me plan to watch this movie. Cause usually girls watch movies that involve teddy bears. As for this teddy bear, Ted acts more of a man than just a teddy bear. He has a job, girlfriend, and loves to party and relax. Seth MacFarlane was a good choice to play the part of Ted. Ted and Peter Griffin are similar in many ways. They love to do stupid things to be funny. And they'll do anything to just slack off. Many children treat their stuffed animals as if they were family to them. As a young boy, John thought of Ted as his little brother. They loved to be together. Since John couldn't make friends, he chose Ted to be his friend. John said he's always there for him and he listens to his problems carefully. Over the years, they become adults and all they wanna do is party. Ted is more of a partygoer than John. John just wanted to have a normal life like any other man on Earth. But Ted just thinks fun is more important. It sure did bite the dust when Ted got a job he didn't want. Ted is sure enough to be a ladies man or should I say a ladies bear lol? Every girl knows what he does to please them. He is who they want to make love. Milan Kunis was a great actress. I can picture her who gets annoyed by Ted. Like when Meg Griffin gets annoyed by her family lol. I would watch the movie repeatedly. It was a great set-up. Great dialogue, characters, setting, and plot. A regular man and a teddy bear makes a powerful friendship. You mess with Ted, and the fight will be unBEARable haha"

","So many comedies these days stick to the foul-factor, how much can they gross everyone out while making jokes about drugs, alcohol, and sex without much context to it. Now, being R-rated, Ted, of course, has these references. But what I loved about it was that it still gave context.<br/><br/>The story line is a bit silly (But a talking teddy bear is your main character, so that shouldn't shock anyone), but you find a connection with Mark Wahlberg's character and his struggles between the seriousness of his relationship and the want of having a care-free life with his best childhood friend, Ted. You even find some relationship with Ted as he learns to grow up beside his friend.<br/><br/>Obscure references that few people can catch at first, wonderful music scores (provided by the Walter Murphy), great narrative by the ever- famous Patrick Stewart, great acting from the cast (yes, even the CG bear), cameos from celebrities (one that caught me extremely off-guard), and an appropriate amount of toilet humor makes Ted well-worth the watch."

","OK, this movie is what it is...a story about a boy and his teddy that comes to life after a magical wish- I freakin loved it! As a big fan of Family guy and American dad I was not surprised to see the same low ball, laugh your ass off cause you're to stoned to move jokes that you see in every Mcfarlene episode. Marky Mark is awesome, he has great comic timing and keeps this movie moving in the right direction all the way through. Yes there are slow parts, but you need them to let your stomach muscles rest after the funny parts. As usual there are plenty of 80's references/material, especially Flash Gordon (which is one of my childhood favs so I am alittle biased). Fans of Seth will not be disappointed, its funny cause its rude, racist and violent but just like a family guy ending, its heart warming as well. Look out of the fight scene, the creepy guy dancing and the kid getting punched in the face....funny fun! The 60 year olds sitting in front of me didn't think the same though :)"

","Though I have been a loyal Family Guy fan (although the series has seemed less funny over the past few years), I was a bit hesitant to see Seth McFarlane's first live-action film. Let me just start by saying that not only did I cry laughing in the movie theater, I am still chuckling about it more than a day afterwards. I thought that it was a good story (at least as good as it could be with the very plausible idea of a stuffed teddy-bear coming to life), with great cameo's, and a hilarious dialogue. If you are looking for a really sappy movie, this probably isn't the one, as Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are about as believable as a couple as Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but nevertheless, that isn't really what the film is all about. It reminds me of a children's movie, with themes of magic and miracles and holiday cheer, up until Patrick Stewart starts talking about the neighborhood boys beating up on a Jew. Essentially this is a feel-good movie with all the vulgarity and ""piss-off world"" attitude that we Griffinites can enjoy. If you enjoy the idea of a talking teddy-bear, one who might utilize vegetables in a sexual manner, that smokes more weed than you've ever even seen, maybe does cocaine with a certain 80's icon, and has a mouth that only a mother from Boston could love, then this is the film for you. If there was one thing that this movie taught me, I would have to say that it is that an Apache Attack Helicopter is indeed more powerful than a little boy's wish, but not by much."

","Specially the part where he is doing the 'dirty teddy' thing toward his future bride. This movie is excellent but sadly it has too much inappropriate language and jokes. I really don't like the fat kid in the movies because he is very badly spoiled by his father Tony (I think thats his name) and he kind of have this thing called 'mental sickness'. The part that could show his 'mental sickness is the fast transform from very violent to Ted and suddenly turning to an 'innocent' kid. Must admit that the actor is very good. Lastly, I want to talk about the main character, John Bennet. He was such a good friend with Ted but their friendship was very weird(for me), since they were together from a very young age, Ted had went on the television yet Bennet wasn't mad at all, but when they grew up, Bennet started to get mad at Ted because of Jealousy."

","I guess if you like Family Guy then you will like this movie. While it does not have those wonderful cut scenes that Family Guy is famous for, it does have the crude style of humor that one would come to expect coming out of the head of Seth MacFarlane. It is interesting that when one of the Simpsons creators decided to move into the realm of film making, you get some academy award winner wannabe starring Jack Nicholson called 'As Good As It Gets' where as when Seth MacFarlane goes into the cinema, you get more of the same. Hey, at least it doesn't put you to sleep.<br/><br/>I would say that this is a good movie, not a great movie, just a good movie. Ted is basically a complete rehash of Brian (so if you like Brian you will like Ted). He starts of as a little wimpy, but that is because he is a kid's teddy bear, however as the kid grows up, so does Ted. Which means he sits on the couch smoking weed, picking up hookers, and throwing wild parties.<br/><br/>The thing I liked the most about this movie was the irregular references to Flash Gordon. I loved (and still love) Flash Gordon, so having the movie rotating around this classic from the eighties made it stand out. As can be expected from the creator of Family Guy, Sam Jones (the guy who played Flash Gordon) doesn't just make a cameo, but plays a reasonable role in the film (including putting his fist through a wall while on cocaine).<br/><br/>I could say that this is a film about growing up, and in a way it is, but in another sense it also deals with that constant pull that some of us have between becoming an adult and maintaining that part of ourselves that wants to enjoy life. Still is Sam Jones, as old as I think he his, can still go to wild parties, pick up women, and snort cocaine (as well as smoking weed) then I guess we all can do so in a way as well. However, there is something that old men with sex appeal have that many of us don't, and that is money, and if those of us with some money wish to use that money to create some form of sex appeal then I guess the old adage of fools still holds true."
"bbrebozo","8","1","4","23 July 2013"," Maybe This Movie Isn't For ""Family Guy"" Fans
","I watched Ted, then went through many of the user reviews on IMDb afterward. It surprised me that so many people who disliked Ted were Family Guy fans. I'm the opposite: I've seen very little of Family Guy and never particularly cared for it, but loved this movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it was an amazing accomplishment to make Ted as realistic as he was. The animation was flawless. And the actors were very convincing in their interactions with a character that didn't actually exist when they were filming their scenes. Yes, the humor was raunchy, but apparently I was in a mood for raw humor that day. The acting was very good, and the evil father-and-son team were actually convincing, despite (or perhaps because of) the father's comically-spastic dancing.<br/><br/>A lot of Family Guy fans complained that they were troubled that most of the familiar Family Guy cast was brought in and used in a different context for this film. But since I don't watch Family Guy and was unencumbered by any such troubles, I just thought it was a very enjoyable, well made comedy -- with very credible dramatic and romantic overtones."

","Perhaps I wanted to like Ted more, but regardless of my expectations, I laughed out loud more times during this than most movies I've seen in two years. And though the audience also laughed, I think I was the loudest.<br/><br/>It's doubtful they got most of the jokes; Seth MacFarlane's humor is mostly targeting one generation – specifically mine and, well, his.<br/><br/>Stepping aside from the endless references, this is the closest Family Guy movie we can count on. For now.<br/><br/>As with most little tyke ""I wish for"" movies, Ted(dy) bear (MacFarlane) comes to life for a young boy, John and thanks to this gift, the little boy, now a large boy, never grows up. Even during his fourth year with the stunning Lori (Mila Kunis,) John (Mark Wahlberg) continues to smoke a lot of weed, skips on advancing his life and complies with all Ted's wishes.<br/><br/>Not that, that's a bad thing<br/><br/>Well, maybe the age old story that wraps around the movie, but I guess they felt they had to go that route to make a feature length.<br/><br/>Note to Seth: you can spend 30 seconds or less developing a plot and the remaining 95% in complete chaos. Much like the movie you spoofed that spoofed other movies. (No spoiler from me. Someone else spoiled it for me – SHAME!)<br/><br/>Anyways, that ""storyline"" almost led to its downfall with the terrible pacing and long stretches of nothingness. Thankfully, Ted returns to the screen, and literally saves the movie each and every time. He also reminds us not to take this all too seriously, for the most part, and I liked that.<br/><br/>And this movie. It's offensive – to some – I'm sure, but then, those closed minded individuals need not see this movie. I don't want to look at naked breasts so I'm not buying a Hustler magazine, even though they do not offend me like most guys get put off by seeing naked dudes.<br/><br/>Not to cut this short – I really don't want to spoil the jokes, cameos or scenarios any further. I highly recommend this movie, for fans of Family Guy AND American Dad and those who like real humor that doesn't hold back on the swearing or racial jokes in fear of alienating bigots. And I look forward to purchasing this on BluRay and having a little party to revisit all the incredibly funny scenes. Like The Fighter fighting. I was ROLLING with that scene. Priceless."

","""Larry Charles' ""THE DICTATOR"" is the best comedy of the year; and nothing comes close, really"". That I wrote back in early September 2012, before watching TED of course (and MOONRISE KINGDOM). Recently I had to do my top 12 of 2012 for an online magazine I began collaborating in – I didn't include Seth McFarlane's first feature film but when I recalled its fantastic and hilarious homage to the FLASH GORDON movie from the eighties I realized it deserved a place. <br/><br/>This is the best thing McFarlane has created; basically with this movie he lived the dream of every geeky fanboy: to work with his heroes and make tons of references to his favorite movies, like STAR WARS. Obviously he has been doing that for many years with his series (if you have seen enough FAMILY GUY you'll recall some of its scenes with this flick), but nothing is as cool as doing it for the big screen. Nothing as cool as ending your romantic comedy in the pure style of an action adventure that features Indiana Jones! <br/><br/>Some people will think TED is a sort-of excessive proof of the power that MacFarlane has in the industry; having Norah Jones herself for the musical climax is perhaps as excessive as random (yes, MacFarlane did everything he wanted to). TED ain't a perfect film but, and like I indicated, few others from 2012 were as funny. <br/><br/>Its story is the very same of any romantic flick: the man (Marky Mark) loses his girl (Mila Kunis) but soon gains her back. The key here is that the reason why Marky loses his girlfriend involves, surprise surprise, Flash Gordon himself! And certainly the title character, the teddy bear with life Ted (voice of McFarlane himself, aka Peter Griffin) turns to be the classic crazy- irreverent-hilarious bastard. <br/><br/>I would love to hear the opinion of filmmakers like Edgar Wright and Guillermo del Toro, since both are huge fans of FLASH GORDON; but I'm pretty sure TED made them very happy and they weren't like ""hey! I would have done a better homage to Flash"". <br/><br/>*Watched it on 11 September, 2012"
"TxMike","Null","1","4","29 December 2012"," Target audience (juveniles) seem to love it, but frankly a pretty poor movie.
","In many ways this movie is a reunion of the creator of and actors in the TV series, ""Family Guy."" Which isn't bad, because there is a lot of talent there. <br/><br/>As a boy John Bennett had trouble finding friends, for no particular reason, because he seemed to be the normal boy of 8 living in a Boston suburb. But for Christmas he made a wish, that his Teddy bear would come alive, and the next morning his wish had come true. Mark Wahlberg is the adult John Bennett, 27 years later at age 35. He is stuck in a low paying job at a car rental business, but has been in a 4-year relationship.<br/><br/>And his bear, Ted, has grown up too, not physically, but his voice changed and he developed this really dirty mind and dirty vocabulary. For no particular reason, it seems. And unlike some similar stories, Ted's secret is widely publicized from the start, and there is an inventive scene where he is a guest on the Johnny Carson show, when Carson says ""I thought you would be taller"", Ted replies ""And I thought you'd be funnier."" <br/><br/>The pretty girl in John's life is Mila Kunis as Lori Collins. She realizes he doesn't have a great career path, but she loves him and knows he has a good heart. But most of the story involves John giving in to Ted's suggestions, screwing up over and over. Ted, who saved John as a boy, now is messing up John's relationship. Seth MacFarlane, creator and director, voices Ted, and post-production did a great job to make Ted look very real, although a static teddy bear was used in filming.<br/><br/>This story has some real potential but to me, and also to my wife, it wasn't handled very well. There are some funny scenes, but there is also a strong reliance on potty humor and sexual references that only serve to make the move ""dirty-sounding."" I know, to many that also makes it funny, but to us it did not. Pretty marginal movie overall, we would not recommend it to any of our friends."

","I hate Family Guy. Even more, I hate American dad. It's just the some old ""life lessons"" over and over again that we don't need and don't want. Feature films- on the other hand, Seth was made for this. A cliché often used in Family Guy and American Dad comedy is the ""degenerate friend gets you into trouble"" thing which kinda gets on my nerves, but this manages to be packaged very nicely. Also, I love the film Airplane! so that's a plus. People often compare Family Guy to South Park, but the thing is, Trey and Matt are actually good at doing South Park, while Seth is so terrible at dishing out new episodes he lets his staff writers handle the job. Seth Comedy is best served in long intervals, and not in 20 episodes per season. As for the ""dirty comedy"" thing... personally, I think its 2012, the MPAA ratings system is there for a reason, I don't particularly endorse R-rated comedy nor hate them for being R-rated. Some scenes were funny. Others, not so. Hence the 6. Anyways, I'd recommend you see this film back home with your family on BlueRay, or with your partner or yourself, because the theater is a really annoying place to watch such a film... especially when you're in Hong Kong, where half the audience doesn't know why John appears in a pilot suit dancing to the song ""stayin' alive"", and they freak out over some freaky thing Ted does."

Sorry but I just didn't find it really very funny and I thought it fell rather flat as a romantic comedy. I was unsure why the ""c"" word was used in a 15-rated film and I wasn't too sure that an adult should punch a child unconscious, (even such a loathsome child, well-acted by the promising Aedin Mincks), but I suppose this was the writer trying to be clever and ""push the line of acceptability.""

"MarcusJ13","7","1","4","21 August 2012"," Supremely funny if over dependent on pop culture gags
","Ted is a film that if you didn't know it was headed by Seth MacFarlane, you would after about five minutes if that. The premise about a Teddy Bear growing up and living with a man is one that has been utilised very well. It does not hide from the fact that it is a very silly premise and does in fact celebrate it. Where the film has its weakness is where the humour is almost too synonymous with MacFarlane. A deluge of 80's nostalgia and pop culture gags reach the forefront of the film. If you do not like this sort of humour where there are references galore, some of which are a little too in your face and out of place. It depends on the patience you have for these pop culture gags. In Family Guy they can be prone to becoming severely out of place and too random to be funny. In Ted though they are, at least for MacFarlane kept in moderation. The leads in Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis do very well and seem completely natural in parts that would be difficult to play otherwise. Wahlberg especially stands out and gets just as funny as Ted himself. Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) is of course the stand out character, his only flaw is possibly that his behaviour is too predictable at times, regardless he is very funny and does actually provide many laugh out loud moments. Plot wise it takes very predictable turns but its just a fun comedy and I anyway at least got over the fact relatively quickly. The film is funny, its key weakness is just that the humour is effectively very concentrated."

","Seth MacFarlane is one unique comical voice, and he brings his Family Guy-like formula to his first feature, Ted. A movie about a bear who swears, smokes weed, and makes frequent crude remarks has serious potential. And that is why Ted deserves to be seen: It is flat out hilarious. Tonally uneven, and overly familiar, but still hilarious with hardly a dull moment. The movie provides some golden antics, especially between Mark Wahlberg and MacFarlane (playing Ted through motion capture). The delightful pop culture references are also tickling, none the least of which was an homage to John Williams' legendary march from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi provide their own laughs in supporting roles, Patrick Stewart gives a droll narration, while Norah Jones provides a couple of jazzy original songs. With his comedic resources, and a possibly stronger screenplay, you can only hope that MacFarlane will make something even better the second time he releases a movie.<br/><br/>***1/2 / *****"

With that said, I can also see why people wouldn't quite enjoy this film.<br/><br/>The movie ""Ted"" is a solid comedic movie that is guaranteed laughs. Sometimes you just have to have a little fun with movies and the film ""Ted"" definitely represents that. I also have to admit that Mark Wahlberg was pretty funny in this film. He hasn't dazzled me before with his attempts to be funny, but in this film he gave me a couple of laughs too.<br/><br/>I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10. This film could have been awful, but they put together a descent plot and made numerous attempts to keep the comedy coming.

Ted is a bromance with a difference; a story of arrested development that brings out the kid in you. The bear really does come alive thanks to MacFarland and persuasive animation. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are appealing and give committed performances while Giovanni Ribisi gives a creepy and campy performance that would fit right into The Silence of the Lambs.

Ted having sex and the feces on the floor are examples of jokes that didn't work for me. Sure there were a lot of dumb jokes in this movie but jokes like these are just to over the top for me. Another thing that took away from this was the cliché ending. I realize it's a comedy but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to succumb to such a boring cliché.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm basing the movie, but I did find this entertaining. The jokes in this movie were funny, for the most part, and there was some good substance to the movie. For example, at times, there is a distinct role reversal between Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg. For example the scene were they meet in the diner. After Wahlberg finishes talking he walks out of the diner. This is one of the few times that you want the girl to run after the guy. Another example is the chase scene, Kunis is driving instead of the action hero Mark Wahlberg. <br/><br/>In the end Ted is one of those few movies that is just a solid film.

Some of them you felt OK laughing about, while some made you feel so guilty that you laughed so loudly after hearing them.<br/><br/>I finally got to see how the great Mila Kunis acted and it's funny seeing Markie Mark talk with his New Yawk-like accent like he did in the movie ""Fighter"". It was awesome how it was basically Peter Griffin if he were a teddy bear. Even though he had a small part, Ralph Garman from the podcast ""Hollywood Babble-On"" did great as Johnny's father when Johnny was little. It kind of felt odd seeing Ryan Reynolds in this, but his part was just as funny as everyone else's. <br/><br/>Even though the plot kind of felt basic, the jokes were the main part of it. You kind of had that feeling of knowing what was going to happen next, but the stuff Johnny and his ""bear"" friend (ba dumb tssh) are just so great you have to see it. I'll never look at toy teddy bears the same and also these pandas that I'm seeing on a local news station. I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're in for a very good laugh. I'd rate it a 7.5/10."
"bhusnur","7","1","4","4 July 2012"," Great film for a guys night
","Get a bunch of guys, go out, have a few beers and then watch Ted. Strongly feel this movie's fan following will grow as the years go by and a decade from today, we will be putting this one alongside the Big Lebowski, Old School etc.<br/><br/>The premise of Ted is silly. Why would anyone want to watch a movie about an obnoxious teddy bear. Well, because a teddy bear doing crazy stuff and speaking like he has no filter is actually pretty funny. And Ted truly is one of the guys. We all had teddy bears growing up. This is what happens if they grew up with us. <br/><br/>Intelligent acting. Seth McFarlane takes his Family Guy humour and is effective in throwing it into a stuffed animal. Overall, a fun movie if you go in with the intent of having fun. If you go in with the intent of finding an Oscar nomination, you'll be disappointed"
"drewstar_16","7","1","4","30 June 2012"," Funny, but trying a little too hard...
","MacFarlane's trademark mix of cutting satire and slapstick comedy setup worked its charm in TED, delivering plenty of laughs, and even a little heart, for anyone who can handle the film's risqué on screen escapades.<br/><br/>But MacFarlane (who makes his feature directorial debut with the film) successfully balances the absurd and over-the-top elements of Ted with a number of grounded, albeit familiar, statements on love and friendship. That said, despite presenting a number of genuinely sweet moments, the film isn't going to be for everyone and moviegoers who aren't interested in watching a stuffed Teddy Bear f**k a cash register display (which is only the tip of the iceberg) should probably look elsewhere.<br/><br/>This feels pretty much the same as watching Family Guy. Peter Griffin is John, TED is Stewie and Lori - Lois. The jokes are ruder, cruder and more sexual oriented (hard to imagine right?).<br/><br/>Without question, the core Ted story will be especially familiar to anyone who has seen a bromance film or a similar thirty-something coming of age tale before. Had the movie not featured a sex-crazed talking stuffed animal, it'd be easy to write Ted off as a formulaic and predictable series of events that fails to offer anything but formulaic characters in service of one comedy setup after another. However, watching the surprisingly lifelike animated Teddy Bear performing even the most basic actions (such as driving a car) never gets old, and as a result, even the formulaic elements of the plot are easily heightened by the unabashed absurdity of the setup. Of course, there are also plenty of fresh comedy gags as well – not to mention loads of '80s throwbacks that pull double duty in providing a number of laugh out loud setups, as well as humanizing the stuffed protagonist (i.e. he's really into Flash Gordon).<br/><br/>The cast includes plenty of stilted interactions, especially between Wahlberg and Ted, but none of these moments detract from the overall enjoyment of the experience – since everyone on screen is clearly operating with their tongue firmly planted against the side of their cheek. Mila Kunis once again successfully flexes her comedy muscle and, despite serving in a supporting role this round, has some of the more enjoyable (and heartfelt) scenes with the bear. Joel McHale's Rex and Giovanni Ribisi's Donny are equally entertaining, albeit exceptionally one-note, which describes most of the characters in the film: thin but entertaining vehicles for either physical or one-liner comedy.<br/><br/>While it's not going to be for everyone, moviegoers who are onboard with Ted's campy premise and crude antics will likely find that MacFarlane has delivered an entertaining live-action comedy debut. Outside of the premise, the scene to scene narrative elements don't offer many surprises, but considering they revolve around an R-Rated talking Teddy Bear, most scenes still manage to present plenty of fresh laughs and, from time to time, heart/stuffing-warming character moments.<br/><br/>P.S Wahlbergs accent is HORRIBLE. I think he would of sounded better just using his own accent, the one he tries to pull off comes across fake as ever, listen out for it...tried a little too hard."
"BigWhiskers","10","2","13","30 June 2012"," Pure McFarland Hilarious genius
","You couldn't ask for anything funnier from the mind of Seth McFarland. The one liners, gags, physical humor and I'm sure some stuff had to be ad-libbed is f'in comedy genius with Ted stealing every scene he is in thanks to outstanding special effects and McFarlands comedic genius. A little boy wishes for his teddy bear to be real and it happens and from there the movie gets funnier and funnier with Wahlberg the boy grownup who has Kunis(Meg) of family guy as his girlfriend , look for other family guy voice over actors like Patrick Warburton and the guy who does the blonde swedes voices. Best scenes are all over especially when Ted and John are afraid of thunder as grownups. This movie is rated R for a reason ,with lots of the F bomb and p**** jokes ,this is not a kids movie and I mean it ,you really have to be old enough to get all the pop culture gags and references and of course the language and some violence while comedic is strong especially a scene of Ted getting his ear ripped off ,ok he's a teddy bear but he's a living thing.

","In a Comedy Film i only give 10s if laugh like I gotta pee from beginning to end. That being said.<br/><br/>This in the canvas that Seth MacFarlane needed set aside from TV. This merger of Universal Pictures and Seth MacFarlane will be known for making the BEST COMEDY FILM OF 2012. <br/><br/>They tried this type of comedy before with HOP but Universal Pictures was only able to do OK. Even though it was a Easter release. This is Different. It Looks Like a Teddy Bear but sounds like Family Guy with a Unrated mouth. I mean your gonna get a bit of everything. Kool Narration, a beginning, plot and a ending. Its a full package film<br/><br/>Great acting is seeing Mark Wahlberg (John Bennett)interact with ted like he was a actual human instead of a stuffed bear running with cgi graphic movements. You truly believe they are best buds for over 20 years. Mila Kunis is awesome as (Lori Collins)girlfriend to John. She too plays off the bear so nicely. You have to understand that when the actors act with ted, they are just talking to props or just air. Its like a Saturday Night Live skit that calls for two characters but your the only living actor.<br/><br/>You will laugh and you will cry from laughing so hard either way don't be without the thunder buddies in the movie ted.<br/><br/>I JUST WISH THEY WOULD SELL THE TEDDY BEAR :( <br/><br/>It looks like a Teddy Bear but talks like a Rated R movie Moms"
"thewillt08","8","1","5","15 October 2013"," Better Than Family Guy
","When I first heard the idea of Ted I thought it was going to be the absolute worst thing ever. A comedy with Mark Wahlberg and a teddy bear with the voice of Peter Griffin did not sound too appealing. Obviously Seth MacFarlane was involved and that was the only hope I saw this movie having. Ted was one of the best comedies I have ever seen. MacFarlane delivers with his direction, writing, and even bringing Ted to life. The story is 100% cliché and predictable but its great and it works. <br/><br/>After the intro scenes with John and Ted I thought this was going to be a story of Ted becoming too big and slowly becoming less and less interested in John. I don't know why I thought that but I did. The story turned into a relationship between John and Lori with Ted right in the middle. Still cliché but I was surprised how Ted and John's friendship stayed strong through their life. Their friendship did drive the story and did dig up a lot of the comedy in the movie. The first time we see them together as adults they are smoking weed, literally. Nothing made me laugh harder than seeing a Teddy bear smoke weed.<br/><br/>I have said I do not like Mark Wahlberg in comedy roles, but he is great. He earned my respect as a comedic actor and would like to see him do more comedic roles. He has a lot of funny moments. He and Ted bounce off one another perfectly and it's really funny. The fight scene between the two of them is funny every single time. It's just like the Peter vs. the Chicken fights in Family Guy. When Wahlberg needs to be funny, he is funny. When he needs to be serious, he is serious. When he needs to be emotional, well, good enough. <br/><br/>I was afraid of Ted having the exact same voice as Peter Griffin. I didn't want to watch this movie seeing Peter instead of Ted. This movie isn't like that. Ted feels like a real character and there is very little resemblance to Peter Griffin at all. When Ted talks I see and hear Ted, and that is important. There are moments where it is his voice over and I hear Peter or Stewie. Ted impersonates a fish and uses the Stewie Griffin voice and I hear Stewie. The lights are out and Ted is in bed with John and Lori and he says something. I hear Peter talking to Lois. I don't hear Ted. Luckily, this happens very little but when it does its inevitable. <br/><br/>This plot has been done before but it's so funny I can look past the cliché with the comedy. The party scene with Flash Gordon is legendary. That whole sequence is one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie. MacFarlane has a writing talent where he references funny moments from any decade. The 90s when Ted is singing karaoke. The 80s with Flash Gordon and so on. MacFarlane sets this movie in Boston and it was perfect. They hit on the stereotype of Boston perfectly with the accents and the way some women act. I'm from Boston so it was really easy to relate. Plus they hit landmarks in Boston. Then end up at Fenway Park. Awesome. <br/><br/>This comedy is really raunchy. It seems that these days comedies can only really be good if they are raunchy. I miss the old days of Dumb and Dumber and Billy Madison where a PG-13 movie can be funny. This is obviously rated R and that probably is the only reason why it was as funny as it was. The laughs are constant while most comedies tend to start strong, slow down to develop emotion and story, then end with a bang that is hysterical. That doesn't really happen. It does have its emotional moments but there are a few jabs of comedy that keeps the audience interested. MacFarlane is really good at that as well. He can draw emotion from a crowd while making them laugh.<br/><br/>Overall, Ted is a great comedy with a cliché story that only makes it better. It is the writing and directing of Seth MacFarlane that makes this movie great. He is the true star of this movie. Wahlberg and Kunis are good but MacFarlane gets the most credit. I laughed a lot during this movie, as it should have. I can watch this movie time and time again. The writing was great, Ted himself looked real. The relationships were real and believable and the story was narrated by Patrick Stewart, the voice of a God. Ted gets The WillyT Comedic Crest as a comedy and The WillyT Seal of Approval as a movie as a whole. The story and little things push this movie to the Seal that is a rare sight in comedies."
"avdhesh-k","10","1","5","28 July 2013"," Amazingly Funny and Brilliantly written movie
","How many times you come across a movie where you can really laugh. Its a rarity. Films like 'Old School"", Hangover or Ted come after a long time.However, looking at so many negative reviews here (really surprised though), I would recommend watch this movie only if you generally like watching comedies and crave for them (like me).<br/><br/>Ted is surprisingly funny, with some really funny and witty dialogues. It is also somewhat a reflection on what a person considers what life is and whether only a certain things count rather than all of it.<br/><br/>Movie has Mark Wahlberg who is natural in the role and Ted, voiced by Seth Macfarlane, brilliant in his dialogue delivery and delivering fun punches. I think only Vince Vaughn can match him in this area. Mila Kunis is fine with her role.<br/><br/>Overall a freaking fun ride. Go for it!"
"DanLives1980","9","1","5","27 July 2013"," Finally, a real kids film for adults!
","First of all let me state that I'm voting Ted a 9 out of 10 not simply because I think it's a great film, but because how often can you seriously rate a comedy? It deserves the 9 for how well planned and produced it is before the content steals the show.<br/><br/>Seth Macfarlane, creator, writer, director and voice-over artist of such animated shows as 'Family Guy' 'The Cleveland Show' and 'American Dad' proves in his feature movie debut that, not only does his own unique and hilarious comedy sketch brand of childish comedy make a successful transfer from cartoon to reality - low and behold, the man can tell a story and make it stand apart from the crowd.<br/><br/>Ted is the perfect mix of all the things a decent comedy should contain and whereas it might occasionally rely on offensive over the top comedy and stereotyping, even if you've never really been a regular to the cartoon series' he produces you still appreciate it because just when you think it couldn't be any more far fetched, it weighs down like an anchor and grounds itself in reality.<br/><br/>It's a stoner comedy, a childish fantasy of epic proportions and dare I say it; its reliance on the odd sexist and racist observations make for the type of uncomfortable laughter you can actually appreciate. Often more suggestive than ""balls out"" offensive, it relies on your sick humour rather than insists that you learn to appreciate it.<br/><br/>Ted also boasts a great cast aside from Wahlberg and Kunis. Patrick Warburton (Family Guy's Joe Swanson) is hilarious as Guy. Patrick Stewart narrates and Ryan Reynolds provides some of his greatest acting EVER! Sam J. Jones' cameo as himself is off the wall and back to the character of Ted himself, MacFarlane has me in stitches so often.<br/><br/>Overall, Ted ought to be a classic and I think it will stand the test of time providing it doesn't rely on a sequel!"
"apb216","9","1","5","11 June 2013"," A lot better than I expected
","I'd heard from many people that Ted was not really that good, and since all my friends and I are huge Seth Macfarlane fans, this stunned me. We are also huge fans of Mila Kunis and Mark, so we thought it couldn't do any wrong. I waited for it to come out on DVD. I actually really loved it! I don't know what exactly people disliked about it, but I thought that it was great for what it was. Yes, there are a lot of 80's references. I am not an 80's lover AT ALL, so I thought this would be my point of undoing but I found that since I didn't really know most of the references very well, it wasn't anything to be bothered about. I love the use of weed smoking in this movie, because the hard truth that American's don't want to face is that more people than they realize smoke weed and it's really not that big of a deal. Those that think it is are just brainwashed by the government telling them that it's wrong and dangerous, yadda yadda. I'm not sitting here saying I do it, because I don't, but I also don't condemn those who do. I fully support movies that don't shy away from the subject. Anyhow, as long as you don't expect this movie to keep you laughing from start to finish without stopping, and you don't have a problem with a bit of drug use and partying and seeing Mila Kunis fog up your screen with her hot self, then this movie is great for you! Is it perfect? No. But it wasn't bad or disappointing. There are even a few heartfelt scenes for those who like that."

","I watched Ted recently, and went in without high hopes. However, I soon found myself loving this film. I found the characters quite likable and the Teddy bear, Ted, was extremely funny. <br/><br/>This film contained some great actors and the plot was quite smooth. At no point during this film did I feel like I wanted to put it down and watch it later. <br/><br/>The greatest thing about this movie is the plot. Its very easy for me to connect to the plot. The plot may seem a little childish to some, especially that Ted came to life and that John didn't want to part from him however this film is far more than that. <br/><br/>****SPOILERS****<br/><br/>****DON'T READ ON WITHOUT SEEING THE MOVIE*****<br/><br/>I found the ending very well done with Lori deciding to fix up Ted by the end of the film. <br/><br/>I also loved how it showed what happened to the characters by a voice-over with Lori and John getting married, Ted continuing his relationship with the girl and some other revelations. <br/><br/>Overall, a fine film.

We've seen the best buddy comedy before. However, we've never seen it with a talking Teddy Bear who smokes pot and drives.<br/><br/>The characters are set up very well, and we get to feel for these people. While many movies blast through scenes, trying to get to some climactic point, this movie takes its time -- but not too much time -- and lets us feel these people and relate to them.<br/><br/>The couple is already together, so we don't have to suffer through a budding romance movie again. However, the romance gets in the way of the friendship between Ted and John, which is what the movie is really about.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's for lovers of Family Guy / American Dad, it's for lovers of Stoner flicks and comedy. GO WATCH TED!!!<br/><br/>WARNING Warning: this film is not for everyone. Do not take your kids.

Mila and Mark have good chemistry and their performances were very strong. Seth McFarlane's wit and sarcasm was evident in the script and the crude humor of Family Guy was present throughout the film. I won't recommend this film for anyone under 13 however adults will thoroughly enjoy the movie. The plot is basic, nothing phenomenal but the humor and wit along with the cast makes this movie just plain old fun.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything but there are a few cameo appearances from celebrities such as Norah Jones and Ryan Reynolds as well as several cross references to pop culture for humor.

"joshuacybulski","8","1","5","18 July 2012"," Ted is a good movie
","Ted is the story of cereal killer Ted Bundy, and honestly it is the Boogieman Nights of cereal killer movies. Ted Bundy is played by that guy from New Kids of the Block Mark Wakeboard and he underplays the roll. Right down to having a stuffed animal sidekick. True crime filmss are always upsettling because you know the factual facts are facts. It's the visual depiction of true life, which adds some sort of authentification to the filmss. Ted starts out as a normal everyday kid with no friends, and the Jewish kids scream at him all the time, then he wishes for a friend in his stuffed animal. He then shows his parents his ""alive"" bear, after they freak out they are never seen again, we are lead to believe he killed his parentsoffscreen. Then for the next two hours Ted and his bear just kind of walk around Boston meeting Tom Skerritt fans and watching Cheers. Then they hang out with Flash Gordon and David Putty for awhile. They meet Ryan Reynolds too and you hope Ted ices him after what he did to The Green Arrow franchise, but then the movie sort of just ends. <br/><br/>All in all I would say Mike Walkburg wsas OK as Tedd Bundy but I would have preferred to see more than him just doing bong hits and giving people keys to rental cars. If your looking for a good cereal killer movie look to Love and Other Drugs or Bride Wars."
"ritera1","8","1","5","7 July 2012"," Hangover 2 laughs?
","No. A good try. 80% there. But Hangover 2 was overwhelmingly funny (with lackluster filmmaking). This was very funny (and better filmmaking).<br/><br/>But a much better story. Despite all the crass humor, the characters were endearing. And like Family Guy and American Dad, it was consistently colorful and original. (Unless you're a prude or conservative, I never understood not liking Seth McFarlane.)<br/><br/>The things that surprised me were the periodic dud jokes in the sea of very good laughs. For those 1-2 seconds there were no laughs in the theater. <br/><br/>And the other were the periodic 2-3 seconds that nothing was going on. And that's a long time when you consider ""screen time"".<br/><br/>And the absence of music, especially in the first half (but much more in the 2nd). For the overuse of music in Family Guy and American Dad, it was very noticeable.<br/><br/>It did wander a bit, too. Felt too long. <br/><br/>I thought the Walberg character was too old. I would have preferred the character to be in his late 20s. Would have made more sense and his actions more acceptable. But he was very good. Versatile.<br/><br/>I've never been on the Mila Kunis bandwagon. She's far out of my league but nothing special in the sea of hot gals. Better actress than Scarlett Johannsen and Jessica Alba, but still average at best.<br/><br/>Joel McHale was wasted. Ribisi was good, as always. And good for you Ryan Reynolds. Even when you don't say anything, you're funny.<br/><br/>But, all in all, a very good time. I'd err on the side of see it now. Don't wait 'til DVD."

"The_Film_Cricket","7","1","5","1 July 2012"," Brave, raunchy and original, just like MacFarlane's television ventures
","In a year in which the best movies have been dead serious, Seth MacFarlane's Ted comes as a breath of fresh air. Here is a cheerful and very raunchy comedy that makes us laugh out-loud by building the comedy in inventive ways. The content earns the film a very hard R, but the movie never feels dumb or simple-minded. Only very creative people could have made this movie.<br/><br/>MacFarlane, of course, has made his name on television, juggling three animated series - Family Guy, The Cleveland Show and American Dad! - that are consistently among the funniest in an arena where most shows are tired, dull and satisfied to repeat the same formulas over and over. This is his first feature, and if this is an indication of his creativeness as a director, I think this is the beginning of a brilliant film career.<br/><br/>Ted is the story of a magical friendship between a grown man named John Bennett and the teddy bear that he was given as a child for Christmas. The movie opens with a narrator (Patrick Stewart) telling the story of how the two came together. The narrator's dialogue sounds like something out of a happy Christmas movie until he breaks the spell with four letter words and a reminder that Christmas is the day in which good Christian boys take it upon themselves to beat the snot out of the Jewish kids. John has no friends and is told by the neighborhood kids to get lost – even by the Jewish kid who is in the middle of his annual pummeling.<br/><br/>That Christmas, John's parents gave him a teddy bear that became his best friend. For reasons left somewhat unclear, the teddy bear came to life and became his best buddy. Ted briefly became a global celebrity, even appearing on the Johnny Carson show, until he fame ran out. ""I feel like one of the 'Diff'rent Strokes' cast"" Ted explains, ""They must feel pretty bad . . . at least, the ones who are still living."" As he grew up John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (with the voice of MacFarlane himself) still share things like a fear of thunderstorms and a near-obsession with the 1980 movie Flash Gordon. They also partake of ball games, wild parties, beers and bongs. Some of the best moments in the movie have the two sitting on a couch passing the illicit device between them. Now 35, he is stuck in a nowhere job at a rental car company. Even with a nowhere job, he has managed to maintain a four-year relationship with his gorgeous girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>The glue of the friendship begins to unravel when Lori suggests that Ted might be stunting John's maturity. Living with a man and his living, breathing, talking teddy bear can't do much for romantic development, so she reasonably suggests that it might be time for Ted to find his own place. Lori isn't a nag, however, she's understanding and actually kind of likes Ted, except for his influence on her boyfriend. She's also none-too-fond of coming home to find Ted on the couch with four hookers and her floor occupied by a disgusting leftover from a game of Truth or Dare.<br/><br/>The story here isn't exactly original. It is your basic Your-Buddy-or-Me plot, but MacFarlane finds ways to punctuate it with perfect little asides and characters that come and go, like Lori's boss who keeps hitting on her by showing her his high school diving photo. Most of the movie deals with John's attempts to do right by Lori, but falling right back into the same partying patterns he once shared with Ted.<br/><br/>What is original here is Ted. He is computer-generated character brought to life by the Tippet Studios, whose computer wizards deserve an Oscar nomination for visual effects next spring. Ted is a fully realized soul, whose movements don't feel jittery like most animated characters. There are details to his movements that seem almost like an afterthought. He is placed into this realistic world so flawlessly that he really seems to exist in it. He really seems to be in the room talking to the actors. There is an extended fist-fight in a hotel room between John and Ted that is a wonder of special effects. I am giving the comedy of the film three stars, but the special effects bump it up an extra half.<br/><br/>Much of Ted's appeal comes from MacFarlane who provides the voice. With a heavy Boston accent, he makes Ted into a wild-haired party animal. At one point, he has sex with his co-worker in the backroom of a grocery store, then later admits that he has written dozens of letters to Hasbro complaining that he never received genitals. Yet, even though he is foul-mouthed and does unscrupulous things, we like him. He's a shade below obnoxious. MacFarlane doesn't make the mistake of trying to make Ted into a fantasy character, but makes him seem like just a normal guy who happens to be a teddy bear. It was a masterstroke to establish that Ted was once a celebrity so that everyone's reaction to him is completely natural.<br/><br/>Is the movie funny? You bet. It is also dirty, raunchy, foul mouthed and definitely not for kids. The movie is pitched at a level of low-brow humor but MacFarlane knows how to keep the comic momentum going. If you've seen his television shows, then you know kind of what you're in for. In lesser hands, this could have been a dim, one-joke idea, but MacFarlane is smarter than that. He hits his first theatrical effort out of the ball park with a movie that is entertaining, touching and very funny."
"james-t-sheridan","7","1","5","1 July 2012"," There's Just Something About Ted
","My admiration for Ted begins with the narration of a young boy wishing his Christmas gift teddy bear would become alive, his real best friend, and the ramifications of that wish coming true. A stentorian Patrick Stewart narrates as John Bennet meets Ted, his best friend forever and thunder buddy, John's parents freak out rather wonderfully in the kitchen at the sight of a walking and talking stuffed animal, and the opening pre-title sequence culminates in Ted becoming a celebrity and appearing Forrest Gump-like on Johnny Carson's show before, as Stewart tells us, pretty much everyone got used to him and stopped making it such a big deal. Roll titles with hilarious photographs in place of plot. <br/><br/>A 35-year old rental car employee John Bennet (Mark Wahlberg) and his PR executive girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) begin the film struggling to find balance within their lives while living with Ted. Ted drinks, smokes up, hires prostitutes, and pretty much serves as mouthpiece for anything graphically sexual, virulently racist, or homophobic, and a his mouth spews a fountain of eighties and nineties references; his influence over John leads to conflict as John misses work, is late for work, still shares a bed and hilarious chanting ritual whenever thunder sounds. As voiced by MacFarlane himself, what Ted lacks in facial expression he more than compensates for in verbal acuity and acidity. Most of the joy of the first portion of this film consists of the incongruity of the visual of a kid's teddy bear spouting racist, homophobic, and sexist comments in a matter-of-fact manner. Very little is taboo, and part of the fun is trying to guess what Ted is going to say next. <br/><br/>So, in order to appease Lori, Ted moves out, gets a job at a local grocery store where his inappropriate behavior keeps getting rewarded, and struggles living without John. They both stay in touch, with Ted calling John to come over to his place to get hight instead of working his job, with a double-date that goes awry featuring Ted's new girlfriend, as well as an eventual chaotic party at Ted's new pad. Said party forces John to choose between a work- related shindig with Lori's predatory and slimy boss Rex (Joel McHale) or Ted's wild bash featuring an icon from both of their childhoods. The party sequence seems to be the centerpiece of the film, with Ted eviscerating Hootie and the Blowfish (as well as most of 90's pop rock) with supporting fights, cocaine, and hilarious one-liners. John's choice to attend the party and the consequences of that act drive the rest of the film, as does a bizarre subplot involving a deranged stalker named Donny (a creepily effective Giovanni Ribisi) who wants to buy Ted for his deranged son. <br/><br/>Wahlberg is winning in this film, a highlight being his offering a litany of white-trash names for Ted's girlfriend that brought the house down. Wahlberg rattles off over 25 names in one take before adding the second layer to the joke and repeating. Although I think Wahlberg's best role ever is that other Boston film The DeParted, his performance is great here, as he does not get swallowed up by a visual effect. MacFarlane's Ted fires up shot after shot, many of them layups, but there are occasional three-pointers of hilarity, and the consistent effort pays off with most shots going in (Ed McMahon thought Ted was Alf; a Teddy Ruxpin crack results in a three minute Kill-Bill style thrashing of an apartment with Ted punching John in the face, repeatedly; a 9-11 reference still catches the breath for its audacity or rarity). Ribisi brings the right level of creep to his role, and both Lori and John's work friends seem poised for more minutes of screen time but never get it. The film races to its inevitable conclusion with a Norah Jones concert as well as a chase scene ending up on the tower above the Green Monster at Fenway (Shouldn't that park be better guarded than it is, considering its role in this film and The Town?). A final joke at the end goes over extremely well and is offensive. <br/><br/>When John recalls a memory of first meeting Lori, and the film flashes back to him as the white-uniformed lead from Airplane! in the dance spoof scene of Saturday Night Fever, the moment works on level after hilarious level. I enjoyed laughing at the reference within a reference, but I realize that not everyone, particularly those younger than me, will get that reference. And it is funny even without understanding the reference of Mark Wahlberg as Ted Striker as Tony Manero. I like being able to get most of the references, though I'll admit to being lost with the Flash Gordon worship.<br/><br/>And therein lie the strengths of this film. A willingness to throw joke after joke up with many of them sticking. An affinity for transgressive humor though not as bodily-focused as a Farrelly Brothers film. A skillful glee in referencing 80's and 90's culture (at one point, Ted grabs his torn arm from behind a doorway ala Indiana Jones, with just a line of John Williams' score). An assembly of really good actors who look like they're having fun. An off-the-wall, anarchic sense of play and that nearly anything goes. A fully realized commitment to having Ted be a character, not a visual effect. Impressively, Ted focuses on the character's statements more than his actions. <br/><br/>Three stars is a strong rating. I had fun watching this movie, and I would watch it again. I think some of the surprise and shock will dissipate and some of the weaknesses of the story might become more glaring. But there were enough shining moments for me to recommend this film. And the few cameos, another staple of the comedy, are handled well."
"scupper-simons","7","1","5","30 June 2012"," Pretty funny movie, but some humor is just a little dry
","To be honest, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought that it would be a childish kind of thing mostly because of the thunder scene. But I will tell you that this movie is FAR from childish. There is only one or two nude scenes, but there is an extreme drug use, and even more extreme profanity. This definitely is a movie primarily for adults. With that said, I will tell you that this movie is pretty much funny because the main character is a teddy bear. Which most people think is hilarious because it is extremely out of the ordinary to see something so childish acting so absurd. But if you were to make Ted a real person, the plot would be just a same old romantic comedy thing. But putting in the factor that one of the main characters is a teddy bear changes the whole thing. Overall, I would recommend anyone who is mature enough to see this."
"davideo-2","9","1","6","9 June 2013"," High concept comedy that's already gaining the cult following it was meant to
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>As a young boy with no friends, John (Mark Whalberg) wished his teddy bear would come to life, and was over-joyed when he did. However, as he's grown up, the bear has stayed alive and grown up with him, turning in to a drug smoking, foul mouthed, lecherous creation who still serves as his best buddy. However, John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) thinks it's time he moved out, forcing John to make a tough decision. Meanwhile, the creepy Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) and his even creepier son lurk in the background, harboring a disturbing obsession with Ted.<br/><br/>Nothing inspires comedy like absurdity, and the wackiest, most far out ideas are usually the ones that take longer to get your head around, but usually produce the best results, simply because of how, well, insane and far fetched they are. So in many ways, Seth MacFarlene (whose hugely successful Family Guy is just something I never got in to, a la Futurama) had a certified cat in the bag when he hit on the idea of Ted, which opens with a whimsical childhood fantasy coming true plot line in the vein of the 80's Tom Hanks vehicle, Big, but which opens out in to a far more adult oriented, risqué comedy vehicle that seems hell bent on pushing boundaries of taste and decency as far as they can go.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Whalberg's a generally intense actor, better suited to more dramatic, tough roles, but that's not to say comedy is out of his ability, and he's perfectly convincing as a thirty plus slacker who's grown older and irresponsible with his, er, friend. MaFarlene serves as voice duties on the titular not so cuddly bear, and gets to further inject his already filthy story with his own cutting style. Meanwhile, Ribisi is a genuinely creepy villain who could actually have made this role work in a less light hearted film.<br/><br/>Sharp, cynical, leaving no stone of taste or decency unturned and leaving no popular culture reference unlampooned, Ted is one of the more ridiculous, unbelievable ideas for a film in recent times, but one which has obviously produced the expected results. I've taken my time getting to review it, but at least I know I'm in the agreeing team with it. ****"
"brando647","9","1","6","24 February 2013"," TED is Hilarious!
","We all knew Seth MacFarlane would make the transition to features at some point. Whether or not you were excited at the prospect depends entirely on how much a fan you are of his small screen prime-time cartoons. I've been a fan of ""Family Guy"" since the beginning, even if my interest has waned in later seasons as the show has fallen into routine without the continual strength of the earlier episodes. And I'm a casual fan of ""The Cleveland Show"" and ""American Dad."" So MacFarlane's first feature film was guaranteed to sell me a movie ticket, regardless of what it was (though, to be honest, I'm glad he didn't just cash in on an easy ""Family Guy"" film). MacFarlane's style of comedy shines through in TED, so people who aren't a fan of his shows might not be impressed with his first film. Cut-away gags, pop culture references, and raunchy jokes made funnier with the fact that they're being spewed from a stuffed bear. Speaking as a MacFarlane fan (and therefore biased, I suppose), I really loved TED. It's an age-old tale of a young boy's love for his best friend, a teddy bear he receives for Christmas. A Christmas wish brings little Ted to life and, twenty years later, John Bennett and Ted are still best buds. But playtime and childhood has been replaced with weed and FLASH GORDON, and the friendship between these two slackers risks destroying John's relationship with his girlfriend Lori unless he can learn to grow up.<br/><br/>As a fan, I actually thought MacFarlane's style transitioned nicely to a feature film. The cut- away gags are kept to a minimum and are used effectively. The pop culture references are everywhere, in just about every joke, with a special focus on the 1980 movie version of FLASH GORDON starring Sam Jones. MacFarlane must have a soft spot for the movie because it gets a lot of attention, with Jones even popping in for a hilarious cameo in the middle of the movie. Every time I've seen TED, Queen's FLASH GORDON theme is stuck in my head for the next two days. Maintaining the MacFarlane vibe are a bunch of his TV buddies filling out some of the movie's supporting roles: Alex Borstien, Ralph Garman, Patrick Warburton, Ryan Reynolds, and, of course, Patrick Stewart as the voice of the narrator. It's a ""Family Guy"" fan's perfect movie. Mila Kunis (another ""Family Guy"" star) is John's girlfriend Lori. Kunis is a guilty pleasure of mine. She's never really proved to be a particularly strong actress or gotten the chance to experiment with much range (with the exception of BLACK SWAN, I suppose) but she's has a habit popping up in some of my favorite comedies. She's got a great chemistry with Mark Wahlberg and their relationship feels sincere. Wahlberg's the best here. The man can do comedy. He surprised me with his comedy chops opposite Will Ferrell in THE OTHER GUYS in 2010, and TED solidifies the man's talent for making me laugh. I was never really interested in Wahlberg's work until the last few years when he took a turn towards the funny.<br/><br/>As good as Wahlberg and Kunis are, the obvious scene-stealer here is going to be the walking, talking teddy bear. The CG work in the movie is absolutely seamless and I never found myself doubting Ted's existence in the context of the movie. MacFarlane voices the bear himself and, despite a Boston accent that cuts a little to close to Peter Griffin (a fact that the movie acknowledges, funnily enough), he's a hilarious new creation that stands above a lot of MacFarlane's television work. No matter how many funny characters cross the screen in TED, the spotlight is always on the bear and for good reason. I would love to see the character get a TV show of his own, but it'd have to be on cable. Network TV wouldn't broadcast half the material coming out of Ted's mouth. TED is one of the funniest movies of 2012, coming in just below 21 JUMP STREET for funniest of the year in my opinion. My only complaint on TED would be that the story is weakly structured. The first two thirds of the movie focus on Ted, John, and Lori's relationship and the final act shifts gears into the realm of action with a chase sequence and kidnapping foreshadowed briefly in the beginning of the movie. If the movie hadn't lost focus and stuck to it's course, it would've been even better.<br/><br/>I imagine this will be a pretty divisive movie. People who aren't a fan of MacFarlane's sense of humor probably won't be swayed by the movie, but people like mepeople who continue to enjoy his TV shows, even at their weakest (I'm looking a you ""Cleveland Show"")will laugh our heads off."

"martinrobertson300482","9","1","6","7 September 2012"," I thought it was going to be awful. Just Awful!
","I was one off the few that thought ""Ted"" looked awful. And too be honest, the trailer still makes it look that way. That whole ""thunder buddies"" thing and trying too guess some girls name. They were like, the poorest parts off the movie. Don't know why they choose too have those moments in the adverts, because the flick is way better than them.<br/><br/>This is the first movie from Seth MacFarlane, creator off ""Family guy."" And it really shows. Now ""Family guy"" is a funny show. But it does get carried away with movie references and attempting too shock us with its crude humour sometimes. ""Teds"" also trying too do this. Though is succeeds. ""Family Guy"" tends too cheat a bit by cutting off to some unrelated scene just too squeeze in another joke. While ""Ted"" has more off a story, and can be way ruder than the TV show, with most off the laughs coming from one-liners, or just from the banter between its characters. Plus it doesn't have too stop everything too insert a joke. The gags flow throughout the thing which improves it in my eyes.<br/><br/>Most off the film is very funny. But what's surprising, is that is also has some heart. The stuffed bear that's in the movie maybe swears a bit too much hoping it'll get a laugh. But there's no denying that by the end off ""Ted,"" you'll care about him."
"dillett-2007","6","1","6","14 August 2012"," Finally a funny film since the 90's.
","This is the first time I've done a revue of a film on IMDb, but after watching Ted - I felt a sudden urge to praise such a charming, endearing and 'bark like a dog' funny movie. There are indeed so many times you can hear the phrase: ""I f**cked her with a parsnip"" without wearing a crash helmet and walk out of the cinema with anything less than a mild concussion. <br/><br/>One can't be blamed for expecting something 'Family Guy-esque' when the credit list reads off such names as Seth Mcfarland, Mila Kunis, Patrick Stewart...it goes on and on. I see no problem there. It's similar. Very much so. But good God, it's great. Them at their best. The bad language, the drug taking, the sex, the jokes and popular culture references. <br/><br/>Moreover, you have a simple yet sweet story of growing up and moving on. Something that everyone can relate to. Is the story particularly profound or well told? No, but that's not the point. And if you think it is then - go read the Top 250 Films list one more time and lecture someone else on how you saw Memento and guessed the ending. - You didn't...nobody did. <br/><br/>Trust me, in a 106 minute film. I laughed countless times. I honestly can't remember the last film (that was trying to be funny) that did that to me."
"sean-cowan1","9","1","6","11 August 2012"," Hilarious live-action debut
","First off I must stress, if you don't like Family Guy you are definitely not going to enjoy this movie. If you do then you will find it be quite funny throughout. Most of the joke material involves Ted as the primary source of the comedy, however Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis both hold their own against MacFarlane's well known style of humour. I personally found this outing for Whalberg was better than in The Other Guys and a solid portion of the films humour was as a direct result of his performance. Aside from looking stunningly attractive as usual Mila Kunis did well in her role and while she wasn't a major part of most of the jokes she portrayed her character well and did well as the primary source on conflict in the movie."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","1","6","11 August 2012"," Wild, hilarious, ridiculous, and outrageous.
","Seth McFarlene is a genius. Sure, some of his jokes on Family Guy miss the mark, but most of them are brilliant. So when I heard he was directing Ted, it just sounded right. When you're watching the film, you truly get the essence of the show right from the opening scene, and thank goodness it uses the good jokes.<br/><br/>What drew me into the movie the most, besides its premise, was it's lead actor, Mark Wahlberg. What I admire about Wahlberg is that he does things that are out of his comfort zone, like 2010's The Other Guys. Here, he honestly gives one of his best performances as a 35 year old man child named John. And even though he seems out of his comfort zone, something feels right about it.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a John and his talking teddy bear named Ted(voiced by McFarlene himself). John was a lonely kid and wished that his teddy bear was real, and so overnight he became just that. But years go by, and now John and Ted are grown up, sitting around their apartment getting baked, watching Flash Gordon, and making John's pretty girlfriend Lori(the wonderful Mila Kunis) a little mad. So, she gives John an ultimatum, and the movie goes on from there. But I can't give too much away.<br/><br/>Ted is absolutely bonkers. It's a wild, ridiculous, occasionally obnoxious, strangely clever and sometimes hilarious movie filled with surprisingly decent performances from all of its actors. This is one the best movies of the year so far, and it feels bizarre to say that but it is so true. It felt like the laughs didn't stop, even if some of them were better than others. See it.<br/><br/>A-"
"jamespell","9","1","6","10 August 2012"," Disappointed to see so much negativity
","Any great movie is a movie which has a little something else hidden under the surface. Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy is a comedy which has just that extra bit more, and he translates this across to Ted with relative ease.<br/><br/>First, it's extremely saddening to see so many negative reviews commenting on the profanity in this movie. Yes, there is a great deal of it in Ted but as a university student, I can assure these people that the swearing is NOT what we are supposed to be laughing. Ted is a movie which offers a parody of conventional romcoms/bromance films. It is very sad if someone cannot laugh at a witty comment simply because they stop listening if they hear a swear word. Granted, the swearing in this film is a little gratuitous at times, but this is simply not a reason for writing off it as a film. Ted mocks the very popular culture which these negative reviewers despise so much, but it does so in such a manner that is itself a parody.<br/><br/>The plot isn't the most intricately constructed plot ever, but if you want to see that kind of film, go and see another film. Ted borders on the risqué whilst shying away from being too offensive and is a brilliant film to go and see if you're in the mood for something that doesn't take itself serious in the slightest. Even the premise, that of a beloved childhood toy becoming the opposite of its general perception, gives away the sheer lunacy of what is ultimately a very entertaining film, backed further by strong performances from Wahlberg, Kunis and MacFarlane himself.<br/><br/>If you can't handle a bit of profanity, please don't waste your time seeing this movie because there really is no point - it'll go straight over your head. Otherwise, sit back, relax, and let this movie take you on a memorable and entertaining ride through the inversion of every lonely child's biggest fantasy."
"neil-476","8","1","6","10 August 2012"," Essentially a straightforward rom-com, but with an original central joke
","When he is 8, John is given a teddy bear for Christmas. He wishes for it to come to life so that they could be friends forever, and his wish comes true. Skip forward 27 years and, after a brief brush with celebrity, Ted is now a dope-smoking foul-mouthed slacker and, still living with John, constantly lures him into this aimless unfocused lifestyle - after all, they are best buddies for ever, right? Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, has other ideas, however.<br/><br/>This film's one original idea is that one of the central trio of characters is a teddy bear, and to see a teddy bear effing and blinding and smoking a bong is funny. Strip away that element (and cast, say, Seth Rogen) and you have a fairly routine rom-com where a long-suffering girl is trying to extract her boyfriend from the clutches of his bad influence best friend.<br/><br/>However, the joke is quite a good one and sustains a moderate amount of the length of the film. Ted (voiced by Seth Macfarlane, who also wrote, directed, and performed Temotion capture), for all his slackerhood, remains a fairly endearing character, as do Mark Wahlberg as the adult John and Mila Kunis as Lori. There is sufficient going on to keep the interest going - silly subplots featuring Sam Jones' Flash Gordon movie, and Giovanni Ribisi as an unhinged father and would-be toy kidnapper augment the central plot.<br/><br/>The realisation of Ted is superb.<br/><br/>I could have done without quite so much drug use, and a bit less bad language. Conversely, I loved the fight between John and Ted - vicious, in the way that fights between people who love each other very much yet who are hurting each other a great deal can be, but also very funny, and I also loved Patrick Stewart's fairy story narration bookends: absolutely faithful to how such narration is delivered, yet knowingly, wickedly, hilariously subversive."

","'Ted' comes from the mind of Seth MacFarlane, the genius behind 'Family Guy', one of the few American shows to legitimately rival 'The Simpsons'. It's irreverent, iconoclastic and inspired. I laughed all the way through.<br/><br/>Being the school loner and an only child, John forms an unbreakable bond with his Christmas bear, Ted. One night John rhetorically wishes that Ted could actually speak. At that moment, as luck would have it, a shooting star passes overhead and Ted comes to life. They grow up but never apart, which threatens John's four-year relationship with his girlfriend, Lori (minxy Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>'Ted' has a deliberately familiar plot and structure, but it's not these MacFarlane wants us to focus on. The bear steals the show because he IS the show. He's a naughty little bear, who swears every other word, smokes strong pot and sleeps with hookers. He's what Peter Griffin would be like if Trey Parker and Matt Stone created him. <br/><br/>As well as voice Ted, MacFarlane also plays him, with the aid of motion-capture technology. Taking a break from his action man persona, Mark Wahlberg is aptly cast as the adult John. Playing a 35-year-old is a touch improbable, though his scenes with Kunis are nonetheless credible. <br/><br/>Scatological humour is usually a sign of desperation, but MacFarlane is as inventive with his butt jokes as he is with the rest. He also reinvents clichéd jokes superbly well, which means they take you by surprise. Remarkably, 'Ted' impresses on a dramatic level, too. Ted is basically a nice 'guy', however, the celebrity life he leads is a lonely one, so he hangs on to John, his 'thunder buddy'. <br/><br/>'Ted' never lets up. It's gag after gag, each one coming closer to making you gag than the last. How does this film have room for such unlikely personages as Patrick Stewart, Flash Gordon and Norah Jones?

","For a long time Family Guy's quality has been going downwards more and more. At the same time Seth MacFarlane was making his first feature film and his first foray in live-action, Ted and it was clear what his MacFarlane was putting his efforts into.<br/><br/>In 1985 an 8-year-old boy, John Bennett (Bretton Manley) is a lonely boy with no friends who gets a teddy bear for Christmas. John wishes for the bear to come alive and guess what, he does. Ted quickly fame rises and falls and by 2012, he is a stoner loser living with John (now Mark Walhberg) and his girlfriend of four years, Lori (Mila Kunis). But when John has to choose between the two and the Ted habit is very hard to crack.<br/><br/>Ted is simply a very funny film with various type of comedy, from excellent lines, risky humour we know from Family Guy, slapstick and fights and some gross out/crude jokes. There are only three cutaway gags in the whole film, one of them being a flashback and the other two are at least linked to the leading scene: so people do not like that style of humour do not worry. Whilst there is a bit of swearing unlike other R-rated films the swearing is not the only use of humour.<br/><br/>As a story Ted is similar to Shaun of the Dead, that John has to pick his long time girlfriend that he lets down or his loyal childhood friend that is bad for him. It is a choose between friendship or romance, who should you be loyal to and a character trying to balance his life with two people he loves but do not get on. The other Simon Pegg/Nick Frost that Ted is similar to is Paul because Ted, a CGI, mo-cap character has very adult tendencies: he is a character he enjoys recreational drugs, women, prostitutes and a crass sense of humour. There are worst things to do then be similar to two Pegg/Frost films Walhberg has shown in recent years he has real comic talent and with MacFarlane has great relationship together. They both have get comic timing with their lines and the physical comedy. Kunis played the straight man role in Ted, but she has her moments and is solid with the duo. MacFarlane also get some of his Family Guy alumna in some small roles and was able to provide some fun celebrity cameos. The party sequence was hilarious and was much more fun and on the same level of realism as the offensive Project X.<br/><br/>MacFarlane and his writers were able tie together the rom-com/bromance storyline with two major subplots very well and unlike what Family Guy can be, Ted is more focused on the story front. Occasionally it felt like the film did drag, but for the most part it is very Ted is what you get when MacFarlane actually puts effort into his work and when he focuses on a story. MacFarlane can be a very good writer when he gets the balances of being risky without being offensive just for the hell of it.<br/><br/>On a final note, it is good to see a jokes in a trailer actually being used in the film they are promoting."

","I thought that TED was a brilliant film, because of all the publicity I did worry that people would expect too much and therefore it would not be as funny, however I was pleasantly surprised. It is typical Seth MacFarlane with hilarious gags that just toe the line, there are some references to family guy for his fans but he doesn't overdo it allowing people that are not familiar with his work to enjoy what he brings to the movie. Of course many of the actors have worked with MacFarlane before but the clever thing is that quite a lot of people even Family Guy and American Dad fans would not recognize them because MacFarlane is famous for cartoons, therefore the actors are given a chance to shine on screen instead of being an animated character. However I do think some of the gags may have gone too far particularly 9/11 it was fine once but i do think twice is a bit too much as it is an American film and people are still a bit sensitive about the subject, I will be interested in the overall reaction of it, I may be completely wrong as MacFarlane has a reputation of taking taboo subjects and taking the mick! Mark Wahlburg and Mila Kunis' acting is superb and really makes the story of Ted believable to the audience, of course a Seth MacFarlane film would not be complete without him in someway or another and it seemed appropriate that he did the voice of Ted, his outstanding voice talent is well known and completed the film. Overall I think Ted is a fantastic Summer movie, it will make you laugh until you can't breath, gasp with shock at this perverted teddy bear and there is a heart to the story, sad parts that are really touching. To watch another side of MacFarlane that has yet to be explored proves that MacFarlane must have more tricks up his sleeve! I really hope he continues making feature length movies as he has proved he can be a success in that field, but still remains faithful to the cartoons that gave him his big break!"

","I saw this film earlier today with my friends, and I thought it was absolutely hilarious. Maybe it's because I love Family Guy so much but I found it thoroughly enjoying.<br/><br/>Moreover it wasn't just me that found this funny the cinema was packed with people who were laughing out loud and it even got to the point when you couldn't hear the next line in the film. Which, even though sometimes could be annoying, really was a credit to Seth McFarlane's first feature length film. <br/><br/>I believe the storyline was good enough for a comedy film like this I mean it is about a 35 year old man who is still emotionally attached to his teddy bear so you know its not exactly going to be Shawshank Redemption, however throughout the entire film the comic timing was perfect. <br/><br/>Overall I would definitely recommend you watch this film, and for all Family Guy fans it's a must see."
"tavm","8","1","6","26 July 2012"," Seth MacFarlane's Ted is quite both raunchy and a little touching
","So I finally watched this movie Ted with my movie theatre-working friend today. I knew from the previews that the title character was a walking, talking, pot-smoking, sexually active, stuffed teddy bear who's been best friends with Mark Wahlberg for about much of his life. What I didn't know was the references to various '80s icons like that scene from Airplane! that spoofed Saturday Night Fever that was reenacted here, or that Sam Jones from Flash Gordon (Mark and Ted's favorite movie and it's one I liked enough to see twice back in the day) would appear as himself here partially acting like his character but possibly knowing he's not really that character. I found much of the raunchy stuff involving Ted (voiced by director/co-writer Seth MacFarlane) funny and when things threaten to take a dark and sad turn, I was a little touched, too. I got most of the references though I didn't find it all funny. Still, I was entertained enough to find the whole thing quite enjoyable. So on that note, Ted gets a recommendation from me. Oh, and that scene when Norah Jones communicates with Ted was also good for some laughs..."

","I'm an old guy, but I also can take a joke. My son encouraged me to join him for this movie. I found it quite engaging. There are films that are deliberately crude, hitting the lowest common denominator. Others have deep charm (sort of the ET complex). This film manages to take that charm which we occasionally fall for, and put a bullet in its head. It is full of great lines (listen for the beginning Apache helicopter bit) and sight gags. Some don't work, but most do, and what we haves one strange film. Family Guy knows no boundaries and so it's not surprising that the film is the same. Ted is a mess. He is the victim of the fate of the child actor (although he is a rather nondescript Teddy bear). Mark Walberg is just vacuous enough to pull this off. It may be his best role because he has to show a balance of kindness and utter stupidity when it comes to his old friend. They are comrades in arms and when romance comes in, the bear is going to take first place. This is wonderfully creative and engaging. Ted should get a couple of Golden Globe nominations (I mean the bear, not the movie)."
"rivertam26","4","1","6","15 July 2012"," Haven't we seen this movie before?
","I'm not sure what I was expecting walking into Ted. I found the restricted trailer to be funny and creative and I do enjoy Family Guy every now and than but something in the back of my mind just kept saying eh, are you really sure you wanna see this? Well I should have followed my instincts because despite some inspired moments Ted is just that eh, it was okay. The film centers on a friendless young boy who makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life. And well it does. 27 yrs. later the young boy has grown into Mark Wahlberg and has a girlfriend and well Ted has grown as well into a pot smoking, foul mouthed, crude best friend that hardly ever leaves it side. The whole fairy tale thing taken to a realistic place is inspired and could have been very funny. Instead don't be fooled this is one of those films where the main character is a big child and has to grow up before his girlfriend leaves him. Ugh, not again. Surprisingly enough it's in it's dramatic scenes when the film is most effective sure there are a few inspired comedy bits the hotel fight was great but most of the jokes fall completely flat. Like the whole flash Gordon reference, a prostitute who defecates on the living room floors and Ted having sex with a turnip and the checkout girl. In fact although I'm not easily offended I couldn't help but be by some of the irresponsible humor in this film. The whole gay underground beat up subplot was insulting and unhelpful to the struggling gay community and some of the jokes just go to far like this whole father and son creep acting just comes off disturbing. That being said I have to give credit where it's due and Mark Wahlberg is a hell of an actor he completely commits himself to whatever role he's playing, Mila Kunis is likable and beautiful as his love interest and the CGI Ted is quite impressive. Never once did I feel like it wasn't real when watching the film even though I was continuously rolling my eyes. So all in all Ted is just another crude, forgettable comedy with a creative spin on it's premise yes but the same old man child movie we've been watching for years. Also I hate that they insulted Superman Returns I loved that film and unlike this one that was critically acclaimed."

","""Ted"" is the first ever motion picture to be directed by Seth MacFarlane, more well-known as the creator of the highly-successful and incredibly hilarious animated TV series, ""Family Guy"". As a fan of the show myself, I was anticipating for this movie, the minute I first saw the trailer. You know what, the wait was really worth it. ""Ted"" starts off with the story of when Mark Wahlberg was a little child, wished that his teddy bear can talk, and become his best friend. His wish actually comes true, and it becomes a worldwide popular story across the world. Now, 27 years later, Ted and Wahlberg have still haven't left each other, and still have been buddies ever since. Wahlberg has also been dating Mila Kunis for over 4 years, and now wants to take the next level in their relationship. Now, Kunis asks for Ted to move out, so now Ted and Wahlberg now head off on crazy shenanigans, which will affect their lives in the process. Now, we have our movie, and it's flat-out hilarious. Similar to ""Family Guy"", ""Ted"" knew how to really beat the odds. This movie is dirty, raunchy, and offensive, all wrapped into one movie. Awesome! ""Ted"" is probably one of the funniest movies I've so far seen this year. This movie is filled with plenty of pop-culture references, movie references, TV references, references of Flash Gordon, and plenty of famous celebrity cameos from Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, Patrick Warburton, Tom Skerrit, and the narration of Patrick Stewart. That's all of what Seth MacFarlane has been known for. I was laughing out-loud from beginning to end, even the moment at the end credits was hilarious. Most of the references got me on my seat, because most of them I have been familiar to, recently. I will definitely go again, for a repeat watch. Mark Wahlberg had really great chemistry with either Ted or Mila Kunis, and the performances feel memorable, and the audience grows to like these characters. The writing is witty, the jokes are raunchy, and overall, this movie just flat-out impressed me. This movie knew what it wanted to be, and it went on a very fresh and clever road. ""Ted"" is probably the funniest film I've seen so far this year, and I hope Seth MacFarlane makes more movie projects in the future, while still making me laugh on ""Family Guy"". ""Ted"", in my review, ""immensely entertaining, and down-right hilarious""."

","Adam:This was the funniest film I have seen this year. While Ted might not be everyone's brand of humor, it was nice to see a film not attempt to pander to such a broad audience that became another milquetoast comedy. Refreshing to see a film be bold and swing for the fences as far as raunchy comedy goes.<br/><br/>Scotty - Good but not great, funny but not as funny as you may be led to believe. Ted certainly had several laugh out loud segments and some great dialogue but I felt like it was a bit slow at times. There was certainly some memorable dialogue and the film will be referenced in normal conversation but I did not think it was in the same ilk as The Hangover, Something about Mary, or even Dumb and Dumber.<br/><br/>Griff – Much like 21 Jump Street from earlier this year, Ted is funnier than it has any right to be. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny this movie was. There were a few scenes in this movie that had me laughing out loud. This is raunchy humor for sure.

"patrick-west10","7","1","6","6 July 2012"," Funniest comedy in years
","Maybe its just because i like Family Guy but I found Ted to be this years funniest film and one of the best comedy's over the past couple of years.<br/><br/>The plot for Ted is nothing original when in the cinema I felt like I had seen it before and the ending was no real surprise. However its Teds chemistry with the other characters as well as the consistent laughs that make this film worth while.<br/><br/>Both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are fantastic in their respective roles especially Wahlberg, his interaction with the CGI Ted is fantastic you completely believe Ted's existence.<br/><br/>The laughs however were what made this film so great, it seems with comedy these days their humor is either inconsistent and unoriginal. Ted's humor has definitively be seen in MacFarlane's Family Guy but in a major film like this it comes off as fresh. Sadly many of the laughs could have been better if I hadn't already seen them in the trailer. However don't get me wrong there's plenty more in the film. It also should be mentioned that for those uncertain about seeing this film that its humor doesn't appeal to everyone, Perhaps watch an episode of Family Guy on fox and see if you like it before buying a ticket for this film.<br/><br/>Ted manages to be both funny and charming becoming a real crowed pleaser."
"Troy_Campbell","Null","1","6","29 June 2012"," Crude crowd-pleaser.
","From the creator of Family Guy comes one of the crudest comedies of the year, but not necessarily the funniest. When bullied kid John Bennett wishes his teddy bear would come to life, it does, and subsequently becomes a celebrity in the process. Three decades on, Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane himself) is a pot-smoking, foul-mouthed wash-up who keeps the now 35 year old John (a very game Mark Whalberg) from growing up, much to the chagrin of extremely patient girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). The jokes come thick and fast and when they score, they really score; however there are a few clunkers present too. For every side-splitting sexual innuendo gag at the local supermarket, a can't-believe-that-just-happened knockout of a kid or a hilarious Ryan Reynolds cameo, there is an unfunny 'thunder song', a lame fight with an Asian man or a misguided fart joke right around the corner. Having said that, a magical teddy swearing like a trooper is essentially always comedy gold and MacFarlane rides the wave as much as possible – even if his very recognisable voice is a slight distraction, as one drunken in-joke slyly acknowledges – delivering a crowd-pleaser that will surely strike big at the box office."

","If I had to sum this movie up in 2 words, it would be...... <br/><br/>Loved It!<br/><br/>Honestly, as everyone could probably already guess, this is a family guy movie, pretty much over half of the cast had some relationship with family guy and the humor is very similar. So if you like Family Guy humor(which I do), you will like this movie, if not then you most likely wont. Simple as that. I liked the characters and the development between them as well. I love that feeling you get when you know a movie just does it right, gets you to feel for the characters whether it be laughter or sadness. Yes, the movie was predictable, but sometimes that just doesn't matter. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an open sense of humor and can laugh at distasteful things :P"
"DICK STEEL","10","1","7","2 September 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Ted
","Come on now, let's be honest. How many of you out there have a soft toy companion that once upon a time you'd wish it could talk back, and interact. That robotic Teddy Ruxpin one doesn't count. If it came true, chances are you'd have Ted, brought to life by that little bit of magic you know can never happen in real life, but in reel life. Given to an unpopular boy by his parents as a gift for Christmas, he makes a wish that his new teddy bear can become more than just a plush toy, and so with a little Pinnochio styled miracle, the toy becomes Ted, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who also wrote and directed this feature film, marking his live action debut after his work on his creation and popular stint on The Family Guy.<br/><br/>Cue opening credits and we see how the boy John Bennett, now all grown up to embody the physique of Mark Wahlberg, become the best of buddies with his teddy bear, which had once upon a time become an instant celebrity, and now all forgotten with all things that have come to past. We see that the ""thunder buddies"" - coined because both have a fear of thunder and would huddle together singing their thunder song - have grown up, and even Ted had his voice broken. And like any child, it's nurture that will bring out some personality, and in Ted's case, both he and John have each other to thank for being somewhat of a bummer, smoking weed and rewatching their favourite Flash Gordon film from their couch.<br/><br/>This of course draws the irk of John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis), a corporate high flier who decided to draw some ultimatum for the boy to choose - his best buddy, or her. This is that story, since it's somewhat of a perennial problem in any relationship, when a girl decides that being long suffering isn't enough, especially when she has to get constantly ribbed by friends and colleagues who question her choice in companions, and worst, having the boss hit on her at every opportunity, just because nobody would believe that she would eventually decide to marry down. It's four years and counting for this two's a company, three's a crowd, and things are going ugly and down to the wire.<br/><br/>The best buddy would of course move away, and the narrative deals with adjustment, how we each have to peel away from the things that we like and the people we love, just because we had to make a choice for something taking higher priority. We all have the same number of hours, and it's up to us to determine how those hours get spent. In John and Ted's case, if given a choice, smoking weed and lazing around would just about be heaven on earth, if not for Lori's objection that had the back of the camel broken when Ted brought home four hookers one special night. And add to that the threat of a creepy stalker (Giovanni Ribisi) who so desires Ted that he wants him all for himself, and his son.<br/><br/>Seth MacFarlane has a winner here in creating something outside of his Family Guy series. I couldn't have enough of the trash/straight tailing bear full of wit and life, that Ted just endears himself and makes you wish you have him as your own, as that faithful companion who can hang out with, and is constantly on the same wavelength. Brought to life by the use of CG, Ted is seamlessly delivered, and better yet, is able to get into a big fight should the scene calls for it. Mark Wahlberg didn't have too much to do playing the man child with that blank expression that the story required for the most parts, being oblivious to the needs of his girlfriend, and almost always jumping into opportunities to hang out with his best buddy, nevermind the consequences. The need to pull up one's socks in life, and to have a sense of responsibility, is John Bennett's story arc. Wahlberg's scene stealer though is the rattling off of thrash female names, done without any visual cues or aid, and completely from memory, which is as funny as it is jaw dropping amazing.<br/><br/>It's a true geek's film, and MacFarlane's geekdom comes in full swing with the appearance of Flash Gordon aka Sam Jones in full garb no less, convincing the actor that he still had what it took, and to have the guts to don that cheesy costume to become a huge parody of himself and that iconic character who had shot him to fame. Look out for other recognizable cameos, with Patrick Stewart lending his baritone voice by being the narrator, and a surprise appearance by an actor whose actions in this film also helped contribute to that M18 rating the censors here had to slap on this film.<br/><br/>Ted makes you root for him throughout the entire film, and I sure as hell wouldn't mind someone to verbal spar with, or have a good time hanging out with. Definitely recommended, and one of the more consistent comedies from start to finish that's been screened this year."

","I thought I'd watch Ted, as I'd seen all the superhero movie blockbusters already this summer and I must say I was very impressed. It started off funny but not as funny as I thought but that quickly changed and I enjoyed it. You will laugh at scenes and be sad at some. Seth MacFarlane does what he always does and entertains us. Whether it's Family Guy or American Dad, or now Ted, he makes amazing characters who we can fall in love with and makes amazing voices for them. So if you want to see a funny film that you will enjoy, definitely go to see Ted and I'm sure you will enjoy it. If not then I don't know what to say."

"ferguson-6","6","1","7","1 July 2012"," Tigers play too rough, but not as rough as Ted
","Greetings again from the darkness. Upon watching the trailer, it would be easy and understandable to simply write off this movie as a ridiculous piece of junk produced merely to capitalize on the popularity of Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy creator). That would be a mistake. While much of what Ted has to say will burn your ears, the insight that goes into his lines is often unmistakeably brilliant.<br/><br/>The movie opens with terrific narration from Patrick Stewart. It's done in A Christmas Story style, only with a caustic and deadpan irreverence that will jolt you before the opening credits have even rolled. We learn the story of 9 year old John Bennett, a social outcast who receives a teddy bear for Christmas. First, what parent buys their 9 year old a teddy bear??? Anyway, that night, under the covers, young John wishes that he and Ted could be lifelong friends. In the morning, he awakes to find a sweet, lively teddy who startles everyone.<br/><br/>The talking bear becomes an instant celebrity and is even booked on the Johnny Carson show ... the first of many 1980's pop culture references. As in the case of Corey Feldman (pointed out by the narrator), celebrity often fades. Flash forward 25 years and John and Ted are living together with John's girlfriend (Mila Kunis). The boys spend most of their time smoking pot and watching TV re-runs and worshiping the 1980 Flash Gordon cult movie. It's a typical man-child existence except that one of them is a vile, 4 letter-word spewing teddy bear, and there is no logical reason that the beautiful Kunis hasn't walked away from the four year relationship with the hapless loser John.<br/><br/>Mr. MacFarlane's true talent lies in laughing at our societal norms and encouraging us to laugh at ourselves. He does this through Stewie, the pet dog on Family Guy, and now here with a talking teddy bear. He holds little back in ripping our obsession with celebrity or our clinical anxiety towards all things Politically Correct. Luckily the same rules don't apply for talking teddies, so we hear things that we aren't even allowed to think. Because he can, MacFarlane mixes in his love of the 80's with numerous references and we even get odd cameos from Tom Skerritt, Nora Jones and Ryan Reynolds. The most bizarre reference takes up a substantial part of the movie ... Sam Jones, the star of Flash Gordon, appears as an aged party animal, teaching the boys some new tricks. Most of this will be dead time to those unfamiliar with the 1980 movie ... and evidently none of us have been impacted by it like MacFarlane.<br/><br/>The movie is a mash-up of John Waters, Bad Santa, Jackass and just about every stereotypical slacker-buddy movie from the past 25 years. It's all of that and none of that at the same time. Depending on your viewpoint, Ted is either a crass, irreverent, totally inappropriate waste of movie time, or it's a comical, insightful observation on where we are as a society right now. Only you can decide ... just please don't take your kids."
"pacmanschulte","8","1","7","30 June 2012"," Very funny for MacFarlane's first film
","""ted"" is a film that may have a teddy bear in it, but it's definitely not for the kids. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, you hear the worst four letter word used in a religious sense. But the audience went crazy, that was when i knew that this film was something different. For those of you who don't know what ""ted"" is about, it starts about this kid named John Bennet ( a very unpopular kid, so unpopular that he envies the Jewish kids that gets beat up) and on Christmas Day he gets a teddy bear that he names ""teddy"". After a while, he knights Teddy with the honor of being his best friend for life (or as they say in the film ""thunder buddies for life""). And on one night, he wishes that Teddy could really talk. Low and behold, the next day, Teddy CAN really talk! Instantly he becomes famous, but it wears out over time. Skip about 30 years or so and it's the present day where John and Ted are still Thunder Buddies. Instead of having movie nights and riding in soap box cars, they're smoking pot and watching their favorite movie, ""Flash Gordon"" (which is very important later on). John (played by Mark Wahlberg) now has a girlfriend of four years, Lori (played by Mila Kunis) and she expects John to grow up and move on with his life, Ted just being the obstacle. It's like every other buddy film, but the buddy is a very irresponsible teddy bear. I think what makes this movie work is the fact that Ted can do things and say things that we wish we could but never had the heart to do it, also because he's a teddy bear. The intriguing thing about this movie is how it never slows down, there are parts that are meant to be serious but then after a second, Ted says something that'll have you on the ground laughing hard. I was extremely impressed by the plot, sure it sounds so overused, but MacFarlane doesn't overdo it, he compliments the characters, so to speak. Also the jokes are very in your face and laugh out loud funny. Defiantly keeps in style with the ""Family Guy"" humor that we all know and love. The acting given by Kunis and Wahlberg is really good and you could really feel the tension and the love between them. But the kudos goes to the bear. MacFarlane gives a voice that really speaks, curses, and does other naughty things. This movie would be called ""all about a bear"" but i believe that it's really about friendship over the years. There's a Ted inside all of us and we all have our own Ted. 8 out of ten."
"Fields201","8","1","7","29 June 2012"," FINALLY a GOOD Summer movie!
","If it wasn't for The Avengers, I would say that so far, this summer is full of duds. Thankfully, Ted came out and I have to say it was really good. Thank you, Jesus, I can honest say a movie was good after walking out of the theater! <br/><br/>First and foremost, and this was already in the trailers, but I really like the setup to the story. It's narrated like some fairy tale and this unpopular kid gets a magical teddy bear for Christmas who can interact with him and everyone else. The true story, however, is when they grow up and how their lives are.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailers, I thought I was high watching it. After seeing the movie, they must have been high making it. In fact, Teddy and Marky Mark are getting high an awful lot in the movie! But their a few things along the way that surprised me. Like the chemistry between Marky Mark Mila Kunis. It was very good! Not only that, Mila acted her butt off in a movie about a Teddy bear. Don't believe me, there is this scene where she gets really mad at him outside Ted's place, and it was a very solid performance. I was actually convinced that she was irate with him! What's odd is that a movie about a talking Teddy bear actually worked on an emotional level. That's no small feat! And the fact that the Teddy Bear sounds just like Peter Griffin and it made me feel something is also amazing!<br/><br/>If there are a few things to gripe about, I would have to say that the Marky Mark character is almost too much of an idiot throughout the movie. I also have a hard time understanding why someone as hot as Mila would even stay with some a weirdo too.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty funny and it is very entertaining. It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it does get the job done. After seeing Black Dynamite for the first time last night, the bar was set a little too high for this film anyway. Highly recommended though."

If you find yourself cringing during or avoiding Family Guy entirely, you're going to have a bad time. You have to come into this movie with an open mind, comedically speaking. Everyone's toes are stepped on, from the Jews to the Trailer Trash and everything else outlying and in-between. <br/><br/>There was plenty of laughs to be had, an interesting (albeit foreseeable) story line, and an ending that'll leave you wanting more of Ted. I see a sequel in the future, even though it didn't leave you hanging in the least bit. <br/><br/>My mark is an 8 out of 10, if you come in ready to have fun, you're going to have a bundle of laughs waiting for you."

","My wife and I were out for dinner and decided at the last minute to see a movie. I saw that Ted had gotten some good critical reviews and that fans on Fandango said ""Must Go."" We got the theater right on time but found out it was sold out. I was shocked but intrigued, so we decided to wait an hour for next showing. Turns out that the theater had added an additional showing, again making me more curious about this movie. We sat down and watched the seating completely fill out.<br/><br/>From start to finish, I was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value of this movie. I was laughing so much at times that my stomach hurt, and so was my wife who rarely finds raunchy humor amusing. But it also has a fairly deep story about friendship. The acting was fantastic and the editing superb; at no time did it drag.<br/><br/>But I don't want to build it up too much. Part of the reason we enjoyed it so much is because we weren't expecting much. Go see it, I agree with the Fandangoians. Warning: Definitely NOT for kids or for those who are easily offended, but it does manage to offend everyone."
"DoctorBaltar","Null","1","9","30 June 2012"," Funniest movie of the year
","This movie accomplishes exactly what it set out to do: To be HILARIOUS. I think it's easily the funniest movie in 2012. It's up there with ""The Hangover"". I've been waiting all year for a movie that I wanted to see again, and this one definitely meets that threshold. It's refreshing to see Hollywood make at least 1 of these laugh-out-loud rated R movies a year. The trick is in the quality. I'm not a fan of Marky Mark, but the bear makes the comedy sing. I think the writer and director has a good sense of comedy, which seems to be in short supply with all these pathetic, weak comedies coming out these days.<br/><br/>This movie scores in that department. A definite must see!"
"jboothmillard","7","1","10","10 August 2012"," Ted
","Seth MacFarlane had great success as the creator of acclaimed comedy cartoon Family Guy, and follow ups American Dad! and The Cleveland Show, but when I saw the trailer for this film, his first directed feature film, I was really looking forward to it. Basically, in Swampscott, Massachusetts, when he was five years old, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was given a large teddy bear that he named Teddy, he saw the bear as his only friend since he had no real ones and was lonely, and that Christmas night the boy wished the bear was real and alive, and his wish came true. John's parents (Family Guy's Lois - Alex Borstein and Ralph Garman) were shocked, and soon enough the story of the living teddy bear was all over the news and media as Teddy became a brief celebrity, and in the present day Johnny still has his best friend Ted (MacFarlane), now a pot-smoking, drinking and foul- mouthed waster, living with him in Boston, along with John's long-term girlfriend, office worker Lori Collins (Family Guy's Meg - Mila Kunis). Lori is hoping that with their four year anniversary approaching that John will propose marriage, but with Ted around she feels he is not able to live a normal grownup life, and obviously he is not happy to go along with his lifelong friend moving out, until of course he has four prostitutes round, and one during a game of Truth of Dare craps on the floor. Ted manages to find a new apartment, John helps him find a job in the grocery store, despite his disinterest in it, working there Ted's gross behaviour attracts beautiful co-worker Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), but he still manages to see John a good amount of time, even skipping work, which frustrates Lori. While this is happening Ted also has to deal with a stalker, obsessive Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) who idolises the bear since being a child, seeing him on television, he wants to possess him for his fat and destructive son Robert (Aedin Mincks). It is at a party hosted by Lori's lewd boss Rex (Joel McHale) that things come to a head for her and John, he sneaks away and rushes to Ted's apartment, where the star of their most favourite movie, Flash Gordon, leading actor Sam J. Jones is there to have fun, John ends up spending longer there than he planned. Lori caught him in the act and in a rage breaks up with him, and in anger he blames Ted for this and says he should stay away and that he has ruined his life, they meet up again in a hotel room, have a fight, but slowly reconcile and realise he has to try and get his girlfriend back. Making an arrangement with ""Sunrise"" singer Norah Jones, Ted convinces her to let John go on stage at her concert, where Ted found out that Rex convinced Lori to go on a date with him, his singing of Octopussy's ""All Time High"" is embarrassing, but Lori was moved by him trying to win her back. Ted decides he should help the couple's relationship by going to Lori's apartment and having a talk, he takes responsibility for the party incident and not allowing his friend to have his own life, he offers to leave them alone, but after she is convinced by this he gets kidnapped by Donny and his son. At the stalker's house Ted is tortured with having his ear torn off by the boy who wants to play with him, but he manages to distract him long enough to make a phone call to John and tell him his situation, but he is recaptured, John uses Donny's contact card so he and Lori can rescue the bear. This becomes a big chase, Ted gets damaged along the way, and they end up in Fenway Park, the baseball park, after the stalker tries to grab the bear Ted ends up torn in half with his stuffing scattered, he dies in his friend arms, the wish magic fading away with his life. John and Lori return to the apartment and put Ted back together hoping that he will return to life, but it doesn't work, Lori tries the method of making the wish on a falling star again, the next morning the magic worked and Ted is alive again, and in the end John and Lori get married, and Ted has his own life and is promoted as store manager. Narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart, and also starring Family Guy's Joe - Patrick Warburton as Guy, Matt Walsh as Thomas, Alien's Tom Skerritt, Family Guy's Cleveland - Mike Henry as Southern Newscaster, Ray Romano and Ryan Reynolds as Jared. Wahlberg is good being the naive friend of the walking talking bear, Kunis as always is good at being beautiful and feisty, and the computer-animated teddy bear that is rude, crude, completely lovable and voiced and animated by MacFarlane does almost steal the show. You could think of this as a spoof of childhood fairy tales, maybe like Pinocchio, but it is done in a sophisticated and modern way, the humour is obviously very vulgar and offensive, but the fantasy element helps even it out, it is well written, and retro stuff like Flash Gordon involved is great fun, it is a really funny comedy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Everybody Needs a Best Friend"". Very good!"
"jdesando","Null","1","11","28 June 2012"," Stuffed, foul, and funny
","Although it's a stretch to call anything by the Family Guy creator ""cute,"" director-writer Seth MacFarlane has endearing moments in his comedy Ted. However, the preponderance of jokes here are raw, rude, scatological, and outrageous, as is MacFarlane's trademark.<br/><br/>He is the voice of teddy bear Ted, brought to life when little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) wishes life into him. Now at 35, John and Ted are best friends sharing life with John's girl, Lori (Mila Kunis). The laughs are plenty, even clean ones like this:<br/><br/>Ted: (dressed in a suit and tie) I look stupid. John: No, you don't, you look dapper. Ted: John, I look like something you give to your kid when you tell 'em Grandma died.<br/><br/>Then the romantic tension sets in and the humor vanishes while John and Lori work out the expected problem of the teddy bear buddy occupying John's time and imagination instead of Lori. While some of this convention simply has to be followed in rom-com's, the predictability compromises some of John and Ted's fast-paced, working-class Boston dialogue that otherwise carries the show. <br/><br/>Suffice it to say, all will turn out right, even if the stuffing gets knocked out of Ted because love wins the day for the humans and, come to think of it, for the bears as well."

","‎""TED"" is funny from the word Go!! It has been a long time since I laughed this hard. I thought ""Dictator"" was the most abusive film this year but TED beats it hands down! What makes the movie such a laugh riot is all the foul language coming out of a cutsie little teddy bear. The movie mocks the music, movies and TV shows (Flash Gordon especially) of the 80s and the 90s and takes a dig at some of the celebs (the one on Katie Perry & Taylor Lautner was too funny). <br/><br/>A lot of guest appearances (Sam Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Norah Jones to name a few). I was totally shocked by Norah Jones talking all nasty. Never expected that! Watch out for the fight sequence between Ted and Mark Wahlberg cos' it is so freaking awesome & funny! The dialogues were too racist and VERY abusive but if you can digest all that, the movie is F*ing hilarious!!

It is difficult to believe it is true even as good as mark walberg is. At some point in movie, you start to think, even after you watch great performance by mark walberg ""This is not possible.

Mark Walberg is good actor, but it is still impossible to believe even mark walberg and toy beer can have real conversation.<br/><br/>So if you like movies like this where real people talk to toys then maybe you will like this movie.

"RossRivero99","9","0","2","6 May 2019"," Downright hysterical
","Seth MacFarlane's ""Ted"" is without a doubt one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen, as well as one o fthe funniest R rated comedies I've seen so far that has a lot of laughs and with it a lot of heart to it as well. Mark Wahlberg stars as John Bennett a seemingly ordinary guy who as a child didn't really have any friends and made a wish that his stuffed teddy bear could talk which came true and ever since that moment have done everything together and have been the best of friends which is shown in the beginning of this movie. Then in the present day John is now 35 years old, still lives with Ted(voiced by Seth MacFarlane), acts like a child, lives a hedonistic lifestyle, and on top of that has been dating his girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) for the last four years and lately has been in a complicated relationship because she feels like Ted is preventing them from moving forward in their relationship and gives him an ultimatum which is that either Ted leaves the house or she leaves him which he doesn't take very well. Then after that Ted has a party at his house with a bunch of women which convinces John to tell Ted that he should move into his own apartment and find a job somewhere, then after Ted moves into his apartment John gets so bored without him in his daily life like a child gets nightmares without sleeping with his/her favorite stuffed animal. Then one night John and Lori are invited to her boss's party when right smack in the middle of it all Ted tells John to come over for just a few minutes just to see a childhood hero of theirs which happens to be the guy who played Flash Gordon in the '80s which leads to all sorts of craziness which has to be seen in order to be believed. Then after John comes back to the party Lori knows that he went over to Ted's and is convinced that he loves Ted more than he loves her which leads to their breakup. John then blames Ted for the destruction of their relationship and end up hating each other and not talking to each other for quite some time. Then after all of that Ted finds himself in a creepy obsession with a little boy who wants him and his father (Giovanni Ribisi) who claims to be a # 1 fan. That is all I'm going to explain at length in terms of the story because everything that happens is too importantto mention and should be left to be seen for itself without being spoiled. Seth MacFarlane is arguably one of the best comedy writers of the last two decades and not only demonstrates those talents here but also brings in a sympathetic lens to the characters in the story. The movie of course some moments with huge laughs and some emotional moments. This was MacFarlane's first movie as a director and is very accomplished in terms of a modern comed, it's not one of the greatest films ever made but if you love shows like ""Family Guy' you'll love this movie."
"GiraffeDoor","8","0","2","17 April 2019"," Oh Seth...Thank you for existing.
","Being an admirer of Seth Macfarlane for a long time, I was hopeful that one day we would get to see him actually make a movie.<br/><br/>If you also enjoy the irreverent styling of Macfarlane but want to see it embodied as one linear narrative that balances the absurd in an otherwise mostly realistic universe then you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Beneath the laughs we actually have quite a thoughtful story of a grown needing to choose between his new relationships tempting him to adulthood and his youth.<br/><br/>Ted is an unbelievably likeable character and comedy vehicle that is also able to evoke great sympathy as a thing literally made for playtime yet must try and make it as humdrum adult.<br/><br/>One of the few movies that have genuinely made me tear up. A beautiful narrative on the themes of friendship and ageing."

The movie has pretty good acting since Mark Wahlberg is the main character of the movie.The movies main female character is Mila Kunis who plays Meg in family guy and the teddy bear is Seth MacFarlane himself.

Ribisis character Donny is a very evil man who wants Ted and Kidnaps Ted to give him to his evil son Robert played by Aedin Mincks.

","I like MacFarlane. 'Family Guy' was one of the first animations to genuinely make me laugh, his profane use of comedy felt refreshing. Over ten years later, his comedy hasn't changed and those who grew up with his crude dialogue have now become fully adjusted. This leaves Ted feeling somewhat empty, despite the fluffy stuffing. A young lonely boy wishes for his teddy bear to be his friend, one night his anthropomorphic toy comes to life where they still remain best friends 27 years later. However, the inclusion of a girlfriend rapidly causes a rift between this friendship. ""Bros before hoes"" is the theme here, an everlasting common message in buddy comedies. Romances do not last forever (unless you're lucky), so stick with the bromance and everything will be great. Except, the whole point of the film is diminished in the last act when both the romance and bromance are equally balanced. But let's not read too much into the core of this comedy, after all it features a talking teddy bear. MacFarlane's feature length directorial debut contains an extreme amount of creativity and technical flair. The motion capture was decent, directing was solid where he dabbles into a variety of styles (including a car chase) and the acting was fine. The problem with MacFarlane is that he just does too much. His famed voice acting career has left his talent specifically trademarked to Peter Griffin, so for him to voice a teddy bear makes it rather difficult to not envisage the lead character of 'Family Guy'. Then he also decides to write the script, which unfortunately didn't make me laugh once. This shouldn't come as a surprise to most, but despite the promised obscenity it felt rather placid. This is simply because we are used to his style of comedy now, he needs to evolve. Profanity isn't funny anymore, intelligent wittiness is what cracks people up. I shan't be saying ""I love you"" to this film due to its lacklustre screenplay and outdated message, yet it still remains watchable."

While many criticize Ted for its plain dumbness and offensive humor, i believe that those factors contribute to the story of.

On the other hand, I think Blazing Saddles is the funniest movie ever made, including - maybe especially - all the n-bombs, fart jokes and inside references. So there should have been something here for me to enjoy. But there wasn't. Ted is a mean-spirited, vulgar, obnoxious movie. I didn't laugh once. In fact, this movie managed to make un-funny the only thing guaranteed in life to make every man laugh - seeing another guy taking a shot to the groin. It's depressing to think this movie has brought in more than $500M worth of business and spawned a sequel.

Seth MacFarlane did a quite impressive job in here, as a voice cast for Ted but also the producer-director- writer of this movie.. And the most wonderful thing about this movie is : Seth takes the audiences from the starting point of John-Ted relationship, and then their highest point when they are already thunder buddies, then lowest point when John leaving Ted for Lori.. And all of that wrapped with a beautiful soundtrack from Norah Jones that really blows the audiences away.. Overall, I really like this movie.."
"Demetrius_Stork","8","0","2","16 December 2015"," Overrated but good for some quality laughs
","I feel often times the term overrated is used, or rather taken, too harshly. When I say that Ted is overrated, it does not mean that it's a bad movie. In fact, I really enjoyed Ted as far as a Seth MacFarlane creation.<br/><br/>First things first, the music in this movie is fantastic. This isn't usually something relevant in a comedy film, but it simply needs to be addressed. Nominated for an Oscar, Walter Murphy and Seth MacFarlane do an incredible job on the film's premier song, ""Everybody Needs A Best Friend."" Macfarlane has always been a great songwriter and it really shows in this production.<br/><br/>Another really strong factor in this movie is the animation with the teddy bear, Ted. Animation really can do incredible things and it's remarkable how good Ted looks in this movie. Honestly there are scenes where I actually forget that Ted isn't really there because even though the idea is obviously imaginary, the bear fits in perfectly with the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is what I'd call a mixed bag. MacFarlane does a great job voice acting for Ted and Mark Wahlberg does fine in his role as Ted's best friend John as well. The supporting cast is all good too; the villain in particular I really enjoyed, as well as Patrick Warburton's character and Mark Wahlberg's boss. The only performance I couldn't get behind was Mila Kunis's. For some reason, her acting has never done anything for me. I've always found her to be just sort of a pretty face. Think a female pre-Dallas Buyer's Club Matthew Mcconaughey.<br/><br/>The ending of this film is sort of lame. I find that MacFarlane usually struggles with writing the sentimental scenes and it's certainly prevalent in Ted. It's a sappy ending and it just doesn't really fit into the sort of Black Comedy style of this movie. Sentimental moments in Black Comedy CAN work, but only if they're done perfectly. Unfortunately for MacFarlane, this is not. But it's not that bad and kudos to MacFarlane for at least trying hard to bring a quality sad scene, because it's obvious that MacFarlane clearly gave it his all in this one at least.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the most important aspect of any comedy movie, the comedy. To be honest this movie made me laugh HARD. MacFarlane definitely has the ability to create funny scenarios and he shows it very much so here. But with this also comes the main problem in all of MacFarlane's writing, the cut-aways. This has always been an issue for me, sure I loved the cut-away bits in Family Guy the first 1000 times but by now the trope is simply getting old. This is interesting too because MacFarlane has shown that he can, in fact, create good comedy just from a story, which works a lot better. Just simply the fact that a Teddy Bear is a pot-smoking, cursing, Boston meat-head is already hilarious in it's own right. But yet Seth MacFarlane still insists on using this cut-away style of humor abundantly in his movies, and more often than not it just doesn't work. MacFarlane can also be a hit or miss at times. When the jokes work, they work great and are good for tons of laughs. But when they don't work, they seem to go on forever and fall really flat and that happens a few times in this film. But to Macfarlane's credit, he did a good job overall, in my opinion. There were certainly more ""ha ha"" moments than eye rolling moments by far.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not great, but I would definitely recommend. It's certainly a hilarious movie that has some really quality moments. You might enjoy some of the cameos as well. Seriously how did Seth MacFarlane and Patrick Stewart become friends? I've always found that amusing. But anyway, go see this movie, you'll be cracking up and will probably find yourself saying, ""Wow I can't believe a Teddy Bear just said that."""
"brandonking-25889","10","0","4","17 November 2015"," Awesome comedy
","Ted is a movie that presents a powerful use of symbolism in the film industry, which I have almost never seen. By observing John's immaturity and his constant struggle to keep his inner child alive in his parallel reality, I was witnessing the presented internal struggle of one man between immaturity and adulthood. All of us can understand this relation, because in each of us lies a teddy bear, a major symbol of our childhood. The best comedies are the ones that have an element of truth. Mark Wahlberg showed again more than a solid, well-painted confusion between John's best friend and the woman he loves.Ted was fun but also a learning experience, it is impossible to miss the essence of the message of this film!"

Some of the jokes are not funny, true, and the story does have some clichés in it, but if you watch it without expecting too much from it, then you'll have a good time. So 5 out of 10 for Ted, because, even though it is about a teddy bear, it doesn't fail to entertain grown ups."

","Seth MacFarlane (director, writer, producer, star) has proved time and time and again that he is a comedic mastermind, and Ted is one more testament to this truth. Full of knee-slappers, the film covers the story of a thirty- five-year-old boy who just will not grow upand his talking teddy bear. Mark Wahlberg co-stars in this comedy, along with Mila Kunis, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jessica Barth. The ensemble works well together and every joke hits, making for a winning comedy. Thirty-five year old John Bennet (Wahlberg) has his ideal living arrangement in Boston, with his best friend and his girlfriend of four years. Ted (MacFarlane), the talking teddy bear who came into John's life when the boy was eight, also loves the arrangement – he lives rent-free and can get into all kinds of mischief with his pal. Lori (Kunis), on the other hand, wants her boyfriend to grow up and has determined that the source of his immaturity is (you'll never guess) his teddy bear. She demands that Ted move out and that John take their relationship seriously. John finds it hard to let go of being so close to his companion, and things get even more complicated when Ted's stalker, Donny (Ribisi), wants to purchase the bear for his disturbing son to play with. I'm in love with the casting for Ted; MacFarlane, Wahlberg, and Kunis all have fantastic chemistry. Although he's interacting with a CGI Teddy Bear, Wahlberg pulls off the ""best friend""-vibe splendidly. The conversation between John and Ted flows naturally, with both MacFarlane and Wahlberg showing their aptitude for their respective parts. Wahlberg portrays the contrasts in John very well. The audience can tell that he needs to grow up and get his life together, but his humor and sensitivity make it clear that his heart is in the right place. Kunis' character is different from the stereotypical female-in-a-male-driven-comedy; Lori clearly loves John, but she is also goal-oriented and demands be treated right by him. Kunis does a great job at showing Lori's torn emotions when she realizes she is unhappy with the way her relationship is going. During the film, the audience sees John and Lori during both happy times and arguments. In both circumstances, the writing and the acting is spot on. The music is very unique in this film, with a couple original songs. Norah Jones and Seth MacFarlane co-wrote the opening number, ""Everybody Needs a Best Friend"" (link), and Walter Murphy composed the score. Some of the tracks in Murphy's score have a jazzy swing to them, which feels appropriate for a MacFarlane film. The music is absolutely a pleasant surprise in Ted. The script, acting, and music were all great in Ted, but the film wasn't completely spectacular. Although I enjoyed MacFarlane's performance, I couldn't help but be bored by the fact that Ted had the same voice as Peter Griffin. I'm not sure why MacFarlane didn't come up with a unique voice for Ted, but I was not a huge fan of his recycling. Overall, the biggest flaw I can find in this film is its predictability. There truly are no surprises in Ted; everything that you would expect to happen in a film like this does indeed. Despite these minor drawbacks, I'd call the movie a success. I'll come right out and say that I'm a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane. The man has a great sense of humor, he's a talented voice actor, and a fantastic jazz artist. Ted has ""Seth MacFarlane"" written all over it, in the best way. Still, putting my bias aside, this film is hilarious and perfect for anyone in need of a good laugh."

","I came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time, but I sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind! I was on the verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude. So instead I sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where Ted and John (Mark Wahlberg)have a big fight (surprise surprise) and John's girlfriend dumps him (another surprise -_-) it's just a barrage of clichés to be honest. The humour of the film was well below mediocre. I didn't understand some the jokes because they were referencing a celebrity that I have never heard about. The other jokes are about drugs, swearing and getting drunk. The only time I managed a laugh was when Ted was pretending to be a retard .

","I really struggled with Ted (short for Tedious). Clearly aimed at the teenage market, the humour such as it is, takes you back to the smut laughed about behind the school toilets. Foul mouthed, although simultaneously attempting to be cute, Ted the teddy bear friend of Mark Wahlberg (who should know better), pretty much bored me silly within half an hour. I'm not sure that I'll be able to take Mark Wahlberg all that seriously as an actor any more after this drivel, which is a shame, as he's been so good in movies like The Fighter and The Departed. Mila Kunis is wasted. I thought I saw Ryan Reynolds, an actor I've taken little notice of, popping up for no apparent reason and Tom Skerritt also embarrasses himself at the end. Norah Jones, a singer whose albums I've collected, also disappoints in a sort of guest appearance and I'd rather not have spoilt my image of her as a good singer. A complete mess this one and unbelievably they've made Ted 2 although I couldn't see Mila Kunis's name in the cast list when I quickly looked through it. Wise girl."
"willcundallreview","5","0","1","1 February 2015"," A comedy with inconsistent hit and misses
","Rating-5/10<br/><br/>Ted is an animated bear who starts off being cute and cuddly and ends up being a party mad, foul mouthed well, still a cuddly bear. Ted has it's funny moments and laughter can be had throughout but I just couldn't see this as that THAT funny and some humour is wasted and lazy. It's not badly written or directed just not good enough in the end and you can feel this a comedy, not on par with others or things Seth MacFarlane has done before.<br/><br/>There are parts that can be enjoyed and very much so and the movies fascination with Flash Gordon is fairly funny and provides some great cutaways to the characters pasts. Mark Wahlberg I felt was likable in his role as John Bennett and acts fairly well for a comedy, his serious side and his funny side mix well and he ends up probably the best out of the various performers. I enjoyed the performances involved and no one acts poor really at all and one person who stands out is Giovanni Ribisi who should have been seen more because of his wildly funny interests which form a very funny moment of the movie.<br/><br/>With this kind of comedy you really have to like Seth MacFarlane's brand of funny and it doesn't harm watching a little of his shows before hand. It does feel in parts like an episode of Family Guy was used to create this but even if it was, it has it's moments of laughter. Look I think MacFarlane can be a top comedian but with projects like Ted, it just isn't sharp enough and almost crosses the line in terms of over the top dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>Despite what I say there are moments to be had where laughter can flow and I particularly liked a certain cameo involved where many things are smashed. I wasn't so keen actually on Ted the bear and felt characters such as John's boss and various others were actually the best thing about this, with MacFarlane's writing skill coming in to play and making something work. <br/><br/>I have to say with this that some jokes made can be offensive and although I think comedy can touch anything, there are times when the offending doesn't quite make sense and although as well we can see MacFarlane is playing a joke here, I couldn't help feel gay jokes and misogyny were either unneeded or miss timed completely. In fact on that point if you are easily offended then don't watch it, it's a not a good enough excuse to say it offends you if you yourself watched it knowing it may offend.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it deserved a grade of 5/10 and a strong and high one of that, in word terms it felt pretty average but again, a strong kind of average and not far at all from being an OK movie. This is a piece where 15 year olds are expected to laugh and elders expected to find it immature but watching it and thinking back on it, it has it's moments and with a type of humour that is hard to sometimes laugh at, it seems to at least do it partly well. At the time of writing this Ted 2 is in the works and although I wouldn't and won't expect anything of it, with bits of MacFarlane's skill and many a slight tinkering in the script department it could be very funny so I will be interested to see just how that goes down."

","In my honest opinion, Ted is a really funny film but I was rather surprised as to how rude it actually was going to be. Ted is the first ever 15 rated film I've watched and it is probably one of the funniest films I have ever watched. That beats Mr Bean's Holiday as probably my favourite film of all time. It was funny because when Ted was with John, they'd always be trying to be high on drugs. <br/><br/>I really liked Ted because it had some rather funny jokes in it such as ""F*** you thunder, you can suck my dick!"". At the time of watching the film, I was very surprised as it was quite vulgar (i.e. reference to sex). <br/><br/>Overall, I really liked the film 'Ted' because it had lots of comical jokes in it but also it ended with a happy ending which is always nice!"

Don't go into this movie thinking it's going to be an Oscar winner because it's not. However if your up for a great comedy and night in this is your film. The plot focuses on Jonny and his Teddy bear Ted. It shows you the changes they have to go through from childhood then to growing up. I believe the 2 characters are realistic in what they are and go through real life situations. These situations are work, relationships and family. The jokes and comedy that are included are very good,they are not for the easily offended which is what I think makes this comedy real. Just because there is a talking bear in it it, it doesn't hold back and I believe it's what makes this film more real. Overall funny movie and I would recommend."

"alindsay-al","8","0","1","18 December 2014"," A great comedy that will be remembered
","Now I love Family Guy and I think Seth MacFarlane is a creative genius so when this film was announced and that he was voicing Ted I knew that this film was going to be a hit and boy was I right. This premise sees an 8 year old boy wish his teddy was alive and it obviously does. Now at 35 years old he is still with Ted and starts to realise that Ted may be holding him back. Now the character of Ted is just awesome and McFarlane's voice was perfect to truly encapsulate this raunchy teddy bear that has some of the best one liners ever. The supporting cast was really good too with Mark Walhberg delivering a really funny performance with his chemistry with the teddy bear and helping really add to the film. Mila Kunis was also good in the film with her dialogue being funny and her chemistry with Walhberg being good too. Giovanni Ribisi also had a good performance as the bad guy and added a lot to the film. The one I didn't really like was Kunis boss who I thought didn't have to be in the film at all. The story is okay with the premise being crazy but I think some of the dramatic moments did work and added to the film but a lot of the film is just random scenes and doesn't add anything to the film. The script is fantastic with all dialogue working and all the lines especially from Ted being hilarious. The style is okay with some of the crazy aspects working but also some of it also seeming just too ridiculous to take seriously. Overall this is a hilarious film that if you are not offended easily is definitely worth a watch."

","In 1985, John Bennett is a lonely child who dearly wished for his new Christmas gift, a large teddy bear named Ted, to come to life to be his friend. That wish coincided with a falling star and Ted became a fully mobile sentient being. John's parents got over the shock, word of the miracle spread and Ted was briefly a celebrity.<br/><br/>In 2012, John and Ted are still staunch, if immature, companions enjoying a hedonistic life even while John is in a relationship with office worker Lori Collins. As their fourth anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but feels he can't move ahead with his life with Ted around. John is resistant to making his lifelong companion leave, but is finally persuaded to act when the couple discover Ted at home with four prostitutes, one of whom had defecated on the floor during a game of truth or dare.<br/><br/>John finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where his grossly irresponsible behavior gets him promoted and acquainted with co-worker Tami-Lynn. Regardless, Ted and John still spend most of their time together, which frustrates Lori when she discovers John has been skipping work to do so while using her for his excuses. Things start to come to a head when Lori and John are invited to a party put on by Lori's lecherous manager Rex, and Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam Jones, the star of their favorite movie, Flash Gordon. Although John arrives with the intention of spending only a few minutes, he gets caught up in the occasion which goes completely out of control. Lori discovers John there and breaks up with him in a rage. At that point, John blames Ted for ruining his life and tells him to stay away.<br/><br/>Eventually, Ted and John confront each other about their ruined friendship and manage to reconcile after a destructive brawl in John's hotel room. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges with an old lover, singer Norah Jones, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during her concert. Although John's performance proves an embarrassment, Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment after being disgusted by Rex's sneering of him. Ted comes clean to Lori about his role in John's lapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she can talk to him. Lori is persuaded, but moments after she leaves, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, a crazed stalker who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted the toy of his brutishly destructive son, Robert.<br/><br/>Ted distracts Robert and reach a phone to contact John, but is soon recaptured. Realizing that Ted is in danger, John and Lori find Donny's residence and chase him and Robert to rescue Ted. The chase leads to Fenway Park, where John knocks out Robert, but during the chase Ted is damaged and falls onto the field torn completely in half. A police car arrives, forcing Donny to flee. As John and Lori gather his stuffing, Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori, as the magic that gives him life fades away.<br/><br/>Unable to accept his best friend's death, Lori and John return to her apartment to attempt repairing him, but it proves useless. That night, Lori, feeling profoundly guilty over her role in this tragedy, makes a wish on a falling star. The next morning, Ted is magically restored and the trio reconcile with Ted encouraging John and Lori to resume their relationship.<br/><br/>With that resolution, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister) and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own, with his misbehavior getting him somehow promoted to grocery store manager. Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease. Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh. Donny gets arrested for kidnapping a plush toy. The charges are eventually dropped because they sound too stupid. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight and goes on to become Taylor Lautner."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","16 June 2014"," 'Ted' is a killer comedy!
","Seth MacFarlane finally enters the film industry and takes a break from television. If your familiar with his work, you know he can create some raunchy and daring shows. Imagine what he can do in cinema! His first feature film is called 'Ted.' Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett, a car dealership worker who at a young boy received a magical teddy bear as a Christmas gift. Now he's in his thirties and still has the teddy bear, only they both switched from sweet and cute to lazy, rude, and rambunctious. The two are best buddies and are absolute bums. Ted is voiced by MacFarlane and constantly smokes pot, makes jokes, and is a total bum. The plot moves from just pure fun and games to a little melodramatic due to John having a relationship with a woman named Laurie, who is played sweetly funny by Mila Kunis. This film is a total party. It's a great film to just enjoy and laugh your face off at 2:00 A.M. MacFarlane is even more raunchy and vulgar than his characters are in family guy, and is absolutely hilarious as Ted. Mark Wahlberg is hilarious as well, and him and Ted have a great buddy relationship. The main factor that makes this comedy so special is the originality. Most comedies these days have the same recycled jokes and plots that they become repulsive and not funny. 'Ted' is pure comedy creativity that makes a great time and has lots of fun laughs and outrageous scenarios that make this the ultimate popcorn comedy film."

He gets his wish and Ted stays with him until adulthood, which causes more than a few complications with his long-suffering girlfriend.<br/><br/>If you didn't know, Ted is Seth (Family Guy/American Dad/The Cleveland Show) MacFarland's first big screen outing and the bottom line is that, if you've seen and enjoy any of his shows, you'll probably enjoy Ted. His writing is not meant to be subtle. Some of it can be shocking, other bits offensive. He (like Family Guy) has an 'open insult' policy, where no one is beyond being made fun of. Although he does cover some controversial topics, he mainly makes fun of eighties movies and TV, plus some healthy ribbing of B-list celebrities.<br/><br/>It's crude, but it's funny.

His wish comes true and at first Ted is a sensation but like with most things people lose interest and Ted just becomes part of John's & girlfriend Lori(Kunis) everyday life. A bit too much of a part for Lori and it soon puts a strain on their relationship. Thrown into the mix is Donny(Ribisi) and his son who stalk Ted wanting to take him for their own. There are some really funny moments & some superbly placed cameos which I wont mention so as not to spoil it. It pays particular respect to some eighties icons and fads.

","Who would have thought this film, Ted would be as funny as it is. Not a knack against Seth MacFarlane, but I didn't think Family Guy-like humor would last for two hours. But thanks to a hilarious, witty, though perhaps inconsistent script, this film is able to work and ends up being a likable comedy. This concept of girl vs. growing up has been done before a countless number of times, but not with a foul-mouthed teddy bear for sure and that gives this film some originality.<br/><br/>This is the first foray into film for Seth MacFarlane and for the most part, he makes a very good and hilarious film. John Bennett happens to be the most hated kid in Boston, so he wishes for a new friend. His wish is granted when his teddy bear comes alive. Now many years later, his manhood becomes put at test when he has to choose between Ted and his long-time girlfriend, Lori.<br/><br/>The acting is really good especially in spite of working with a puppet. Mark Wahlberg rarely works in comedy if at all and I think he does a good job in this film shedding his macho, tough-guy image here. Mila Kunis is good as Lori who desperately wants him to grow up. Giovanni Ribisi is a bit creepy as the man who wants Ted for his son. Finally, MacFarlane adds a bit of his Peter Griffin to Ted's voice which actually get it's own joke in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Ted is a hilarious comedy though it may overstay it's welcome for just perhaps a few minutes. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film and I laughed very hard. People may find this mean-spirited, but it's Seth MacFarlane we are talking about here. There are many references to Flash Gordon here including a surprise appearance. This is a good recommend for anyone looking to laugh. I rate this film 9/10."

A word of advice:despite the ever-precense of a cute teddy bear, this might not be for kids, and if they do see it, make sure the parents are with them due to the persistent crude and drug-related humor.<br/><br/>The movie starts off when an outcast kid wishes his new teddy bear were real, and of course it comes true. The bear becomes a celebrity overnight, which unfortunately fades out soon. Many years later, the kid is an adult in age only, the bear is still his friend and constant companion and is also foul-mouthed and loves to dabble in drugs and rather gross stuff, and it tests the guy's 4-year relationship with his girlfriend. Of course, a bad guy and his son have their eyes set on Ted, and Ted pushes his owner to his limits, and the owner does the same to the girlfriend.<br/><br/>You will love the ending.

","I've been in the mood for R-rated comedies lately, and I've been lucky to find a string of them that I've all enjoyed. Ted was one of the better ones in that it didn't totally deflate in the final act, although it did start to feel clichéd and conventional. The early scenes are funny as John and Ted have to grow up and get separate lives. Ted getting the job at the grocery store might be my favorite bits. Mark Wahlberg's character gets dangerously close to unlikable--I liked it better when he was playing it straight as opposed to trying to make his girlfriend laugh by acting like he was twelve. I know that was the point, but I thought they showed it better through his lack of ambition than his childish humor. The subplot with the kidnapper and his kid doesn't pay off except for the scenes in their home. The chase at the end and the wrap up had some good lines by Ted, but felt too much like a thousand other movies to be interesting. Ted himself looked amazing-- as accomplished as anything in CG or animation. However, I found myself really wishing someone else had done the voice. It was distracting that he sounded so much like another well known character. I think he needed his own unique sound, but that seems to be less of a problem as I rewatch it over. I would definitely check out a Ted part 2. I don't know Ted's lines were all in the script or if the voice actor did a lot of improvising, but his dialog was the highlight and what kept the whole thing together. Also, I'd like to see Joel McHale as this sleazy villain in every movie from now on. 6 out of 10."

His wish comes true and Ted becomes world famous, even appearing on the Johnny Carson Show.

It's definitely low brow broad grade school humor. There's nothing subtle about it. No detailed explanation is given for Ted and none is really needed. The sad part of the partnership is that Ted overshadows Mark Wahlberg in acting skills. Mila Kunis is no wallflower and she can keep up with the boys.

","...Seth McFarlane cannot get over the idea that ridiculing racism, sexism, and homophobia can be accomplished by doing some kind of ""meta"" mumbo jumbo that lets you still make jokes at the expense of those who are non-white, non-Christian, non-heterosexual, and non-male. And it's too bad, because this is a very funny movie. But unless you are a white heterosexual male of a certain age, you might struggle to get past the offensive stuff and miss an otherwise very funny, moving story, with great acting and directing, and superb comic timing. Considering how well this movie did at the box office, I can only assume that if McFarlane stopped the extreme offensive stuff, his future movies would do even better, because he'd have an audience that includes people that are not just white men raised in the 80s. Every time the offensive stuff popped up in ""Ted,"" it was superfluous, and actually stopped the momentum of the story. (A flat, unfunny bit involving the Patrick Warburton character comes to mind, and the payoff later in the movie was not worth it. A cameo character involved in the bit was momentarily funny, but there are so many other ways to achieve the level of humor he was aiming for without stopping the momentum of his story and offending a significant proportion of the American public in one fell swoop.) It's clear he can be hysterically funny without the offensive material, so why interrupt a great, funny story with stuff that alienates up to half of his potential viewers? And make no mistake, the offensive jokes are as superfluous as the related humor is necessary to the story. The jokes that are specific to the story work without fail and are great. (Including one that was the most extreme scatological bit I've ever seen, but I still found hysterical.) The offensive jokes do not work and are just not worth it. The best humor takes aim at those with the wherewithal to handle it, not those who are already marginalized. I've read McFarlane making the excuse is that he's poking fun at a society that allows these issues to marginalize people. Given that the story is about maturity coming when one learns to take responsibility for one's own behavior, his excuse comes across as lazy, immature and extremely ironic. I challenge Seth McFarlane to make a movie that does not require his fans to defend him, but can appeal to everyone. Take a lesson from Chris Rock, who knows how to engage in topical humor without cutting down those who are already victimized by society. And learn to write jokes without using the word ""rape."""

","This movie was just funny as hell like funnier than family guy even though the voice of ted is peter Griffin from family guy. There are some rude scenes during the film but it was just funny as hell. The plot was interesting and funny at the same time the jokes are crack up and it also had other actors that were from family guy like Jo swat-son the police man in a wheel chair. Ryan Reynolds also appeared in the film as well which was interesting. What also surprised me was the amount of swears in the film like F**K, S**t and many other bad swear words. But that OK because Seth Macfarlen always has swears in his TV shows and movies. Over all I thought it was interesting most of the time Ted was either being funny, Drunk, taking drugs or fighting a duck. Over all I would recommend people seeing this film that are fans of family guy."
"Mr_PCM","8","0","2","17 March 2013"," Funny despite itself, and oddly enjoyable
","Ted is rude, crude, full of crass humour and 'clever' references, self-aware to the point where the characters do all but wink at the camera, and absolutely ludicrous. Yet it is this acceptance of what it is, and complete lack of loftier ambitions, both genuinely funny and actually endearing in a bizarre kind of way. <br/><br/>The premise is so simple it's genius: A boy wishes his teddy bear would come to life, and by a miracle that is exactly what happens, and the boy and the bear promise to be friends for ever. But rather than a childhood friendship story, Ted flashes forward to what happens when the boy grows up, and the bear ages along with him. What we see is the now grown-up Johnny (Mark Wahlberg) living with his long term girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and the eponymous bear (voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane), who is now a foul-mouthed, weed-smoking and generally hard-living waster. The plot then (such as it is) leads to a somewhat obvious theme of learning to grow up and take responsibility.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the paper-thin predictable plot only seems to serve to detract rather than add to the film's premise, which in itself grows slightly wearing after a while. Certainly there is a great novelty value in seeing a grown man eating, drinking, talking and fighting a talking teddy bear, and in hearing the bear swear and tell vaguely racially offensive jokes, but the novelty starts to wear off when the film tries to enter the more serious middle third. Fart jokes and an actual reference to Family Guy's Peter Griffin all serve to point out that this actually is all rather derivative after all. No doubt fans of MacFarlane's earlier work will love it (and will cry shame that MacFarlane remains ""misunderstood""), but they would no doubt have watched it anyway. And therein lies the problem. This almost feels like a feature-length live-action version of a Family Guy episode, which might be great for some, but it is unlikely to win any new fans to MacFarlane's work. <br/><br/>Most of the characterization is very simple and 2-dimensional, with Wahlberg himself, for all the film's message of taking responsibility and growing up, not actually developing much as the film goes on, leaving the audience to wonder why on earth the similarly-bland Mila Kunis is with him in the first place. The rest of the supporting cast are little more than paint-by-numbers stereotypes, particularly Joel McHale as Lori's sleazy boss, while the underused Giovanni Ribisi could have been something interesting, had his wannabe-bear owner Donny been given more than a few minutes of screen time here and there. However, Patrick Stewart's opening and closing voiceovers do provide some genuine laughs, and hearing Captain Picard/Professor Xavier swear is quite an eye- (and ear-) opening experience! <br/><br/>Having said all that, Ted does contain a large number of genuinely funny lines (even if a lot of them do appear in the trailers) and did produce a few laugh-out-loud moments, particularly with the numerous references to 80s movies, although sense of taste and political correctness may need to be left at the door. A liberal sprinkling of the F-word (and isolated stronger swearing) ensures that this film should definitely not be mistaken for a family-friendly film. In the end, Wahlberg and Kunis do not need to do a great deal, and allowing themselves to be out-acted by a computer-generated teddy bear in a predictable growing-up plot line, while slightly embarrassing for their CVs, somehow does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. There is something about the predictability, and seeing the friendship endure between Johnny and Ted that is both enjoyable and somehow strangely comforting. <br/><br/>Just like a teddy bear."

","""Ted"" most definitely has some laugh out loud moments, and overall I enjoyed it. Sadly though, there is an overabundance of scatological jokes and other offensive material. While I am a woman with a sense of humour, I found a lot of the lines to be outrageously sexist. Of course, I don't take this movie seriously; it's about a talking teddy bear. Still though, I think that Seth McFarlane has gotten a little out of hand. There are some scenes that just made me ask, ""WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CROSS THAT LINE?"". Those are scenes that I would skip over if I watched this again. Giovanni Ribisi and the boy who plays his pudgy son are hilarious, with their Kathy Bates in ""Misery""-type characters. The sex-scenes leave me perplexed, because I do not understand how those acts are anatomically possible, considering that one participant lacks the body parts necessary to engage in said act.

","Creator of popular shows such as Family Guy and American Dad, Seth MacFarlane leaps on to the big screen with the comedy, Ted. A young boy's wish brings a teddy bear to life and an unbreakable bond between the two is formed. However, as they grow up, life creeps in to their wholesome life as Ted becomes a washed out child star while his friend, played by Mark Wahlberg is in a job going no where. The college mentality between the two friends puts a strain on Wahlberg's relationship with the stunning Mila Kunis, forcing him to make a tough choice.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, known more for his action and intense roles has transitioned in to comedy rather successfully and doesn't disappoint in this feature. Kunis, tagged the sexiest woman alive by esquire, has a long history of working with MacFarlane and plays her role adequately. As Ted, MacFarlane will keep you laughing and all the 80s references are icing for those who remember that era.<br/><br/>With a host of amusing cameos, MacFarlane hits another home run with this refreshing comedy that will undoubtedly spawn a sequel.

","Finally a comedy that I laughed out loud at more times than I can remember, I can't remember a comedy this good since 'I Love You Man.' Now for the criticisms, although I felt the writing and the jokes were very funny, it was the same story told a million times over, the only difference was the substitution of a teddy bear in place of a real person. Mark Wahlberg was good as usual (I do like his work) but as other people have said, I was a little distracted by his character being 35 when he clearly looks several years older than that, I'm 34 myself so I should know, just sayin'. The film may skew more towards the male audience with the humor and the lead male protagonist roles, also I didn't find the film overly offensive, the comic timing was good and the jokes were funny and not too over the top, definitely American humor if that is up your alley. Anyway, I have been putting off watching this film for a long time because I just found the premise weak and have been jaded by so many bad comedies releasing in recent memory, but I finally watched 'Ted' and I wasn't disappointed, best comedy in a long time."

","A funny movie that will make you laugh like you never laughed before. But why? The answer is simple. It's because it managed to use something that you've always been attached to when you were a kid, and twisted that a little to make something unique. That thing is a teddy bear toy. A teddy bear that talks! You won't hold yourself laughing after hearing any word that Ted is saying, even if it wasn't funny! It's the idea of having a speaking toy that is funny. Yeah we could say the same thing about Toy Story as well, but the argument here is that Ted managed to bring in the real-life element into the story. The story is still believable in every aspect. You won't feel the fantasy behind it, the character ""Ted"" is part of our lives and the movie goes as far as even involving him in social and professional activities. He is treated like a normal person, just like me and you. So when you see that on the screen and you start to comprehend the fact that he is just a soft toy, that's when you'll start laughing and laughing! <br/><br/>In summary, Ted is one of the funniest movies I would recommend to watch.

","Ted is not your typical movie. This much can be said about it but nor is it a movie that is so odd that it can't fit in any category. Ted is a comedy by Seth McFarlane directed by him and the main character's voice by him as well. Seth McFarlane is the creator and executive producer of Family Guy among other cartoons for the Fox network. If you enjoy Family Guy then you will very much enjoy Ted but let's start at the beginning.<br/><br/>Ted is the story of a magic wish that happen on Christmas Day. It's very simple there was a lonely boy who got a teddy bear and he wanted that teddy bear to come alive and it did. You would expect the teddy bear to grow up and be responsible and good citizen. Not this teddy bear not Ted. Ted smokes pot, swears, drinks beer, drinks alcohol and has sex with prostitutes. He is irresponsible and basically holds back his best friend played by Mark Wahlberg to being a perpetual teenager pothead. Thrown into the mix is the longtime girlfriend of Mark Wahlberg's character John Bennett. She wants John to grow up and he won't with Ted around. So starts the story when Ted after throwing a party with prostitutes is put in to his own apartment.<br/><br/>But this doesn't stop Ted and John from hanging out every day and getting high off the pot. So things go from bad to worse and Lori John's girlfriend ends up leaving him. Thrown into the mix is an obsessive-compulsive fan that wants Ted for his own and for his son. Ted does not end like you expected to but then again maybe it does I'll let you watch the movie and you can find out.<br/><br/>So given all that but the movie is from Seth McFarlane and it's rated R who is this movie for? Obviously it is not for someone under the age of 13 even though given the character Ted you might be tempted to think so know this is an adult movie for someone 16 or older. But given that it is an R-rated movie with lots of R-rated humor it is still a smart movie in many ways. Ted hits on all eight cylinders when it comes to the story, the pacing, the jokes ,the inside jokes and overall script. Also the special effects of which 90% of the movie has in it which is Ted because he's not real, he's all computer animated. This side of the movie is so seamless by the time the movie is over you almost believe that Ted was a real character. So given that Ted gets 9.5 out of 10. Enjoy the movie the DVD looks as great as the theatrical release and it's even better with some added footage. So enjoy yourself good night and good luck."

The film centre's around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who when he was eight had a magical wish that brought his teddy bear to life. Cut 27 years later John is in a relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) but he still is best friends with Ted (Seth MacFarlene) even though Lori feels that John should ditch Ted and finally grow up. During this time we see Ted's fame has passed and he gets stoned a lot with John but also there are some other weird characters in the story that do some strange things.<br/><br/>The film is like an extended version of the comedy styling Seth's TV shows are known for which did make me laugh at times but other times the comedy seemed to out there for me laugh along with which is usually what happens when I watch Seth's shows. Also I like how the film even with it's real teddy bear did not skip over that detail by making the whole world accept him but they allowed him to be famous which was a smart idea to make this film seem more real. The film did contain to many scenes that were not needed in the end because most of those scenes were just there for comedy and could have been cut to make the film move better. Also continuing plots just seemed to be done for comedic effect and did not translate well to a film that does not want to seem overly long.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays the older version of John and something I did not like about his performance was his accent maybe because I did not feel it was as believable as his previous attempts of the accent. Also Mark for me does not have screen charisma that wants me to care for his performance which distracts me from the story of the film. Seth MacFarlene is doing the voice-over for the teddy bear and sure he does have some funny moments but I was distracted by mostly everything he said because the voice he used was similar to the voice of Peter Griffin on Family Guy (which they also make a joke of in the film). Mila Kunis who I have liked in previous film just was given nothing to do except be the complaining girlfriend which I think she deserves more then that because unlike the other main actors she actually has some talent. The rest of the cast were forgettable supporting roles which just did not work for me.<br/><br/>The film was funny but unlike other comedies done in this style the characters in this film are not as well written that I actually feel for them when things happen to them. I can see why some jokes were included but I felt a lot of them could have been cut and small cameos did not have to be the film because they were just there to try shock the audience.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: C- (MVP: Seth MacFarlene)"

On the night he wishes for this, a shooting star happens to shoot by in the sky... the next morning the bear is alive. 20 years later, the bear and the boy have grown up and are partying hard.<br/><br/>The bear actually looks real through the whole movie. The effects are very good. I didn't notice Mark Wahlberg talking to himself at all... when he was talking to Ted, he was actually looking at him.<br/><br/>There are some really funny moments in this movie, most of which are in the trailer. There are some other really funny parts that are not in the trailer though. I was just hoping there would be more. It is a laugh out loud comedy, but there could have been more which I am hoping will be in Ted 2, which I have read is going to be made soon.<br/><br/>There are some great in jokes too... as well as some retro tunes (Knight Rider, naming one) and a classic guest star appearing in the form of Mr. Flash Gordon himself, Sam J.

","I watched the movie without prior knowledge and the very beginning did not look promising... But then, with Mark Wahlberg's (as grown up John Bennett) entrance, the things changed and lots of fun and irony filled the screen. The plot has its roots in romantic comedies and there are several related clichés, but used vocabulary and awkward supporting characters provide additional - and captivating - value. In spite of ""overlay"" fun and hectic events there are serious topics in place, including (but not limited to) growing up, letting go, commitment, love and/versus friendship, greed, jealousy, childhood influences.<br/><br/>It took some time for me to recognize Mark Wahlberg as a gifted actor - but I have admitted it for a while and the movie in question is no disappointment in that respect. In a convincing way, he can be both a tough action man and a pleasant childish ordinary guy. The director Seth McFarlane as Ted is also sweet and funny. Mila Kunis' role has the most clichés, but thanks to appearance and talent she does her part nicely and smoothly. Giovanni Ribisi is an atypical actor who could be used more frequently. <br/><br/>Soundtrack of the movie is well-picked and good as well, especially Queen and Nora Jones. Queen is one of my most favorite bands and all respective references make my day :) <br/><br/>Owing to the topics, Ted could easily be a family movie, but due to strong language it has been rated unsuitable for children/teens in many countries. So far, it the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time. Well done, Mr McFarlane and your team!"
"estreet-eva","5","0","1","21 November 2012"," Like a middling ""Family Guy"" episode
","In his directorial debut Seth MacFarlane does not wander far from the ""Family Guy"" tropes that made him wealthy. During a party montage the film even admits the voice MacFarlane uses for Ted mimics that he uses for the Peter Griffin character. It is these montages and asides that are MacFarlane's strong suit (basically ""Family Guy"" is an referential and observational stand-up comedy routine held together with a nominal plot) and their lack makes the film somewhat plodding. MacFarlane is forced to rely more so on plot which represents a challenge which he attempts by cobbling together a coming of age story about Mark Walberg's delinquent loser character and a talking teddy bear. Walberg feels much too put together to pull off the pot-smoking middle aged delinquent and Mila Kunis is much too one-note to be of consistent interest. The teddy bear character is just stupid and ultimately adds little to the proceedings a more conventional character couldn't have sufficed. However, some laughs pepper the over-long affair although they tend to be of the ""in December comes a very special day - the day the neighborhood kids beat up the Jewish kid"" variety. In short, watching back-episodes of the show on Hulu represents a better return on time."
"christophe92300","7","0","1","20 November 2012"," Enjoyable
","With Ted, MacFarlane managed to create a tale that seemed to be child oriented, but that is definitely for an adult audience.<br/><br/>The movie is riddled with references and parodies; the dialogues fly, and the caustic humor is enjoyable even though it is quite uneven qualitatively.<br/><br/>What can be blamed is the script, being easy and nice enough with this bland love story which contrasts with the quirkiness of the movie. MacFarlane could/should have really gone much further on that aspect.<br/><br/>The direction is very good, the teddy bear animation is top-notch, and some scenes render very well like the fight at the hotel."

Fame is fleeting, and as we flash forward to the now thirty five year old John Bennett, who has remained best friends with the pot smoking, foul mouthed bear, the film becomes a fairly routine romantic comedy. Mila Kunis is Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, who has grown tired of John and Ted's sophomoric and immature antics. She demands that he drop the sarcastic childhood toy and commit to her fully. The predictable breakup occurs, and a few mildly amusing scenes are used as filler, including a funny one with the actor Sam Jones from the campy ""Flash Gordon"" movie from yesteryear. Mark Wahlberg is easy going and he has good chemistry with Kunis on screen. The script is decent, but nothing new or different, other than the concept of a talking teddy bear. I give it a 7/10."

","I would like to preface this review by saying that I am not offended by anything, and cannot think of anything that has ever offended me in a film before ( except the scene at the end of Hostel 2, you know the one! ) and so that perhaps factors into my love of this film.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that of a young boy, aged 8, who gets a brilliant Teddy Bear for Christmas and wishes that it could talk to him as he has no friends. The wish comes true, and Ted is born.<br/><br/>The film takes place about 27 years later, when Ted and John have grown up and Ted has become an irreverent, crude and bloody hilarious character. The voice acting by Seth MacFarlane is fantastic as always ( huge Family Guy fan ) and the Boston accent is perfect. The story is pretty basic and predictable, but that is really irrelevant. Anyone who has watched Family Guy before will appreciate that the overall plot of the story is not important, it only serves as a springboard to launch a series of hilarious and rude jokes off of.<br/><br/>The cameos by assorted actors are great, Ryan Reynolds rocks up as a silent gay dude and Nora Jones appears as herself. The arrival of a much older Flash Gordon is also great, an excuse for a brilliant party montage.<br/><br/>All told, this movie really is not for everyone. It's not a classy or thoughtful movie, it's not the best acting in the world, but it delivers on what I wanted: A 2 hour long collection of awesome jokes and comedy, loosely tied together with a predictable plot and a giant teddy bear as the main protagonist. If you have a limited sense of humor, or take yourself, your gender, your race or your class too seriously then you will not enjoy this film. A sad indictment on you, and not this hilarious film."

","Well, since almost everyone I know had already seen this picture, as it became very famous in Brazil, I decided to give it a chance. As many people had advised me, this is surely a very American comedy, with some male chauvinist messages, so if you're a woman you won't probably enjoy this as much as your boyfriend. Characters are well developed, and it is good to see such a pretty woman in the main couple. Even thought story is at many times corny, and you feel like it's just another dumb comedy, sometimes you have strong laughs, such as the karaoke scene when Ted sings only the vowels-- albeit only me and my friend laughed out loud in that cinema. In the end, I can't affirm this is a great movie, because the story is pretty cheesy and sometimes ridiculous, but if you're looking for free laughs, this may be a good choice."

","I was very reluctant to the thought of liking this movie after seeing previews, hearing the general story, and hearing a bunch of positive reviews. This usually sets me up for a disaster and most people tend to like movies like that because others peer pressure them into doing so. This one turned out to be great! ""Ted,"" is a spin on the old boy with a teddy bear story. A young boy with no friends gets a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas and wishes it would become real so he could have a friend. The wish is granted, Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is born, and John Bennett (Mark Walhberg) has a stuffed friend to hang out while he grows into a man child. Soon John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) tires of the man/bear relationship and the man and the bear may have to part ways in order for John to grow up and have a big boy relationship.<br/><br/>The Good: This is a comedy, and a good one, that doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. The story is pretty much the same as any other romantic comedy, but not one that bores a man to death the way most of the others do. Call it a man's romantic comedy. The writing was great, and there were some scenes that were Hilario's. Many scenes in the beginning are what you would expect, but combined with the musical score the corniness factor of the movie actually makes it more amusing. This is not some super intelligent, artsy comedy, it is meant to be rude and crude, and makes for one of those great guilty pleasure movies.<br/><br/>The Bad: I can't say a lot of real bad things. Mostly the bad part is just the fact that this is sort of a basic story line, but then again for a mindless comedy, it is not intended to have any deep meaning. There is also a lot of vulgar language and references in this one, so definitely put the kids to bed before watching. Sometimes a teddy bear just isn't for kids. Personally I didn't mind the profanity laced dialog but there are many that may be offended or it may not me their cup of Teddy, but hey, if you like, or can stand it, go for it because this one is fun.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 out of 10. The story is basic but has an original take. It is mindless comedy fun and it has a lot of laughs. It was one of the funnier movies I have seen in awhile.

","The film is adorable because of the talking bear. And this is alone a reason to watch it. No need to go to the theaters. The DVD will also give the same pleasure. The story is average. You should not expect anything more than laughter which for many is genuine. The adult talk that he does in the entire film was hilarious. The story is about a boy who wished for a talking teddy on a Christmas night and he got it. Than starts a normal journey of a person who has this talking teddy ever since which makes him special. Nothing happening in his life is so interesting or worth watching but of course the teddy makes him interesting. For most of the time it looked that the adult talks and funny moments were chunks in the film and were inserted forcefully without actually making the film interesting. But nevertheless those were laughable. It seems like the director could not forget his 20 minutes south park episodes, and was bound to insert these short clips at places without making much effort towards progressing the story. Never felt, that I was watching a film. It looked as if it was a number of pages of an adult comic book. In the field of acting, everyone performed very nicely and the voice of Ted given by Seth Macfarlane was awesome. Mila kunis however didn't have much to show.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A hilarious adult comedy film."""

","This movie is NOT tedious. This is pure fun ! It's a great and funny way of seeing life with different eyes. It is like a connection between childhood and adulthood, linked by great fun, humor and criticism too. Those false moralists who piled tons of objections to it just didn't get the idea of the movie, which is very original in its conception and performance. Ted is, by far, a great wake up call for all of those who carelessly ""waste"" their lives in a make-believe fairy tale where everything is idealized, sinless and ""pure"". The acid jokes, the society criticism, and the whole plot of the movie will lead you through a mishmash of sensations each will, ironically, put you to the test: What have you done of your life ? are you happy with it ? these are questions the movie does not intend to answer, but which are surely damn well right to be asked.

The teddy bear goes against all stereotypes, as he indulges in sex, alcohol and drugs. The teddy is a cute transformation of a man's worst best friend. Ted derails all the good things in life that can happen to John, leaving him with irresponsibility, a lack of career and a failing relationship.

","Say what you will about Seth McFarlane, but the man can be really, really funny. You know, when he's not shoving his liberal and atheist views down people's throats and making you feel like an idiot if you don't agree with him. I actually still do enjoy Family Guy, even though it's mostly hit and miss, but when it hits it can be comedic gold. American Dad is still a damn good show, and while I don't really watch The Cleveland Show anymore, I didn't think it was awful, it just got old really fast. So his first movie Ted, could either be really funny, or really annoing. Thankfully, I found myslef laughing quite a bit in this film.<br/><br/>While it does have some jokes that follow the Family Guy formula of going on for a little too long, and the plot itself is nothing really knew. In fact Ted being a Teddy Bear didn't really affect the story as much as you would think, it comes up a few times, but for the most part it could just be a normal person and there wouldn't be much of a difference. Plus there's a couple of dry spots where there's way too much talking and drama and not enough comedy.<br/><br/>But did I laugh, oh yes I did, I laughed at almost every joke in this film with either a laugh out loud or a small chuckle. Ted himself is actually a pretty likable character, yeah he can be a bit of a slacker, but he has a good heart. And the CGI work on him is really good. I like how it turned a few cliché's on their heads, like making you think that it was going to go in that way, and then explain why that wouldn't work. But like I said, the main reason to watch this is just because it's funny, sure this comedy may not appeal to everyone, but to me, I laughed quite often.<br/><br/>Ted is easily one of the best comedys of the year, if you don't like Seth McFalane's style of comedy, you won't like it.

""Rock Star, Invincible, The Departed, The Fighter,"" are all some of my fave films and Marky sure did a fine job in 'em. Admittedly, I've done my best to keep from watching the ""loser"" movies Mr. Wahlberg has done to ""pay the rent/dues/favors,"" but have watched ""Four Brothers"" and ""The Other Guys"" (hey, a guys gotta watch some crap to get some, know what I'm sayin?""). In those crap movies, it wasn't Marky's acting that was at fault, I'll leave it at that. Back to Ted, it's a nice mix of Msr. Wahlberg playing straight man to the voice of Seth McFarlane in the body of a Teddybear-come to life as-X-mas Miracle-turned drunken loud mouth perv with a heart. (and if that's saying a mouthful, just wait 'til you hear the bear go on and on, it'll make you want to get him a paci, or at least a personal-sized melon!)

","'Ted' is a really funny film that could have been brilliant if there were more laughs in it. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was absolutely the right guy for this film, he is definitely at his best when he is in comedic roles (not necessarily in comedy films) and he carried this film better than anyone else could have. Mila Kunis was really funny in this but her character held her back a bit; she could have been a lot better if the script hadn't stopped her. Seth MacFarlane's voice performance was really funny though he was pretty much just playing Peter from 'Family Guy' in a bear form. There was a lot less cameo roles than I expected here but the ones from Sam J. Jones and the delightful little one from Ryan Reynolds were really funny. Let's not forget the hilarious narration from Patrick Stewart who is just brilliant despite only saying a few sentences at the beginning and ending. <br/><br/>The script was really funny despite the story outline being kind of basic. The jokes, the insults and the dialogue were fantastic. Seth MacFarlane has definitely excelled here with this script; I really hope he goes on to write more films after this.<br/><br/>Overall, if you love 'Family Guy', 'American Dad' etc. then you should love this. It's the same type of humour and is arguable just a giant episode of these but it is still as funny if not more. It was still missing something however; the jokes were spread throughout the film meaning you weren't laughing non-stop."
"markgraham280","8","0","4","28 September 2012"," A comedy that'll corrupt you - in a good way
","When my brother walked into our local multiplex two weeks ago to see Ted, he thought it was going to be a Disney film. I can tell you now that Ted is many things: a charming fantasy about a boy's Christmas wish coming true; a bromance; and an anti rom-com, but it is most definitely not a Disney film.<br/><br/>Comedy isn't a film genre that I like to gamble my money away on very often. In fact, the last comedy I saw on the cinema was Tropic Thunder back in 2008. However, I'd read and heard nothing but praise for Seth MacFarlane's feature-length directorial debut and had, unlike my brother, watched a few episodes of 'Family Guy'. So, I went in with relatively high expectations - and Ted delivered.<br/><br/>The film begins with Mark Wahlberg's outcast character, John Bennett, when young, making a Christmas wish that his teddy bear will come to life. Sure enough, he wakes up the next morning to a walking, talking bear named Ted (MacFarlane), who immediately professes his eternal friendship to John. You have to suspend your disbelief a fair bit: Ted just is. Just go with it.<br/><br/>Fast forward a quarter of a century and John and Ted are best pals of the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost ilk, spending most of their time watching Flash Gordon, smoking cannabis (or something) and generally enjoying a life of zero ambition and responsibility. Their care-free existence is threatened, however, when John's girlfriend (Mila Kunis), her patience having been pushed to the brink, gives him a simple ultimatum: Ted or her. Throw in a very creepy Giovanni Ribisi, who plays the villain, and what has to be one of the best cameos I've ever seen from Sam J. Jones, and you're left with a highly entertaining film.<br/><br/>Ted succeeds where so many ""comedies"" fail, in that it's crammed full of quality jokes that make you laugh, as well as moments that might - just might - bring tears to your eyes. The premise is amusing enough on its own without MacFarlane's brilliant one-liners, the edgy sexual humour, and eclectic pop culture references. In addition to Sam J. Jones, there are surprising cameos from actors like Tom Skerritt and hilarious, deadpan narrative interludes by Patrick Stewart, all of which combine to give Ted an apparent seal of approval from Hollywood itself. Either that or Seth MacFarlane just has friends in high places.<br/><br/>'Bizarre' is a fitting word to sum up Ted. True, it's a little formulaic in places - and increasingly so towards the end - but the overall sense of randomness is what you'll hopefully walk away with. Whether it's the film's silky soundtrack or its many homage sequences, Ted oozes with the maturity of a more experienced director. As you'd expect from anything Seth MacFarlane touches, most of the comedy crosses a lot of lines, which will undoubtedly offend some viewers, but this gives Ted a competitive edge over less risqué films, in my opinion. It's strange to think that gross-out vulgarity can have a place in a genuine and touching tale of unbreakable friendship. There's just something refreshing about a film that sets itself no limits in terms of what it can and can't do to show you a great time.<br/><br/>As for performances, MacFarlane clearly steals the show, but Wahlberg and Kunis more than hold their own in his presence. It's perhaps a rather introverted performance Marky Mark gives, but this suits both the film and his character.<br/><br/>When I got home after watching Ted, I felt somehow corrupted by that teddy bear's playful influence - but in a good way. This expressed itself in my shoddy parking job on the driveway. Perhaps we all need a Ted in our lives: fluffy, physical manifestations of our IDs that only want us to have fun.<br/><br/>The only reason why I haven't awarded Ted full marks is because - just like an episode of 'Family Guy' - I don't think I would enjoy the jokes as much second time around. This is an inherent flaw of the comedy genre as a whole, though, not a specific criticism of MacFarlane's film, which is by far the funniest I've seen in ages."
"dave_lam","Null","0","3","28 September 2012"," Relaxing, witty, superficial in a positive way
","The story-telling opening genuinely invite audience to the fantasy of Ted, making the rest of the film very relaxing to watch.<br/><br/>The film is given life by the witty touch with the combination of CG figure(Ted) and Family-guy-style jokes. It's awkwardly funny watching a cute, fuzzy teddy bear cursing in a man's voice. The change of Ted's voice in different life stage interestingly 'legitimized' the Peter Griffin's voice when Ted is 25.<br/><br/>The only thing I disliked was the presence villain father-and-son contribute little to the comprehensiveness of the plot, all it did was making the film going to the path of Disney-story. Good thing they didn't appear for very long time in the movie.<br/><br/>Feminine readers should not expect too much. The film would probably be logically more popular among men than women because of the masculine style of playwriting surrounding two men (technically a man and a bear).<br/><br/>Howevery, one could never be too serious watching Seth Marcalane's production.

","I had been looking forward to Ted ever since I saw the first trailer, not just because it was from the creator of Family Guy, but also because the concept was freaking genius. It's basically a parody of Pinocchio/The Nut-Cracker. It tells what happens when a kid grows up with his living toy. Glad Toy Story 3 didn't turn out like this.<br/><br/>Ted is a very funny movie. Very few of the jokes fall flat, and while I personally prefer The Dictator as the comedy of the year, Ted is basically a better movie. In The Dictator, a FEW of the jokes fell flat and some of the characters where over-shadowed by General Admiral Aladeen. In Ted, however, most of the characters that are supposed to be funny, are funny (and not just Ted), and the actual story is much better than in The Dictator. So while I personally prefer The Dictator, this movie is better.<br/><br/>Ted also doesn't have any jokes that fall flat. But the reason it's not as funny as The Dictator is because it doesn't have any truly brilliant jokes. It's just great comedy all the way.<br/><br/>I'll stop comparing it to The Dictator now. I personally enjoyed how the movie developed its own story, rather than being JUST a comedy about the bear being all rude and Peter Griffin- ish. It starts off as a dilemma for the main character to choose between his beautiful girlfriend and his best teddy bear friend, but quickly develops into a more emotional story that I won't spoil. But I'm glad it developed itself like that. It made it much more exciting.<br/><br/>There are very few problems with Ted, it's just that it's not AS funny as a 9/10 comedy would be, such as The Dictator. It doesn't have any ""OH MY GOD, THAT'S A JOKE I'LL REMEMBER FOR DECADES TO COME""-moments. It's just a great comedy.<br/><br/>Ted is a great movie. It's got a great sense of humor, good characters, a good story for its genre and a touching finale."

","Of course this is not aimed at kids, I just thought that summary line was funny.

Kudos to the director (also the voice of Ted in the movie) for mastering this.<br/><br/>Now as you can tell by the trailer this is a really insane comedy. Outrageous and crazy would be two other adjectives you could describe it with. Foul language and crude humor should be your thing, if you want to watch this and enjoy it. If you haven't seen the trailer and you don't want too many story spoilers, just search for ""Thunder song Ted"" and watch that little snippet from the movie. If that makes you laugh, you will love the movie! One other thing I took from watching this: ""So this is where we draw the line"". Something everyone can use to good effect ... ;o)"

","""Ted"" is a film that's filled with ribaldry, and gloriously un-PC pop- culture references... It's also handy that the marketing never made it out to be anything other than 'dumb'... If you were a dissatisfied audience member who was expecting a movie starring a talking teddy bear to be deep, then I don't know what to tell you.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a big surprise that people who are huge fans of Family Guy are more likely to enjoy this than those who aren't. Most of Family Guy's jokes are lazy too... but in general they're funny anyway because they're semi-topical and delivered well. <br/><br/>Not all humour has to be clever in order to amuse. <br/><br/>Maybe there were a few 'Epic Movie' type jokes where a random reference is thrown in for no bigger reason than a surprise laugh, but they were carried off with a lot more style and context than Friedberg & Seltzer manage. <br/><br/>Not every joke can be right on target, but I thought that there were more hits than misses, and you soon forget the bad ones if you're laughing at the shots that struck home. <br/><br/>A couple of the movie references did annoy me though, being almost shot for shot, and really unimaginative... There was no need to spell out the second ""Aliens"" joke, for example - it would have been far funnier for a savvy audience to need to work it out by themselves... but I laughed long and loud at other parts of the movie, so I'm prepared to forgive the odd moment that fell flat. They can't all be winners. <br/><br/>Overall it's a fun time at the movies, provided you have an inkling that Macfarlane's style of humour is your cup of tea."

","First things first...the concept of Ted is completely ridiculous. That being said...Ted is also completely hilarious. Writer/Director/Actor Seth MacFarlane, best know as the creative force behind the TV animated hits Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show, brings the same kind of humor to his feature film debut. Jokes that offend everyone from all walks of life and expected and delivered.<br/><br/>Although Ted is a walking talking teddy bear, MacFarlane's script keeps the story grounded in the real world, which actually makes it more realistic and believable then the recent comedy duds That's My Boy and The Dictator.<br/><br/>Mark Walhberg (The Fighter, Boogie Nights) and Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Friends With Benefits) form a strong basis for MacFarlane to bring the cuddly little Peter Griffin'esche title character to life. And major props have to go to Giovanni Ribisi playing the awesomely creepy stalker who plots to steal Ted away for his own son. His gut-busting scene where he sexually dances by himself in front of his TV to a 1980's Debbie Gibson music video while drinking apple juice through a straw is one of the funniest in recent memory.<br/><br/>Parents beware...if for some reason you think this would be a funny movie to bring the kids to...think again. Ted curses like a sailor, smokes pot and bangs hookers. If this seems like a movie you want to enjoy with your children then the Parent of the Year award went out the window for you a long time ago. If you don't let your kids watch Family Guy, then you won't want them to see Ted.<br/><br/>If anyone could make a funny movie out of a teddy bear that has come to life, I'm glad it was MacFarlane who attempted, and not someone at the Disney cheese factory. Now that he has a taste at feature films it's excited to see what he will come up with next.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

","Let me start this by saying, I don't really like Seth Macfarlane, despite the fact that I enjoy Family Guy a whole lot, I really don't like the man as I feel he has a certain arrogance, which really made me not want to see this film, but I did anyway.<br/><br/>Let me start off my commenting on the animation of Ted... it was BRILLIANT, it was totally believable that he was there and his interaction with Mark Wahlberg and other actors was great, his voice didn't distract me as much as I thought it would, as I was too into the animation of Ted to really care.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's performance was great and to me it was the best thing about the film, his character is very likable.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes were QUITE good, especially when they introduce the villain (NO COMMENT) as he is extremely funny and his interaction with Ted is even funnier.<br/><br/>The film wasn't as RAUNCHY or RUDE as it was made out to be, and to be fair Ted doesn't even take drugs as much as you would think, some of the time it's a feel good comedy.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the bad parts.<br/><br/>I didn't like this movie, but I didn't hate it either, sometimes the jokes fall very flat and sometimes there are references that the audience in my screening did not get, especially when there's a small reference to AIRPLANE. Sometimes the film felt too FAMILY GUY-ESQUE.<br/><br/>To cut it short, it was enjoyable but it's a film I wish I didn't pay to see in the cinemas.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT- If you're a fan of FAMILY GUY and is happy to see a film by SETH MACFARLANE, see it. Even if you're not a fan you'd probably enjoy it.<br/><br/>But I would probably just wait for the DVD."

It takes most of the movie for this to sink in with John but there are some funny scenes in the meantime.<br/><br/>It stretches disbelief more than a little that Wahlberg's underachieving character could be going out with a Mila Kunis lookalike for four years but he is a talented comic actor so he just about gets away with it.<br/><br/>There some funny scenes as the obnoxious Ted struggles to start a life on his own. McFarlane also throws in a lot of trademark ""edgy"" one-liners, mostly spoken by Ted.<br/><br/>However the movie does drag a lot and an unnecessary ""Ted gets kidnapped"" plot line makes this even worse.<br/><br/>Perhaps best saved for a DVD rental."
"franciscoraposo72","7","0","5","15 August 2012"," Best Movie of All Time
","Ted is the BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Why? Well, here we go. Seth MacFarlane, the genius guy that created the legendary Family Guy, with a sense of humor that blew everyone away, he also created American Dad and The Cleveland Show, and in these three shows, he voices multiple characters with very different voices and he's just amazing. Seth decided to bring his enormous talent to the big screen. Ted is MacFarlane's first motion picture, where he takes care of the directing, the writing and voicing the hilarious teddy bear. In the end of the year, people will think what was the best movie of 2012, some will say The Dark Knight Rises, some will say The Hobbit, some will say The Avengers, some will say 21 Jump Street and some others, some others like me will say Ted. Ted is a fantastic mash of one of my favorite TV shows Family Guy sense of humor with a very smart plot.<br/><br/>John is an 8 year old kid with no friends at all. One Christmas, his parents give him a teddy bear. He wishes for him to come alive. That wish comes true and 27 years later, John (Wahlberg) and Ted (MacFarlane) are still best friends, they live together and their favorite hobby is smoking pot and watching Flah Gordon. But, John's girlfriend Lori (Kunis) wants them to move on with their lives and get Ted out of the house. John and Ted's friendship will be tested.<br/><br/>No one would not like to see a movie which concept is about a talking teddy bear that swears all the time, smokes pot and has sex with lots of women, including Norah Jones. MacFarlane used Family Guy humor in here, my favorite type of humor and it worked even better in here cause he made this movie rated R (restricTED) and that way he could go even further with the dirty and politically incorrect humor, in this movie we even see a grown man punching a young kid, and only a MacFarlane project could have that. He brought other things from his show, like Mila Kunis (Meg), Patrick Warburton (Joe) and Alex Borstein) and they were all very well used. Now let's talk about the cast, which was a very solid element of the movie, Mark Wahlberg was a superb choice, he keeps surprising me, since The Other Guys, I knew he was amazing with comedy and in here, he was terrific, he just had to make his Bostonian accent have more encases and he had a great performance where he fires off jokes all the time. Mila Kunis, my favorite actress, was also a perfect choice to be the mature of this weird trio, she was very good here and she was also pretty funny and Seth MacFarlane is also amazing voicing Ted, making a voice that sounds a little like Peter Griffin's voice mashed with Brian Griffin's voice and the movie also had amazing cameos. The jokes, well, let me put it this way, Ted is probably the most hilarious movie I've seen, it's a laugh-a-minute movie and each joke is hilarious and I'm a person that usually doesn't feel comfy at laughing at a theater in front of everybody, but this time, I couldn't help it, and although it wasn't that loud, I did laugh a lot, and if I was at home, the windows would break. Botttom line is, if you love Family Guy and MacFarlane's humor, you'll love Ted, it's a heart warming and also raunchy hilarious movie that I just loved, well, let me say it again: TED IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br/><br/>Frank: You think you got what it takes?<br/><br/>Ted: I'll tell you what I got.Your wife's pussy on my breath. <br/><br/>Frank: Nobody has ever spoken to me like that before. <br/><br/>Ted: That's because their mouths were full of your wife's box. <br/><br/>Frank: You're hired. <br/><br/>Ted: Sh*t."

","I hemmed and hawed for five minutes before going in to see this movie. I hadn't heard anything about it, and the poster made it look like a children's movie. However, I didn't want to wait too long for the next film and I noticed Seth MacFarlane had directed it -- so I took the plunge.<br/><br/>For the first 20 minutes I was worried I had made a mistake. The only other person in the theatre was a kid. Then the movie took a strange direction and gradually morphed into a Family Guy kind of film. (It took me a few years to warm to Family Guy, but I'm at the point now where the oddball humour entertains me somewhat. And there are times when the show is brilliant, especially in scenes involving the Stewie character.) <br/><br/>I'm afraid however that I did not really fully appreciate most of the writing and humour in this film. I just didn't find it that witty or funny. The gratuitously offensive jokes and the toilet humour fell flat for me. It was supposed to be irreverent, but much of it just seemed stupid. Perhaps I was in the wrong mood.<br/><br/>However, I did enjoy the original premise at the core of the movie (once I accepted its lack of realism) and some of the gags that arose out of it. I was also impressed at the technical wizardry.<br/><br/>I had problems with the casting of Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett. I'm a fan, but he is too old, too hot and too worldly to play a 35 year old loser. I don't see him as the Peter Pan figure that the script calls for. In general, I didn't really appreciate this character's quirks. It was forced. Wahlberg pulled it off I suppose. He has a wider range than people give him credit for. I saw Lori (played by Mila Kunis) as just being annoyingly demanding. I thought that Wahlberg and Kunis were a hot couple, but they were in the wrong roles and the wrong movie together. Giovanni Ribisi was good, as always.<br/><br/>I was put off by the constant drug and alcohol indulgences of Ted and John. I mean, look at what John looks like: this is a guy who would be into the gym and into his health.<br/><br/>I am not quite sure how a young teenager could be allowed into the theatre to see this film. I'm not a prude, but I suppose there are no age restrictions anymore. A lot of the material and language in the movie seemed inappropriate for children, especially the anti-semitic and homophobic humour.<br/><br/>If you really enjoy Family Guy, I think you might enjoy this film though."

I had been waiting so long for this movie to come out. It was a decent movie but not too funny. Most of the funny stuff came from Ted obviously. The rest was just kind of bad. Even Mila Kunis's acting was kind of overacted in my opinion. Overall I guess it was okay, but not really too great. You should see it if you like comedy but if you want something more serious/good you should see something like TDKR or TASM. It wasn't too bad and I'd definitely watch again but maybe renting it or wait till it's on TV. A lot of the jokes are just flat, something I wouldn't expect from the guy who created American Dad.

To me it is having classic lines that you and your friends will be talking about for years. Thats what happened with Wedding Crashers, Old School, Happy Gilmore, etc. This isn't in the league of those; and therefore I would like to see its rating settle down in the 6's.

Ryan Reynolds made a surprise appearance. and flash Gordon. the real flash Gordon was in this film. it was a raunchy comedy that was filled with laughs all the way through. it through in some annoying cliques and the whole kidnapping thing was unnecessary. some of the jokes, were a little to over the top or felt forced in, but again its a comedy just for teens and adults and they treat it like one with no limitations like they have with family guy on fox. it was funny, fun, and an enjoyable movie. currently out in theaters. see it."

Some of the jokes fall flat, as does an overlong fight scene, an even longer wild party sequence, and an apparent need to be as comically offensive as possible.

Mark Wahlberg has as much aptitude for light comedy as Sylvester Stallone while Mila Kunis begs to be pimp slapped (mainly because she's so mean to Ted.) If you're going to be a raunchy comedy stick to the sleaze, don't put in a feel queasy love story that's so unbelievable even the actors aren't convinced. The whole premise of the story is Kunis (Lori) wants Wahlberg (John) to marry her because they've been dating for 4 years. Wahlberg finally agrees but then Mila adds the stipulation he must get rid of the bear. So for four years Mark is happy with his situation but when he finally reluctantly agrees to marriage he suddenly thinks it's a good idea to ditch his best friend too? That plot was stale 50 years ago with good actors but falls completely apart with these hacks. The nadir of the movie was a flashback to how the two met featuring a disco scene copied verbatim from the movie ""Airplane.""

","You want bear puns? Look no further! Thankfully, though, the humour in Ted is somewhat more refined. For most TV show creators, the opportunity to translate their talents to the big screen comes with a license to push boundaries in new and exciting ways not available through the medium of television. For Seth MacFarlane, creator of the outrageously outrageous Family Guy and ridiculously underrated American Dad!, it must have just felt like another day at the office. <br/><br/>John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is the loneliest kid in Boston. While the other children engage in unique Christmas traditions, John spends his days inside, wishing for just one friend. On Christmas Day, that wish comes true in the form of Ted the stuffed bear (MacFarlane), who is magically transformed into a living being, the miraculous story of which spreads like wildfire across the country. Fast-forward nearly thirty years and Ted's fame has long-since vanished. He and John now spend their days getting high, watching bad movies and managing John's relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>As if to state the painfully obvious, the amount of fun to be had with this film is heavily influenced by how familiar one is with MacFarlane's comedic style. Each of his animated creations employ sharp one-liners, bizarre set pieces and a ton of pop culture references, all of which are prominent in Ted. Naturally, the humour is all sorts of politically incorrect, with jokes ranging from drugs to sex to September 11. Highlights include Ted's job interview at the local supermarket, Patrick Stewart's narration and a house party with Sam Jones, star of Ted and John's favourite film of all-time, Flash Gordon.<br/><br/>It is made clear by the closing credits where the bulk of the effort went into making this film, as most jokes hit resulting in an array of instantly quotable material making it difficult to watch Ted without a perpetual smile on your face. With so many references to popular culture jam-packed within two hours, most international viewers are likely to misunderstand jokes about Tom Brady, Pepperidge Farm and those promiscuous 'Bahstan Gahls', but the film does more than enough to keep all viewers chuckling throughout.<br/><br/>The motion-capture argument typically begins and ends with Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and deservedly so, but an honourable mention must go to this film's visual effects team for the creation of Ted who, both voiced and controlled by MacFarlane, looks about as close to believable as can be. <br/><br/>The film tends to cruise in areas not pertaining to straight-out comedy, which may be a direct side effect of MacFarlane's first outing in the director's chair. The plot has been done literally thousands of times before and the character arcs established early leave the viewer in no doubt as to where the movie is heading to the extent that, once you take away the fact that Ted is not human, it starts to look a lot more like every deliberately offensive rom-com ever. Regardless, the film refuses to take itself too seriously with plenty of tension-breaking jokes that, along with a multitude of A-list cameos, work a whole lot better than would appear on paper.<br/><br/>Ted begins to deviate from its comedic roots just slightly during the climax set after-hours inside Fenway Park (just out of shot: David Ortiz socking a few dingers), but it does allow for an epilogue that, at least temporarily, strikes the audience off-guard by neatly showcasing the charming bond formed between a man and his bear. Indifferent viewers will enjoy Ted without differentiating it from most other contemporary comedies, while fans of the director's prior work are likely to draw a lot more enjoyment out of every scene.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","Being a fan of other work by Seth MacFarlane, I was expecting nothing less than edgy. I was not disappointed. Although a first see is great, this requires a repeat or two to appreciate all the nuances and details crafted into this piece.<br/><br/>This not for the weak or fragile. Step up or step back... simple as that. <br/><br/>That being said, the ability of the actors to interact with an imaginary lead character requires immense skill... conversationally and physically. The hotel fight scene is a great example.<br/><br/>You will love this or it will shock you. Hopefully both! Enjoy!!!<br/><br/>Cheers~!"

","Parents, don't give this movie a low rating cos you're dumb enough to take your kids to see it!!! I just returned from seeing Ted, and was bemused that so many parents took their kids. Just because the main character is a teddy bear, doesn't make it appropriate for children. Those parents were probably the kids that were taken by their parents to see ""Child's Play"" because it's main character was a doll? It's rated 'R' for a reason...<br/><br/>Anyway, Ted is an adult movie, suitable only for adults, and it was hilarious! Wahlberg & Kunis were great together, but they were in supporting roles to Seth MacFarlane's Ted."

","While there really isn't anything wrong with Ted, there isn't anything that great about it either. For his first film, Seth MacFarlane did a good job, but he's still got a lot to learn as a director. The film feels very much like his material and some scenes felt exactly like a live action episode of Family Guy. Mark Wahlberg did a good job in his role and MacFarlane and I really enjoyed the character of Ted. He really carries the movie and the scenes without him on screen really seemed to go by a bit slow. As for the comedy in the film, there are plenty of funny scenes, but most of them deliver on a level of chuckles instead of big laughs. That's not to say the film doesn't deliver some laughs at points, but not as many as it should. The one thing that did kinda bug me about this film was it's constant references to the 80's. Some of them such as the references to Flash Gordon were funny, but the film relied way too heavily on them and some of them felt forced. I also felt the film was a bit too long and could've easily been 15 minutes shorter. Overall, Ted isn't as good as it could've been, but there really isn't anything wrong with it that will keep you from enjoying it either. It's much better than the new episodes of Family Guy, but there's much funnier films that have come out this year such as 21 Jump Street."

","I went into this film with much trepidation, considering it emanated from the mind of Seth McFarlane, the creator of ""Family Guy,"" a once hilarious animated program that has since become nothing but a left-wing propaganda piece with McFarlane himself nothing more than a shill for the Democratic Party.<br/><br/>Even trying to atone himself with ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" earned less than stellar repentance points. Still, not one to prematurely judge, I tramped to the screening with a (somewhat) open mind.<br/><br/>And, to my pleasant surprise, I really enjoyed this comedy based on no small part much of the earlier ""Family Guy"" vibes. In short, this is one of the few comedies released in the past few years that will make you laugh. It ill make you laugh out loud in some spots and, with so many unfunny movies disguised as comedies being released today, this earns my solid recommendation.<br/><br/>In a spirit of generosity, McFarlane also gives employment to many of his television show staff, including Mila Kunis (voice of Meg Griffith), Patrick Warburton (voice of Joe the Cop), Alex Borstein (voice of Lois Griffith) and Patrick Stewart (the narrator and voice of the CIA Director in ""American Dad"").<br/><br/>""Ted"" tells the story of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg, ""Contraband""), who, as a boy (played by Bretton Manley), receives a Teddy Bear for Christmas back in 1985. Lonely and friendless, he makes a solemn wish that the toy would be his friend forever. And, of course, in movies like this, the wish comes true and the bear comes to life â€” complete with the voice of Peter Griffith (McFarlane).<br/><br/>Amazed (and almost shocked to death), the parents (Ralph Garman and Borstein) grudgingly accept the miracle of a living stuffed animal, while Ted becomes famous for a while, appearing on the covers of dozens of national magazines and the subject of many TV and radio interviews. Included in this is a great clip of his ""appearance"" on the ""Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" (think ""Forrest Gump,"" here).<br/><br/>Later, though, in the advent of instantaneous journalism and as he grows older, he is subjected to more embarrassing moments (such as a public arrest in an airport for smuggling ""mushrooms""). John does not age any better and the duo spend much of their adult lives getting drunk, high and watching reruns of the old ""Flash Gordon"" TV series.<br/><br/>Barely making a living at a rent-a-car office, John somehow attracts the beautiful and successful Lori (Kunis), but despite an amazing amount of tolerance for her boyfriend's situation (not many women would continue to endure his vapidness, immaturity and complete irresponsibility), she finally has enough, giving him the ultimatum: the bear or me.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, John and his toy meet ""Flash Gordon's"" Sam J. Jones in a hilarious party scene, while a darker subplot concerns a father (Giovanni Ribisi, ""Contraband"") and son who want to kidnap Ted.<br/><br/>The laughs come a-mile-a-minute, some heartier than others. Plus, with a few surprising cameos along the way, as well as loving pokes at past and present American pop culture, I have to admit that director McFarlane, who also co-wrote with fellow ""Family Guy"" scribbler, Alec Sulkin, has a real winner here.<br/><br/>The premise of a living Teddy Bear, albeit one which goes from saying ""I love you"" to one that snorts coke and wrecks hotel rooms, is certainly pretty dumb, but the fun harvested here is well worth the 106 minutes spent in the theater watching this film."
