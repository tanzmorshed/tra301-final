","... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.<br/><br/>It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a ""respectable"" member of society. And yes, we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife (the retconning did annoy me, too, by the way, but you just can't avoid a little re-imagining here and there).<br/><br/>Speaking of unavoidable, Irene Adler, Holmes' one uncapturable (is that a word?), simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting, the romance, and the near-make-out session were irresistible to the director (and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves).<br/><br/>That being said, I felt Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes (preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations) show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey, but at which they constantly hint.<br/><br/>As for Watson himself, Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought, given Watson's wartime injury, but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly, I feel. No one, no matter how patient or forgiving, could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes, after all, was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless, Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.<br/><br/>This version (or vision, if you will) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling, more thrilling, and more edgy than any other incarnation, but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original. Aside from a little revisionist history in the cases of the female leads, nothing is that far out of the ordinary; and no amount of references to Madonna will change that."

","Nearly hundreds of actors have played Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson, and it may seem rash to call Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law the best Holmes-and-Watson-duo so far. But I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and most of the portrayals I've seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character. In Guy Ritchie's film, as in Doyle's ""canon"", Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer, a martial artist, a dabbler in many sciences, and a master of disguise. Most importantly, he's an expert in logic and deduction. He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson (Geraldine James) and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan).<br/><br/>The movie opens with Holmes and Watson apprehending serial killing Satanist Lord Blackwood (played broodingly by Mark Strong). Blackwood is executed, but when he seemingly rises from the dead, the deductive duo must determine whether it's a supernatural occurrence or if there's a logical explanation. It's exactly the type of mystery Doyle would have devised, with plenty of twists and opportunities for Holmes to show off his genius as he races to stop a plot to take over England and (gasp!) America. Everything from the experiments Holmes performs in his Baker Street flat to his climatic revelation of the mystery on the Tower Bridge seems perfectly in line with Doyle's writing.<br/><br/>One of the only departures from the canon that bothered me was Sherlock's introduction to Dr. Watson's fianc√©e, Mary Morstan, played as a delicate English rose by Kelly Reilly. In the stories, Mary was Holmes' client in ""The Sign of Four"" before Holmes first encountered Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" Then again, the continuity of the stories was rarely important to filmmakers, or even to Sir Arthur, so I'm just nitpicking.<br/><br/>As a film on its own merits, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is almost perfect. The movie's opening shot grabs you, and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles. His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric. Hans Zimmer's quirky score blends well with the film's tone and Downey Jr.'s off-kilter Holmes. Meanwhile, Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool, competent sidekick. Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops, he's the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes. When he leaps into action, he relies on a sword-cane and a trusty revolver, while Sherlock favors a riding crop (which die-hard fans will recall was his preferred method of self-defense in the canon). Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock's classic adversary into a feisty action heroine. All the while, another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.<br/><br/>Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond, he doesn't feel any less like Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock's fighting as a mental exercise as much as it's a physical feat. In the same way, though ""Sherlock Holmes"" is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie's usual films, it doesn't feel any less like Guy Ritchie."
"C-Younkin","8","267","395","22 December 2009"," Downey and Law are on the case
","Do Guy Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. Downey is Holmes and Law is sidekick Dr. Watson, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord Blackwood (a perfectly grave and menacing Mark Strong) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. Rachel McAdams also shows up as Irene Adler, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of Holmes.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. brings quick-wit, cunning, and a scruffy toughness to a role long seen as stuffy and dry, while Law a distinguished charm that, at times, spills over into testy aggressiveness (which is funniest at Holmes most annoying). Both toss off the one-liners with ease. Ritchie's directorial style also comes through, from the dark, grimy Victorian- London production values to the violent boxing and martial arts matches. Holmes' mindset (such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect, interpret clues, follow the deceptive) also brings out Ritchie's ability to create an ultra-stylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action set-pieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot, by three screenwriters, is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plot-twist on-top of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style, you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's Sherlock Holmes, but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless."
"RResende","Null","152","224","4 January 2010"," Actor, and Placement
","Somehow, i've always avoided the cinematic (or TV) presentations of Sherlock Holmes. I find the character fascinating, but i always felt it was more invested in literature, not cinema. His deductions, the way he surrounds the worlds he investigates are a feast for thinking minds. Even when the deductions are over the top (which happens often!) one can't stop smiling at the cleverness. More than that, the character is a perfect piece invested in a clever, irresistible and fascinating world. London. That part is visual, and a good ground to invest a cinematic world. But, unlike for example anything by Agatha Christie, Doyle's cleverness is rooted in pure deductive logic, not on the mechanics of the world. Notice that Christie's crimes are many times a matter of understanding how things happened, spatially (murder on the orient express is the zenith of that). I suppose Doyle formed his mind before cinema had any significant impact on how our minds work.<br/><br/>So the challenge for any modern filmmaker, and actor, who wants to update Holmes, is to make the character more cinematic, more appealing. Several tricks are used here, most of them successful, even if straightforward. One is the most obvious, making Holmes an action character (which actually is in its original dna, even though TV productions usually ignore that). This might be a flop, and make the version laughable, but by now there is a sense of irony and self awareness in Ritchie's films (sincer Lock Stock) that allows him to support a xxi century action figure in Holmes clothing that actually is watchable. A minor trick here is the association of the deduction with the very process of physical fighting, which creates some Matrix moments. Well, their watchable, though not particularly interesting. In the greater arc, there are good action sequences, because, as any competent action these days, considers the elements of the surrounding space, and uses them.<br/><br/>But there are two big things in this film, which take it to new levels of interest.<br/><br/>One is the acting. Jude Law is a clever guy, an interesting actor whose greatest quality is how he merges anonymously with the context he is intended to integrate. He willingly becomes a piece of a larger tapestry, and that really is something to look upon. There are not many actors who can claim they can do this competently. But the king of the game is Downey Jr. He is the gold piece in the puzzle of updating Holmes. There certainly will be a before-after Holmes character, with this film. The man is capable to work his performances on several directions, and each of them is a perfect link to its surroundings. So he gives in to Ritchie's demands, and introduces humour, irony, and self-awareness in the character, to make it usable for the director's winks at ironic action. He invests totally on the creation of a character who merges with the textures of the context, while being distinct from it. And while doing it, he folds us into his game, so we do everything with him, side by side. We deduce, we smile, we run, all with him. So, if the film hadn't other qualities, Downey Jr would still make it worthy, because he, alone, solves one the most basic problems with any film: to find a channel audiences can safely cross into the game someone (director) proposes. He is one of the best ever.<br/><br/>But there is another great thing here, which i suspect has a lot to do with several guys involved in the process of making the film. The result is an incredible sense of placement. London, XIXth century. All those dirty muddy streets, all the dirt. The fascination of the inner locations, namely the midget's laboratory. How those sets are usable, in the action scenes. That's all competent, more than competent. It's perfectly rendered, carefully photographed, it sounds overly artificial, but it's a matter of taste, i suppose. But what was really striking was the use of the London bridge. Notice how it is announced, early in the film, with a similar perspective to the one we'll get in the end. Than, the great sequence, when Irene Adler goes through the sewage, goes up, and we end up with a close up of her, in an unidentified location. The angle opens, we move away, and we are set up in the location for the final fight scene, which in its own merits is interesting enough. So, this was a unique way to actually use an establishing location, instead of merely showing it. I mean, how many films have shown the Eiffel towers? countless. How many actually use it? not so many. This is one of the best London cities we've seen lately.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Great literature seldom makes for great cinema. The mediums are vastly different. However great literature, in the right hands, can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie's interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.<br/><br/>Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ""Holmes and Watson"". Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.<br/><br/>What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Of course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the ""good"" guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.<br/><br/>This is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story, but anyone who has read a Holmes story (and isn't against a little artistic license) should see the film. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch."
"joestank15","9","138","216","25 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes for the remake generation
","Sherlock Holmes - Based on the books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the popular detective is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His loyal companion Watson (played superbly by Jude Law) is getting married and Holmes is none too happy. Their antics are put on the shelf because Lord Blackwood (ice cold Mark Strong), a powerful man of the occult world, has committed a series of murders. When he is hung, he rises from the grave and promises to drastically change the world with himself as master. With the future of several countries at stake, it is up to Holmes to stop Blackwood. Downey Jr. disappears into the role like the character does with various disguises. He is completely believable as a detective whose deductive skills are so powerful that, without focus, mundane situations are overwhelming to his psyche. The film and role are his.<br/><br/>Holmes is portrayed as a borderline manic depressive eccentric who cannot function unless he has a goal to accomplish. In other words: Robert Downey Jr. The film has fun exploring the part of Holmes left untouched by the films done by varying Television productions for many years. Namely: the physical side of Holmes. Yes, Holmes is a boxer, stick/sword fighter, and a martial artist. It was in the books, and it is done in this film as well. He flung Moriarty down a chasm with jujitsu in one of the stories for God's sake! It always bothered me that Holmes's eccentricities and drug-use seemed to be shelved on the screen in favor of a more well-put together stern man who would never deign to get his hands dirty. Holmes was never meant to be a symbol of stiff-upper lip Britain, yet that's what he became. The obvious reasons behind these choices were probably finances (or lack thereof concerning fight co-ordination) and censorship. It's funny how interpretations work. Icons are taken down such a strange path that, when someone decides to bring them to where they started, the old looks new. Batman was always noir. Bond was a quipless suave killer. Holmes could fight. <br/><br/>A down and dirty Holmes is more interesting (surprise!) to a 21st century audience than an omniscient uppercrust man eternally in a bathrobe. This Holmes is fairly true to the original character. It may not be true to the Holmes some people have in their heads, but that version cherry picks elements of Doyle's original creation. Actually this Watson is not as close to the original version (younger with no limp), but this Watson ties Holmes to reality, is less of an audience fill-in (read: a dumb shmoe) and kicks some major ass.<br/><br/>The film is riveting with only a few parts that actually lag. Huge explanations are saved until the end. We realize we have seem more or less all that Holmes has seen, and yet he gleaned far far more with his powerful intellect. Guy Ritchie's directing is vast and yet detail oriented. It's fairly comprehensible yet there is enough in the dialogue and character relationships to warrant future viewings.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is smart and entertaining, a combination which always works better than either adjective by itself. This is an invigorating re-boot that reminds us why the detective is such an icon. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have perfect chemistry like an old married couple. Mark Strong plays a chilling villain and one lament is that, as part of the film is spent trying to find him, his performance is surprisingly brief. Rachel McAdams is the one part of casting that feels disingenuous. She's not quite devilish or sensuous enough to be the one woman that outsmarted Sherlock Holmes. Still, a thoroughly entertaining film for the head and heart. I look forward to the inevitable sequel. A-"
"superflysamurai13","9","197","330","23 December 2009"," 'Sherlock Holmes' is a Fast-Paced Whirlwind Adventure
","-----It came as a surprise when Guy Ritchie was chosen as the Director of 'Sherlock Holmes.' Known primarily for his work on indie crime films, such as 'Snatch' or last year's 'RocknRolla,' Ritchie had never taken on a mainstream franchise film, the likes of which 'Sherlock Holmes' promised to be. Thankfully, Ritchie was able to mesh the two genres on some level, with his trademark style of film-making ever present in his latest outing. The result is a film that will surely prove the most popular take on the character outside of Conan Doyle's original novels, and will also likely spawn a franchise.<br/><br/>-----Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson have been successfully solving cases throughout England for years. Their most recent case was that of Lord Blackwood, a man who murdered in the name of his black magic. Finally hanged for his crimes, it comes as an unpleasant surprise when he literally rises from his grave. And so it is up to Holmes and Watson to find him and stop him before his killing spree devours the whole of England.<br/><br/>-----Robert Downey Jr. is right at home in the role of the infamous detective. Swapping out futuristic armor for a pipe and fiddle, he plays another character with the wit and confidence of his Tony Stark persona in 'Iron Man.' This makes sense because, to some degree, what is 'Sherlock Holmes' if not merely the Tony Stark character set back about a hundred years? Regardless, Downey Jr. is excellent, providing an effervescent wit and supreme charm to his latest role. Jude Law plays his right hand man, Dr. John Watson, in a role much smarter than past incarnations of the Watson character. The two are more equals than hero and sidekick, and their chemistry is indelible. Even when the narrative becomes a bit erratic, the pleasure of seeing the two stars' continuous verbal quarrels is worth the price of admission alone. Together they inspire numerous laughs and clever rebuttals to an unrelenting degree, allowing many of the jokes to pass unrealized, saved for the treat of a second viewing.<br/><br/>-----'Sherlock Holmes' has a method completely reminiscent of Director Guy Ritchie's earlier films. In the style of show first-explain later, Ritchie has effectively applied his trademark fast cuts to the mind of his lead protagonist. Much as Watson is often catching up to Holmes' various schemes, so must the audience sit in question for a large portion of the film, waiting for Holmes to reveal his motivations. Particularly similar to his work on last year's entertaining 'RocknRolla,' along with many of his other films, Ritchie takes the first hour of his endeavors laying out the dots to be connected in his lengthy but fast-paced crescendo throughout the second half of the film. With 'Holmes,' he has compromised nothing, rather managed to find a better balance between build up and climax. With various fistfight intervals dissecting the chaotic mystery, Ritchie keeps the audience entertained even when they're unsure about the direction of the plot. That being said, many viewers will begin to question their purchase throughout the films first half hour, as the story puzzles more than entertains. But rest assured, a satisfying finale follows, with so many pieces coming together that a second viewing is a necessity to begin dissecting the intricacies of the case being solved, if that only means better understanding Holmes' course of action.<br/><br/>-----Visually Ritchie has constructed a film in the shadows, only occasionally getting out into spanning shots of daylight England. This, like the rest of the film, settles into place as the film develops. His infamous lightning cuts allow no slow moments, even when the pace would typically meander in the hands of a lesser Director. Holmes also riddles off explanations so rapidly that audiences can hardly pick up on all of what he is saying, or all of the nuanced humor during the interplay between Watson and him. Unfortunately much of the laugh-out-loud humor as been divulged in the trailer, but a film should not be penalized for the faults of its advertising campaign. The musical score is supplemental to the frantic convolutions of the film's earlier scenes, providing a spirited tune that rides the energy of fiddling and poses as anything but generic. The locations are likewise smart, the costumes are admirable, and the effects are gritty, proving to be another benefit of having an indie Director helm an event film. Ultimately there are no blatant shortcuts in the way of computer generation, only clever sets and a brilliant Art Direction.<br/><br/>-----'Sherlock Holmes' is refreshingly less conventional than one might guess, even if some viewers may find themselves a bit lost by Ritchie's unforgiving cuts and unrelenting energy. It jumps right into the tale, no origins told and no flashbacks necessary, relying on Holmes renowned history. Furthermore, many subtle elements of the various characters' past interactions are left for the audience to deduce in the fashion of Sherlock Holmes himself. And while the film may not be the grand epic some may have hoped for, its sheer entertainment value is undeniable. From the moment the credits roll it's apparent that 'Sherlock Holmes' cannot be full appreciated in one screening, and will likely grow in favor upon further viewings. It further presents itself as a gem of home entertainment in the long run, as a film that can be enjoyed on any occasion in any company, even with its hefty two-hour-plus runtime. This is a byproduct of the wonderfully gritty action Ritchie brings to the tale, and the uncompromising portrayal of the classic characters by the films superb leads. 'Sherlock Holmes' won't be quite what you expect, and you may even be dismayed by the films feisty narrative style, but more often than not you'll be completely entertained by the characters on screen in this fun addition to the loaded Holiday season."

The hero is very different from the traditional and austere Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Therefore, the story could be from two detectives ahead of time living in London in the end of the Nineteenth Century instead.

"fabian_2401","1","155","279","1 February 2010"," A very simple (and boring) plot...
","Many people complains about the plot being confusing, but I found it very simple: Two ninjas, Sherlock and Watson (the former said to be very clever) have a fight each five minutes of the film. In-between fights they try to solve a very difficult case about a bad guy (Lord Blackwood) that, as Count Dracula, has the power to get into the minds of the people and make them cause riots and protests everywhere in Victorian London. Although the bad guy‚Äôs ambitions are merely political, he also murders women as a hobby and that‚Äôs why he is captured by the two ninjas, then prosecuted and finally hanged.<br/><br/>Many people go to see the execution, but nobody (not even the clever ninja) notes that the rope from which the bad guy hangs stays loose around his neck. The other ninja, said to be a physician, takes the pulse of the corpse directly on the neck, and realizes that the rope didn‚Äôt leave any mark whatsoever in the dead guy‚Äôs neck. Admired by how soft these new ropes are, he says nothing and declares him dead.<br/><br/>The bad guy wasn‚Äôt dead, but he was buried the same under big blocks of granite. This was a very hard task because these blocks were actually very small pieces glued together lightly so that the bad guy could break them from the inside of his grave and it must have required quite a lot of people to put these fragile blocks in place so delicately as not to unglue them. Fortunately for the bad guy no one working at the cemetery noticed this.<br/><br/>The film goes on very slowly after that. Anything they investigate is immediately followed by a long fight.<br/><br/>Very often Conan Doyle writes about cases that although they look supernatural at the beginning, a sound and rational explanation is provided at the end.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie decides to change this tedious scheme, so that a crescendo is built till the last frame. To achieve this Guy Ritchie applies the rule that if a case looks supernatural, the explanation should be more supernatural than the case itself.<br/><br/>So, at the end, we are faced with magical substances (that couldn‚Äôt be found till now even in the Pandora moon) like a kind of clear, odorless liquid, that people take as water, which ignites readily and violently with just a spark, distilled cyanhydric acid that kills much better than the relatively pure counterpart so easy to obtain, an antidote thanks to which you can breathe hydrogen cyanide with no ill effects, small sized remote controls made in 1880, and many, many more. No ridicule is spared in explaining what has happened and how.<br/><br/>Such a display of fantasy for nothing; at the end the clever ninja cannot explain how the bad guy managed to get into the minds of the people and organize riots telepathically. Maybe there was also a magical gas that was released by the bad guy and caused this, but unfortunately this is not shown in the film."
"pasholy2001","1","108","192","20 July 2010"," Mediocre
","I'm rating a 1/10 to counterbalance all the 9/10 reviews. This movie was just another stupid, boring action movie. I might of given it more stars if it wasn't named ""Sherlock Holmes"".<br/><br/>1. The characters in the movie were not Holmes and Watson. Maybe Dr. House and Jackie Chan. I read some reviews saying that this is the best portrayal of Holmes you've ever seen, seriously? Yes, he was eccentric, but he wasn't a smug, childish, karate champion, witty.... He was a proper British gentlemen. Why does he always have a stupid, baffled expression in the movie? You know the one with his eyes wide open.<br/><br/>2. I have to agree with another reviewer, Conan Doyle mostly had believable explanations. Not some remote control, flammable water, and lot's of other junk that they didn't have in the late 1800's.<br/><br/>3. I hate that everything nowadays has to be an action movie. Holmes and Watson were not crime fighting ninjas. I've read many Holmes books and I've yet to find one where he goes around kicking ass all over the place. Next we'll see a Jesus movie where there are lots of explosions.<br/><br/>This movie is good for the masses, but not if you are an actual thinking human being."

","As you can tell from the first review, you probably have to be a big reader or fanboy/girl of Sherlock Holmes in order to be displeased. I was pleased almost the whole way through this movie without caring much about character. Still, even though Sherlock Holmes sometimes was a bit too 'ambiguously gay' and had an annoying modern-like personality, he continued to be funny, strange, and as intelligent as I thought Sherlock should be. Jude Law did a good job as well as others on the cast.<br/><br/>I loved the plot. It was obvious to me at times how the story would unravel, but then it hits you again in the end. It was a subtle hit, however. Anyways, my favorite part of the story was mainly the broad scheme of things and the people involved. Sherlock goes deep enough into the world of conspiracy to keep me interested.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie is sometimes the humor. A lot of the 'humor' came out during conversations. People would laugh at the wittiness spewed by the main characters, and it just felt too much like a modern sitcom. Today, American society and culture is infected with internet memes, battles of quick wit, and straight-faced jokes that provoke a lame laughter from me (one not deeply felt.) You could compare what I am saying to the dialogue in 'The Big Bang Theory.' Hollywood could maybe tone down a bit on dry and clever jokes, especially when they poke out during unnecessary times.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I enjoyed this movie enough to rate it an 8 out of 10, and although I did complain more than I gave praise, I just didn't want to give away all of the good parts. Go see this movie. It's fresh, isn't based in America, and doesn't trail off there either. There are twists, excellent action scenes, lots of fun moments, sweet investigation, and some analogous material better discussed in a forum of theorists."
"jeremyfredrikson","7","25","40","11 January 2010"," So tired of subjective ""best ever"" reviews
","I am so very tired of people reviewing movies, which are subjective by nature, as blanketly ""best ever"" this and ""best ever"" that. That's simply a case of small minds and big egos at work. There are so many great Holmes films and portrayals out there, that it's asinine to declare any one film or one actor as ""the best"". Most reviewers who rave about this film claim how it finally got ""it"" right. Got what right? Your personal interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in your mind? What about Jack's mind? What about Sally's? Some go so far as to claim this film merits something extra because it debunks the very debatable myth that Holmes never wore the famous deerstalker cap. For the record, Holmes was described as wearing a hat made of ""cloth"" that was an ""ear-flapped traveling cap"" in the story Silver Blaze. Original illustrator Sidney Paget saw that as meaning a deerstalker in his mind and an image even more famous than the writing on the page was born. Sounds like Paget made a pretty sound deduction too if you ask me. Regardless, if you personally don't think Holmes ever wore a deerstalker in the stories would facts like that alone or in combo boost a film so much as to make its interpretation ""the best"". Equally valid claims can be made that Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Arthur Wontner, Douglas Wilmer, Peter Cushing, Clive Merrison, and others depending on your taste are the best. The question is, was the movie any good on its own and were the performances fun. I don't give a hoot if it was exactly how you pictured Holmes in your mind or if you thought it was better/worse than other Holmes' films or that it somehow isn't as authentic because it wasn't a verbatim dramatization of a Conan Doyle tale, etc (Jeremy Brett fans, you know what I'm talking about). If you liked the movie, great. If you like other Holmes' a lot better, more power to you. I personally think the new Sherlock Holmes film took a lot of hinted at bits of Holmes' personality and skills from the canon and gave those characteristics the spotlight. That's fine. Those aren't the qualities that took reign when I read the stories, but who cares? Why would I want to see the exact same thing I saw when I read the books? That would make for a monotonous world. Hurray for everybody's various interpretations and subjective and wonderfully different tastes! There are no gospel truths about movies or books or art, so please just say you ""liked it a lot"" instead of it was ""the best"". That's so unhelpful. Just tell me what you liked about it as a film on its own without comparing it to any books, or other versions/interpretations. That's like saying one food item is ""the best"". It's ridiculous. On a final note, this new interpretation is a welcome addition to the world of Sherlock Holmes. It doesn't diminish any of the older films or television series. It stands on its own as another fun ride for fans of mystery, action, and those who love many things Sherlock."

","As with most of Hollywood ""blockbuster"" cinema these days, the film suffers from an inescapable, one-dimensionalism. It is all about style; the cinematography, costuming, digital sets and effects, etc. are all top notch. As well, the quippy dialogue betrays a certain shallow, slick stylism that the script suffers from in general. However, far from being a clever distillation of the best of Holmes and Watson, the film instead suffers throughout from a post-modernistic reductionism that flattens our heroes into effete, world-weary caricatures of their literary counterparts.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, for Holmes enthusiasts particularly, the film--in spite of the stylishly depicted action sequences--is dull and soulless, almost as if bored with its own pointlessness. Telling of our times, perhaps, but far from great storytelling."

","At face value, Sherlock Holmes should have been the must-see of 2010 - great cast in the shape of Jude Law and the currently unstoppable Robert Downey Jr, massive budget, big name director and a classic story.<br/><br/>In reality it fails, and fails badly.<br/><br/>My better half extended a theory which I think holds merit here: it feels as though somebody has written a really good story to prequel the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and presented it to a studio - who have promptly handed it to a hack screen-writer and a lacklustre director to make a shambles of.<br/><br/>The action scenes lack any feeling of authenticity or excitement, and that's pretty inexcusable in an action driven film with a cast of good actors. Had the film had a different director, I can't help feeling that it would have made an excellent, suspenseful story-driven feature. As it is, the action feels pasted-on and ruins the story.<br/><br/>*(slight) SPOILER ALERT* Holmes' trademark summing up and explanation at the end is perhaps the one enjoyable scene in the film, but is ruined by the constant foreshadowing of sequels to come. The whole film, in fact, feels like it's setting up its own sequel rather than trying to be a film in its own right - it just doesn't work! *ANOTHER (very slight) SPOILER ALERT* Mark Strong is the villain of the piece as Lord Blackwood - but the character is a hugely inferior copy of his role as Septimus in Stardust, right down to the thigh-length black leather jacket.<br/><br/>*ANOTHER (much bigger) SPOILER ALERT* Take a Dan Brown novel. Take all of the nonsensical plots about Illuminati and mystic orders. Superimpose it on top of an Arthur Conan Doyle novel.

But the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long so there's the problem. There are so many plot holes that a mack truck could drive through and even with suspension of disbelief, it is truly a hodge podge of dreck with loud noises interspersed amongst the dreck to keep you awake. We are supposed to believe that Irene Adler is so strong as to heave a drugged and out-of-it Holmes from off the floor by the fireplace and onto a bed and then strip and handcuff him to the bed posts. They don't show you any of this because it would be laughably unbelievable. She must be super human to accomplish such a feat. There are other ridiculous stupidities that I thought perhaps were aimed at teens but the teens that were with me actually fell asleep because it was so boring. Every once in a while one of the sleeping teens would nod awake at a loud explosion. One such explosion completely engulfed the major characters yet in the next scene, not a burn mark is to be found.

"moviedoors","4","68","125","26 December 2009"," The Sign of the Bore
","I've finally figured out Guy Ritchie's fatal weakness as a filmmaker. He doesn't actually care about character, theme, or even storytelling. He just wants to be cool. He only wants characters that quirky, badasses, or sex godesses. Because they're cool. He employs flashy cutting, hyper-stylized cinematography, and fractured time lines. Because, they're cool!<br/><br/>This worked for the bonkers Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. Those movies were cool and it felt natural, easy. Things took a turn for the ugly with Swept Away, this decade's Isthar. Revolver was dreadful, and RocknRolla dances in your faces practically screaming ""look how cool I am"" and is then forgotten before you've even unlocked the car to leave the theater. <br/><br/>Which brings us to Ritchie's desperate-to-please, big-Hollywood style stab at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's timeless icon. The production values are excellent. Period-appropriate London is completely convincing. Downey's Holmes captures the mad intensity of Doyle's character, withdrawn, depressed, and self destructive when he's has nothing to occupy is never ceasing ming, burning life and frantic energy when the case does arrive. He does however, straight up mumble for half the picture, rendering what might of been neat instances of observation/deduction/knowledge, but I couldn't tell. Couldn't understand him. <br/><br/>Ah, the case. When it comes to adaptations, remakes, re-imaginings, etc, I'm a pretty forgiving fellow, as long as the soul is intact. Change the race, change the gender, change the setting, but don't lose the essence. The mystery, the case, is the soul of a Sherlock Holmes tale and I'm afraid this is where Ritchie's film falls flat. Sure, there's something dastardly afoot, but solving the puzzle is beyond the audience to predict. We're not made a part of the unraveling. Stuff goes on that we don't understand, and it's all explained in the end in smash cut flash backs, filling us in with details that were never foreshadowed, many of them feeling like afterthoughts to dig the screenplay out of the hole it dug for itself. Doyle's stories invite us to narrow our brows and read carefully. One feels include in the unraveling. We're right there with Watson (who in this movie, is quite spry for a man with a permanent war injury) Here, Ritchie holds out on us, keeping the mechanics of the mystery entirely to himself. The larger mystery afoot exists for no other purpose than to make a sequel. <br/><br/>Why such failure in maintaining the soul of Holmes? Because Ritchie doesn't care about the mystery. He drowns the film in cool, in showy camera angles, manically (and confusingly cut) action and the whole affair is drummed up with buddy-movie comedic angle that falls flat. It's just not funny. The shifts in tone from funny, to mysterious, to thrilling, to dramatic, are jarring, barely held together at the seams. It's ultimately a crushing bore, lacking any sort of narrative momentum. <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has undeniable talent as stylist. He'll can make a worthwhile movie. No one who works that hard with that much raw talent will just fade away. He needs to another round at bat to prove that too us again."

","It took three guys to write this mess? I've quoted him before, I'll quote him again, director Vincent Sherman: ""More writers doesn't necessarily mean a better script. It usually means just the opposite."" And so, Sherlock Holmes doesn't know what kind of screenplay it should be. An action flick? A buddy movie? A rip off of a TV forensic drama? One thing for sure, as a result of not answering the crucial question when writing a screenplay, ""What is it about?"" Guy Ritchie gives us a boring, bubbles in the think tank, flash in the pan.<br/><br/>I can just imagine the yackety-yack over drinks: ""If we can get Law and Downey, then it'll be commercial! Oh, oh, and make sure Law and Downey whine and bicker like two women during their menses, because audiences love when men complain in unmanly ways. And don't forget to tell the camera guys to work it like CSI. And, and, make sure Bobby looks buff because astute men can't just be shrewd, they have to look manly, otherwise the bare-chested fight scene, which really has nothing to do with anything, won't work."" <br/><br/>Be forewarned, Mr. Ritchie's plot revolving around a villain, who may or may not be dead, has been done already. So, the storyline is not fresh. In addition, Mr. Ritchie shows and tells us things not once, but twice. Does he think audiences are dead from the neck up? Then why waste precious plot time? Mr. Downey mumbles when his English accent gets lower. The CGI is painfully evident. Holmes and Watson as super heroes are just plain out of character and dumb.<br/><br/>If you can't tell a well-written screenplay from bestselling ones, then this is the bird-cage liner for you.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand you haven't forgotten how to open a book and you're not acquainted with Doyle's novels and anthologies, then get reading. It's fun to create your own little mind-movie and interpret fiction yourself rather than enabling Mr. Ritchie to get richer and offend the masses in the name of ""entertainment."""

","Rarely have I hated a film as much as I did this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. Blame the script, and to some extent, the director for willingly filming this mess. They have completely misinterpreted one of the greatest characters ever, presenting Holmes as an Action Figure. What is it about Hollywood that thinks we want to see vast conspiracy cults, intent upon taking over the city, the world, the universe? Why do they continue to turn already entertaining stories into total mishmashes of roller coaster, smash-boom-bah adventures? Whether ""Dragnet,"" or ""Temple of Doom,"" or ""National Treasure,"" it seems that the Suits in Hollywood want every film to imitate the original Indiana Jones with a measure of Da Vinci Code on the side.<br/><br/>Granted, I have been a major Holmes fan ever since seeing the Basil Rathbone version of ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" long ago and then reading ""Red Headed League"" in grade school. Since then, I've read the entire collection and enjoyed more Rathbone and the wonderful Jeremy Brett interpretations on PBS, as well as some other more forgettable ""consulting detectives."" What they all have in common-- what makes Holmes such a memorable character-- is their reliance of the cerebral to solve the crime; not the physical. <br/><br/>Ritchie gives us a few inklings into Holmes deductive reasoning, to show us that the little details can contribute to an overall portrait of who, what, when, etc. But he also more frequently has Holmes punching villains, brawling in the betting ring, dodging a massive ship's hull as it lumbers towards him in dry dock, leaping head first out an upper window of the House of Parliament into the Thames, and concluding with a literal cliff hanger atop the then under construction London Bridge. By coincidence, today my cable was also showing a recent James Bond film, and that film offered fewer explosions and violent encounters per minute than SH.<br/><br/>I love Robert Downey and Rachel McAdams is a fetching actress-- but both are wasted in this film. I am reminded of a comment made long ago about the filming of ""Gone With the Wind"" which more or less said, ""The audience will forgive you for what you leave out, but they will have a hard time with what you put in.""

","I love Robert Downey Jr., and he's funny and engaging as always in the role he takes on in this film. Unfortunately, his character, though named after the ""Sherlock Homes"" invented by Arthur Conan Doyle, has almost nothing in common with his literary ancestor. This film's ""Holmes"" is a hyper-kinetic pugilist who excels at swinging numchuks, swan-diving into the Thames from second-story windows, and leaping about city buildings in a manner reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed video game franchise. For that matter, the hyper-real Victorian London of the film's exterior shots has a very similar computer-generated feel to it, one amplified when it vividly depicts the Tower of London on the wrong side of the Thames, among other gaffes.<br/><br/>There is none of the cerebral intensity, none of the subdued emotion, essential to Holmes as a character. A pipe appears precisely three times, and a cigar if proffered but unsmoked. Jude Law's Watson shows little affection for or understanding of this nouveau Holmes, and their little bits of stage business evoke nothing of the vital feeling between them.<br/><br/>That said, if a steam-punk action-adventure film that's built around three or four elaborate chase sequences appeals, this film may be a fun way to spent an afternoon -- it's certainly a decent ""popcorn"" flick.

Why I watched the second one first is unknown to me, but I'm not sure how much I would want to re-watch it after witnessing this. <br/><br/>The plot is average. Crazy man wants to take over the world/immediate area/habitat/country and it's up to Sherlock Holmes and his trusty Watson to stop him. That would be all fine and dandy if the movie didn't start at the end of the conflict, then continue with it for the rest of the movie and constantly make references to the conflict that we never got to witness because the movie started with the end of it. Now that's not the only reason why I didn't like this movie, but it would have been nice if we could have had a movie about that, then a second movie for afterwards, and then have the third movie be Game of Shadows instead. It'd make a nice little trilogy. But I guess that was too hard. Anyway, the plot wasn't horribly original and while I liked, for the most part, the bad guy and his tricks, the rest of the movie was so unappealing that it was difficult to enjoy any part of it. <br/><br/>The characters were fine. I already knew that Sherlock was a quirky character who just did whatever he wanted while Watson was more official, so it really just developed that. We never went any further into the characters, which is perfectly fine. The female character, Irene, only came in when it the conditions were perfect or she needed saving or someone else needed saving, so I didn't care about her because she just came and went as she pleased without doing a whole heck of a lot. <br/><br/>Something that really frustrated me was the fact that the audience never had to chance to think about the case as if progressed. You were left with Sherlock staring at random objects that didn't seem to serve any purpose until the very end of the movie. At the end there's no excited 'A-ha!' or 'Eureka!' moment. He just explains it all very quickly and you just look at the screen and think 'Oh, okay. Cool'. We never get to hear his thought processes throughout the movie so a lot of his explanations come off as far fetched over amazing. Now I understand that that's just part of his character, but maybe that just means that Sherlock Holmes isn't an effectively entertaining character is mystery stories.<br/><br/>Overall Sherlock Holmes is just disappointing. Other than the antagonist and his methods, the movie is very lackluster and poorly done, and even the antagonist isn't horribly original himself.

","You know, come the finale of Guy Ritchie's ""update"" of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's much loved super sleuth I was not only bored to almost impending sleep, but also struck with one overriding question; why not just make a Victorian piece about a couple of swanky buddy sleuths and leave out the name Sherlock Holmes? The answer of course is obvious, to me at least, it's a name that sells. Mr Ritchie would most likely tell us that he wanted to bring the great detective to the attention of a whole new generation, whilst simultaneously making it appealing to the ""youth"" of today. Not elementary my dear Mr Ritchie, it's a cash in if you please. A cash in further aided by the casting of the talented and in vogue Robert Downey Jr as Holmes. Whilst casting Jude Law as Watson {so effectively a secondary role that suits Law perfectly} also carries some aesthetic weight for a younger audience.<br/><br/>The film does pretty much what one expects of a family blockbuster, in short, simple frothy fun that's sadly devoid of any mystery or intelligence befitting the once Deerstalker attired one. There's action and explosions, even good old fist fights given the Ritchie slow-mo make over, but these are either preceded or followed by long bouts of tedium. Not helped by an unadventurous & dull plot involving Mark Strong's {value for money performance} black magic shenanigans as Lord Blackwood, and the pointless inclusion of the anonymous Rachel McAdams as Holmes' ex love interest Irene Adler. All of which comes together for a rather uninspiring show down on a half built Tower Bridge. The set design is smart and on the money (Sarah Greenwood), as are the costumes (Jenny Beavan), but the same can't be said for the sound mix, which is quite frankly skewy and renders some of Downey Jr's brainy ramblings inaudible. Same for the score, Hans Zimmer goes for bombastic, which would have worked if it wasn't in conjunction with diddly day-diddly doo Celtic music. I mean this is Victorian England right? You could have set the film somewhere Celtic Mr Ritchie-since you have changed most of the essence of the character anyway. Hmm.<br/><br/>The sequel is inevitable given that the film has made monster amounts of cash, and no doubt about it, Law & Downey Jr have great chemistry. But this is comic book Sherlock, an attempt at an action comedy mixing brains with brawn. The end result being almost a cure for insomnia. 4/10"

","I thought it would be hard for a remake to be worse than Wild, Wild West but this version of Sherlock Holmes managed to do it. And that was just on old TV series, while Sherlock Holmes founded a whole literary genre.<br/><br/>It's not surprising that this anachronistic action thriller on steroids is popular -- the budget, the production values, the actors all saw to that. What's surprising is that those who claim to have read the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle still maintain that this Victorian James Bond has anything to do with him. This hodgepodge borrows everything, from Indiana Jones in the opening scene to James Bond apocalypses -- everything that is except the original works by Doyle.<br/><br/>What Robert Downey does on the screen may be entertaining, but it has nothing to do with acting. Jude Law is his usual insipid self. Rachel McAdams is her usual glowing self, though totally miscast in what may be the worst-written role in a pathetic script.<br/><br/>Hollywood has truly abandoned any pretense to making quality films in its pursuit of the adolescent audience it thinks will save it.

","Although Sherlock Holmes is undeniably the best detective to be universally known, I should have known the updated film version would not have been as entertaining. I wanted it to be, the casting seemed to have picked the right actors, but instead the result was disheartening.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. stars as the observant detective in a race to discover the plan of the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). No doubt does Downey Jr. give a convincing performance as Holmes but his execution is frustrating if not unconventional. Holmes' powers of deduction are quite impressive just like Ace Ventura, how he can ramble out various illustrations to how certain acts were performed but his means of communication are not what you would call crystal clear. Instead of hearing what Holmes had to say, I heard deep raspy monotone whispering with no change in pitch or annunciations. What did he say? Seriously.<br/><br/>The same goes for Downey's co-star Jude Law who plays Dr. John Watson. I did enjoy some of their exchanges but much of them were just based upon their facial expressions. Half the time I couldn't even tell what they were mumbling about. Another person that didn't really fit into place was Rachel McAdam's character of Irene Adler. The audience is told that she was once a love interest of Holmes. Okay,...so what happened? Why is she acting currently as a mole? What made her become the thing she is in this movie? No explanations were given.<br/><br/>The set designs were not that much of an eye-grabber either. I couldn't believe how colorless every scene looked. Grey, black, brown, some dark yellow, blue and red shades were the only things I caught a glimpse of. For the adventures Sherlock Holmes is known for, this adventure was not very colorful at all. And although this is an adventure film of some sort, I did not really appreciate for the action scenes. How could Sherlock Holmes, a man of the 1800s, receive martial arts training and no one else seem to know of it? <br/><br/>One of the few scenes I actually got a kick out of was when Holmes, Adler, and Watson were in the slaughterhouse. That was an intense moment but for the element of danger, not action. Lastly, the movie soundtrack is the most foreign I have ever heard of. Hans Zimmer, a well-known composer, I thought would have created music with little more panache but all I got instead was a bunch of weird guitar playing. Not cool Zimmer. Pretty lame if you ask me.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the plot here, Robert Downey Jr. does have some good lines but it's hard to understand him half the time. It doesn't help that both the action and music are weird too."

I never pictured Sherlock Holmes to be a strong, tiny man & I think they just did completely horrible things with the characters. Story line and plot and all that was not bad at all definitely some good entertainment but NOT using Holmes & Watson as characters, that just completely ruined the movie because that is NOT what those characters are supposed to be like at all! Definitely going to avoid the new one coming out this year I was already disappointed enough in this one definitely know better than to waste my money this time.

It doesn't feel true to its period, or English society in general. I wanted a version of Victorian-Edwardian England I'd at least recognize. This concoction plays like Michael Bey mugging Arthur Conan Doyle. I will give Robert Downey Jr credit. He does bring some genuine panache to ole Sherlock.

","This movie provides one of the scenarios where the credits look better than the movie. When I first saw the trailer, I began to look forward to seeing Sherlock Holmes. I enjoyed the quick-witted dialogue interspersed with seemingly random flairs of action.<br/><br/>If only the movie had been this good. Granted, I didn't hate it either, and I saw after seeing the two best movies of 2009, Avatar and The Road, so my expectations were a little bit higher as well. However, these expectations aren't insurmountable, as long as q movie is successful in what it aims to do. Sherlock Holmes does not accomplish this. At least, not completely. <br/><br/>The best bits of dialogue were already shown in the trailer. Throughout the movie, Robert Downey spoke in a monotonous mumble, that I, as well as the other movie-going sleuths, often had to decipher for ourselves. That's not to say Downey Jr. Was bad. On the contrary, the bittersweet relationship between Holmes and Watson was the most engaging part of the script. <br/><br/>The plot began interestingly enough, but it was bogged down by the plodding sameness of the scenery, and the obvious sequel set-up. By the end, I found myself wondering why Guy Ritchie had chosen to devote so much time into preparing a sequel that he forgot to pay attention to the script that was in front of him. <br/><br/>Without Downey and Law, this movie would have been a total waste of money. As it is, save your money for a movie more worth your time (Avatar, anyone?), and go see Sherlock in a second-run theater, or better yet, as a rental from Blockbuster."

What a crock. Bad from the opening scenes. When reading more about it here on IMDb, I realized, it's probably because of Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>I really feel sorry for Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They have each been in some good movies, but this time, we walked out after an hour.<br/><br/>There was nothing wrong with the idea of updating Holmes, showing a more physical or emotional side, compared to the dry, almost emotionless way that he's usually been portrayed. In a couple of scenes, I thought, he reminds me of Dr. Gregory House, from the TV show ""House MD"". That would have been an interesting treatment, if it had been consistent or well done.

At least in your dorm, you could make phone calls home and maybe read a book. In a Guy Ritchie movie, all you can do is sleep. And you can't even do that unless you bring earplugs.<br/><br/>Ritchie diligently repeats every piece of information - vital, moderately important, irrelevant - as if convinced the audience shares his I.Q. deficit. Redundancy is a fond memory in his world: dead horses at least make a different noise when beaten in different locations. Shake a stick at Guy Ritchie and you get the same reaction every time, a hollow thud resonating in a void. A very loud hollow thud.<br/><br/>Downey is fine, but he's been better in better comic books. Jude Law is very good, but other than SLEUTH, when was he not? And the great wasteland of this SHERLOCK, and of any Guy Ritchie product, is populated by excellent supporting players brought to mediocrity. Ritchie has succeeded in failing to make Mark Strong an exciting screen presence, a feat even Ridley Scott couldn't accomplish; the lovely Rachel McAdams, who has proved her ability in drama and comedy, here can't even manifest the basic facial expressions of the pantomime: fear? Nope. Passion? Uh-uh. Boredom? Well, we're together on that one.<br/><br/>Yes, I've read every one of the Conan Doyle stories, and yes, there's ample support for Holmes as a pugilist, a narcissist, an adrenaline junkie. What I have failed to find any previous evidence of is Holmes as a soporific. Guy Ritchie has performed a sort of Christmas miracle by making one of the great dynamic intellectuals of literature into a dull, third rate professor of history.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a movie with more than five set pieces, you'd do well to realize you're making an action movie. And if you're making an action movie, it behooves you to ensure that the audience hasn't seen every one of the fights before, not only in countless other movies but in THIS one!

But when it appears the super-villain has mysteriously risen from the grave, Holmes and his nagging but ever loyal sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law) must use all their detective know how and skill to solve the mystery while dodging obstruction from every corner of London society.<br/><br/>A big screen adaptation for 21st century audiences of Arthur Conon Doyle's legendary literary detective was an unusual change of direction for southern hot shot Guy Ritchie to take on, but he's gone at it with his usual gusto, leaving no stone unturned and striving for the most professional job he can get. Unfortunately, his SH is a bewildering mess, a long, heavy, humourless affair that is curiously short on entertainment value.<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue is probably true to the style Doyle originally used in his novels, but it is nonetheless baffling and over-whelming even to someone like me who isn't much of a lover for slang. It manages to be a lot of style with no real substance, and for a 'blockbuster' doesn't give you a lot to be on the edge of your seat about. Performances wise, Downey Jr. tries to get under the skin of the lead character, but doesn't stand out and does a questionable cockney accent, while Law is as bland and unremarkable as ever as the sidekick. Even support like Eddie Marsan and Kelly Reilly can't do anything. Strong is good as the villain, practically playing the role in his sleep, and things do perk up a bit at the end. Overall, though, Ritchie should stick to gangster films. **"

Because when I woke up, I was still able to follow the story just fine. I was at that stage, however, praying for the end to come quickly. The plot is bad, the acting is not much better. I hated the filming style, all that ridiculous slow-motion, fast-motion, fast cuts, narrating the fight scenes ‚Äì all CRAP. And terribly distracting. I think RDJ is a good actor, Jude Law is fine and Rachel McAdams is good, too. So why did they do this movie?

The film looks great with some nice cinematography and strong production design and I didn't even mind the characters - most of them anyway - but the editing and music especially combine to create a final film that trundles along with absolutely no suspense, no intrigue and no mystery. I'm no expert on Holmes but from what I have read/seen these are pretty key. I just finished my third (maybe fourth) attempt at watching it all the way through...

A couple of scenes work because the dominant actors, Geraldine James and Edward Fox respectively, know how to play them; but then each disappears and we're left with the glumly miscast principals, among them the estimable Mark Strong, who might have made an interesting Holmes but is stranded playing a stock villain.

While cinematicly interesting and attractive for the people who have never read a book a day, or even a book a month, as most Ritchie's films are (I love Lock Stock too), this take on the classic is a step too far.<br/><br/>Jude Law is great as Watson, i never doubted that character in his hands (similar to Russian Solomin who played Watson brilliantly, with a healthy dose of humour too), Robert Downey is the usual American take on a superhero, despite of Ritchie's UK heritage, he comes across very far from the character Doyle created. I like Robert Downey too, normally, as an actor, but he';s gone quite a few notches down in my popularity list after making this but not to discredit him too much, Ritchie's whole idea to modernise Holmes stories for the new ""internet generation"" or illiterat6e people who have never held a book in their hands is rather shallow and pathetic (or pedantic as peter Griffin would say), especially for those who love Conan Doyle's books, as most of US remakes of classics are.

I could moan about it for ages, but i guess if i were an 18 year old boy who has never read a true classic book (or a book of any kind) about Holmes, i would have rated it a lot higher, 6-7/10 perhaps, but luckily I know it came nowhere near portraying true great stories and characters, so it was a huge disappointment to me. I wonder what my dear Stephen Fry (big fan of Holmes/Doyle) would think of this atrocity<br/><br/>I have only 1 review published, out of 4 I wrote for IMDb, so this probably won't see the light of day anyway, but for all those with a bit of brain in them, avoid this, if you have any respect for the original great books/characters<br/><br/>To be absolutely objective though (hence 2/10, instead of 1/10), the visuals, the action movie setup, Guy Ritchie's usual fun bits and the cast, it's OK :), but the stories were raped and completely re-interpreted to get a hit at box office. awful, simply awful, made me completely rethink my liking of Guy's movies"

","When you make a movie based on beloved classical fictional characters such as Holmes & Watson, expectations are sure to follow. Had this movie used been made NOT based on these two legendary characters, I believe people would have reviewed it more favourably.<br/><br/>I've read all the books, watched all the DVDs I can get my hands own, and have studied the various interpretations of Holmes & Watson on-screen & on-stage and I was hoping that the success of this movie would trigger a resurrection of interest in the original Conan Doyle stories, perhaps an introduction of the original stories to a newer generation (i.e. similar to a Harry Potter or Twilight).<br/><br/>However, in wanting to appeal to a modern movie-viewing audience I think the movie failed on many counts -- not glitzy & exciting enough for modern day movie-go'ers new to Sherlock Holmes and way too off-the-mark with traditional Sherlockians.<br/><br/>If this is your FIRST introduction to Holmes, please do yourself a favour and give Conan Doyle's stories their proper due by renting or borrowing one of the many movies with Jeremy Brett as Holmes. In my opinion, they are the closest to the stories, and they are WONDERFULLY shot & photographed -- and Brett himself throws truly BECOMES Holmes.<br/><br/>The stories themselves stand on their own, more than 100 years later -- that cannot be said of this horrible movie rendition."

","Entertaining perhaps, but I seriously disagree with those who contend that it represents Doyle's creation. I see comments saying: Holmes practiced boxing, he was adept at drawing large conclusions from small details, he was a serious dabbler in forensic science, etc. Yes, but he was not ADHD. In times of boring inactivity he resorted to cocaine for relief. Some say he had a dog, but I don't believe he had one, and certainly didn't experiment on one with anesthetics. Certain dogs figured in the stories, but they weren't his. He was not abusive to Mrs. Hudson. He sometimes expressed deep appreciation for Watson. But most of all his personality was not at all as represented by the film. His personality was most perfectly represented by Basil Rathbone, but maybe that's just too dull for people addicted to action. If Dr. Joseph Bell was the model for Holmes, then we might look to what is known of him for personality traits. http://www.siracd.com/work_bell.shtml"

","I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for 50 years, but I'm not a purist and have long felt that most large screen portrayals of Sherlock Holmes did him a disservice. Should Holmes and Watson be younger than their traditional casting? Certainly! Can Holmes be a man of action? Of course! His physicality was often implied and sometimes written very explicitly in Doyle's stories. I was looking forward to seeing a characterization of Holmes enriched with these under-realized elements.<br/><br/>But as eccentric as Holmes was, he was also a man of his times. Early in the film, Holmes goes to dinner with Watson to meet his fianc√© Mary-- and he goes unshaved! Holmes may be a slob at home, but he would always be appropriate in public. Then, he insults Mary and Mary throws a glass of wine in his face-- again, two actions that would never take place in the society of the times.<br/><br/>Even so, I tried to put my reservations aside. I saw great potential in Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Holmes, and appreciated Jude Law's re-imagining of Watson. The script, however, failed the characters. Holmes' intellect was mostly ignored; Watson's loyalty was portrayed as irrational. The new interest that Holmes' physicality could have added was undermined because it was overplayed.<br/><br/>Worse, the story was confusing and unengaging. About an hour into the movie, I realized that I was remaining in my seat only because of the ticket price. I was bored by the chaos.<br/><br/>The sets and art direction were excellent but ultimately lacked impact because of their unrelieved darkness.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment is that this current telling of the Sherlock Holmes story, and the franchise that's bound to follow, will prevent any new re-imagining for years to come."

","Yes, sure, the Holmes character in Doyle's original was a skilled fighter, enjoyed opium, and could be quite prickly. I don't think that justifies this treatment of him as a scruffy, debauched, out-of-control lout, constantly in and out of brawls and prison. The angry, irritable Watson character here has little in common with the sycophantic Watson of the books and stories, who devoted his life to chronicling Holmes' remarkable mind. This is 21st century version of Holmes owes more to Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson movies than to Conan Doyle.<br/><br/>There are far too many fights and chase scenes here, far too little ratiocination. The plot of this story is also unworthy of Doyle -- an attempt to turn the murders and intrigues of the original stories into a vast, dark Da Vinci Code conspiracy. <br/><br/>It's as though they cobbled this together using focus groups and formulas. Take one part National Treasure, one part Bond movie, combine with Lethal Weapon, insert special effect etc. <br/><br/>Despite all the noise and action, I was constantly bored. I turned the movie off several times, had a hard time seeing it through to the end. (Another annoying thing: Though Downey does a creditable British accent, he mumbles constantly. You will need a good sound system to make out his words. And no, the problem is not the authenticity of his accent. Jude Law is quite easy to understand.)<br/><br/>Somewhere in between the starchy Holmes character played by Jeremy Brett and the dumb buddy-cop version here lies the true character. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone of any age at any time."

The accents used by the actors can be hard to understand.<br/><br/>The ending is a set-up for a second movie, but I don't expect this one will generate enough of a following to warrant a part two.<br/><br/>Wish I could say something positive, but honestly, it's dull and not worth the time or money.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","26","51","25 December 2009"," Downey Jr. helps ""Holmes"" entertain in a livelier, more modern way
","The grandfather of the mystery genre -- and film's most adapted character -- is none other than the great detective Sherlock Holmes, so if one were to apply Holmes' own deductive reasoning skills, a modern reinvention was a matter of time. English Director Guy Ritchie (""Snatch,"" ""RocknRolla"") applies his witty and gritty crime thriller style to the first mainstream 21st Century version of Holmes, one that will likely appeal to a younger crowd and those less familiar with previous incarnations of the iconic sleuth. <br/><br/>The reason is the new ""Holmes"" is much less concerned with the quality of the mystery and more focused on breathing a new quirkiness and style into the character and his top-notch detective work. The script hopes you'll be hooked on the reveal of how Holmes figures everything out and not so much the crime/mystery itself. In other words our new ""Holmes"" is about creating an entertaining diversion in the form of clever logic, high-brow humor and old-school science -- it uses mystery conventions but to a showier end. Wisely, Warner Bros. has trusted the responsibility of delivering this amusement to one of the best and hottest comedians out there in Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>Downey Jr. continues to impress in his turn as Holmes, managing to employ his same wit and charms while creating a unique character that makes you feel as if you're watching Holmes, not RDJ with yet another accent. This Holmes is not merely a wise detective of old, but the quirky type, suggesting some insanity behind the genius. RDJ makes him much more colorful and entertaining and takes attention away from an okay storyline.<br/><br/>The mystery surrounds Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who appears to have supernatural abilities derived from an ancient magic. He creates terror in London appearing to have risen from the grave and committed a couple murders. Holmes and his dear friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law) are on the verge of ending their partnership because Watson has plans to settle down and marry when the crafty Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) gets them deep into the Blackwood case.<br/><br/>The supernatural angle didn't work well for the latest Indiana Jones film and it doesn't exactly do well here. ""Sherlock Holmes"" Ver. 2009 is a little more Dan Brown ""Angels & Demons"" and a little less ""Se7en."" This is fine for those who can look to Holmes for a more mainstream romp than what an older crowd might hope to be a rigorous exercise in fine mystery and logic. Again, the fewer the expectations, the better.<br/><br/>As for the lean and mean Guy Ritchie depiction of Holmes, it's not entirely unfounded. The script creatively draws the connection between Holmes' intellectual prowess and how he might use it in a physical bout. It adds another dimension and ups the entertainment factor of the character. It might feel like it's giving a character steroids to put on more of a show, but the appeal would be too narrow if Holmes were straight-laced. Credit, however, has to go to Downey Jr. for making this vision work. His banter with Watson and ability to use classic Holmes logic to a comic effect is infinitely enjoyable.<br/><br/>It does take a bit of settling in to understand exactly what direction this new Holmes is going in, but it works thanks to RDJ and picks up as the mystery thickens and Holmes' limits are tested. McAdams' character lacks enough strength to stay memorable and as much as I like Strong, his character lacks dimension too. But the rebirth of Holmes will be a nice Holiday escape for the modern audience and those willing to keep an open mind. It's not your grandfather's ""Sherlock Holmes"" but can you think of any reason why it should be?<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at moviemusereviews.com"

","It's fair to say that Sherlock Holmes is one of my favourite characters in all of fiction. The detective stories in which he features haven't dated one bit in the 120 or so years since they were first written, and they remain fresh and crackling with wit and energy even today. Sadly, this big bucks adaptation of the Holmes canon has absolutely nothing to do with the stories. Instead, the approach is of the typically soulless Hollywood blockbuster, i.e. this a film filled with snappy one liners and extensive CGI action scenes. With Robert Downey Jr. playing the titular sleuth, this is more of a Victorian IRON MAN than it is anything approaching Holmes. Even BBC's RIPPER STREET is closer to the material than this.<br/><br/>SHERLOCK HOLMES is a pretty but uninteresting movie which is interchangeable with the plot of a dozen others. It's a little like the less-than-impressive Jackie Chan vehicle SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, except made with a larger budget. Downey Jr. appears to be channelling the kooky spirit of Johnny Depp rather than the likes of Rathbone or Brett, and Jude Law is the only one who halfway convinces as a youthful Watson. The worst acting award goes to Rachel McAdams, completely out of her depth.<br/><br/>The plot is a nonsensical bit of fluff even worse than the one in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Mark Strong is some black magician who seems to have wandered in from a low budget fantasy flick and the boring action scenes are full of all the soul-crushing explosions and CGI scenery flying about that you'd expect; the green screen climax is particularly poor. Consider this another misfire from Guy Ritchie, whose debut double-whammy of LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH remain the only decent films of his career."

","Two really good things here, and one bad. <br/><br/>The bad is that though there are some good components, the thing never gels. Richie has only one formula for humor, and it doesn't work here ‚Äî probably because illogically we want to think this is real. In his earlier works, Richie depended on his ability to create an alternative universe on top of movie clich√©s. Here he must build on something more fundamental and fails.<br/><br/>One good thing is how the writers mined what was behind the Sherlock phenomenon. At the time the stories appeared, there was a huge battle on for the hearts of the London street. It was ‚Äî dare I say ‚Äî where we are today with the Cairo street. Darwin had presented his theory, and a rush of other scientific discoveries were being made. It really seemed to many that the world was amenable to logic and that at some point logical deduction should come to understand human behavior. <br/><br/>Criminal behavior was seen as some sort of deviance from the healthy and this potentially easier to grasp. So within Londo (and Paris) a strong backlash of spiritualism grew. Magic was the antidote to science, pure and simple. The irony was that the creator of Sherlock was himself the most prominent of the champions of spiritualism. His fictional character was created as something of a cartoon joke. But Sherlock became so popular that Doyle found it impossible to kill him off ‚Äî and write about more ""real"" things. <br/><br/>The failure of logic to describe human behavior continues to the present in our AI disappointments. (A smaller percentage of Americans believe the science of evolution than did the Londoners of 120 years ago.) So the story here is apt and shows both an understanding of this audience and that of the past. People really want to believe in magical stuff.<br/><br/>The more interesting thing is from a cinematic perspective. Suppose you understood the Sherlock stories, and you understood that they were centered on stringing causal agency so that it makes sense. Suppose you wanted to translate this to film: what is essentially a mental process. How would you do it? The standard for the last 75 years was to wait until the end where the detective's though processes were explained. As he or she would recount the reasoning process, scenes that you have already seen would be replayed so that they ""made sense.""<br/><br/>Here we have the first improvement on this in a mainstream film. We do see this standard device at the end. But we see variations on it all through the movie, including several times the ""working out"" what to do next. There are some sideways episodes as well, like the replay of how he stalked his lover in disguise ‚Äî through a circus! This is really intelligent cinematic thinking. Hooray for Guy! This is enough for me to recommend this. But don't expect a successful film.<br/><br/>Downey is great, as always. Rachel McAdams has a strange role to play. Her character really does appear in the original stories as a love interest, but she seems too manipulatable here. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","For those who don't know, the TV show Dr. House, MD (or just ""House"") is based on Sherlock Holmes and his friend Watson, with the characters renamed to House and Wilson.<br/><br/>So, having been a fan of House, the TV show, for a long time, I'm growing bored with it. It's neat that the main character can solve medical mysteries and find cleverly hidden clues in people's lives. But I've grown so tired of watching that miserable person manipulate coworkers and meddle with people's lives. Then I watch the movie Sherlock Holmes. And it's the same stuff with which I'm already bored.<br/><br/>So this movie had that going against it.<br/><br/>Then the mystery was impossible. I mean, there's no need for the audience to even try to figure out anything in the movie, because it's all far too complicated for you to solve. Kinda defeats the purpose of a mystery movie.<br/><br/>And then the story was haphazard. Each scene seemed to pop-up out of nowhere. There was no logical tie-in from one scene to the next. I'd bet you could take all the scenes, shuffle them in a Yatzee cup, and dump them out, letting them land where they may, and the movie would make about as much sense as it does now.<br/><br/>Any good story - particularly where a mystery is being ""solved"" - the audience should be right there with the main character, thinking ahead, knowing where we must search next. We should just barely predict the next location. But instead, it's all so random seeming.<br/><br/>Other than that, I admit, RDJ's body was impressive. My lady friend enjoyed that part of the movie.

Had this film been called the ""Marvelous Adventures of Chuckie and his sidekick Frank"" it may have passed as something of value; as it is, it is a revisionist trashing of the Holmes brand. Nothing about the character portrayed by Robert Downey even comes close to suggesting the persona of Holmes, except maybe the pipe and that was thrown in, it appears, as an afterthought. The plot is silly, the lines ridiculous and the acting is minimal. When the arch villain asks the Houses of Parliament why they are surprised to see him, when all think him dead, it puts an exclamation point on one of the saddest and silliest movies I have seen in a long time.

"dennis_chiu1","8","16","30","28 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes Was Better Than I Expected
","The game is a foot Watson, and not so horrid a spectacle as I expected. <br/><br/>As a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, I had deep misgivings about seeing Guy Ritchie's updated 2009 film based on the previews. I feared that he may depict a Holmes that utilizes brawn more often than intellect. <br/><br/>However, my fears proved mostly unfounded (only ""mostly"" because there is one gratuitous boxing match, featuring Holmes, placed in the screenplay to introduce the character of Irene Adler to the story). Most of the fight sequences are in genuine service to the plot, and several are performed after we hear Holmes plan each blow upon the person to be attacked. This intellectualization and economy of violence eased my fears.<br/><br/>Another of my concerns was that the Sherlock Holmes previews had a supernatural / horror element, which to me was the antithesis of Holmes' application of the scientific method and use of deduction in criminal detection. Being a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I am familiar with the duality that existed in Holmes' creator, where Conan Doyle was trained as a doctor, but became a believer in the supernatural later in life, after suffering a depression following a string of close family deaths. However, even in the last set of Holmes short stories, ""The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes"", Conan Doyle wrote a case that proved that no vampires were involved in the crime at the heart of ""The Case of the Sussex Vampire"". So, in my mind, even in later life, Conan Doyle's belief in psychics and the supernatural did not overwhelm his faith in logic and science.<br/><br/>Mr. Ritchie's version of ""Sherlock Holmes"", in an original story written for the screen by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, blends science, deduction, cults and the supernatural in a story that borrows a little from Dan Brown's conspiracy style plots. <br/><br/>In the end, science and intellect win, and this more than anything else redeems the film from the minor detours from Conan Doyle's Holmes. For example, in one failure in accurately portraying Holmes, to create a cute moment, the 2009 version of Holmes pulls a stolen jewel from Irene Adler's necklace that eventually becomes an engagement ring for Dr. Watson. In my reading of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the famous sleuth would never take a stolen jewel from Irene Adler and give it to Dr. Watson. In one of the original Conan Doyle Holmes cases, ""The Case of the Blue Carbuncle"", Holmes sets upon finding a rare blue jewel and when he finds it, he wires the original owner that he has it. Holmes wires the owner of the jewel despite his rare action of allowing the guilty to escape on Christmas, because it was not his job to remedy Scotland Yard's deficiencies. Conan Doyle wrote Sherlock Holmes with a heart, but with a strong moral core that does not include passing stolen jewelry.<br/><br/>Proper recognition should go to Mr. Ritchie, and his film editor, James Herbert, for an excellent editing job on the film. The film flows from scene to scene with style and panache. I knew I was in good hands from the opening sequence, where the studio logos are blended into the brick streets of London, seamlessly leading into the opening action sequence with Holmes, Watson and Inspector Lestrade in hot pursuit to prevent a murder.<br/><br/>In regards to the actor's performances, I was most impressed with Jude Law's portrayal of Dr. John Watson. Other professional films critics found Jude Law's portrayal to be ineffective. I, on the other hand, found Jude Law's Watson to be the cleanest and best update of all of the Sherlock Holmes characters in the 2009 film, because it was modern, but not a drastic departure from the literature. As written by Conan Doyle, Dr. Watson was never the bumbling portly Watson portrayed by Nigel Bruce in the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films. In the books and short stories, Dr. Watson was thin, tanned, and has a strong, stout neck.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes was mixed. Mr. Downey did an excellent job portraying the intellectual side of Holmes, but the choice to make Holme's physical appearance slobbish was inaccurate and deeply unattractive. In Conan Doyle's ""The Hound of the Baskerville"", Sherlock Holmes is described as having ""cat-like"" love of personal cleanliness, so portraying Holmes with a lack of personal hygiene was a serious and unnecessary departure from the original character. Further, even if Mr. Ritchie and Mr. Downey purposefully intended to depart from Conan Doyle's classic character and make Holmes a filthy mess, I disagree with the choice on a practical film level. I found Mr. Downey an unattractive hero and unpleasant to look at. I wanted to cut his hair, give him a shave, and scrub him down with antibiotic soap. In general, a hero still looks attractive if he or she starts the film clean, becomes grimy during the course of the adventure and is clean at the end. Mr. Downey is a mess throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the portrayal of 19th Century England, and the shots a top an under-construction London Bridge. Each scene is handsomely decorated and the environment felt authentic.<br/><br/>In total, I found ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) to be a relatively successful attempt to rejuvenate the famous consulting detective."

","Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is unsurprisingly not faithful to Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, however this does not necessarily make it a bad film, and it is possible for Ritchie and co. to have made an impressive film with the Sherlock Holmes character. Hiring the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. and using ""Batman Begins"" as the template for a critically and commercially successful opening to a film franchise.<br/><br/>Alas, the film isn't very good. Guy Ritchie's fingerprints are on the film as seen in the bare knuckle fighting sequences and the use of the city of London as a backdrop and character. There is also the usual traits of Hollywood blockbusters; fight scenes, CGI explosions and cartoonish villains with a plot to take over the world. Conan Doyle's ideas are marginalised but they provide the best bits of the film. The character of Sherlock Holmes is vividly brought to life by Downey Jr. who interprets the character as an arrogant, charming genius who needs to be occupied by a case or he'll fall apart. There are hints of a clever plot, however the plot is rushed and underdeveloped resulting in an absurd plot by the two dimensional villain Lord Blackwood to restore the British Empire. Instead of plot development there are several fight scenes and explosions which add nothing of substance and add little style.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes"" takes little from Arthur Conan Doyle's stories and makes up the rest with Hollywood blockbuster clich√©s and the tiresome traits of Guy Ritchie's films, resulting in a poor adaptation and a poor film."

","I was about ready to question the legitimacy of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) adding martial arts skills to his repertoire, but a few other reviewers set me straight on that point. The camaraderie between Holmes and his partner Watson (Jude Law) points to a decidedly more equitable relationship between the two than was ever exhibited between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, or any of the other pairings I've seen from the Thirties and Forties. The whole idea takes a little getting used to, and in the hands of a less capable director than Guy Ritchie, might not have worked out quite as well. Ritchie applies a lot of the smart-alecky type of humor evident in such earlier efforts as ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". Robert Downey Jr. takes to his role well by applying some of that old Tony Stark arrogance and comes off as a master tactician. That is, if you find credible such mental feats as describing the path to the headquarters of Sir Thomas Rotheram's (James Fox) Temple of the Four Orders while blindfolded. While generally enjoying the story, I kept wondering whether the name of Professor Moriarty would ever wind up being mentioned, and on that point, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) provided a clue near the end of the story as well as capably setting up a sequel. For fans of the old time Sherlock Holmes flicks, this one might appear a bit jarring for one's tastes, though I found it rather entertaining myself. It appears that a modern day franchise has been well established."

","A+<br/><br/>If there is one genre I began to detest over the years, it was the 'buddy-action' flicks. You know the movies where two guys who aren't exactly friends are forced to form an uneasy alliance which leads to hilarious escapades. It's only been done a thousand and one times, note the long line of duos: Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson (""Die Hard 3""), Will Smith & (""Wild Wild West""), Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan (""Rush Hour""), and let's not forget Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson (""Shanghai Knights""). Though many (but certainly not all) of the aforementioned films are indeed funny, few have any real lasting qualities and even fewer a challenging storyline. The best they can often do is throw an alluring female co-star between the two leads, but I digress.<br/><br/>This film however, stands a monumental achievement. Firstly, the cast is really something else. Robert Downey Jr. as our titular character, and he does a bang up job playing a man who's a mystery in himself. Jude Law is entertaining and I'm glad Eddie Marsan was aboard. Mark Strong makes for a very impressive antagonist, and Rachel McAdams is a seductive femme fatale of sorts. The gloomy setting, 1800s London, couldn't be better realized and it definitely gives the film a darker tone. <br/><br/>Most importantly though, the story is truly a one-of-a-kind detective tale. It really is a pitting of rationality vs. superstition, and to my heart-thumping exhilaration for the majority of the film you would think good old logic had been defeated. Moving on before I spoil anything. The plot twists and turns menacingly, and leaves one astounded by the effort put into the writing.<br/><br/>Lastly, kudos to composer Hans Zimmer who did a very catchy leitmotif that fit the film perfectly. The gray-blue cinematography is great, and I've got to congratulate Guy Ritchie on his feat."

"pivic","3","11","20","3 January 2010"," review from a Holmes aficionado
","To say I have a lot to do with Sherlock Holmes would be an understatement. For quite some time, I lived and breathed Holmes and the world that Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of. It all began when I was 12 years old and crossed paths with the TV-series produced by Granada, where Jeremy Brett played Holmes. My mind expanded, not only by seeing the most powerful and well-known private consulting detective in the world trip the light amazing through the aid of a seven-per-cent solution of cocaine in ""The Sign of Four"", but because Brett was The One. I knew he _was_ Holmes. And slowly my obsession took shape. I watched the Rathbone films, started - granted, at a much later age - following Holmes' adventures through the short-stories, then the novels, then more films before stumbling onto the web and Leslie S. Klinger's ""The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes"", an ubiquitous tome for all those impaired by the virus to know all. To compare. To sketch out paths, know how Holmes came to certain conclusions and to eradicate him from guilt (where Doyle made some logical errors in the stories about Holmes; which are, of course, not errors at all...). In short, yes, I love the Sherlock Holmes universe. Of course all aided by my anglophilia and the fact that I, severely interested in serial-killers, have followed the world of Jack The Ripper very closely from a young age; that age is approximately the very same as that of Holmes'. It all blends and comes together, deerstalker, blood, London and awe. Ooh, I love it.<br/><br/>And here comes Guy Richie with a film, an American actor (Robert Downey Jr.) as Holmes and Jude Law as a quite acrobatic Watson. These two are about to part ways as Watson is to marry, and Holmes falls head-long into a slump of sorts, not wanting Watson to leave him. Along comes Lord Blackwood, the most acerbic villain, ever. He dresses goth-cum-Gestapo and acts Most Evil in the most tawdry manner, merely being a wooden plank at best. Oh, we get it. He's bad. And Downey-Holmes? Most of the time he displays his ways of applying logic to win by fighting. Holmes knew how to fight, and despite preferring mind to rule over matter, Richie has apparently thought the film to be at its best through brawn rather than brain.<br/><br/>And comedic passings, for the dark, musky men who seek out Holmes' destruction are all very furrowed brows and simply lead. I went to the cinema with an open mind, having seen the trailer and not thinking about the consequences; I let myself see this without trying to see Downey-Holmes as Holmes, as with the rest of the characters. Marsan-Lestrade was fair, but definitely not McAdams-Adler, who was a faint memory of the ephemeral and intelligent person from The Canon. Well, intelligence pushed aside, was there a saving grace? Yes, the film was quite entertaining. It reminded me of ""Young Sherlock Holmes"", a 1985 film made with heart with no basis in The Canon, where the young Holmes and Watson meet up and try to thwart an evil empire as run by cultists. A few non-basic elements from the film were snatched from The Canon as well, e.g. the coach-ride from ""The Greek Interpreter"", and Holmes' guessing the identity of a person as in ""A Scandal In Bohemia"". But, also pushing The Canon aside, was there anything to this? Yes, I'd say an action-filled blockbuster aimed for the American-international market through slightly English eyes, stirring up a couple of laughs, awakening my boyish need for adventure-films. I like Downey Jr.'s acting, even though this film did not require any subtleties, never mind the masterful acting that Brett performed in said TV-series. Law did good. McAdams was boring. Of course there'll be a sequel to this film, and of course I'll see it, but I daresay I won't be paying for it."
"colonel_green","9","11","20","28 December 2009"," An entertaining swashbuckler that gives a great character a new lease on life.
","Sherlock Holmes has been identified by the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the most frequently used fictional characters in history. Appearing first in the 60 stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he has subsequently went on to make hundreds (if not thousands) of appearances in novels, film, television, and radio, with the part essayed by a number of very talented actors, with Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett the most notable. Adventures on the big screen have been slim pickings for a while (the last really notable one was 1985's ""Young Sherlock Holmes"", obviously a bit of a break with traditional formulas) as TV adaptations have been the go-to medium. This new entry aims to jumpstart a new cinema franchise and introduce Holmes as a living character to a new generation of fans (as opposed to just being a cultural touchstone), with the assistance of talents like Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. This has been met with understandable wariness by longtime fans, but I would say that overall the movie succeeds admirably at its goal. Some spoilers follow.<br/><br/>The bare bones of the plot (summarized in innumerable places elsewhere): Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) crack the case of a series of ritualistic murders and arrest the man responsible, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong; doing a lot of villain-work this year, and looking like a British crossbreed of Andy Garcia and Stanley Tucci). However, even after Blackwood is hung by the neck until dead, trouble continues, and it appears that he may indeed have risen from the grave thanks to the black magic he claimed to possess. Holmes is back on the trail of the seemingly-resurrected villain, while former acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) reenters the picture, in the employ of an anonymous stranger. And on the domestic front, Watson is getting engaged to the nice Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) and preparing to move out of his Baker Street bachelor flat, much to Holmes' annoyance.<br/><br/>I would say that this film has been somewhat poorly-represented by its trailers and promotional material (not poorly served, though, if the box office returns are any measure), which plays up the action to a point that will turn off many diehards (though one imagines they'll still see it to feel the joy of bilious outrage). While there is certainly more physicality to this production than to your average BBC adaptation, director Guy Ritchie retains the core of Holmes as a cerebral man (and, truth be told, Doyle's original knew his way around a fight, even if the author didn't spare much prose on depicting it). Tastes change a bit, and, so long as the core of the character isn't lost, it's fine by me to show him in a few scraps.<br/><br/>Downey's Holmes is a brilliant/eccentric mind with addiction issues, and rather poor hygiene (I tend to think of him as being more precise, even when troubled, but whatever). But he's always on top of things. Saints be praised, though, for Jude Law's Watson, who will hopefully go a long way toward rescuing the character from the bumbling ghetto created by Nigel Bruce's characterization and carried on ever since. Law gives us a strong, confident Watson who is an indispensible part of Holmes' operation, and possessed of considerable deductive prowess of his own. The film really hangs on the Holmes/Watson interaction, and Downey and Law hit it off marvelously. The film opens in media res (a smart move, really; it's not like anyone is unaware of who these characters are and how they work), and you get a palpable sense of two people who've been working together for a very long time. The ladies threatening to intrude on this male-bonding exercise, McAdams and Reilly, are both fine, though the writers sometimes seem a bit insure of what to do with Irene (they know enough about the mythos to know that Holmes isn't the romantic type, even if this is a bit more in that direction than most depictions, so this is a fairly mild case of Catwoman). Mark Strong glowers and growls sufficiently as the villain.<br/><br/>While heavier on the action than your typical Holmes story, and a lot grimier in its production design (true to life, one imagines; outside of the upper class, Victorian London wasn't the cleanest of places), Ritchie and his writers retain a lot of the core Holmes story aspects. A villain with seemingly mystical powers must be confronted, and Holmes' logical mind must inevitably pierce the veil and uncover the rational explanation behind it all (outlined in a marvelous little climactic scene). And, as we find out, Holmes has been slowly building his case through the whole movie, but rarely letting anything on. The film also does a pretty good job of making Holmes' end-of-film explanation visually interesting, rather than just a dull monologue.<br/><br/>The film ends with some quite obvious sequel setup, and given the box office numbers, it's pretty likely we'll see a ""Sherlock Holmes 2"" in a few years; I welcome it."
"thetaoofjoe","5","19","39","27 December 2009"," A mediocre film that knows it could have been much better.
","Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is that rare piece of forgettable  mediocrity not content with leaving the audience to guess how it  could've been a better film. Instead, the movie chooses to one-up us by  showing how it could be better in the first half.  As played by Robert Downey, Jr., the Holmes in this film is an uncouth  and scruffier detective than the ones we've seen in previous  adaptations. Some might complain he no longer wears that ridiculous  deerstalker hat or the fact that he never says, ""Elementary, my dear  Watson."" That said, opening scenes are quite steeped in what really  made Sherlock Holmes such a fascinating character ¬ñ his uncanny sense  of deductive reasoning.   Hot on the trail of a murderous cult leader named Lord Blackwood (Mark  Strong), he spots some hired muscle guarding a corridor. Then in an  inventive sequence, we hear Holmes' inner monologue as he sizes up the  goon's various weaknesses based on the way he walks. Meanwhile,  Ritchie's ever-anxious camera gives a slowmo, telegraphed demonstration  of how the fight will actually go down, followed by a sped-up version  wherein Sherlock bests his foe with almost phantom speed and accuracy.  A similar moment takes place later on during a hilarious boxing match,  but then this approach is abandoned for the rest of the film. This is a  real shame, as it was a lot more fun to watch than the mindless  fisticuffs that punctuate the latter two-thirds like exclamation marks  in used car lot ads.  We get another great moment after Lord Blackwood is apprehended wherein  Dr. Watson ¬ñ played by Jude Law who walks away with the entire show ¬ñ  coaxes Holmes to leave his cluttered office for a change and meet him  at a restaurant. Holmes obliges, arriving at the restaurant early only  to lose his mind paying attention to the tiny physical details and tics  he could use to identify every single person in the room. Again, this  moment was a solid inclusion for a movie attempting to reinvent  Sherlock Holmes for the Mountain Dew generation. If the good detective  must become a scruffy action hero, at least let him be a thinking man's  scruffy action hero.  But then the movie ditches the point of view that powered the first act  in favor of slap-happy double and triple crosses that make little sense  in terms of both the characters and story, and worst of all, the film  loses sight of Holmes. Oh, we still see him all right, but we're no  longer inside his head as he investigates a mystery that points to  Blackwood returning from the grave after being executed for his crimes  and attempting to put his pagan cult in control over London. And when  it comes to movie villains, Blackwood is more of the dumb James Bond  variety. He might be brilliant enough to invent the first remote  control biological weapon, but he bungles important details like  loading his bombs with enough explosives to kill his enemies when they  detonate them.  According to the opening credits, ""Sherlock Holmes"" was scripted by  three screenwriters ¬ñ Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon  Kinberg ¬ñ and while this is not unusual for a studio blockbuster, my  hope is that the producers will realize which ones were responsible for  the movie's best parts (i.e. the beginning) and rehire them alone to  pen the inevitable sequel.   The only praise I could give the trio of writers collectively for their  Frankenscript is that they had the smarts not to make Sherlock's foes  capable of actual magic. I spent much of the film dreading that this is  what they were going to do. And while you can deprive the detective his  hat and oft-quoted line, if you remove the logic as well, you might as  well call it something else."
"AlanJ2","4","19","39","22 December 2009"," Holmes returns in visually arresting but largely comedic Guy Ritchie style
","Sherlock Holmes is a tricky subject for modern audiences. His cerebral characteristics are, if anything, over-familiar yet if changed too much there is little point in doing the character at all. Guy Ritchie has gone for Holmes as jokey and slightly camp action hero with Downey giving an energetic (if anything too energetic) performance. Whereas in 'Iron Man', Downey perfectly caught the dry decadence of the character, here he plays Holmes as a volatile modern eccentric who seems to spend most of his time sleeping on the floor, jumping around and trying to trick Watson (Jude Law) out of getting married. It isn't enough to make us care about the character, perhaps because he doesn't convincingly seem to care about anything very much himself. In contrast Jude Law plays Watson commendably straight, again as a man of action (though he doesn't have enough to do) and there is a good villain in Mark Strong as an aspiring black magician. The film has quite a look to it and a fast pace but, thanks to the comedic tone, nothing ever seems to be at risk. Even one of the best action sequences (in which Watson appears to be killed) ends not with a bang but a line of dialogue ""Watson's alive"", which feels oddly like a cop-out.<br/><br/>As for the trade-mark Holmesian deduction, it is derisory. Indeed it typifies the whole problem with this venture in that for something supposed be based on wit, it isn't nearly witty enough. For example Holmes concludes instantly that one character is a Professor because he sees two chalk-marks on his clothes. Why not a school teacher, a surveyor or a pavement artist? Given such low calibre stuff, it's easy to forget the character in the books had flashes of genuine brilliance. Guy Ritchie fans will obviously lap this up, his trade-marks are all here but I'm guessing 'Iron Man'-type success is a very distant hope"
"thesar-2","4","10","18","3 January 2010"," Nothing to Write Holmes About
","I guess I'm thankful for not being exposed to the previous movie installments of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, as most critics are opposed to how this relates to them. I was able to enter with a clear and open-mind. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed.<br/><br/>There was a lot to like, however, in 2009's Sherlock Holmes. I've always loved, and probably always will love Robert Downey, Jr. He did a fantastic job in his stab at the brilliant, but troubled sleuth. He did have a lot of low-brow humor, which I favor in films. (You see this mostly in real British humor.) In addition, I am always about the ""Super-Man"" characters who know all and barely ever defeated. You'll see a ""super-human"" Holmes who can not only do no wrong, but can barely take a beating even when punched.<br/><br/>As for the previews, which did NOT in any way persuade me to see this movie, I didn't like how he, in slow motion, hit other men in ""combat."" I loved on how they explained that and what was going on in his mind at the time ‚Äì the planning and execution. Too bad they only did that 2-3x in the film. And finally, I loved the cinematography, the sets and the feel/look of the late 1800s England.<br/><br/>Okay, that's where my warm feelings end. As for the rest, at very least I can safely say: I won't see any more sequels to this. Furthermore, I never want to see this movie again.<br/><br/>It was far too long, it was far too forced and though some scenes were well crafted, they were far too spaced out. The movie's set in England and yet maybe one person actually has an English accent. The movie boasts as a ""fun, action-adventure"" when I found very little fun, a few minor action scenes and the adventure was just so-so. And the ending¬Ö? Not to give anything away, the climax has been done so many fracking times, I can't count. Actually, make that, I can. There probably have been as many movies made with this same ""surprise/twist/revelation"" ending as there has been years since this movie was set.<br/><br/>Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and heterosexual life-partner Watson (Law) are not only crime fighters, but roommates. Well, Watson wants out and in with his soon-to-be wife. Holmes finds he will be lonely without him, but continues on with a mission against a ""Dark Lord"" Blackwood (Strong) who kills for sacrifice and apparently can rise from the dead. Holmes is suspicious and works with Watson to solve the political mystery behind Blackwood's ambitions.<br/><br/>There, I described the entire 2+ hour film in a few short words. Throw in a mysterious woman (McAdams) who's in the movie as much as Angelina Jolie is in Gone in Sixty Seconds. In other words, less than 10% of the film and there: you have the whole film. Unfortunately, you will also have to throw in a bunch of smelling (literally), wise-cracks, ancient explosions and ""National Treasure"" sleuthing.<br/><br/>I have to give it to them; it was a unique film, whereas, it wasn't your typical action-adventure that, if made in the 1990s, Mel Gibson would star. But it wasn't anything really to write ""holmes"" about. Okay, that was bad, yet, so was the movie."
"nachiketajoshi-1","8","18","37","22 December 2009"," The classic ensemble with a new twist
","I saw this movie in a preview. I have read almost all of Sherlock Holmes stories but watched none of the movies or video, so went with a blank mind. I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of smart banter. Stylized fights. High production values with convincing landscape of the London of late 1800s. English humor but not too dry. If you have to have the faithfully reproduced characters, then you will be disappointed. However, the characters here have a lot of zing. I was reminded of the endless stream of comic book movies Hollywood have churned out for ""thinking adults"". In this case, the set up was already for brainy folks, so the challenge was to make it appealing for the contemporary audience and the director has succeeded not only on that count, but also in creating his own style. The background music suggests a fast tempo and goes well with the story. In some ways, the movie reminded me of the Indiana Jones and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I wish the story were a bit less predictable, though. 7.5/10."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","9","16","26 December 2009"," Not the same thing, nevertheless enjoyable
","Sherlock Holmes devotees should expect this screen rendering of their hero to be quite unrecognizable, given the persona of the talented actor in the title role. In fact it is not even remotely close to the version that I like best, Peter Cushing's portrayal in ""The Hound of Baskervilles"" (1959). But those who have a broad mind and enjoy good cinema should have no problem having fun with this movie, for the same reason, the talented actor in the title role (Robert Downey Jr.), not to mention also the two most adorable heartthrobs on today's big screen (Jude Law and Rachel McAdams).<br/><br/>The plot and story are so formulaic and contemporary (in the sense not of the period setting, but of the content: mysterious cult, secret symbols ‚Äì it has Dan Brown written all over it) that it doesn't feel Holmes at all, despite some familiar names like Inspector Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Professor Moriarty and Irene Adler. Presence of other regular Holmes elements such as observation and deductive power, delirious spells, boxing skill, chemistry expertise, just to name a few, somehow fail to conjure up the iron-nerved, eccentric, super-intelligent private detective of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's recreation. Even the dialogues fail to carry any convincing British humour and subtlety. Instead, you have things like tribute to iconic American comedian Jack Benny: Holmes trying to use Watson to illustrate a point, says to Mary, the latter's fianc√©e ""Take Watson¬Ö"", and without missing a beat, Mary quips, ""I fully intend to"".<br/><br/>But despite the rather simplistic approach, this movie is delightfully enjoyable. The Downey Jr.'s version of a somewhat blundering Holmes brings out this actor's best. Law responds with his sarcastic, contemporary of Watson that generates good chemistry with the protagonist. Irene Adler, in whose brief appearances in Doyle's work is referred to by Holmes as ""the woman"", is brought to life by lovely and witty McAdam, another bright spot in this movie and well poised for the sequel (maybe ""a"" sequel, depending obviously on audience reaction to this first one). The art and action directors have all done a fantastic job. Yes, this is not your version of Sherlock Holmes but at least it's your version of Robert Downey Jr."

"mpless","4","12","23","30 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes for the brain-dead
","By-passing the outraged and ignorant who seem to think the only Holmes is the one played so well by Basil Rathbone many years ago, this movie nonetheless lacks a great deal of entertainment value, and treats the audience as if they were dim-wits. Having said that, I am delighted that Watson is portrayed as something other than a bumbling foil, but more of Jude Law's role later.<br/><br/>The quantity of expository dialog grates after the first few minutes, and the attempts to show Holmes' thinking by using voice-overs becomes tedious. There are better ways of doing this, but if you're pitching at a CSI-style audience (as a retired forensic scientist, I can assure you all that we do not lean on our instruments, and discuss the basic principles of their function with each other), then perhaps the laziness or ineptness of the script-writer(s) is understandable.<br/><br/>Downey appears to be reprising his role as Stark in Iron Man, but with Jude Law as his near-constant companion just to provide some modicum of variety.<br/><br/>The action comes quickly, and with little let-up, but this is no handicap to the enjoyment. The somewhat washed-out colors and the fact the scenes are almost always in dim locations means much of the movement is hard to discern in the gloom and surely action needs to be clearly seen? The sets themselves show obvious artifacts of cgi and after pieces like Gladiator and more recently the brilliant Avatar, the audience is left feeling either budgets prevented the job being done properly or more dangerously, that the studio didn't care, thinking the drawcards of Holmes, Downey and Law were sufficient.<br/><br/>Though Downey tries hard, it is Law who comes across as more convincing and is the focus of attention whenever the two are together. His portrayal is the highlight of the movie. The lowlight is, obviously, the handcuffed Downey, naked on the bed with only a teddy-bear for modesty. This is US-sit-com stuff and the fact such a tired, clich√©d scene features heavily in previews shows the utter lack of imagination the scriptwriters put into their work. And of course, the giant who wreaks mayhem and is near-invincible has been done to death. Is it such a crime to bring something new to the audience?<br/><br/>The climax was both predictable and tedious, but thankfully has one recommendation: it showed the end was near. There are many movies where the talents of the cast are wasted. Sadly, this can so easily be added to the list, and must be done so immediately."

","For starters, the two stars should have switched roles. Jude Law could have pulled off a Sherlock Holmes that one would have wanted to see in this movie and even in some sequels. Plus, Downey could have done Watson as a rumpled genius who gave more support than is generally known. Then, to actually have made the whole thing work, a different director, one who hasn't been marinating in the sexually confused alternate universe of Mr.Madonna, could have made a buddy movie for this age that revealed a mind meld without bedroom influences. Gee, where is Alfred Hitchcock when you need him? He knew when and how gay inferences should be used to season rather than poison a franchise-worthy film."

I certainly didn't get a sense of Sherlock Holmes; He just didn't look English. the hats all wrong.<br/><br/>They also threw in a little bit of (thinly disguised) masonic conspiracy in there as well, perhaps a touch of Da Vinci code and just to make sure American's cared about the ridiculous plot the bad guy planned on taking back American.

","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) go head to head with the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has plans for world domination. A lady from Holmes' past named Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to help them--or is she? <br/><br/>OK--I have no problem with trying to reinvent Sherlock Holmes. I've read all the books multiple times and have seen all the movies and most of the TV shows. Trying to update him is not a bad idea BUT he should retain some of what made the character famous. Ritchie obviously doesn't agree and completely destroys the detective. For starters Downey Jr. (a wonderful actor) plays Holmes all wrong. He seems to be drugged out at all times and mumbles his lines in a half-hearted way. Where's the intensity Holmes is supposed to have when he's on a case? Downey shows none of that. His face never changes expression! Even worse is McAdams as Adler. She looks hideous and gives a worse performance than Downey! She is so annoying that, at one part, when she's about to be killed with Holmes trying to save her I felt like saying, ""Oh let her die!"" The plot itself makes little sense and is needlessly convoluted. Also the film looks grubby, poorly lit and just plain ugly! Perhaps this was an accurate portrayal of Victorian England but this is supposed to be escapism NOT a documentary! <br/><br/>On the plus side Law is great as Watson. He doesn't play him like a bumbling fool--he's young, intelligent and Holmes' equal. He also tells Holmes off in some great parts. Also Strong gives a very strong (sorry) performance as Blackwood. The man is tall and just oozes evil. Also there are multiple action sequences with Holmes and Watson battling the bad guys silly. Now turning Holmes and Watson into action heroes may seem dumb but these are the only parts of the film with any life! Director Ritchie is known for shooting fights and violence in a very convincing way and it works here. These set pieces look like they belong in a dumb summer blockbuster film but at least they add some much needed jolts of life to this movie. However I was looking at my watch a lot during the last hour and could have cared less what was happening. I almost walked out and I NEVER do that! This gets a 2 for the action and some good acting...but I was bored silly. Not recommended."

","I'll start with the good: the indoor sets are magnificent. Outdoors is great, too, in the narrower alleyways (though it seems like we keep seeing the same horses over and over again), but for wide shots, an excessively CGI-ish feel interfered with my suspension of disbelief. And Robert Downey, Jr. is a magnificent talent, who held my attention when he was on the screen, as he always does, despite the weakness of the character and the writing in this film.<br/><br/>That's as positive as I can be about this movie, on which I have just wasted what felt like a few more hours than the clock said it was.<br/><br/>It was just so very boring and, in the large ways, unfocused. There was no coherent narrative frame, just a lot of random action, bouncing around within the confines of some vague story that seemed almost beside the point, nothing to do with what was happening on the screen most of the time, which seemed to be more about replicating as many action movie clich√©s as possible. We journeyed through Bond movie clich√©s, Vietnam movie clich√©s, buddy comedy clich√©s, with touches of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>There was small-scale cleverness in some of the lines. On the larger narrative scale, though, it was tone-deaf. Where we never got to was the film maker using film as a medium to tell me a story that he thought was worth telling.<br/><br/>I suppose if you want mindless action with the magnificent Downey and a soup√ßon of Doyle, you could do worse. But this movie is not the good stuff, and it will not endure."

","Fast-paced, stylish, great sets, good action, and enough brain teasing to cater to the not yet dead-in-the-head, but is it Sherlock? I guess it is now...<br/><br/>It says in the trivia notes that Downey Jr studied Granada Television's Jeremy Brett's characterization of the great sleuth. I'm glad he didn't study him too closely because I much prefer Downey as Holmes. If the image of a lean, ascetic, high fore-headed, aquiline-nosed, drawn-cheeked, somewhat saturnine detective has to be banished, why not go all the way and replace him with someone Conan Doyle never had in mind in a million years but who is at least charming.<br/><br/>I suppose it all comes down to casting and this was cast by current box- office appeal, with no regard to the fictional characters. The best or the most glaring example of this is Rachel McAdams who seems to have wandered off the set of a contemporary romantic comedy into London of the 1890s. Her presence in every scene is like having one of the period characters suddenly put a cellphone to his ear and take a suck at a Starbucks cup. The set design is fantastic: London of the time must've looked a lot like this, and although the clash exaggerates the time warp effect the sets win in the end, and with the excellent supporting cast make the movie credible, while Downey and Law do their best to make it in-credible - but that's what we're paying for after all. <br/><br/>If you want the real Sherlock, and envision the character as Conan Doyle imagined him, read the books. If you want 2 hours of amusement go see this and you won't be disappointed."

","This was the worst portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters that I have ever seen. The plot made no sense whatsoever. As with most new versions of older stories/characters, the main characters become nothing more than street brawlers.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read the original stories would see this in an instant, and anyone who has seen the faithful adaptations done by PBS starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke will see how poor this movie is.<br/><br/>It was so bad, that I walked out halfway through the movie. The only similarity to Doyle's original characters is their names. Holmes was not a brawler. He was an extremely intelligent character who only used cocaine when bored. There was no indication in the original stories that Dr. Watson had a gambling problem. Irene Adler was not a streetwise, slutty thief - she was a renowned, honorable opera singer. Just read ""A Scandal in Bohemia."""

","I am an great admirer of Robert Downey Jr and he acts very well in this film but Sherlock Holmes he is not.<br/><br/>This is not a good film. It is equally as bad as ""Where are the Morgans?"" that I had the misfortune to see a few nights ago. Where is the film industry going? I watched Wallander with Kenneth Branagh on TV a couple of nights ago. That is great writing, great acting and great cinematic photography. Entrancing. That is the standard we are looking for. As a film Sherlock Holmes is comprehensively not even third rate. It takes a lot of talent to make even a bad film. There is lot of talent and money on display but a bad film this is.<br/><br/>The script is amateurish; no sense of onward momentum within scenes and from one scene to the next. Did anyone read an elementary book on screen writing? It is Dan Brown without the story-telling ability, the characterization and the inventiveness. Guy Ritchie, what has happened to you? Amazing special effects but all very noisy and incoherent. Give it a miss. It is two hours long but the middle hour seems like three."
"ihatemichaelbay88","7","12","24","26 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes Has A Lot of Bad Complimented By A Lot of Good
","The Bad <br/><br/>1. The villain - I truly thought that Lord Blackwood was a terrible villain. There was nothing about him that really intrigued me. Sure, he is a ""sorcerer."" Sweet (no idea that Lord Voldemort invaded the Sherlock Holmes universe before going after Harry Potter). There are a few good twists revolving around Blackwood. But in a Sherlock Holmes movie, I would have preferred to see an antagonist more along the lines of Jack the Ripper as the source of Holmes' cases. Mark Strong turns in a convincing but forgettable performance as Blackwood. His character is not very well developed and does not get a large amount of screen time. In better scripts, such as The Dark Knight with the Joker or Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lector, it is effective to use the villain sparingly. In SH, on the other hand, I often nearly forgot all about Holmes' nemesis. I realize that the writers were going for some originality with using a supernaturally driven villain. I will admit that I haven't read the books and my Holmes knowledge only goes as far as legend and Wikipedia. However, Lord Blackwood seemed all wrong for this movie. <br/><br/>2. Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler) - She is gorgeous. Her looks alone will be enough to encourage any man to buy a ticket. Her performance and character, on the other had, were nothing to write home about. Adler's part in the movie is fairly ambiguous. The script finally informs the audience of her motives at the end in some short dialogue, but by that point I did not even care anymore. Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler was so stale and poorly written that I ignored her presence in most scenes. I will say that this is more the issue of the script than McAdams. She seemed to be trying her best to bring the character to life and she flaunts her beauty to keep to audience focused. Sorry, Rachel. Irene Adler is too awful of a character for even your face to win over fans. <br/><br/>3. The Script - LONG. And it is only a two hour movie. That should give you an idea of the surplus of blandness in the script. If I were to give Guy Ritchie some advice for the director's cut, I would probably tell him to cut out thirty-five minutes of the movie. Adding additionally footage to SH would put even the most caffeinated person to sleep. There are some great elements to the script with the witty dialogue. Having said that, the story is at times incomprehensible and quite frankly boring. After the first fairly entertaining hour of the movie, prepare for forty minutes of draaaaaaaag. Sherlock's solutions came a little too late to save this screenplay. <br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>1. Downey Jr. and Jude Law - Please, everyone, stop saying that these two are miscast. Both actors (given what they had to work with) were excellent. Robert Downey Jr. sports a good enough British accent while convincingly portraying the genius, sarcastic persona of Sherlock Holmes. I would say that Holmes' monologues of explaining the gray areas in the case are some of the best parts of the film. RDJ does a great job of convincing audiences that Holmes can be a martial arts expert while at the same time possessing a strong aptitude for sleuthing (I don't know if this film's depiction of Holmes is accurate for the original Sherlock, but this mediocre script called for it and RDJ delivered in what could have been a highly laughable character). Jude Law's Watson is refreshing in that he is actually very helpful to Holmes. Unfortunately, his character disappears in the last thirty minutes of the movie (he comes back for the final scene). However, Law has enough screen time to please audiences with his performance. As has been said many times before on this thread, the chemistry between RDJ and Law is wonderful and is easily the highlight of the film. They play off each other very well and it seems like the two of them had been friends for years (which is overly impressive in that the two actors had never met before the commencement of filming SH). Oh, and also, they are not gay. I don't know why people started that rumor but I really did not get that impression from the film. They are partners in crime solving, but definitely not partners in life. <br/><br/>2. The set direction/costuming - London looks absolutely incredible in this film. It seems like the movie was going for maybe a more visual experience than a true Sherlock Holmes experience. The sets and costumes of Victorian London are Oscar Worthy and should be recognized come award season. <br/><br/>3. Guy Ritchie - Well, it wasn't a great film. But it wasn't as bad as some of the stinkers he has put out since Snatch. I would say that with the big budget success that this film is destined for, Guy Ritchie could be on a path to better films. I'm sorry for those of you who enjoyed Swept Away and Revolver, but I am going to go out on a limb and say that Ritchie has been in a bit of a slump. His handle on RDJ, Law and the overall setting of the movie showed me that he might be coming back into his Lock, Stock and Snatch form. <br/><br/>So there are a few of my thoughts. It is at times a fun film with quick dialogue and intriguing action sequences. But at the end, I did not care about 90 percent of the characters, Sherlock may have thrown one too many Judo Chops and Lord Blackwood probably should have just stayed dead in the grave. It would have at least given a better villain a chance to challenge the always entertaining Holmes and Watson duo. <br/><br/>Grade: B- (or just below 7/10 stars)"

","I stayed away from this for a long time because I'm an old codger who loves the old Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies and from the trailer, I thought this was going to be another far-out Robert Downey Jr. flick that would be more science fiction/FX movie than a good Holmes mystery. Well, it was....BUT the movie was still very entertaining and I really liked it......and I'd certainly watch it again.<br/><br/>Yeah, it was a little weird seeing Holmes and Watson duking it out numerous times like they were members of The Expendables, but once that was accepted, I could settle back and enjoy the action, the dialog, the special effects, the fascinating characters and sharp picture and visuals, making it all surprisingly-fun ride. All the major characters in here were very entertaining, and all the while, Holmes still retained his incredible powers of deduction, which were a hoot to hear.<br/><br/>So, for older people who expect a very sedate Holmes and Watson, either skip the film or loosen up and just be ready for two hours of wild entertainment."

If the characters were renamed, this would be an excellent action movie telling the story of a detective and his good friend in a XIX century London, instead of a poor attempt to copy Conan Doyle's style.<br/><br/>Of course, if the movie's name weren't Sherlock Holmes i wouldn't be much interested in watching it, but at least i wouldn't have left the theater thinking ""that was a big waste of time""...<br/><br/>Call me annoying, nerd or whatever if you want, but this movie is not worthy the name of Sherlock Holmes.

I admired it from a distance, fell asleep twice and ultimately did not care for it or any of the characters in it.

","On this film, I basically agree with the NY Times review- mildly diverting but falls way short of its potential, although all the people I saw it with liked it.<br/><br/>You have Sherlock Holmes, one of the great characters of literature, two fine actors in Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law turning in excellent performances (although Downey was very hard to understand), and some well done period art direction and costumes, but the film was borderline boring. Why? It seems geared to an audience of adolescent boy- there's very little intelligence behind it- the action scenes are over the top and I didn't buy them, and the plot, as it were, or the conspiracy, is a roll-your-eyes, sophomoric Dan Brown rip off. Who cares? How about a simple, elegant, well-filmed murder mystery? Not for today's audiences I guess, who demand ever-increasing incarnations of evil and bigger doses of gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>This is a middling, mainstream Hollywood blockbuster- just another product of the ""industry"". If that's what you like, or if you are under 30, you will probably enjoy it. If you are a Conan Doyle fan, or enjoy a good mystery, you will be disappointed."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","11","22","27 December 2009"," Welcome Holmes...
","Ever since watching the first trailer for this movie, I knew it was a film I definitely wanted to see. I'd anxiously been awaiting its release and, thankfully, it did not disappoint. It's a rollicking good time, and only the nitpickers or most hardcore fans of the books might take issue with this ""reimagining""/""reinterpretation"" of the Sherlock Holmes character. And thank goodness this wasn't an origin story (we didn't need another one of those). What lifts this film from good to great, first and foremost, are the actors. The casting of Robert Downey Jr as Holmes may have been met with some skepticism by certain people, but he pulls out all the stops and delivers an excellent portrayal of the legendary character. His deadpan delivery is well-suited to this role, and he never devolves into being over-the-top or a parody of the character. Instead, he - in large part - is what holds the film together/makes it so good. Jude Law, meanwhile, gives a fine performance as Sherlock's sidekick, Dr. Watson. He and Downey play off each other exceedingly well. Their back and forth banter, as well as their camaraderie, makes the film very enjoyable. They make a great team, and the ease with which the two interact is clear on screen.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams has also been well cast as the only woman to ever outsmart Holmes, Irene Adler. While from the trailers you may be led to believe she's just around to play the love interest, and nothing much else, she's actually so much more. She's like an unofficial third member of Holmes's team, who has a history with Holmes. Downey and McAdams have an easy chemistry between them, which helps make their past together believable. Although there are times when she does require help, Irene proves on more than one occasion that she can handle herself/is not to be messed with. She's quite formidable, and I enjoyed all her scenes with Holmes or Holmes and Watson. They make quite the trio when on screen together.<br/><br/>Probably the least memorable of the cast was Mark Strong as baddie, Lord Blackwood. He didn't really do anything for me in The Young Victoria, and in this film, I must confess I was not really blown away by any of his scenes either...with perhaps the exception of one scene, after he's been caught and locked up, where he's threatening more death to come - though that's mainly due to the eerie lighting and how the scene's filmed (Blackwood looks as if he has black eyes and it's all very moody. That's one thing this film has in spades - lots of shadows). The other supporting characters are all pretty good (I liked Kelly Reilly as Watson's fianc√©e), as well as the dog (who's frequently the subject of Holmes's experiments...but don't worry, he remains okay and unharmed).<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the film is quite dark when it comes to lighting. Plenty of gloominess, nicely clouded-over skies and very dirty/unclean in places. Lots of grey. The film is exceptionally shot. Everything looks great, I loved the direction. As for the story - I appreciated the way in which it was told. It's not exactly straight forward (sometimes, it's actually quite nonlinear), but it's not incomprehensible/over-complicated either. What made the start of the film particularly interesting was how we began with seemingly the end of Holmes & Watson's last case together. Throughout the film, there are flashbacks that help explain things - and it's these that I appreciated most. Those who may have problems with the idea of Holmes fighting bare-knuckle in a boxing ring (with Irish pub music playing, no less) should be happy to hear that his most important asset - his intellect - has not been forgotten. It's on display all throughout the film, as we hear (via voice-over) Holmes deducing things/working out problems and how he might neutralise an opponent. Yes, the film has its fair share of slow motion, but it's used well within the story and actually has a *reason* behind it.<br/><br/>I also liked that things were *explained* in the movie by the end. There was one thing in particular that I was wondering if they were ever going to explain...but by the very end, thankfully, they did explain it. This is everything you could want in a film. The great acting, the excellent story, the exciting action (including one particularly tension-filled scene) - it's all present. Then there's the humour. There's just the right amount of it, and it never descends into silliness. The music used throughout the film is also really good (especially the Sherlock Holmes 'theme'). The end of the movie is obviously set up for a sequel (which I hope we do indeed get). So many movies get sequels when, really, they shouldn't...but this movie easily deserves one. If I had one minor quibble with this film, it would be that I missed some of the more interesting shots from the trailer that weren't actually in the film itself. <br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is a really enjoyable film, from the opening shot (great way of working the WB/Village Roadshow logos into the cobblestone pavement, by the way) to the very nicely-done end credits (with what appear to be sketches of the actors/characters in the film - they're definitely worth sticking around for). <br/><br/>You want to see an excellent film? Well, there isn't any time to waste then, is there? Go see Sherlock Holmes!"
"priyankar_b","6","5","8","31 July 2010"," More Hardy boyish than Sherlock Holmes
","To give credit to the movie, on a standalone basis it is a decent watch. It does have a decent plot, is fast paced, has a fair bit of action with subtle jokes thrown in for good measure. The problem however with the movie is that the title is Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>While suitable elements of Sherlock Holmes have been captured in his characterization, the overall plot has gaping holes. What struck me as being particularly irritating was the fact that Dr Watson was often shown to be smarter than Sherlock Holmes, in fact at times being a step ahead of Holmes in his deductions. This was NEVER the case in the original novels. The fact that he often adopted a condescending behavior towards the far more intelligent Holmes, was quite ridiculous. Secondly, there was less thought and more action in the story. While Sherlock Holmes can certainly not be called a man of inaction, he was certainly not one to behave like James Bond and indulge in so many Hollywood like action stunts as was shown in the movie. There were similar other inconsistencies, the broader characterization of Holmes not being the least of these. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is quite dangerous in the sense that it wrongly educates those who have not read Sherlock Holmes. Having said that, it would have been much more admirable had the movie had a (known) character neutral plot."
"RaiderJack","7","5","8","14 April 2010"," Quite Entertaining!!!!
","I finally got a chance to see this much-hyped version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character and after all is said and done, this was most entertaining.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr was an inspired choice especially when considering Guy Ritchie is at the helm. Downey perfectly fits Ritchie's frenetic vision of the legendary detective and the casting of Jude Law as a much more energized Dr. Watson is just wonderful. Law's Dr. Watson is infinitely more his own man than any Watson I've witnessed before. The chemistry between Downey and Law served the project quite well.<br/><br/>The set design is amazing making this a visual delight. The costumes and sets combined with Ritchie's energetic and rather imaginative editing all combine to create the perfect mood to accompany this action-packed, fun-filled ride.<br/><br/>To be sure, the plot was rather muddled, rather busy, and rather ambitious which is also rather deftly camouflaged by the almost non-stop action. Sherlock still remains the highly analytical, precise, and logical detective we all know and love but is refreshingly and delightfully encased in the always interesting Downey who is more than complemented by Law's more deliberate Watson.<br/><br/>Some may feel this version makes a travesty of Doyle's original vision of Holmes. To each his own. Seeing this in no way at all diminished (or elevated for that matter) my perception of Holmes. Hey, guys, get over it!! - its only a character for godsakes!!! Fun movie. Excellent production standards. I definitely recommend!"

","Sherlock Holmes is an entertaining action crime adventure from director Guy Ritchie whose admirable in making this movie. It has actually made me what to check out some of his other films like Snatch and Rock N Rolla to name a few. Sherlock Holmes has some tiny flaws that I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as the character of the title. It's definitely a much different interpretation of the popular private sleuth detective than we've seen before. With Iron Man, Zodiac, The Soloist, and Tropic Thunder, Downey Jr. has made a great comeback proving to be one of Hollywoods most talented actors. He continues to solidify just that with his performance in this movie. Well done. Jude Law is equally impressive as Holmes partner and best friend Dr. John Watson. Downey Jr. and Law have genuine chemistry with each other perfecting an odd couple relationship between their characters. They make the best of the screen time together which provides the movie with a lot of humor. Rachel McAdams is good as Irene Adler the only woman to make as Watson puts it ""a proper idiot"" out of Holmes ""twice."" Despite not being given a whole lot do, McAdams is convincing as the beautiful temptress Irene none the less. Mark Strong is solid as serial killer and mysterious occult ""sorcerer"" Lord Blackwood in his limited screen time who proves to be an effective villain for Holmes. He doesn't share many scenes with Downey Jr. but the few they do have together are well written. The rest of the cast are nothing memorable but they do what their roles require and still turn in decent performances. The action sequences are well executed with just enough so it doesn't feel like overkill. There was a nice balance between the action, humor, and drama that made the 128 minute running time go by at a steady pace. The humor was very funny which always helps make a film better and we can thank most of it from the banter between Downey Jr. and Law. They both delivered their lines to perfection bringing much of the humor out of the script through their odd couple relationship. There were a few memorable quotes too that I found quite funny like ""Permission to enter the armory?"", ""No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not"", and ""So that's a no to the opera then?"" to name a couple. Some of the action scenes were even humorous especially the one with Sherlock Holmes in a bare knuckles boxing match and another involving a huge French guy. I also liked how most of the films mysteries including Lord Blackwood's possible supernatural abilities were explained in a logical manner and it didn't leave you with many unanswered questions. The few minor flaws were that certain characters (Blackwood and Irene) weren't really developed considering most of the focus is on Downey and Law which isn't a bad thing. It just wouldn't be a little better if we knew more about Blackwood or Irene. The climatic fight between Holmes and Blackwood near the climax felt a bit rushed but hey that's okay because everything else made up for the films minor flaws. Overall I was still very impressed with Sherlock Holmes and I recommend this to anyone looking for a movie that sure to leave you feeling entertained by the end. Sherlock Holmes has a complex but not too complicated story with just enough action, humor, drama, and exceptional performances by the two leads (especially Downey Jr. and Law) who make this film worth the time to watch."
"GirishGowda","9","5","8","26 February 2010"," Modern Take on a Classic Holmes Fires on All Cylinders
","First of all, let me start by saying that after watching this movie, Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man) is my new favorite action hero. Guy Ritchie directed this movie and I haven't watched his previous works, but I'm very interested in them now. The film opened here to packed theaters and awesome reviews. I was a bit skeptical because what would be so great about ""Sherlock Holmes - The Action Movie?"" In the novel he is a brilliant but quiet detective who uses his stealth and brains and what type of action would that make in a movie? But anyway, I was very happy to hear that Sherlock Holmes would come to the big screen. I make it a point not to see the trailers of any movie. So, I was a novice having only seen the ratings which it got in local papers.<br/><br/>Then the film opened and me and my friends were awestruck by the DOWNEY HURRICANE. I was literally grinning from ear to ear. I was even smiling with anticipation when Sherlock Holmes ends in a situation when his life is in danger. In the books, he's not much of a fighter. His fighting interests are just alluded to. But here, he was just wow!! Downey has an uncanny ability to make people sit up and care for his character (I have seen only Iron Man and Zodiac). The scene in which he fights in a wrestling ring in a dingy building was awesome, the background score really amazed me. I loved the score and the song during the fight and the end credits. The starting of the movie was accurate in its portrayal of Holmes as a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (in the TV series this cap is made ridiculously famous). I loved Rachael McAdams in THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (this made me cry), THE NOTEBOOK and in the supporting roles in MEAN GIRLS and THE HOT CHICK. In this, she epitomizes the Beauty with Brains saying in the role of Irene Adler. I loved her. And Watson played by Jude Law (I have only seen his The Talented Mr. Ripley and The Aviator mainly because of the lead actors there) was surprisingly very good when you take into account that he's not at all what other versions have portrayed him as (fat and bumbling) and is faithful to the books. Lord Blackwood, with his weird magical capabilities really gave me the chills. I didn't even feel like this movie was two hours long. The very authentic 1900's look of the movie added to the genuine entertainment of this action and surprisingly comedic movie. This is The Best Holmes-Watson duo in a very long time. Guy Ritchie is an amazing director and I have to see more of his works.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have to say this; after AVATAR came here, Hollywood movies are attracting audiences like never before. So, I hope your screenwriters don't think of us subcontinent audiences as being dumb and give us trashy over-hyped movies like the annoying 2012, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION which were way too crappy.<br/><br/>9/10"
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","5","8","29 December 2009"," Holmes remade as an action hero
","This version begins with a fist fight involving Holmes at a gambling den. Naturally Holmes walks away the victor. The scene signals clearly that this version is not going to follow in the footsteps of its many predecessors. So, if you have read the original Holmes stories, or seen any of the many previous Holmes adaptations, particularly those from the 40's with Basil Rathbone, you will probably be shocked and disappointed to see Holmes portrayed as a sort of cartoonish James Bond/Batman character. There are more fist fights, chases, heroine in distress scenes, and a finale atop the Tower Bridge. Although this is a period piece purportedly set in London during the 1800's, to me it lacked authenticity mainly because of the cartoonish nature of the film. It seemed that the film was really a superhero movie but with the superhero having a keen sense of observation instead of magical powers. There were times when some of the actors lost their British accents and one scene in which one of the detectives clearly spoke in an American accent. So, director Ritchie seems not to have cared much for authenticity but rather went for an action joyride. On that level, the film is not so bad, much like a National Treasure or DaVinci Code. Robert Downey Jr. portrays Holmes as a tormented, depressed soul, never clean-shaven, clearly a personal slob, witness his disgustingly slovenly digs, with no manners and a pugilistic side. Jude Law's Dr. Watson is more like Robin to Batman and he is more than willing to join Holmes in fisticuffs as they fight off one thug after another. There are Holmes references in the film, as to Professor Moriarty, but unless you are already familiar with characters from the Doyle stories, you will not understand them, nor are they explained at all. Clearly there will be at least one sequel. The film is clearly aimed at younger people and will probably provide them with 3 hours of non-stop action entertainment."

","Dr. John Watson: Holmes, does your depravity know no bounds? Sherlock Holmes: No.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code meets The Wild, Wild West by way of Jackie Chan and The Fight Club‚ÄîRobert Downey, Jr. captures the manic, addictive nature of Sherlock Holmes without the sober intellectuality of Basil Rathbone, the Holmes against which all others are measured. Director Guy Ritchie sets a feverish pace for the Victorian detective story, allowing Downey to overindulge his acting tics and considerable athletic ability to create a modern emblem of the deductive thinker, imitating the more physical evidencing of CSI rather than the traditionally contemplative crime fighter of Conan Doyle's Holmes.<br/><br/>The intellectual side seems to come from the 20th-century attitude indulging of Holmes and Dr. Watson (Jude Law), himself an accomplished fighter and worrier. Their banter even when they are fighting a French giant (imagine that! shades of James Bond) is more Butch Cassidy than Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>As in the Da Vinci Code, the villain is associated with a secret powerful organization, like the Masons, that plans a serious overthrow of government and world domination. Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is the pre-Moriarity evil brain, who seemingly has come back from the dead to further his nefarious plot.<br/><br/>Holmes, like Dan Brown's Robert Langdon, is the brains outside the police solving Blackwood's crimes because Inspector Lestrade and his cops are clueless. Not that we don't get the usual Holmesian lectures about the simple clues we and Lestrade missed; it's just that Downey delivers them rapid fire as if he couldn't wait to get to the next athletic activity. Rathbone could deliver them like sipping a fine wine.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is in the physicality, from meticulously designed London settings to incessant and overly long fisticuffs. The bare knuckling allows Downey to be shirtless, a plus for older folks who thought such a physique the province of men half his age.<br/><br/>The presence of gifted criminal Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is a welcome touch as she sparks the kind of analysis Holmes needs most‚Äîof himself. Ritchie has picked this little part of the Holmes legend wisely but fails to expand it in a classic opportunity lost to the relentless action.<br/><br/>This Sherlock Holmes is a 20th century quick-cut sleuth in 19th century waistcoat. I have plenty of memories of that hyperactive 20th; I just wanted to smoke a pipe in the 19th with a reserved Holmes and listen to the deductions of his exploits.<br/><br/>I'll wait for the Rathbone reruns.<br/><br/>Dr. John Watson: (to Holmes drinking a liquid) ""You do know what you are drinking is meant for eye surgery?"""

Seemed more like some strange action/fantasy hybrid.<br/><br/>I have a feeling we'll find out where there going with this in the sequel. Perhaps Jude Law is actually playing Sherlock Holmes? I think Robert Downey may be covering for him, as Jude seemed to be the one more likely to be the Sherlock type.<br/><br/>Other than the lack of plot and characters, I had a major problem with the ridiculous action scenes. I guess I should have been ready for them from seeing the trailers/commercials but there's more ridiculous action than I could tolerate.

"montferrato","1","8","15","3 June 2010"," Was this Sherlock Holmes or Harry Potter?
","I do like Sherlock Holmes movies. I was quite thrilled, because a new movie about Sherlock is always a good thing. However, i must say i was quite disappointed with the result.<br/><br/>Why was i disappointed?<br/><br/>1. The plot is simple, the action is slow, and there is no intrigue or suspense whatsoever. You always know all the time who the bad guy is, and how things are going to develop. 2. The duo Law-Downey Jr. seems ineffective to me, and it is unable to transmit positive chemistry. 3. The Ninja abilities of Holmes and Watson are for children, or for brain-dead people. If you want to see this kind of action, it is better to watch a Bruce Lee, Jacky Chan or Chow Yoon Fat movie. 4. The Bad guy, Lord Blackwood, is very thin, does not transmit any fear whatsoever, and it is actually like a dummy. It looks like the bad guy of a Harry Potter movie for 7 year old children. It is in fact so bad that it makes no sense at all, and conveys very poor feelings. He is not a memorable villain, but a very weak villain in a ridiculous Harry Potter style. 5. The use of humor is also very childish and easy, for non intelligent people. 6. Secondary characters like Lord Coward are just pitiful clich√©s. 7. The use of satanism and black magic might be good for the plot. However, in this case looks more like a bunch of Harry Potter apprentices. The use of a book of spells(new age pseudo-witchcraft) is ridiculous. 8. To sum up, this is a very poorly designed movie, with a very bad plot, an uninteresting story, and grotesque characters. It is just a ""harry potter"" sherlock Holmes for children and not very intelligent people. However, i suppose that you can enjoy the movie if you are between 7-12 years old."
"amwright81","10","8","15","25 December 2009"," Scientist crime fighter dispels superstitious nonsense on Christmas
","How fitting for an intelligent hero to emerge in theaters on Christmas to dispel silly superstition. Guy Ritchie did a great job portraying this master detective based on the actual Doyle stories and did not rely on the old Holmes movies. In other words, this movie was a good adaptation, not a remake ten times over. He made Holmes more than an armchair detective and focused on the crime fighter that Doyle intended.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the visuals, including London with its filthy unpaved roads and the flat at 221B as it probably should look with two bachelors living there, especially with one with an intensely curious mind. <br/><br/>I liked how the movie focused on Sherlock's ability to fit in with criminals as well as his ability to fight‚Äîboth of which are hinted at many times in the fifty plus stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/><br/>I like too how Ritchie dispensed with the curved pipe and deerstalker hat, neither of which really is mentioned much in the stories. The violin was a big part of Holmes' stories, and I like how he strummed the instrument in the movie while thinking about his cases. Something a thinking person would do.<br/><br/>Finally, this was cast in an interesting way. The actor who played Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), and even Jude Law, have physical features more identifiable with Holmes and they may have thought they were going to play the role when hired for the film. Instead, Ritchie cast an unlikely actor, American Robert Downey, Jr. This worked because Downey comes across as a mind that it always busy. Downey might also relate to Holmes' drug addiction, which was not shown in this movie but is hinted at (sloppy apartment, disheveled appearance, experiment of drugs on dog, bored when not working, etc.)<br/><br/>The music in the movie was up-tempo and musical, suggesting a busy mind. The plot was a little bland and a lot like the plot of The DaVinci Code, but the feel was right for Holmes. One of my favorite aspects of the Holmes' stories was that there was always a mystical element thrown in. Doyle was a spiritualist and brought a certain otherworldly darkness to the mysteries, until Sherlock's keen brilliance illuminated all the swindles and schemes, just as he did in this movie."

","If you're looking for a witty, intelligent mystery film with an original plot, keep looking. Guy Richie's previous achievements with 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' gave high expectations for his turn on the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson. However, I was all in all disappointed by the film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to fully elaborate on the plot, but simply explained, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Watson (Jude Law) seek to bring down the very evil, often irksome mysterious Lord Blackwood, portrayed by Mark Strong. Rachel McAdams plays a self-interested professional thief named Irene Adler.<br/><br/>When I think about the plot and the characters, trite is a word which comes to mind immediately. The film would have been forgettable altogether, if it wasn't for the witty performance of Robert Downey Jr. His wittiness and humour, already his trademark as an actor, stand out against Jude Law's dry seriousness. Rachel McAdams, when not in her typical romantic role, has difficulty establishing herself and adding a certain depth to her character. Further, the plot is made to look intricate but is actually rather dull and tiring, with a relatively predictable ending. However, visually the film is sometimes quite stunning. The beautiful cinematography shows London in the late 19th century, especially the unfinished London Tower Bridge is magical."

"tomgillespie2002","5","4","6","3 April 2013"," Breezy, easy-watching entertainment
","Said to have been portrayed by over 70 actors in over 200 adaptations, it was only a matter of time before Sherlock Holmes received a modern- day revision. The BBC cast Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular loose- cannon, with Martin Freeman as his sidekick Dr. Watson in the series Sherlock, but director Guy Ritchie wanted to revert back to the source novels for his Holmes, and who better than Robert Downey, Jr. to star as the bohemian detective-for-hire with a penchant for self-starvation and cocaine. Only this being rated 12A, the cocaine and needle abuse is somewhat glossed over in favour of a more 'teenage-friendly' preference to alcohol, though the unpredictable and near-schizophrenic personality is maintained, and his famous and iconic deerstalker hat (though never mentioned in the books) ridden of altogether.<br/><br/>After foiling the ritualistic sacrifice of a young girl at the hands of the aristocratic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), Sherlock Holmes retreats into a state of isolation while he awaits his next case. His good friend and colleague Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is getting married, and his invitation to Holmes to meet his bride-to-be finally brings Holmes back into the world. With Blackwood awaiting execution, his last wish is to talk with Holmes, who is warned of three more deaths to come. Blackwood is hanged and assumed dead, until his body goes missing and is replaced by a man reported missing by Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), an American thief who has managed to escape Holmes in the past. Holmes' investigations leads them to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secretive magical organisation who seem terrified by Blackwood's apparent resurrection and eventual resurfacing.<br/><br/>I've never really been a fan of Guy Ritchie. Since his breakthrough d√©but way back in 1998 with Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, he has done little of note, or at least nothing to develop on the promise of his d√©but. Lock, Stock was an amusing and quite clever little throwback to the Cockney gangster films of the 1980's, featuring memorable dialogue and a funky score. He then made Snatch (2000), which is still lauded by its fanbase but offered nothing different apart from a new and annoying self-awareness, and Alan Ford calling himself ""an 'orrible cant!"". He then was almost forced to pack it in for good after making the embarrassing double-whammy that was Swept Away (2002), a love-letter to his then-wife Madonna, and Revolver (2005), a pretentious, insulting piece of s**t starring Jason Statham and Ray Liotta. Seeing his dreams fading, Ritchie went back into his comfort zone - the criminal underbelly of London - and made RocknRolla (2008), which although being over-familiar, wasn't half bad and featured some nice cinematography.<br/><br/>With Holmes, Ritchie has gone mega-budget and handles it well. Though for all its CGI backdrops and grand set-pieces, Ritchie has stuck with the Cockney wide-boy dialogue and slow-motion fight scenes. From the very first scenes, his intentions are clear, as Holmes envisions his opponents weak-spots and we are narrated through the damage that each blow will inflict, all caught in that time-altering way he championed way back in '98. This is Holmes at his most action-heavy. I don't recall ever seeing Basil Rathbone taking out someone's knee-cap or getting involved in bare-knuckle boxing fights. But isn't that was revisions are all about - taking a beloved character and taking them to places never seen before? Well of course, but in this case, it's to take their character to the top of the box-office by attracting a less-demanding audience, and make a lot of money.<br/><br/>The Ritchie-isms aside, Sherlock Holmes is still entertaining, which is its primary goal. Although the story is weak, everything looks fake and like a computer effect, and the aspect that made Holmes such a popular read - the investigation and his almost supernatural ability to unravel the smallest of clues - isn't particularly clever, it is brushed aside in favour of Downey, Jr's admittedly excellent comedic performance. He is perfect for this Holmes, showing a lot of the cocky charm and general strangeness he injected into Tony Stark in the Iron Man films (2008- 2013). After all, Downey, Jr. practically is (or was) Holmes, almost spurning his talent in favour of drug abuse. It's enough to make me watch the sequel someday, but not enough to make me warm to Ritchie. But it's 128 minutes of breezy, easy-watching entertainment.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

The story was fairly interesting too, though I have to say I didn't pay as much attention to it. But I liked that there was a big Reveal at the end where everything is explained. Very traditional mystery story.<br/><br/>I think the only letdown was Rachel McAdams, whom I usually like and think is talented but fails to keep up with the two snappy leads here.

"aliceinreallife","7","4","6","8 January 2010"," Hit-and-Miss Casting, terrible plot.
","To say that Sherlock Holmes was disappointing wouldn't be an exaggeration, but it would be misleading. Ever since the trailers for this film began bombarding movie theaters months ahead of Christmas, I was already one of those assholes that ""has-read-the-books"" and would be hard-pressed to be satisfied by any on-screen incarnation of the great detective.<br/><br/>So, I guess I wasn't expecting a whole lot, not from Robert Downey Jr. playing another brilliant man who abuses substances and is generally snarky and quirky, not from Jude Law playing a prissy, long-suffering friend. Not even from Guy Ritchie, not really, because a dark romp in the alleys of London seemed right up his, er, alley.<br/><br/>I think the main issue with this movie was that people weren't at the movie theaters to see a movie about Sherlock Holmes. They, myself included, were there to see Robert Downey Jr. play Sherlock Holmes in a movie. I got what I wanted, certainly, and perhaps that's some inspired casting right there, but it didn't feel right. With actors that I love, it's really easy to tell which movies they truly acted in, because I'll end up knowing its them up there on screen, but think in terms of their character instead of who they are in real life. In those movies, I don't get this feeling of not being able to lose myself in the movie, and detach myself from their persona as an actor.<br/><br/>None of the lead actors melted into their characters enough to make me believe that I was watching Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Lord Blackwood instead of Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Maggie McAdams, and Mark Strong. While I was entertained for the most part, I feel that this was a definite flaw for this film in particular, because of how iconic the characters are and also because this film is so removed from the modern world we live in. It's a period piece, but the costumes and settings and all the painstaking work so many people took to make this film look (kinda) realistic didn't really matter, because I'm still watching Maggie McAdams up there and not the woman that she's supposed to be portraying.<br/><br/>I will never agree that Robert Downey Jr. was a good choice for the role of Sherlock Holmes. He's physically nothing like the part, and call me a stickler, but I feel that there is a something to be said for how an author wanted his character to look. Here's what Arthur Conan Doyle said about Holmes: ""His very person and appearance were such as to strike the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet,and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision."" Looks withstanding, RDJ did a decent job undertaking a demanding role. I loved watching him sass throughout the murky streets of London, even if, when taking a big step back, his portrayal of Holmes was bordering on slapstick and made the poor guy seem almost like an idiot savant, unable to socialize in public without insulting people left and right.<br/><br/>Jude Law was the best of the ensemble, hands down. He was a pretty good Watson. I loved that Watson was finally portrayed as a capable character and not merely a useless sidekick that Holmes ends up explaining everything to. He limped well, he spoke well, he punched well and sliced up the baddies nicely. In particular, he was a tremendous relief as a foil to Downey's over-the-top eccentricities. I definitely appreciated most, if not all of his screen-time. His part in the bromance (best part of the movie) was also very well-done. Thank you, Jude Law.<br/><br/>Mark Strong was terrible as Lord Blackwood. I'm not familiar with Strong's filmography, but I'm going to blame his terrible acting mostly on his terrible character. Blackwood is supposed to be a menacing person who comes close to besting Sherlock Holmes. Instead, he ends up the least terrifying character in this movie. Watson's fianc√© Mary seemed to have more nefarious tricks up her sleeves than Lord Blackwood. It also didn't help that he looked like an Evil Steve Carell. Whaaaaat? They should have just gone with that and made the villain devious (with a decent plot) and weird and FUNNY instead of just lame.<br/><br/>Having Irene Adler work for Moriarty and then cast Maggie McAdams as Irine Adler was a stupid, stupid, idea. Adler in the original Doyle story was kick-ass, and Holmes pined after her because of her brains. Adler in Richie's film was dull and nowhere near the femme-fatale she was supposed to be. For the most part she was just there and ran around with the boys for no reason except to become a damsel in distress and mess everything up.<br/><br/>Now we get to the worst part about this movie: The PLOT. Sherlock Holmes has, and always will be, plot-driven, no matter what Guy Richie wants to think. The whole point of a detective story is a clever plot for the audience to go ""Oooohhhh"" at the end and applaud the smart detective for being so smart. Everyone goes home happy.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that I literally laughed out loud at how stupid the plot was for this movie the first time that I saw it. I couldn't help myself. Why. Why, God, why, would you rip off of Dan Brown when you have Arthur Conan Doyle as source material? I can't imagine that RDJ did not laugh in between takes when he had to talk about the map of London and the signs that the occult symbols represented. Are you kidding me? The movie was actually going okay until that happened and then it lost all credibility."
"notforrental","10","4","6","5 January 2010"," Finally, the great detective is portrayed the way Conan Doyle intended...
","Everything about ""Sherlock Holmes"" is stunning, from the gritty, realistic Victorian London, to the wonderful performances by the film's fantastic four; Downey Jr, Law, McAdams and Strong. I enjoyed every minute of the film, and found that it matched the mental images that I had created while reading the books far better than any previous adaptation, and I include the celebrated Granada television series starring Jeremy Brett in that list.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr's Holmes is not a starched, middle aged gentleman with every hair in place who sits in an armchair and looks pensive, but as the man from the stories; a younger, rougher individual who is perfectly happy to play dirty to get what he wants, and whose body is as powerful as his mind. He's brilliant, and so is Director Guy Ritchie, who keeps Holmes' incredible deductive powers at the forefront of the movie by showing him using them to neutralise his opponents. <br/><br/>And Watson...Jude Law is perfect. Fat, bumbling old man? I think not. He never was in the books, and he isn't now. Instead, he's young, handsome, intelligent and not afraid to tell Holmes just what he thinks of the great detective's bad behaviour. His friendship with Holmes is everything it should be ‚Äì not the hero/sidekick dynamic created by Rathbone and Bruce, but rather a friendship between two men who are as close as brothers, and who can't live with each other, but can't live without each other either.<br/><br/>As for Irene Adler¬ÖRachel McAdams is pretty good. She didn't quite feel like Holmes equal, and she was a little young, but she certainly was a femme fatale, and had plenty of guts and gumption. She was also capable of getting down and dirty, which earned her a gold star in my book. Her relationship with Holmes is believable, and not nearly as romantic as some would claim. She flirts; he resists; she does something nasty to him. Like chaining him to a bed. Naked. <br/><br/>Last but not least, Mark Strong does a wonderful job as villainous Lord Blackwood, considering that he has to be a plausible antagonist, but not bad enough to outshine Moriarty, who is set to appear in the sequels. Strong has certainly set the benchmark for future Holmes' villains ‚Äì whoever is going to play Moriarty is, will have to be really evil now. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is gripping and very believable: the sets are beautifully detailed, none of the stunts are overdone, the actors all play their parts to perfection, and Guy Ritchie certainly wasn't the wrong man to direct; his confidence in his abilities is what allowed him to make the film dirty and gritty and fresh. When coupled with an amazing score by Hans Zimmer, this film is certainly the best film of 2009, and will continue to be great through 2010, and well into the future."

"DICK STEEL","8","10","20","26 December 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Sherlock Holmes
","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had arguably created the literary world's greatest detective operating from that famed 221B Baker Street address in London, and has been the subject of countless film interpretations, but none quite like what Guy Ritchie had crafted in making Sherlock Holmes a lot more sexier for today's audiences, compared to the rather stiff persona perceived so far, picking up the various clues from the books and cranking those elements up by a mile. It's hard to find someone who's never heard of Holmes' superb powers of observation and deduction, being that consulting detective for the police, but never one comfortable with the limelight.<br/><br/>Ritchie had sexed up the characters of Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his trusty assistant Dr John Watson (Jude Law) so much, that you can't deny the homoerotic vibes that reverberate all around when these two gentlemen grace the screen in the same scene, obviously still trying to work out emotional issues with their brotherly bonds now threatened with Watson's engagement to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), and his moving out of their operating apartment. There's this perpetual reluctance in allowing Watson to leave, and the jibes that they share is unquestionably very much like a bickering, seasoned couple, toward the end of a close partnership which had yielded tremendous success.<br/><br/>Which became the opening scene of the film, where we see the dynamic duo working hand in hand to crack and solve a case of demonic rituals as conducted by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a villain who is pronounced dead by hanging, but turning up very much alive and walking the streets of London to exact his sinister plot based on Fear. Black magic, superstition and secret orders become the themes that Holmes and Watson, through science, have to solve before a New World Order gets underway in Old Victorian England, in an era just on the cusp of massive industrial revolution, having the landscape very much the highlight as well thanks to wonderful CG work that chugs along nicely in the background.<br/><br/>As a film for both fans of the Sherlock Holmes character and as an introduction, this film did its obligatory scenes well to bring you up to speed with the character and his idiosyncrasies, be it little tidbits like Holmes' erratic eating habits, the ordered chaos of 221B Baker Street, his roguish methods at times, the myriad of disguises employed and of course, Watson being the biographer of their joint exploits. Some of these elements get the in-your-face treatment, while others get quietly snuck into the narrative that will certainly delight fans who spot them.<br/><br/>And Guy Ritchie stamps his usual trademarks with the flash forwards and backwards to highlight some of these prowesses, from his monologues on the deductions formed, to that of spicing up the limited hand-to-hand combat to show off Holmes' natural advantage when having to rely on brute force thanks to physics and anatomical knowledge, not to mention coming with a touch of arrogance in determining how long his opponent will be out of action. Ritchie would seem to be at home with his filmography boasting a vast array of character thugs, now having his same storytelling technique applied to the other side of the law.<br/><br/>Some may think that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law share no chemistry, but I disagree. Their scenes together as Holmes and Watson couldn't be any better, and I would be hard pressed to think of another buddy pairing, which would bring out the same spirit as buddy- cop pairings from the past, such as that from the Lethal Weapon series with Gibson-Glover. Both men bring about a cavalier attitude to their respective roles, and seemed to be having a heck of a good time when paired up together, utilizing each of their specific skill sets brought to the table, especially when called upon to use their fists once in a while over their cerebral abilities. A major action sequence here also had this unbelievable fight which spilled from a lab to the docks, complete with sinking ship and flying anchors thanks yet again to the non-intrusive CG work.<br/><br/>The wildcard of the film proved to be Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, the only woman who could catch Holmes' offguard, and well, the one who perennially escapes. Her role here is probably nothing more than to contribute to the setting up of the next film (if it materializes, though I don't see why not), with the shadow of Holmes' greatest nemesis Professor Moriaty constantly hovering, and which the filmmakers did quite brilliantly to keep him under wraps from the credits even, so that casting calls for a follow up movie would likely go into this frenzy when deciding who should step into those shoes to rival Holmes.<br/><br/>Only time would tell whether that follow up film would be made, but for now, do enjoy this jazzed up tale of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, in an adventure that would keep you at the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!"

","This review may seem as schizophrenic as Downey's Sherlock. As others have noted, there are reasons to like this movie and reasons to hate it.<br/><br/>Starting with why I hated it, this is not the Sherlock Holmes I remember. Sure the name is used but do not expect to see the quality detective story and character as done in the past. What we get instead is a distorted, cartoonish version of a great detective. The movie could have used other characters instead of Holmes and Watson. The movie would have been more appealing if it had in fact used a new pair of detectives. Ahhh, but Ritchie is going to make money thanks to the currently popular name of Robert Downey. In the meantime he gets to recreate, and even pollute the name of Holmes for the sake of opportunity, glory and money. That is even more devious than a plot from Blackwood or Moriarty. Even worse, Holmes is not a man of great confidence and intelligence. He resembles someone who is everything and yet nothing. A lonely, alcoholic, schizoid with little regard for sense and sensibility, he seems more able to succeed thanks to luck and surprisingly loyal friends. And yet he is an accomplished fighter, again with a great deal of cartoonish luck. How sad and pathetic. That being said, nothing really need be said about Watson.<br/><br/>Now for the good. The story, imagining this is not about Holmes and Watson but some other unkowns, was pretty good. I liked the mystery and the evil Blackwood. I liked old London. I liked the fast pace in picking up clues and developing mystery. The action was good and the humor was OK. I preferred Watson over Holmes. Jude Law's interpretation of Watson was more appealing than Holmes( I even got to the point, where I didn't care much for Holmes). Well, that's it for the good.<br/><br/>If you don't care for the traditional Sherlock Holmes, you may very well like this movie. But if you want to see the traditional Holmes and Watson get a clue and you will miss this slap in the face of tradition.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 for destroying tradition but a 6 out of 10 for a good attempt at making a fun detective movie. That averages out to a 4, Lestrade."

But as their dad I can read their true reactions; i.e., ""good"" has several meanings, degrees, shades, etc., and I don't believe they thought it was anything special, extraordinary, etc. <br/><br/>My problem was it just was not a Sherlock Holmes film, what with the extraordinary action scenes, the mild humor, and, especially, the diabolical plot line of taking over the world. Not to mention Holmes never had anything approaching a romantic interest.<br/><br/>I understand the argument that the film introduced Sherlock Holmes to a new audience and needed some ""jazzing up"" to compete with other films. But for those of us who grew up with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes, the subtlety, nuance, and suspense was entirely missing.<br/><br/>Next up, Vigil Mortessen plays Tarzan as Spiderman."

","I actually fell asleep in the movie theater while watching this movie. I cannot see what all the fuss is about. It is boring, gloomy and lacks substance. I wish I hadn't wasted my money! It seems like the one part that was even remotely entertaining was placed in the trailer (the part where he was chained to the bed). Other than that, there was nothing special at all. What made this movie going experience even worse was the fact that it got so many good reviews. I went to the theatre expecting a masterpiece and got nothing. Even the characters seemed unbelievable to me. As with most Guy Ritchie projects, the dialogue was self absorbed and dull. I would give this movie a minus rating if I could."

","Robert Downy is a brilliant actor. It is a shame his talent is wasted in this production. My wife and I couldn't wait for the movie to end, which seemed to drag on and on. The movie failed in its blend of action and mystery, leaning heavily on the action and meager in the mystery.<br/><br/>We appreciate the intention of a director to rework material and make it his own. Guy Richie was right to try and make the iconic character suitable for contemporary audiences. While he was right in intentions he was wrong in his executions.<br/><br/>The first error was assuming we cared about the characters. There was no build up in character development that made us care at all. We cared about the actor, but not the character he had to play.<br/><br/>The second error was not encouraging the audience to figure out the mystery. For the mystery was not at all evident. Instead we know who the killer is and as far as we can tell, he is a Satanic worshiper.<br/><br/>The use of flashbacks to show how Holmes figured things out failed as well. It had a contrived and mechanical feel, almost as if obligatory since he is a detective and he should be shown as a detective.<br/><br/>We give this movie a thumbs down. It might appeal to a younger generation but for an aging baby boomer, it was a failure."
"paulhmontag","3","12","26","26 December 2009"," I think I know what Doyle would be thinking ...
","I really like Robert Downey Jr. and the few Sherlock Holmes novels I've read by Arthur Conan Doyle, so this film version of the memorable English Detective was a great surprise. <br/><br/>Holmes novels give adults a chance to have a good time. And in an age where so many of the movies are for 'everybody,' especially the family, the kids or teenage boys, I looked forward to some fun adult entertainment. But it didn't take but a few seconds of screen time to realize this Sherlock Holmes movie was not going to be sophisticated. Pretty much right away Holmes is punching people in slow-motion. <br/><br/>I think the movie would have been better if it was set in New York instead of England because then Robert Downey wouldn't have had to worry about talking with a British accent. Sometimes it was difficult understanding exactly what he was saying. Plus his haircut was nothing like Sherlock Holmes' haircut would be but he did have a pipe in his mouth at least two times so that was good. <br/><br/>Also, if the makeup artist applied more makeup to Jude Law's face to make him look older like Watson is, then he could have passed as Watson.<br/><br/>Like I say, I was pretty worried right off the bat when Sherlock Holmes was punching people on this dimly lit staircase, but, oh, about 20 minutes later my first array of hope that the movie may get better was when an investigation was to take place at a cemetery. This should be good, I thought, like something out of a Holmes novel, but when they got to the cemetery, it was kind of sunny and looked like a construction site instead of a cemetery. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is really pretty but I didn't really know why her character was in the movie. <br/><br/>Bob Clark made a Sherlock Holmes movie called ""Murder by Decree' in 1979 that is not perfect, by any means, but is good with some great moments, and I wish Guy Ritchie would have seen it, because that was a lot more like a Sherlock Holmes novel."

","SHERLOCK HOLMES. It's a bad movie. Soooooo boring. I saw every twist coming and that's totally inexcusable. The best thing about the movie is the performance of Lord Blackwood. He's played by Mark Strong, and that was okay. At least he was interesting because he was the villain. Robert Downey Jr irritated me with his over the top performance. Jude Law blah. They weren't a good team in my view. The directing was just okay. Ritchie is all over the place and makes you very impatient. That's because the movie goes along at a snail's pace. Maybe it's the editing? I don't know. The biggest problem for me was the story. It was just way too predictable. The best part was the production values, which is not saying much. 4/10"
"DarthVoorhees","9","6","11","1 January 2010"," A Refreshing Blockbuster
","2009 was a poor year for film. I don't think there was a movie I have seen that I could give a perfect review to other than Tarantino's ""Basterds"". I think the problem with 2009 and this whole millennium is that it has been defined by a breed of film that we haven't seen before. 2009 was the worst year for it. Countless fluff films have been packaged as sure fire blockbusters. I don't know what to call these pictures but it is it's own sub genre brought to life by the comic book superhero film. None of these films have been overall original, almost all of them have taken a book, comic, or video game and pervert the source material. Many look slick but are sloppily made or edited with rapid cuts to the point of being eyesores. Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a part of this 'blockbuster' fluff genre. I think 'Sherlock Holmes' though is an example of pulp entertainment done with originality and fun. The difference between 'Holmes' and say a 'Transformers' is that Guy Ritchie respects film and film-making. Ritchie has a style that is uniquely his. Although 'Sherlock Holmes' isn't overall original or great in terms of general film-making it knows it's purpose and succeeds at it. Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey want us to have fun at the movies and boy do they ever succeed. Most importantly he has taken 'Holmes' and made it original.<br/><br/>I confess I am not a huge fan of the Holmes mythology. I kind of like some of the background but I could only give you a Cliff Notes synopsis if I was asked to explain it. Maybe that's why I liked 'Sherlock Holmes' so much. It doesn't assume you've read everything and although it alienates some fans it really was the way to go. This isn't Sir. Arthur Conan Doyles story, it's his character and in the long run Guy Ritchie respects that. A lot of the reviews of Ritchie's film criticize it for taking a lovable character and destroying it. I'll tell you this much though I'm glad Ritchie made the film his own. I don't think mainstream audiences would like or accept a Rathbone if we were given one. It's like saying all the Bond films should follow Ian Fleming's exact design. I think 'Holmes' is very faithful to the spirit of the character. Downey plays him picture perfect as a brilliant yet often eccentric genius which he always was. When you have an actor as talented as Downey headlining your cast you have to give him something to work with and breath distinct life into. Rathbone could only do Rathbone. If someone tried to do Rathbone today it would turn this rich character into a clich√©. Downey has made the character his own and I salute him for it.<br/><br/>I really like the plot. It skates dangerously close to over the top with elements of supernatural enemies. Holmes however is given the task to take this Lord Blackwood and bring him back to being a man. Holmes is still a super sleuth and not a super hero despite some complaints. The chemistry between Downey and Law mulling over the mysteries really are genuine fun. Maybe Holmes is the hero this generation needs. I've seen Incredible Hulk, Terminator sequels, and the horrendously disappointing Watchmen adaptation all based on incredibly intelligent stories. Downey's Holmes while eccentric and knowing a thing or two about Karate still uses his brain to solve problems. Guy Ritchie doesn't think his audience is stupid. He may stage some over the top sequences but in the end the mystery is still afoot and the enemy won't be stopped by Michael Bay explosions."

","I have been a Holmes fan since I first started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 8th grade. I have been disappointed with other filmed versions of the past, and I was skeptical of this ""newer"" Holmes. My children took me (as a gift) on Christmas Day. I was prepared to be silently critical. Imagine my surprise when I was speechless with joy. And what was most surprising, my sons, who are not Holmes savvy, enjoyed the movie as well. It was a delight to the eye, a heartfelt, wistful return to adventuresome reading and a bit of jolt to the adrenal system. Congratulations to Guy Ritchie for this fabulous recreation of Holmes and gang. And to Downey and Law, special appreciation, it was like falling in love again. I was gleefully entertained and thoroughly satisfied. Bravo !"

","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is an 1890s sleuth who bears an average Englishman's body; has cat-like cleanliness; has an uncanny ability to blend seamlessly with brilliant disguises; knows a Japanese system of wrestling called the Baritsu; is a formidable bare-knuckle fighter; a single-stick expert regarded by Dr. Watson; is also an expert with a sword as he studied fencing; and always carried a pistol.<br/><br/>In this 2009 adaptation, the world's most famous fictional detective returns to the big screen bearing six-pack abs and an effects-heavy action story. But this adrenalised Sherlock Holmes lacks the intelligence of its brilliant hero. Robert Downey Jr. lends his not-inconsiderable wit to the proceedings as the brawny, brooding Holmes, but despite director Guy Ritchie's robust re-imagining, this picture struggles to transplant the 19th-century sleuth into the world of 21st-century Hollywood blockbusters. His sleuthing simply became a sideshow.<br/><br/>On characterization, Watson, played by Jude Law was more consistent with the original physician. But the medical character itself lacked the on-screen narration much popularized in Doyle's earlier Holmes cases. <br/><br/>Irene Adler, Holmes' only love, played by Rachel McAdams, was a breather from the almost Brokeback Mountain-ish bromance between Holmes and Watson. For without her pretty face which cuts like a warm knife against the brilliantly designed backdrop of how dirty 1800 London was, Ritchie's adaptation would've been mistaken for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the sequel; full of revving testosterone with no where to go.<br/><br/>Now let's go to Holmes.<br/><br/>Doyle's original Sherlock is an eccentric, sloppy bohemian, erratic eater, an expert on deductive reasoning, a fighter, a cocaine and morphine user and a loner. <br/><br/>Ritchie's Holmes focused on the eccentric and fighter with a slight tinge of reasoning. A similar image would be Batman. Richie wants Sherlock Holmes to be a dark, edgy, exciting adaptation. Holmes may still have his trademark pipe, but he has ditched the deerstalker hat and bookish demeanor for a roguish manner and buffed-up physique. Likewise, he and Watson are presented as a crime-fighting duo who get involved in elaborate action set pieces that are pitched at a hyperbolic level that quickly becomes numbing. <br/><br/>The desire to turn Conan Doyle's detective into a complicated action hero is intriguing, but after the recent cinematic reboots of Batman and James Bond, this approach has started to lose its novelty. You can add a big dose of Captain Jack Sparrow at one point Downey is tied naked to a pair of bedposts.<br/><br/>More crucially, unlike the other two properties, Sherlock Holmes's personality and psyche aren't meaningfully explored in the new film. While Downey Jr. provides his usual devil-may-care charm, this Sherlock Holmes ultimately feels like an excuse for high-energy action sequences rather than an attempt to breathe new life into a dusty literary icon.<br/><br/>The film does have its hints of brilliance. Take the piece called production design by Sarah Greenwood (Atonement and Pride and Prejudice), she transported us to 1890s London. One could almost smell the rancidness of Baker Street. Add to that Hans Zimmer's (The Dark Knight and Angels and Demons) moving score with crescendos that push you to the edge of your seats without the help of Ritchie's pyrotechnics. <br/><br/>Any film which doesn't need flash and flare will always turn out overly done. This is a film adaptation which lost some important parts along the way because someone failed to see the bigger picture and decided to make up his own pieces.<br/><br/>These are just a few personal observations deduced rather quickly just as Holmes would. But still, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have had a hard time figuring this one out."
"PWNYCNY","3","8","16","7 January 2010"," Sherlock the buffoon.
","The name Sherlock Holmes evokes an image of a suave, debonair man of impeccable taste and stalwart character, and then there is this movie which offers a new take on the Sherlock Holmes persona, this time as a frumpish, mumbling, annoying buffoon. True, Sherlock does display fleeting moments of lucidity and genius but for the most part he is a mess. Yet the audience is asked to believe that this broken down Scotland Yard reject can solve complex crimes, beat up the toughest toughs and be involved with a beautiful woman, all of this without any evidence that he actually baths. The only credible part of the movie is the scene where the audience finds out that Holmes hasn't been out of his apartment in weeks, but that is where Sherlock Holmes belongs because on the street he is merely a nuisance, and an annoying nuisance at that. There is no way that this Sherlock Holmes could possibly defeat Professor Moriarity. Holmes is so befuddled that at times he sounds incoherent yet the audience is asked to believe that this man, who at one point manages to get himself shackled to a bed, can actually solve crimes when he has hard time just leaving his apartment. The only thing bleaker than Holmes is London itself. The city is dreary, filthy, dismal and probably reeking with odors, a perfect setting for this downtrodden Holmes and his prissy companion Dr. Watson. Now regarding Dr. Watson .... I'll leave that alone for now."

","I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews. I saw the movie on Christmas Day along with six other family members. The two youngest (ages 17 and 20) liked it a lot, but the rest of us weren't as enthusiastic. Many of Robert Downey Jr.'s lines were difficult to understand because he spoke in a soft, low voice without moving his mouth much. Because Sherlock Holmes' deductions are often responsible for connecting the dots in the plot, were were sometimes confused. The film LOOKS great, and I really wanted to like it, because I've always thought Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant, but overall I thought the movie was ho-hum, and so did the rest of my party."
"MovieAddict2016","5","7","14","30 December 2009"," Holmes Begins
","Sherlock Holmes is positing itself as a new beginning for the iconic Baker Street detective, even going so far as to set itself up for a sequel with its series' most recognizable villain much in the same way that Batman Begins did with the Joker. Only problem is, it's not an entirely effective reboot. For starters, it's plagued by a blockbuster mindset, which means for every interesting scene featuring Holmes' skills of deduction, we're treated to a scene of fisticuffs, or explosions, or large propelling CGI objects -- such as ship anchors -- whizzing by and narrowly missing the heroes.<br/><br/>Some of these action sequences might have been somewhat amusing if they didn't feel so stale and recycled, or if their special effects were actually special and didn't appear to be so outdated. When you open your film against Avatar, make sure it doesn't look like it just stepped out of The Mummy's school of special effects wizardry. The excess of bad CGI pulled me right out of the movie.<br/><br/>The strengths? There are two: Robert Downey, Jr. (in a role he was so obviously right for, that I'm surprised it took us so long to notice), and Jude Law. Downey's been on a roll lately, and this is his second assured franchise since Iron Man, but Law is receiving less attention for his performance, which is a great foil to Downey's eccentric Holmes. The two of them have effortless chemistry and I'd watch a sequel just for more of their back-and-forth bickering.<br/><br/>But that's really the most credit that can be given. The film's too long -- it didn't need to be more than two hours -- and the script just goes through all the most predictable motions. Guy Ritchie's direction is distinct enough that the picture's style avoids being generic, but he's too proud of his slow-motion sequences and when he does decide to film an action sequence at full speed, it's edited so quick and tight that you can't really tell who's punching whom. When Sherlock rescues the Damsel In Distress (Rachel McAdams, giving what may easily be the worst performance of her career), the whole thing happens so fast that whatever clever reasoning he just employed to save her is lost on the audience.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is more Van Helsing than Batman Begins, but there's a lot of room for improvement here, and I smell franchise potential. With a better director (or, at least, the same director willing to sacrifice his directorial vices for the sake of the story), and a better screenplay, the next one could be a real delight. This one's just a fairly passable end-of-the-year distraction, rendered worthy of a home viewing thanks to strong performances lost amidst a clutter of gratuitous action and CGI."

","Reinterpreting a classic character is always going to be met with mixed response. The only way to pull this off is to boldly pursue a new vision while retaining the recognizable core of the character, which is what Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes does so well.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. is Sherlock Holmes, and he knocks it out of the park. The film deals with the supernatural Lord Blackwood, who is at the beginning of the film arrested by Sherlock whilst performing a human sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to death and hung, however the following day, Lord Blackwood rises from the grave and puts into motion a plan that will completely warp the fabric of life as we know it. Of course it is up to Sherlock Holmes to stop him, alongside his legendary sidekick, Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law.<br/><br/>This Sherlock Holmes film is less of a mystery and more about the ride, which might disappoint a few fans of the famed detective, but it's what I enjoyed so much more about this adaptation than previous adaptations of this classic character. The film does have a mystery, but rather than giving the audience the hints and clues throughout the film to try and let us solve the mystery alongside Holmes, we literally see and hear Holmes's thoughts as they're happening and we go along with him as he solves the mystery. This really comes through in the scene where Holmes pummels a Big Guy whilst in an underground street fight.<br/><br/>For me, Sherlock Holmes was very different than the trailers. The trailers paint it as a stupid amusement park ride made up of cheap thrills and explosions. While the movie does have some fun action sequences, this is not a correct portrait. In actuality, this film has had some thought behind the creation of the story. The script is filled with highly clever dialogue, and the witty banter between Holmes and Watson is hilarious, not to mention the chemistry between Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. Then the villain, Lord Blackwood, is the first badguy I've seen in a longtime that legitimately creeped me out. Blackwood is mysterious and evil, being given that all-evil moment that I am always looking for out of a villain when he makes a man spontaneously combust! The only weak link to this film is Rachel McAdams. She just doesn't really work in her role as Holmes's love interest, Irene Adler, although her character does set-up a potential sequel. Also, the action in the film is fairly generic, never having that memorable action sequence that would allow one to put this film alongside movies like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Overall, Sherlock Holmes is an extremely fun time at the movies. Robert Downey, Jr. is charming and lovable as the eccentric detective, and turning Sherlock into an action hero actually works extremely well. Sequels are definitely desired.<br/><br/>I give Sherlock Holmes a 9 out of 10!"

"ramc19","7","5","9","12 February 2010"," The cool new Sherlock Holmes
","I am a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, having spent a good part of my teenage and college days reading Doyle's books multiple times over. I have also tremendously enjoyed the Guy Ritchie films that I have watched so far - Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels, and Snatch. So, needless to say, I had huge expectations from the Guy Ritchie adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. And this movie did not disappoint me, though I did not adore the movie as much as I thought I would.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has given Sherlock Holmes a cool new makeover and transforms him into an adventure loving action hero (though Doyle gives an impression in the books that Holmes was more a man of languor than a man of action), while keeping his methodical logic and meticulous attention to detail, intact. In fact, there is a lot of focus throughout the film on these well known and other little known Holmes traits, and other quirks that are trademarks of the Baker street detective. But what is most striking is the beautiful interpretation of the Holmes - Watson relationship. Since the books are narrated from Watson's perspective, the neutral perspective of the film throws new light on Holmes's emotional dependence on Watson and his possessive love for his loyal sidekick. Jude Law plays his part to delightful perfection and is often more charming than Downey Jr. Downey Jr. though good, is still more Downey Jr. than Sherlock Holmes, but the two actors share a great on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>Ritchie continues to delight with his fast paced staccato style narration of a complicated plot, though the execution here is not as perfect as in Lock, Stock... and Snatch, and there were phases in the movie which felt abrupt and left me a little confused. In keeping with the style of the books, the storyline remains vague for the major part until Holmes offers his traditional logical explanation of the case in the end. The makers, however, seem to have tried to emulate the success of the Batman franchise, rejuvenated by Nolan, and at times, I did feel like I was watching Sherlock Holmes in ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant as with the other Ritchie films, and so is the background score.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film. Would I watch it again? Yes. And a sequel? Definitely, yes. I am looking forward to Guy Ritchie making a better Holmes film."
"ihatespike","10","5","9","2 January 2010"," An enveloping movie (don't let the trailer turn you off)
","With films such as this I feel stuck in the middle of targeted audiences; I love it when a series gets restarted but I'm always on my guard and at my most cynical.<br/><br/>If you've ever had the hours of your life stolen from you with films like Wild wild west or The League of extraordinary gentlemen, then you know exactly what I mean when I say that it is rare indeed to see a movie set in the 1800's that isn't a load of historically inaccurate, technologically ridiculous, propriety insulting garbage.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes (much to my great relief) has forgone that pitfall by a giant leap; the technology in the movie fits the time period very well- we are allowed the pleasure of seeing 'the future' of that time, but nothing absurd like a giant mechanical spider or a machine gun crossbow. The settings are wonderful. I'm not a British historian, but I know quality sets when I see them, and for once it's not Tim Burton that's responsible (meaning that they're good Gothic settings, but not unnecessarily bleak.)<br/><br/>The fact that Robert Downey Jr. stars as Holmes made me even more on edge; he's just isn't who would come to mind at all. But the humor and intelligence he brings to the role is refreshing and wholly natural. We're not subjected to the unbearable smugness of your average super-protagonist, but rather an almost childishly humorous grown man, weary but curious of the world around him. Downey's English accent flows comfortably, so well in fact that I would risk getting a beat-down from his bodyguards to hug him for not putting me through another Nicholas Cage type accent abomination. I was never really in to Jude Law or Rachel McAdams but both of them also fell into their characters with winning performances, Law being the sidekick that keeps the hero in line without being annoyingly mean, and McAdams the love interest/femme fetale without being over the top, clingy or trashy.<br/><br/>The story itself will wind your brain around a bit until the end, but isn't that why people have been in love with Sherlock Holmes for so many years in the first place? It will not bore you for a second, and it wraps up very nicely at the end (although you'll probably want to go over it your head again after you've left, which is a good thing)<br/><br/>And last but not least, anyone who's ever read Sherlock Holmes will notice a plethora of accuracy, hints and homages, from Watson's limp thanks to the Jezail bullet that passed through his leg in the Afghan war, to the photo of Irene Adler that Holmes kept as a reminder of the only woman who ever outsmarted him.<br/><br/>So take my advice and don't miss out on something this rare in concept; a quality revamp that pushes boundaries instead of ignoring them."
"honestevivere","9","8","17","2 January 2010"," Closer to Doyle's Truth than Expected
","The new Sherlock Holmes adventure offers a great deal of promise and excitement beyond the already created story. Being an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes (due to a startling number of similarities in personality, but sadly not wits), I was both excited and apprehensive to watch this new addition to an already incredible set of stories. I have read nearly every story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. To be fair, I have often found that the movies created today fashioned after great novels of the past are changed nearly always for the worse. The changes are typically viewed with cynical disdain and fury at the director's/writer's arrogance. However, the changes applied to the characters so many have grown to love and admire in Conan Doyle's work are not as bad as I expected. In fact, I may go so far as to say that I rather enjoyed Ritchie's view of Sherlock.<br/><br/>So to warn anyone, I should point out that I will be outlining a number of differences and similarities between the original works and the movie. That being said, if you do not want to hear about the movie, then stop reading now.<br/><br/>Before I begin, I want to inform readers of the stories (in case they have not read them). I should point out that nearly all the stories (except two) were written from Dr. John Watson's perspective. They are taken from notes he supposedly kept of each case and were written ONLY at the permission of Sherlock. Sherlock is a man consumed by his own curiosity and boredom. When his mind is not fully employed to discover some unknown through deduction, he becomes reclusive and intolerable to Watson, often because he passes time by doing cocaine. Though I should point out that he was NOT a drug addict because he neither craved nor depended upon the substance other than to eliminate the insufferable boredom of having no cases to work on. Contrary to popular belief, Sherlock neither enjoyed attention nor fame. He rarely cared for taking credit in the solutions of many of the mysteries and often asked for little or no money (which is shown rather humorously at the end of the movie). Literally his ONLY necessity in life, were it not physically impossible, would be to satisfy his curiosity, nothing more. This characteristic is one of the primary reasons why his character is such a singular and incredible icon in the minds of millions around the world today. So it was with great surprise and happiness that I came to see this same trait apparent in Robert Downey, Jr.'s adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Now we get into some of the more humorous, if not accidental, similarities. A number of the movie's details were taken directly from ""The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone."" The first is the name of the villain, Lord Blackwood. Fans may remember him as Count Negretto Sylvius (Negretto is Italian for black and Sylvius is Latin for woods). Interestingly enough, Blackwoods was a competitor of the Strand (the publisher of Doyle's work). Blackwoods also rejected some of Doyle's early work, though the Mazarin story was written 40 years after the fact and Doyle was very successful by then. In any event, Blackwood was NOT some magician with an egg tooth (a tooth most baby snakes are born with to cut through their eggs).<br/><br/>Another common detail is the Crown Diamond, which is the Yellow Mazarin Stone (named for Cardinal Jules Mazarin[1602-1661], minister to Louis XIV). The large yellow stone hung around Irene Adler's neck in the movie. This is also the first and only story to mention that the 221B Baker Street apartment had multiple exits and a waiting room. The extra exit was through the bedroom which Sherlock employed to follow Irene early in the movie.<br/><br/>Let us continue with some obvious differences from Doyle's work. The first and most important difference between the Sherlock Holmes stories and the movie is Irene Adler. Though Ritchie got it right that she is the only female to outwit Sherlock and he strongly admired her for it (never admitted of course), they only met in one story. After, he referred to her as only ""the woman"" (which is humorously referenced at one point in the movie). In the books, she died after their interactions and did not divorce her husband.<br/><br/>Secondly, Watson was prideful, brave, and willing to go into battle with Sherlock. However, he was NOT arrogant nor was he argumentative with Sherlock. Typically he only made suggestions when frustrated with one of Sherlock's more quirky behaviors and Sherlock, being so overly polite to the point of condescension, acquiesced to his friend's requests. In the books, he did marry one woman (Mary Morstan) whom he met in ""The Sign of Four,"" but she died before ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" (after which Watson moved back in to 221B Baker Street with Sherlock).<br/><br/>Thirdly, Sherlock was far more independent in the books than the movie described (the only reason I did not give the movie a 10). In fact, he did absolutely nothing to try and stop Watson from marrying Mary, nor did he seem to care much when Watson moved out. He would simply show up at Watson's door and announce some new mystery and Watson's curiosity compelled him to go along.<br/><br/>Fourth, professor James Moriarty was known about by Sherlock as a criminal long before anyone else. In fact, Sherlock had been trying to find some damning evidence on him for years prior to Moriarty's demise in ""The Final Problem."" Regardless, Sherlock often commented on Moriarty's superior intelligence and made a remark that he was an intellectual equal. On a side note, Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, is an intellectual superior to both Sherlock and Moriarty (at least by Doyle's descriptions)."

","I had mixed feelings about this one, but wouldn't you know it? I liked it. Sometimes great fictional characters deserve a revamp. I'm not saying go and do some 'hip' revamp of every famous fictional character, like say, make Captain Ahab into some bad-ass space marine with a cybernetic leg who fights alien whales in space or something like that, but sometimes reinterpretations can work. I can safely say that 'Sherlock Holmes' is one of them.<br/><br/>Here, the roles of Watson & Holmes are reversed. Traditionally, Holmes is a no-nonsense, nearly emotionless man who ruthlessly conforms, and demands conformity despite his many eccentricities, while Dr. Watson is a warm, emotional reader/audience identification figure who, despite his intelligence, comes off as an idiot compared to the brilliant Holmes and frequently makes the mistake of simply being human. Here, Holmes is the audience identification figure who makes mistakes, gives into his emotions(sexual and otherwise)and is looked on as a fish-out-of-water, while Watson is a stuffy, conservative man trying to lead a normal life who takes things way too seriously. It's an interesting twist, and thankfully obeys the golden rule of revamps: It does not in any way destroy the essential integrity of the characters. One could even say this version fleshes them out a bit. Robert Downey Jr. is an odd choice to play Holmes, but he handles the role well. My only complaint is that he never gets to wear Holmes's famous Inverness cape and deerstalker hat, although I'm sure this was an intentional move on the filmmakers part.<br/><br/>There are however, several flaws in the film's setup. For what is supposed to be an introduction, the film already feels like the umpteenth entry in a series, and makes the audience feel as if they missed a previous installment. This could be seen as either a good or a bad thing. Holmes and his supporting cast is so well-known that treating them as typical character archetypes(buddy cops, obnoxious boss, heroine on the wrong side of the law, depraved nobleman, hulking henchman, unseen criminal mastermind)keeps them from becoming caricatures, but it also keeps them from feeling like real, multi-faceted characters unique to their world; One could easily rewrite the film to be about James Bond or Batman. That is the film's biggest flaw, but it was easily overlook-able. And considering how stupidly most modern film-goers react to more complex and introspective characterizations(Christ, look at the bad reception 'Tropic Thunder', 'The Dark Knight', and 'Watchmen' got for their bizarre, satirical, nontraditional, or deconstructive looks at stereotypical characters), maybe this is a good thing.<br/><br/>I also have to give the film props for it's sets and atmosphere. The setting really does feel like Victorian London in all it's filthy, poverty-stricken glory. I also liked the old-fashioned look of some of the gadgetry, and the huge French henchman was pretty cool. For some reason, his big ears, crooked nose and grimacing brow remind me of Rondo Hatton as 'The Creeper', a supporting villain from the 1944 Universal Sherlock Holmes film 'Pearl of Death'. If that was an intentional reference, nice touch.<br/><br/>'Holmes' isn't perfect, but as an introduction to the character for a new generation, I have to say that it's the best I could have hoped for.~"
"buzzerbill","1","6","12","22 December 2010"," Sherlock Holmes (Ritchie) and Sherlock (BBC)‚Äîbad and good
","I recently finally caught up with Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes; very much at the same time, I saw the BBC's 21st century reboot of Holmes. They span the extremes‚Äîdreadful to astonishingly, and unexpectedly, wonderful.<br/><br/>Starting with the ridiculous‚ÄîGuy Ritchie's film is, frankly, dreadful in almost every way. The steampunk vision of Victorian London is visually striking, but far from original, and it gets tiresome and overly gloomy. The plot is a cross between second-tier Conan Doyle and second-tier Hammer horror. The film is full of special effects and set pieces‚Äîin particular, a boxing match, a bout in a shipyard with a 19th century Oddjob, and a fight between Holmes and the villain on top of a half-completed Tower Bridge. The first is mere vulgar sensationalism; the second two, obvious borrowings from Bond films.<br/><br/>In fact, much of the film is bricolage from better work, be it Bond films, or Hammer films, or earlier Holmes films. There is enough holes in the plot to drive a locomotive through. For instance, Holmes gets to Tower Bridge from a location near the Houses of Parliament in a matter of moments‚Äîin reality, Tower Bridge is several miles away from Parliament. The only bright spot is Jude Law as Watson‚Äîa performance that is authentic to the character.<br/><br/>And, ultimately, authenticity is the biggest problem. For a Holmes film to work, it does not have to be a faithful reproduction of one of the 60 original stories‚Äîthe route generally followed by the Thames TV series with Jeremy Brett. To name only a few, Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The Seven Percent Solution, and most of Basil Rathbone's films have little if any connections with the original stories, and yet they are full of the right atmosphere and character. The biggest problem is Robert Downey Jr.‚Äîa wonderful actor whose work I generally admire, but who is all wrong in the part of Holmes. Part of the problem is the dreadful script. Part of the problem is that Downey plays Holmes as too neurotic, too scruffy, and too unpleasant. A scene where Holmes insults Mary Morston (Kelly Reilly), Watson's fianc√©e, is simply out of character.<br/><br/>There is another dimension, which is perhaps a bit refined‚Äîbut nevertheless significant to a core portion of the audience. Holmes is the best known fictional character in English literature‚Äîpossibly the best known fictional character in all of world literature. The Holmes stories have attracted exegesis worthy of a Biblical text, and even those who are not of fanatical disposition (like me) are sensitive to contradictions. To name only two‚ÄîHolmes at one point states that he has never met Mary, which (chronologically in the books) is untrue, and much of what passes between Irene Adler and Holmes does not square with the only story in which she appears, A Scandal in Bohemia.<br/><br/>These points would be trivial, if the overall quality of script and characterization were right. They are not. Gregory, the movie cat, whose judgment is infallible, just snorted with disgust and left the room early on. I wish that I had. Don't waste your time.<br/><br/>As a long-time Holmes enthusiast, I was not prepared to like the BBC Sherlock. The notion of updating Holmes to the 21st century sounded like a ghastly idea. But this new series‚Äîthree episodes to date, and I hope many more to come‚Äîis flat out wonderful.<br/><br/>The casting is spot on. The critical characters are of course Holmes and Watson. Benedict Cumberbatch proves a nearly perfect Holmes‚Äîcerebrotonic, neurasthenic, unnervingly intelligent‚Äîand Martin Freeman, as an Afghan war veteran (a clever reference back to the originals) is a perfect down to earth foil, and, refreshingly, not played as a dolt. The first of the 3 films, A Study in Pink, is both a cheeky reference to the first Holmes story (A Study in Scarlet) and an intriguing psychological variation on the locked room mystery.<br/><br/>Frankly, as urgently as I would suggest that the reader avoid Ritchie's Sherlock, I would suggest watching the BBC's Sherlock. It's one of the most refreshing things I have seen in some time. The atmosphere is right, the characterization is right, and the concept is original."

","In the Fawlty Towers episode: Waldorf Salad, Basil Fawlty was confronted by the guest who complained that he did not get the dish he ordered: The Waldorf Salad. Basil tried to convince the guest that the salad was indeed the Waldorf Salad, pulling his usual stunts and tricks, but to no avail: the guest was adamant that the salad at hand was not the one he ordered. The guest, guessing correctly, that Basil had no clue what was the Waldorf Salad, even told him the list of ingredients of the salad, and he also stated clearly that a cook cannot omit some ingredients or substitute them with some others and call it Waldorf Salad. Finally Basil's wife, Sybil, came to the rescue by making the salad with right ingredients, to the satisfaction of the guest. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no Sybil to rescue us here: the dish has bin made, it was packaged and delivered, we can either take it or leave it. I took it. I am not sure what kind of salad it was, but the taste was not too bad. However, in the end, it made me feel like the another character, this one from one of Bugs Bunny cartoons: The guy ordered rabbit stew, and Bugs, playing the waiter, brought him the carrot instead. The guy said, enjoying the dish: ""If I did not know that this is rabbit stew, I would swear that I am eating a carrot""."
"nick suess","7","6","12","30 December 2009"," Holmes and Watson join Voldemort, Sauron and the da Vinci mob for a rollicking romp across Victorian London
","Much as I appreciated that this Holmes explored more of the darker sides of Conan Doyle's character than many past dramatisations have, it was a serious distraction to find him embroiled with characters and settings drawn without apology straight from Potter, Tolkien and Dan Brown. I mean, look at this plot! It centres around the return from the dead of the Dark Lord, who then murders his own father and steals his magical ring. He is the leader of a brotherhood of satanists who meet (for their virgin sacrifices etc etc) in secret chapels decorated with pentacle symbols.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Ritchie succeeded in recreating the black humour of Lock-Stock to take us on a romp across a geographically distorted Victorian London which was enjoyable almost for its improbability. I hope that when Holmes locks horns with Moriarty in however many sequels are to follow we get something just a tad more cerebral in plot development, with more focus on the 'clues' to tease our minds as we progress through the story.<br/><br/>Neither a masterpiece nor a landmark redefinition of the Holmes story, in fact very far from being either, but for two hours of light entertainment I'll be generous and give it 7/10."
"SocalSam","9","6","12","27 December 2009"," The Plot beats the special effects in Sherlock Holmes
","Wow, the plot for Sherlock Holmes could have been used in a movie without the special effects and the almost annoying fight sequences.<br/><br/>This movie was a fun house of plotting, special effects, and Downey channeling various actors. Jude Law as well as the supporting cast did their job quite well, I have never seen Jude Law act in anything that I liked, so this was surprise.<br/><br/>The plot could have gotten out of hand, ala Wild, Wild, West, but it didn't. I won't spoil the secret, but I thought that Sherlock was going to go off the track of being a realist.<br/><br/>Robert Downey channels Charlie Chaplin in few scenes, watch for the quiet moments and in one of the fight scenes. He also needs to send a check to Dustin Hoffman for stealing his persona in the scene where Sherlock states he is a professional while handcuffed to the bed. Other scenes shows that Downey understands the physical science of Hollywood and flows with it. Jude Law and the two female roles struggle with the physics in their movements, Jude often forgets he has a bad leg and it shows in some of the scenes, nothing major.<br/><br/>Speaking of physics, the movie does use ""Hollywood"" physics in a few scenes, not in the annoying way that most movies lately do, but they are there. For instance, a massive object like a ship that is propped up by poles isn't going to slide down a ""way"", it is going to fall on it's side. But the scene works, and no one except mechanical engineers will likely notice the physic problems.<br/><br/>Spoiler: There is one scene where the ""Hollywood"" science breaks down, Holmes holds up a rat tail that indicates that a gas will contain arsenic (arsine). Arsine, according to the plot, will flow into a chamber with good guys and bad guys in it. Then a little later he states that the bad guys have received an immunity to arsenic. Good luck on that one, there isn't an antidote to arsenic, if you are poisoned with arsenic, you will likely die. However, the concentration would have to be very high to kill instantly, in reality, it would take up to 3 days for arsine to kill the people in the chamber. But it isn't noticeable and certainly the plot wouldn't work without the bad science, I didn't think about it till I left the theater.<br/><br/>Villain's machinery: Poorly designed, lot's of failure points, but fits into the plot and flow of the movie nicely, unlike the awful ending in a movie like Wild, Wild, West.<br/><br/>Also, in a world that isn't used to what happens when you close the flue on a coal fire place, which Holmes does in one scene, the smoke accumulation seems OK. But the fact is that smoke goes up and doesn't lay along the floor. In the movie, the smoke is clearly made up of either a software particle cloud, water or dry ice which lays on the floor and then moves up. If it was a software particle cloud, hopefully the special effects people will fix that in future productions.<br/><br/>The special effects and background had the feeling that it was similar to the ""Secret Adventures of Jules Verne"", not a bad thing. The problem with that type of ""blue screen"" is that the actors have to be darkly lite, even in scenes that they should have angle lights. This seems to be lazy work on the part of post production.<br/><br/>Sound was well done, but loud, I'll be wearing ear protection to any movies that I go to the theater this year. The subsonic sounds were intense in the early part of the movie, so make sure you go before you go, if you get my meaning.<br/><br/>Overall, you need to see this movie in the theater, it is worth it!"

I had a premonition, sitting through all those action-oriented trailers before the movie started, this wasn't going to be what I expected (maybe Downey Junior acting, as he can do very well--here, he's mostly mugging.)

","People who complain about this film tend to be people who just don't get Sherlock Holmes at all or stuffy Sherlock Holmes fans who believe they have managed to figure out the character in all entirety and that no one can defy them that.<br/><br/>Well I found this film extremely exciting. The direction was very good and the fight scenes well placed and humorous. Also I thought Hans Zimmer's' soundtrack could not have been improved because it was absolutely superb. Not only all this but as a big plus it had amazing special effects.<br/><br/>As soon as I had seen the film and had been transported back to my childhood by this excitingly fast paced movie, I sat down to reading The Return of Sherlock Holmes. The books I had to say surprised me, for of the little criticism I had read of the film it was doubts on how correct the attitudes were to the books. Now taking that into consideration I expected to begin reading a very dull long story about a righteous, stroppy gentleman, which was the image the criticises had given me. However I found Sherlock Holmes to be very much more like Robert Downey Jr's performance (which was amazing by the way), he was quick witted funny and always having little banters with Watson, teasing him.<br/><br/>So Robert Downey Jr I believe really brought out the true Holmes. Also Jude Laws performance defo improved Watson by giving him more backbone, brains and making him all together a lot less worshipping of Holmes, which was obviously a good thing. Rachel McAdams played a very good Irene Adler. <br/><br/>:D"

","About three minutes in, I had to run out in the Lobby to check what movie I was seeing. I thought I had purchased ticket for a Sherlock Holmes movie. You know. Sherlock Holmes - the genius detective who used his superior brain power to outwit villains of every stripe? But what I was seeing was Sam Spade. Somehow he got transported back to 19th century London and was persuading the bad guys with an astonishing array of knuckle sandwiches, knives and pistols. And the movie just continued in this vein - with Holmes punching it out with assorted thugs, including, I kid you not, Irish toughs who gather in cattle pens at the stockyard and stage fights for a purse. Who was this Holmes impersonator I wondered? I immediately riffled though my A Conan Doyle Complete Serlock Holmes books, and, much to my surprise, was able to find at least two episodes where Holmes talks about using the martial arts to subdue nefarious foes. He is also portrayed in the books as an expert swordsman. However, scenes with Holmes actually deploying fisticuffs apparently don't occur in the books at all. <br/><br/>So the movie producers and writers have modernized the current Holmes to make him more appealing to the ""cage fighter"" generation. I guess I can forgive them for that. It did make the movie more exciting than the ""snail's-pace"" action we got in all of the Basil Rathbone oeuvres from the thirties. In those, Holmes relied almost exclusively on his wits. However this movie used the violence as a plot vehicle too much in my opinion. I do miss Basil, even though his stereotyped version of Holmes also doesn't appear in the books. No deerstalker hat for example. It's not in the book. This movie also captures the tortured, opium-addicted, nature of Holmes quite well. That is mostly missing from the Rathbone movies. <br/><br/>Okay, overall this was a good movie, albeit a bit too rough, too little polish, too much bare-knuckles for my tastes. Go see it though. Holmes with wit - and grit to spare."
"RainDogJr","8","4","7","2 January 2010"," Just enjoy Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson!
","Sherlock Holmes, a name everybody knows but even so a name that Guy Ritchie just introduced to me. Yes, Ritchie's new film was not only the very first film I saw in 2010, in the decade (saw it last night at a full theater), but also my very first encounter with something of Sherlock Holmes. Yes, some not even care about who is the director of this huge new Sherlock Holmes production, but as a Ritchie fan I must say that of all his after Snatch productions (with the exception of , the film Ritchie made for his wife of the time and the only one I haven't seen... wait, I don't have to see it to know it's a piece of crap! Then yes, forget the exceptions!) this was the one I liked the most (with ROCKNROLLA right after it), still it could have been better. <br/><br/>Some weeks ago I saw an interview with Ritchie in which he talks about the 2009 film of his ""rival"" director Quentin Tarantino. He remarks that the think I liked about INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, and that is jealous about, is the richness of its characters. In SHERLOCK HOLMES he was more interested in the richness of his characters than in anything else. Downey Jr. and Law are amazing here, and if Ritchie succeeded in at least in one regard is definitely the richness of his Holmes and Watson. Well, maybe richness is not the correct adjective for the case of Watson but nevertheless this film is worth watching for, if for nothing more, its two main characters. Is extremely enjoyable to see Downey and Law here, so basically if these two are back for the sequel I will be watching it, no matter if Ritchie decides not to care that much for the story again."

","Although I have ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" on DVD I have never watched a full Guy Ritchie event until now... I plan to make up for lost time ASAP! I am familiar with his ironic method of sending up a person based on their own foibles - as he did in his BMW feature ""Star"" with then spouse Madonna. Clive Owen in that case was the Watson, while Madonna was Holmes on a bad day, or bad decade maybe...<br/><br/>The ride was just as brisk in this totally original Sherlock Holmes venture, from when he plotted his pugilistic damage a la CSI or Sherlock/Downey Jr reverse engineering the solution to a felony in a manner reminiscent of the film based on a Philip K. Dick tale,""Paycheck."" There was a massive hue and cry against the production from the beginning, where is his Deerstalker hat? What? No Meerschaum pipe? Those were Basil Rathbone's, dearie, this Sherlock is way closer to what was in the original stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's interpretation of Dr George Bell, the real Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>When noted Holmes fan club, Baker Street Irregulars - invitation only members, praised the film then this revelation tended to shut up most detractors.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) as Holmes portrayed all of Holmes' eccentricities to perfection, he's even better here than in Iron Man. While Jude Law as a smart, efficient Dr Watson, the ex-soldier and capable of his own deductions was a marvelous foil to Holmes' self-worship! Mark Strong as the demonic Blackwood was a great villain, he already had his chops blooded in such a capacity as 'Septimus' in the cinematic version of Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"" and he easily could play a member of the Malfoys in Harry Potter! Eddie Marsan shows versatility from an American accented would-be bank robber in ""Hancock"" to the Cockney-slurred Inspector Lestrade who obviously had a love-hate admiration for the eternal detective.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams as Sherlock's love-interest is a far cry from her usual sappy flicks such as ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" with Eric Bana or in the tear-jerker ""The Notebook"" which featured James Garner.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's direction while at a blistering pace, never left you wondering if you missed anything nor did it speed by so fast you did not feel a part of the ride.

"hte-trasme","8","4","7","29 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes movies are back from the dead
","Speculation and debate around the 2009 film version of Sherlock Holmes (a simple title used for countless movies based on Arthur Conan Doyle's detective) centered on the controversial choice of Robert Downey Junior, and the genre-shock-inducing decision to make Holmes, in effect, into an action hero. Happily neither of these choices turns out badly. Holmes was rather a man of action, though not to the same extent, in Conan Doyle's stories, and this element, in tandem with his well-known mastery of disguise, make for a logical, interesting, broadening element to his character. Best about this, though, is that the action scenes, which are well realized and entertaining without detracting from the story or going on too long, afford through creative means an original way into Holmes's character in early scenes. In a couple of the fight sequences we experience action first slowed down - before a repeat in normal speed -- in which we hear Holmes' telegraphic internal monologue as he uses his powers of observation and deduction to determine exactly how to defeat his opponent.<br/><br/>Downey is extraordinary as Holmes. His performance has an intensity that makes it almost impossible to take one's eyes away from what he is doing. Holmes here is aloof and superior not out of intentional rudeness but the mere fact that he is operating on a level so much higher than everyone else intellectually that he cannot be bothered even to consider such things as politeness, tidiness, and grooming. At the same time he has moments of complete vulnerability that make for a fascinating and nuanced character. He's extremely obsessive, to the point of being almost unable to function, and in constant conflict with Jude Law's well-played and rather strung-out Dr. Watson. This conflict is well and subtly written, so that even while in some scenes it is only hinted it, it becomes the real centre of the film. It's good, strong drama, helped by a script full of well-written and witty dialogue. We can believe that the two men are not speaking, yet would easily die for each other, which is a difficult picture to paint on film. Rachel McAdams is magnetic as Irene Adler, whose character is rewritten from Doyle to further stretch the Holmes persona in fascinating ways.<br/><br/>In fact, almost every element of this film is extremely well realized -- which brings me to the one that I think isn't. Of all things, the plot seemed entirely unsatisfactory. For much of the film, this is not a problem since for long stretches this story about the greatest mystery character of all is not a mystery at all but lavish character drama around the new feud between Holmes and Watson. When the plot does come in, it turns out to be in several over the scenes revolving around sketchy plot that involves a Lord coming back to life through black magic to gain godlike powers and lead an international conspiracy. It's flimsy and seems silly, and only leads up to the resolution that Holmes very quickly explains how all the instances of supernatural powers, totally unbeknown to even the most observant audience member, could have been simulated through natural means. The only reason the flop of a plot can be forgiven is that the drama between Holmes and Watson can be followed instead, and the rest of the production, from music to special effects and action sequences, to the stylized design of the extra-grimy Victorian London, are so unified and exceptional.<br/><br/>There are strong hints (or bids) at a sequel involving Professor Moriarty; I think that development would be welcome.<br/><br/>So the main failing of this movie is what is typically expected from a Sherlock Holmes story -- the mystery plot. But for character conflict, excellent acting, the fun of some thrilling action in a lushly-designed Victorian-style setting and an extremely memorable visual production, it's wonderful. On those terms, I'd highly recommend it."

Guy {Madonna's ex} Ritchie modern take on the classic Conan-Doyle stories seems to have been made for a contemporary audience who has no clue {get it?}-on who Holmes is. Downey totally fails as Holmes in a character who is too modern-and possibly too ambigiously gay for the role-not that there's anything wrong with that. He is all nervous tics and always seems to have something else on his mind. Hell, he doesn't even wear the famous deerstalker hat!Law is just alright as Watson and he does try to bring some comic relief to the character. The story has Holmes trying to stop a plot to destroy London. There are the usual CGI scenes, but for some reason most of them are pretty well done and do manage to capture the essence of what London probably looked like at that time. Also there is a very good Irish bar song that is featured throughout the movie. Even though it is a good looking and well produced movie, it is somewhat hard to follow at times and fairly predictable from start to finish., even though some interesting diversions with some steampunk items placed in try to add some momentum to the story line. Obviously looking for a new franchise, the producers of this should hope that the Baker St.boys are a hit at the box office. Movie itself is fairly likable, but it just falls flat on what it has to deliver. That's the trouble with Holmes when new stories are written to cater to contemporary tastes. Prehaps if an original Conan-Doyle story was used, this would have turned out better. Where are Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce when you need them?"

","This nonsense is not Sherlock Holmes. It's a disgrace to past Sherlock Holmes' movies to have this junk bear the title of the greatest detective in the world. The main problem with this film is the same that affects the newest Batman movies and the newest Star Trek movie. In all 3, the plot is being ""cut out"", literally. Watching these movies it feels like the main point is the action scenes and the explosions. The plot is there merely in name and if not that, then certainly only as a second characteristic of the film. The primary reason for the film is to show aggression, with men getting into close proximity of other men's faces such as might happen on a military base. The rest of the movie is devoted to showing quick spurts of action scenes that are very fast. Just as the plot is ""cut out"" and hence made to go faster, all the action is made to develop very quickly so that the audience doesn't get bored watching it come up. Once it does appear, the action occurs at blitz-speed and is shown from a gamut of angles to keep the viewer stimulated. It's highly abnormal and almost meant to induce a euphoric effect on the viewer, similar to what a drug might do.<br/><br/>Terrible film. Do not watch it!"

","Sherlock Holmes is a remake or reinventing of the classic, rich detective that was made famous in the 1900s (first book published in 1888) by Arthur Conan Doyle. Now a motion picture of the feisty English detective is made but alas no an Englishmen does not play the role¬Ö an American known as Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law stars as his trusty side kick Dr Watson who is the dependable doctor who is ready to stick his nose out in any situation Holmes lures himself in. Playing the evil Lord Blackwood is Mark Strong who is a mysterious and disagreeable fellow to witness on screen. It is of course being a Sherlock Holmes film it is set in Victorian London and the genre would be a mystery action some people would call it although a lot of people would think differently.<br/><br/>I am unsure whether the film is a fresh story or inspired by a novel but it doesn't really matter because I think it is a story that the writers dropped the ball on. I had this feeling that the writing team weren't trying too hard and that they could have thought of something a lot more exciting or thrilling but the plot felt very dry and eventually quite boring. I wasn't exactly lured into the plot. I was sort of hanging on an edge and rotating whether to go in or to back away , but eventually I backed away like a bomb was slowly about to blow up My general thoughts were this. I wasn't as enjoyed as I thought I was going to be. My expectations were high for this film and I came out thoroughly disappointed at my viewing experience. I felt that again the writing was very shallow and not deep enough to explore. It then became very quirky as though they were writing for a specific audience and I guess for this film it would be Sherlock Holmes fans and I felt sidelined as Holmes fans were enjoying the experience¬Öor not. Was it completely bad? No it wasn't some parts of the film were very enjoyable but most of the film was a bore.<br/><br/>For the positive side we had the remarkable talent of Jude Law who I thought did a marvellous job as Dr Watson. As a proper Englishmen he managed to pull off a very charming and wonderful version of Dr Watson. I enjoyed Jude's slick charm and charisma in the role and his ability to exercise the role instead of it being a supporting character. Guy Ritchie has directed this film and he did a pretty respectable job with this film unlike some of his previous films.<br/><br/>Then we come to the negative side of things. Sadly I must go to Robert Downey Jr. His performance as Sherlock Holmes sadly didn't deliver. I felt it was too quirky and too in your face and I didn't like it especially at the end. Robert's English accent however is almost spotless or as a matter of fact it is spotless. Despite his quirky performance his accent was so spotless you couldn't find a hint of American. However that doesn't change my thoughts of his performance.<br/><br/>For the characters of the film there were some good and some not so good. Start with the good Jude Law's attempt at Dr Watson was well done indeed and really should have had more screen time. Rachel McAdams as Irene Alder was reasonably regular and got the amount of screen time she needed. No more or less. Then there is again Downey Jr's quirky and quite slightly over the top performance as Sherlock Holmes. Then Mark Strong as a very tedious and not so menacing Lord Blackwood. I didn't feel a sort of menacing feeling around him and just thought of him as a crook or that cartoon villain with the twirling moustache.<br/><br/>In conclusion I thought Sherlock Holmes as a decent film with some well done settings and costumes but overdone acting by the main star and better acting by the sidekick. Plot was steady and characters were flat but overall it is pretty enjoyable for you and your family to get cracking on.<br/><br/>B+ - An above Average Film with so good solid performances and some over the top.

","This is taken directly from my LiveJournal mini-review.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I want to warn people that I write fan-fiction (of the slash kind), so my review is very much about what I found to be the slashy moments. Please Google slash if you don't know what I'm talking about. Also, keep in mind that Holmes/Watson was never my OTP (one true pairing) for this fandom until after I saw this film, I never even had an OTP for this fandom until this film.<br/><br/>Here goes...<br/><br/>I entered the theatre with some trepidation, as I am a huge fan of the Shelock Holmes stories of the Arthur Conan Doyle sort. I swore to myself, when I went in there, that I wouldn't try to find slash in a Guy Ritchie film. Big mistake. I found slash, and lots of it. Particularly one scene where Holmes is attempting to disengage Irene Adler from some contraption, and he has to get into Watson's pockets, so he undoes Watson's belt and says ""don't get excited."" I nearly choked on the water I was drinking at that point. That and the ""I never complain. When do I complain about you practicing the violin at three in the morning?"" scene (which, by the way, starts with a very cute shot of Holmes dozing on Watson's shoulder). The script does nothing to help the fact that Robert Downey Jr. (Holmes) and Jude Law (Watson) have an incredible amount of chemistry. The script has these gorgeous banter scenes between Holmes and Watson, ones, I believe, have an amazing amount of potential. There wasn't much of a plot, though. Ignore the failure of a plot and just go with it. I adored it, not for the slashy moments (although there were many) but because the essence of the true Conan Doyle characters of Holmes and Watson were there... That, and there were some pretty awesome explosions and the CGI Victorian London was amazing. Costuming was also bang on. Watson is also finally Holmes' equal, not some bumbling sidekick, just the way Conan Doyle wanted him to be (I believe)."

"Chris Knipp","6","7","16","27 December 2009"," Not bad, for a travesty
","On the one hand turning Arthur Conan Doyle's cerebral Victorian detective into a scruffy action hero is a terrible idea (and formally speaking, a travesty). On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law (as Holmes and Watson) are (however dubious the conception) excellent in their roles, and this is the most coherent, as well as the most expensive, film the ham-handedly hip British director Guy Ritchie, perhaps most famous as Madonna's ex, has ever done.<br/><br/>Having been steeped in Sherlock Holmes stories as a youth, I can recognize all the many trappings, characters, and ideas of the originals that are carried over into this Christmas Day blockbuster, while finding none of the original atmosphere and personalities here at all. Partly my sense of outrage is due to reading at least a very large chunk of an old but richly satisfying Complete Sherlock Holmes, a thick volume on tissue-thin India paper. Partly it's due to seeing various previous Holmes incarnations on film, which go back over a century. The preeminent incarnation was undoubtedly Basil Rathbone's tall, deep- voiced, long-faced version, with the big meerschaum pipe (now taken over by Tarantino's juicy Nazi villain Col. Landa), the tweeds, the cape-like overcoat, the deerstalker hat, and the traditional lines, of which ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" is the most famous. Above all it was the voice, rich, resonant, elegantly West End English, utterly authoritative. Robert Downey Jr.'s staccato delivery is witty. It's not always quite audible. He's thrown away the deerstalker and the meerschaum for a straight black pipe and a bowler. And that's fine because he doesn't seem anything like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes. Downey Jr. likes to toss off his lines; sometimes they fall before we've caught them. He's bright and quick witted and his motormouthed manner has always been above all suited to keeping the ball rolling. He does that fine here, and he and Jude Law play off each other with excellent chemistry. It's all a lark. And a very well-tooled disaster. Because somehow the action of this actioner doesn't matter. The villain isn't really scary, the danger doesn't feel dangerous, the suspense isn't suspenseful. It's fast and skillful and complicated and loud and sometimes in its overly-dark processed way rather beautiful (like female interests Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly), but it doesn't grab you.<br/><br/>It's okay to design a modern Sherlock Holmes, I guess. But if you do, why steep your movie in Victorian atmosphere? Ritchie's costly film, rich in CGI and spectacular action set pieces, is set in the grimiest of 19th century Londons, with an elegantly slovenly Sherlock Holmes to match. Every moment and every scene is designed to tell us this is Sherlock Holmes, but every moment of every scene has elements in it to tell us that Sherlock Holmes is absolutely what this is not.<br/><br/>Traditionally Holmes is the quintessential intellectual sleuth. You've got that here. Robert Downey Jr's Holmes is a keen observer of detail; he can tell just by scrutinizing her person that Watson's fianc√©e has had a previous failed engagement -- much to her annoyance, and pointlessly; Watson already knew this. Holmes is also a clever inventor -- like his evil adversary, Lord Blackwood. (This individual is played by Mark Strong, who is the villain in two movies opening this week, this and Young Victoria, where he is the evil Lord Conroy. Is England short on villain material nowadays, or were all the other candidates working on a new political satire with Armando Iannucci and Peter Capaldi?)<br/><br/>Anyway, the trouble with Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, which looks like it's set up for a sequel, judging by the way Holmes' perennial opponent Professor Moriarity is mentioned at the end, is not that anything whatsoever is left out. It's that nothing is left out, and on top of all the traditional trappings (slightly distorted, like turning the deerstalker into a bowler), too much is added, of a very distracting and inappropriate nature. All the details of 221B Baker Street and of Holmes and Watson, now locked into an amped-up love-hate relationship that needs a fianc√©e to save the pair from Brokeback Mountain overtones, are dutifully, if not lovingly, preserved, along with the rationcination and the battles of wits with a fiendishly malevolent opponent, only this has been plugged into an action movie matrix, with Holmes additionally transformed into a martial arts master skilled at bruising organs and smashing bones, and with this comes all the loud noise and speeded up and slowed down CGI-assisted footage and hypertrophied musical background complete with bangs and thumps. It's about like the way the disco team of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band redid Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as ""A Fifth of Beethoven.""<br/><br/>All this is great for action blockbuster fans. Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a relief from the ponderous over-signifying of the genre. This is a lark, though sometimes a brutal one. But mostly as A.O. Scott says this movie Sherlock has ""loutish, laddish cool"", and the movie is ""a series of ""poses and stunts"" that are ""intermittently diverting."" But supposing you're a lover of Beethoven: how much will you get out of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band? Not a whole lot. And ultimately there's not a whole lot here, which, come to think of it, despite all the extra millions added in the production this time, has always been true of Guy Ritchie's movies. Some people aren't very good, and yet they keep getting promoted to better-paying jobs. But it's not that Ritchie has no talent, and certainly not true that he has no energy. But as somebody said, his trouble is he doesn't care about character, theme, or even storytelling; he only cares about being cool. Here, he doesn't care about the mystery. And that's the answer to the mystery of why this movie leaves you cold."

","Sherlock Holmes was a complete who-done-it, spine ‚Äì chilling thriller along with towering performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. The movie starts with Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson trying to stop a Black Magic spell on an innocent girl by Cornwood. Soon, he is arrested and sentenced to death. This is not the end but the beginning. He arises from death and people of London are once again plagued by evil spell of Blackwood Magic. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson must try to stop him before he cast his spell on the the entire world. Sherlock Holmes was a fantastic movie with mind blowing performances by Downery Jr. And Jude Law. Both the actors were amazing enacting their part to the utmost.The direction by Guy Ritchie adds another feather to the cap. The best part of the movie was the London background. It will actually took f 1870's. A special word for an outstanding cinematography. The sound effects along with the visual effects were amazing. So overall, a fantastic movie to watch with some great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude law."

","The first film of Guy Ritchie's that I've seen since his staggeringly awful debut, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (aka No Way! Shut Up! I've Never Even Seen Reservoir Dogs!). I was right to avoid him. Sherlock Holmes is almost a good movie. In any case, Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for the role, and he really does his best to make the film work. I don't at all object to the idea of making Sherlock Holmes an action hero. The screenwriters make it make at least some sense. But, boy, does Ritchie go out of his way to screw everything up. The guy can't direct an action sequence to save his life. At one moment, he's overexplaining everything via slow-mo flashbacks (we could figure out Rachel McAdams drugged the wine, we don't need to see it), and another moment he's confusing us with slapdash editing. The film is just a mess. In the hands of a better director, this franchise could have been worth watching, but in Ritchie's hands, I'll avoid any subsequent films."
"jmkeating","2","3","5","9 June 2010"," Could have done better
","I found the film to be utter rubbish - the Sherlock Holmes character was more like a cross between Steven Seagal and McGyver, and unshaven! He didn't ""look intelligent"" when he was trying to solve problems. His pipe wasn't right and some of his shirts ‚Äì I wondered if they really existed before 1900. And, of course, his accent wasn't quite right ‚Äì the English accent or rather English accents can be difficult to achieve and ends up as a mishmash of different regional accents. I find myself trying to sort out which regions and that spoils the film for me As for Irene Adler, at first I thought the American accent incorrect, but then realised that Conan-Doyle had her born in New Jersey in 1858, so she would have been around 32 at the middle of the construction of Tower Bridge.<br/><br/>The French speaking thugs had a French-Canadian accent - strange.<br/><br/>I agree that the special effects seemed to have been bought from a charity shop. All the buildings scenes seemed not right, not real. If you can't get it right, don't put it in!<br/><br/>And all the chase scenes, not very Sherlock Holmes-esquire, were nothing to do with what I had expected, as were the ""last second saves"" in the pig abattoir. The amount of violence was far greater than ever seen before in previous renderings of the great detective. I concluded that it should have been given another name, e.g. Herlock Sholmes, the Parody invented by Maurice Leblanc in his Ars√®ne Lupin books (Conan-Doyle was, apparently, annoyed).<br/><br/>That just about sums it up ‚Äì it wasn't Sherlock Holmes ‚Äì it was a parody."
"vancelongwell","6","3","5","26 May 2010"," Decent Actioner
","As a fluffy little actioner this was a passable film, but I abhor the treatment of the source material. The adversarial relationship between Holmes and Watson is intolerable. It's so distracting, not to mention, the diametric opposite condition depicted in the source material. Moreover, Holmes and Watson, within the source material, are most assuredly not distinct characters. These are the two halves of the same man, and therefore, Watson and Holmes simply can't be portrayed separately. Besides which, I don't see any reason to betray the source material in order to depict this stupid conflict as it goes absolutely nowhere, and has zero to do with the plot. Nah, this alone makes the film virtually unwatchable, and has severely damaged my 'like' of Guy Ritchie. I mean, Rock n Rola was a tight film, his best to date. This pig was a disaster.<br/><br/>Law and Downey had fantastic chemistry here. What the heck were 'they' thinking pitting them against one and other? Mark Strong continues to impress, is there anything he can't do? Is there a large-scale film he HASN'T been in this last decade? The Mary Morstan character played by actor Kelly Reilly was a total bust and her appearance was gratefully brief. Who is this chick? I don't usually pick on Hollywood types about their appearance but that is one ugly woman. Yeah, like a bow-wow like that could land a Doctor as handsome Law plays the character. Another massive distraction. Plus, I spent the whole time wincing at the scenes she tries to make an appearance in, and she's so clearly totally overwhelmed by Downey and Law she's got no business on a set with them. McAdams bordered on this as well. Star-struck much, ladies? And lastly, how she managed it I'll never know, but that was the worst fake-British accent ever!! Only wait! Reilly's British!! Am I the only one who thought her accent sounded like a 13 year old girl playing 'lady' with her teddy bear? Just wrong.<br/><br/>The conflict between Holmes and Watson isn't the only straight miss either. Sherlock Holmes has always been portrayed as a fastidiously neat, and tidy fellow. This quasi-Bohemian treatment was just dumb. Clinical scientific methodology simply doesn't work for slobs. Period. Wouldn't have even had to go there if they'd left the source material alone, remember, Watson is SUPPOSED to be the alter-ego. <br/><br/>Anyway, I thought Law, Downey, Strong, and McAdams were all on their A- game here. No complaints there. I suppose the film looked alright too, kudos Ritchie. But they simply strayed too far from source material and cast the thing just all wrong. Future mental note: When depicting one of English-lit's most famous fictitious characters, might want to get an Englishman to play the part. Duh.<br/><br/>This could have been the identical flick without all the crapping all over the source material folks. This 'reboot' trend will hopefully die a painful death soon."

However the movie kept throwing all manner of plot devices at you it became extremely difficult to actually follow the story. The habit of having Holmes visualize his deductions might have worked, if it weren't for your mind being assaulted by all manner of other effects and unnecessary bits of dramatic filling. Don't get me wrong. My complaint isn't too much action or too many stunts. It's too much everything. Instead of making it fast paced, the Director winds up slowing everything down. It's not like watching paint dry. It's like watching paint dry and every few minutes someone comes along and throws on a new coat of paint."

The inane plot, probably whizzed up in a night of Californian fake ""champagne"" and some controlled substances, has nothing whatsoever to do with any Conan Doyle story, and is seated in a heavily steampunked London, which is a past of not our future, with a number of anachronistic details (radio is mentioned, guns look Far West improved by Luger Corp., pocket watches are of at least 50 years later build, etc). It also exhibits a number of holes the size of a whale. You will be delighted to learn that the finishing touch is to mix in a vaguely Masonic evil secret society √† la Angels and Demons. Steer absolutely clear, put sandbags and barbed wire on your DVD player and refuse to get involved with this reinvented chemically pure drivel."
"p-stepien","6","3","5","16 January 2010"," Holmes without mystery
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his trusted swashbuckling limp-legged sidekick Dr Watson (Jude Law) are two peas of a criminological pod-unit in the XIX Century. Lightyears ahead in knowledge of the London bobbies (not to mention the outdated methods of CSI) they are an unstoppable detective force, that breaks down any mystery within a matter of minutes. They are essentially Batman and Robin of the XIX Century... just without the masks.<br/><br/>One of their cases forces them to solve a mysterious series of murders committed on young women. The culprit is Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a member of a hidden sect and an learned adept of the black arts. Sherlock Holmes manages to foil Lord Blackwood just before he attempts to sacrifice another girl on his black altar of power. This sees Blackwood thrown into prison and prepping up for the noose.<br/><br/>After ending this supposedly last big mission Sherlock Holmes locks himself away frustrated with his awesomeness and the boredom on the outside (he simplicity of cases to be offered is very frustrating). Hence he indulges into wacky experiments on animals (poor pouch), gets wasted regularly and throws himself into illegal back-alley brawls to waste the time. In the meantime Dr Watson finds himself a beautiful woman with whom he aims to spend the rest of his life with, thus creating a new sphere of everyday existence that no longer entails Holmes or solving crimes. Meanwhile Lord Blackwood is to be hanged...<br/><br/>This is a movie I really wanted to like, but in the end I found it very wanting in most areas. Robert Downey Jr and surprisingly Jude Law both do a fine job in the respective parts and since they are key to the story you deftly find yourself asking why the movie constantly falls short of its promise.<br/><br/>For one thing Sherlock Holmes has been transformed from a great detective into a supernatural superhero. The crimes are basically unsolvable with pure logic and only due to Holmes having superhuman cognizance and total awareness is he able to solve them. This leaves viewers to being basically receptacles of Holmes brilliance, but in no way are we capable of actually trying to solve the puzzle. We just quietly have to accept the solution presented on a silver platter. All in all this leads the movie about Sherlock Holmes focused on action, because it is devoid of any real mystery. In the end you just wait until Sherlock Holmes explains the plot point. No inner voice says 'Oh yeah! That's was so obvious!' or 'Wow! I never thought of that!'. After Holmes explains the non-mystery in this detective story its back to the no hold barred action.<br/><br/>Secondly and surprisingly Guy Ritchie really fell short in the one place he used to excel in - the comedy department. Despite having such an excellent comedic actor in Robert Downey Jr all the jokes in this movie fall well short. Some of the gags are really quite brilliant, but even those don't even get a smirk out of you. The scenes are too rushed and have no real comedic feeling. Instead of building the joke and then letting it burst at the right moment all the jokes are basically leaking out of a punctured balloon. Adding to that most jokes are extremely clich√©d and have a 'done that' feel to them. Its almost like rewatching ""Maverick"".<br/><br/>Thirdly the movie has a comic-book feel to it, but not in the Christopher Nolan manner (good), but more in the direction of Batman and Robin. This movie really needs less punchlines and more dark dramatic scenes that bring a bit of seriousness to the movie.<br/><br/>There are some very strong points to the movie. One of these is the beautiful presentation of old London, which really is jaw-dropping and the best such achievement of presenting a XIX century town in cinema history. I was also very impressed by three scenes, which really showed how talented a storyteller Guy Ritchie can be. One of these concerned Sherlock Holmes thinking out step by step what he would do to his opponent in a boxing match and then doing it in real time. The second was a sequence of blasts which really were very intense and gave the movie a dramatic punch. The third was a retrospective in which we find out what Sherlock Holmes did just minutes earlier. All three scenes are brilliantly shot and really added two stars to my general vote for this movie. Another 2 stars I give due to the fine duo performance by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Unfortunately the director was not up to par to the acting.<br/><br/>Just to end on a positive note: The movie definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography."
"H3ddd","9","3","5","11 January 2010"," Great story...Conan Doyle would be proud!
","This is one of the best film adaptations of Sherlock Holmes I have seen in a LONG time! The plot was involved, captivating, intricate and full of surprises.<br/><br/>There was a lot of action and I thought both Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law were awesome! Jude Law was great as a calm and rational balance to Downey's fanatical and somewhat crazed genius.<br/><br/>All supporting cast were great, especially Holmes two nemesis: Moriarty and Irene Adler. Mark Strong played a wonderful villain and kept us guessing right up to the very end. There HAS to be a sequel in the works because the ending was quite obviously set up for this.<br/><br/>The only criticism I would offer is that Downey's Sherlock was shown to be very physical whereas Doyle's Sherlock is more mental in his dealings with villains. This is a very small criticism, however. I really didn't mind it. The rest of the film's excellence made up for it. GREAT MOVIE! H"
"markgorman","7","3","5","28 December 2009"," Elementary movie making. Flawed but great.
","The new incarnation of Holmes by Robert Downie Jr is fascinating. His relationship with Watson (played by Jude Law) continues that enduring Holmesian 'is he, isn't he' gay frisson which is suitably mashed up with the introduction of female love interests on both sides (Law's played demurely - dully actually - by Kelly Reilly and Holmes' rather better by Rachel McAdams).<br/><br/>Central to the film's success is Law and Downie Jr who really make you believe there is life in this as a new franchise. Both (yes even Law) are excellent. And especially when they are on screen together they are great; carrying off the dialogue knowingly and often laugh out loud funnily.<br/><br/>It's a great smorgasbrod of action, humour and special effects with enough Holmsian explanation of who did what and why to keep the interest up.<br/><br/>The set needs special mention as a London in which Tower Bridge is under construction plays a character role. It's really quite beguiling, and although much CAD is used it works.<br/><br/>The effect of a ship (also under construction) being set loose down a slipway is eye boggling and the use of lots of flying objects heading for the camera genuinely makes you duck (so who needs 3D then?) Now for the bad news. It's long, way too long. And the story is pretty silly really. I won't bore you with the details here. The oft used metaphor of a raven of death marking character obliteration is naff (first year film school).<br/><br/>But overall I give it a healthy 7.5 out of 10. (The scene in the boxing booth justifies entry alone.) Good honest entertainment."
"vailsy","8","3","5","26 December 2009"," A fresh slant on a classic character
","For those more familiar with the deerstalker hat and cape which is how Holmes was depicted pictorially only, this version of Sherlock Holmes may come as a surprise. Ritchie draws out some of Holmes' lesser known traits here such as his bohemian nature; often high, slightly bedraggled and manic depressive off the job, and sometimes on it. These are accurate character traits, and the Holmes in need of some TLC comes straight out of Conan Doyle's stories.<br/><br/>So while Downey Jr doesn't look like the typical Holmes image and Sidney Paget's drawings of the character, his look stubble aside is more in keeping with Doyles writings and I did find him an interesting Holmes (though if it'd been me I'd have wanted Paul Bettany for the part). Downey Jr and Law obviously click well off screen and this shows in their performances. They have an excellent and witty rapport and I look forward to future instalments with these two <br/><br/>Judging from the trailers I was expecting this film to be Sherlock Holmes the comedy. Having read all of the Holmes stories several times over, I was slightly disappointed at this prospect, but luckily this is more a darkly humorous action movie - the trailers actually just show the most obviously funny moments back to back. Overall Ritchie goes for a reasonably serious if slightly shallow and super hero styled update to the character <br/><br/>We're dipped straight into the life of Holmes and Watson, in keeping with the original stories, and there are no boring introductions or origins filler to sit through. the plot is otherwise quite unlike any of Conan Doyles original stories though, more like a comic book, and I think this is the films weakest link. There's certainly lots of murder and mystery on offer but the story lacks the finesse of Doyles writings <br/><br/>In terms of the films component parts I loved the score which was constantly interesting. The visuals are stunning with London looking suitably smoky and mysterious.<br/><br/>The film includes some great action set pieces and I think audiences young and old will be satisfied with this Sherlock Holmes. While I'm most definitely not a fan of Guy Ritchie's past endeavours, I think he has made a creative resurgence here after dumping some old baggage"

Not to mention the actors and director, in which we expect a lot from.<br/><br/>I haven't read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books about the great detective Sherlock Holmes. So this review will be based upon whatever I have seen and I will rate it for what I saw, not how accurate or how there is a miscasted Sherlock Holmes is. To be honest, I have seen many of these Sherlock Holmes fanboys complaining about how inaccurate this film is, I really don't care. We live in the 21st century, things change, just because you think how perfect that actor 40 years old played Sherlock Holmes should be casted, sorry, his dead. There have been films of Sherlock Holmes which are played by the 'more suited' actors, but sorry, how successful were they? This one is going for a wider audience.<br/><br/>The film starts instantly with a crime, all of a sudden with questions and gets into the point fast.<br/><br/>I've been a Guy Ritchie fan ever since Lock, stock and two smokin' barrels. And I can easily say that he is one of my favourite director. Guy Ritchie adds his own touch of 'first do, explain later' which really made the film more interesting. You always wanted to you know why, how, or when.<br/><br/>I really don't have to talk about the actors, with reputation for all four actors you guess they'll do an exception job, which they did. I found the chemistry of Judd Law and RDJ really real and it felt they belonged to together. Not for the second did i think that they were lovers, as some people argued. They are just two good mates.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie depicts the Victorian times perfectly. From the clothes that were worn, to the way the streets were paved. The costumes were top notch (I hope I see them getting an Oscar nomination for that category). The CGI scenes, which were not overused nor needed for most parts were done excellently. I found them feeling really realistic. from the ship scene and the bridge.<br/><br/>Humour was a big part in the film. I found it to be quite funny. Although most of the 'laugh out loud' scenes were exclusive to the trailers, It still had more humour than I expected. The theatre laughed at almost all the jokes and I laughed a little extra.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film has shown some great acting by the lead roles, a magnificent setting of the Victorian times along with a good plot with tasteful humour. Sherlock Holmes is a franchise that will make millions not matter how crap the films are. There are always people will want to watch it.

"nebojsa-todorovic","4","4","8","23 January 2010"," Pretentious and overdone
","From the beginning of the movie, and the first fight it's obvious how pretentious the movie is going to be. I suppose all You fans of the Conan Doyle's character cleverly know how Holmes was a good brawler, and was proficient in some martial arts and weapon using (singlestick, sword etc.), but in this case it's overdone and just pretentious. He deducts his foe in the dark, by sounds, smell etc. while fist fighting in a way that would make Batman to rethink if he would get in the fight with him. It's generally OK for Sherlock to be superior to others but they made him overly competent comparing to the main character in the book, but at some point I thought writer has mistaken main character addiction to drugs with addiction to steroids. It's like the writer took every little strong point of Sherlock's character and just threw it in randomly through the script just for show-off, and to make him more likable, and that the writer can prove he read a book thoroughly. Also, I know Holmes is eccentric, but here in few scenes when talking to Watson, he behaves like a 13 year old with ADD syndrome, and this, once more, becomes laughably overdone. All this makes the drama more idiotic when it's obvious he'll come through no matter what. This character will never be able to make you hold for the chair in expect of what will happen, simply because he is perfect in every aspect, whether it is his clairvoyance brain, or physical performance of a mix of Rambo and Brus Lee, which is odd for a heavy smoker/drug user in his mid thirties.<br/><br/>I know everyone is going to watch it anyway, but at least go and watch it in a right mindset and don't expect too much."
"mcsheehey","10","4","8","16 January 2010"," Bloody Brilliant!
","""Sherlock Holmes"" is part-comedy, part-thriller, part-romance, and part-buddy movie. It is also completely brilliant.<br/><br/>The film's plot concerns a mysterious plot by the menacing Lord Blackwood. Holmes (Downey Jr.), Watson (Law), and an alluring past love interest (McAdams) must work together- sometimes reluctantly- to crack the case. It sounds simple, but a number of ominous supporting players and adrenaline-inspiring set pieces make it constantly entertaining and riveting.<br/><br/>The perpetually likable Robert Downey Jr. takes up the torch as Sherlock Holmes. There's no need to compare his work to that of Basil Rathbone- the two performances could not be more different. Downey Jr. makes Holmes both comedic and competent. His accent is convincing, and his delivery is as dead-pan as ever. In Guy Ritchie's revisionist take, Holmes has become a comic action hero, and Downey Jr. pulls off both the comedy and the action seamlessly. Jude Law lends great support as Watson; his take on the character is more traditional, but he makes a great comedic straight-man as well. McAdams also does well as an American femme fatale whose allegiances are always in question.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the film combines Ritchie's ""guns-blazing"" sensibilities with period detail and witty dialogue. The quick-cut shots and fast-paced visual flashbacks/explanations suit the source material surprisingly well. The musical score is effectively creepy; it evokes the air of the Rathbone films and the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels. Similarly, the costumes and art direction capture the time period, and arrest the audience visually. The script is chock-full of funny lines, and the cast delivers them well.<br/><br/>While purists may shudder at the sight of Sherlock in the boxing arena, Ritchie's ""Holmes"" is fun, fast-paced, and fresh. Case closed."
"dougmcnair","10","4","8","11 January 2010"," A brilliant film! What are the critics complaining about?
","When we first saw the trailer to Sherlock Holmes, my wife and I both got the impression that this film could be really good or really bad. Then when the reviews came out, I breathed a sigh of relief that we hadn't wasted our time and money running out to see it on opening night. We would have avoided it entirely if she hadn't suggested we go see some chick flick, causing me to grasp at ""that silly Sherlock Holmes action film"" as an escape hatch.<br/><br/>Now we are both furious at the critics for keeping us away from this film for so long. Robert Downey's Sherlock Holmes is the most compelling and authentic portrayal of the Holmes character I've ever seen. One of the first things we find out about Holmes in the Conan Doyle stories is that he's a manic depressive drug addict who engages in aberrant, self-destructive behavior like firing bullets into the walls of his apartment when he doesn't have a case to distract him from his inner demons. All Guy Ritchie does is emphasize this darker side of Holmes' character and use it to portray Holmes as a man of action as well as creature of the mind. That is a far cry from the wholesale reworking of Holmes that the critics accuse Ritchie of.<br/><br/>Ritchie's Holmes is a lonely misfit who lives with one foot in ""respectable"" society and the other in London's vast underworld. All of that is true to the stories. As for Watson, he is Holmes' only friend and the one person trying to save him from himself (again, true to the stories). For that reason, Watson's impending marriage is a threat to Holmes, and brings out some wonderful comic relief with Holmes acting the part of the aggrieved ""wife"" trying to overlook ""her"" husband's dalliances while working hard to undermine them and save the ""marriage."" That may go beyond what's in the stories, but it's a great way to make the two characters come alive in a way that a 21st Century audience can relate to. Failure to re-imagine their relationship in such a way runs the risk of treating Holmes and Watson as Victorian museum pieces; something that's been done quite enough.<br/><br/>Throw into the mix a supernatural plot with a villain in the mold of Aleister Crowley, and you have a superb film that shakes off the dust of 20th Century screen adaptations and gives us a fresh new Holmes for the 21st Century who is still 100% faithful to the character. I hope to see Downey and Law in many Holmes sequels to come."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","4","8","1 January 2010"," Guy Ritchie's best film in about ten years.
","Guy Ritchie is like the English Quentin Tarantino. Except, well, not as good. Ritchie has had some great films, some OK films, and some terrible films. His first,Lock,stock, and two smoking barrels, was OK. His second, Snatch, was great. His third, Swept away, I never saw. But it bombed. I don't know what he did after that. But then he did Rocknrolla, which was OK. It had it's moments but not art. But now he returns with his newest movie. Sherlock Holmes. Which is his best movie since Snatch.<br/><br/>Ricthie changes the iconic characters Watson and Sherlock. Both are now ass kickers. I know, it's an odd twist. Well, if it makes the movie work, then I guess not. The film works anyways. I was never bored by Sherlock Holmes. It was funny, some of the action sequences were spectacular,the acting was good. It's exhilarating entertainment that you must see. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. stars as the title role. Like most of Ritchie's plots, I have a hard time explaining what it's about. There is a lot to it. But I will tell you that the cast to it is very good. And it has a lot of what Ritchie uses.<br/><br/>I will tell you a few details. The plot at first seems like it will be something paranormal. It's not quite paranormal.It seems like it but it's not. I will not give anything else out besides that the movie is a lot of fun. See it.<br/><br/>Alright now I have come up with a way to describe the plot. The film starts off with Sherlock(Downey) and Watson(Law) going to save this woman from some sort of evil ritual. They soon learn it's a guy named Lord Blackwood, a priest or something. Eventually, Blackwood is put in prison and hung by the neck. And also more murders start to occur around the town. And they believe it was Blackwood. But how could he be back from the dead?<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have a strange kind of romance. Or bro-mance. Though Rachael Mcaams plays his mysterious love interest of some sort, Irene Alder, I always sensed that Law ands Downey had a bit more of something.<br/><br/>Another thing about the plot. Watson always feels tempted to go with Sherlock. Even when he is going on a date or something. The film is never boring, funny, and exciting., As I said before, see it."

","Let me make my voting clear! I refuse to give this a 10, because I am no movie expert and in no position of calling this an excellent movie! As for the movie, it is the most entertaining movie of 2009! The plot is just brilliant and there are very few plot holes as the movie continues. The movie also develops nicely, sharing the adventure with the audience. The ending is somewhat predictable and there are a few clich√©s, but in no point during the running time, they will ruin the experience! The visual and sound effects are very well done. There are spectacular views and breath taking sound effects. Definitely not a low budget movie this...<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Natural, funny and adventurous. Chemistry between Robert Jr and Jude Law is one of a kind. I have no complaints about the cast. Even the bad guys were well-casted! The boxing scenes remind me of the ones in Snatch, definitely a Guy signature.<br/><br/>Movie is highly recommended, money well spent!"

","I just finished watching Sherlock Holmes and I must admit that I got more than I bargained for. Guy's Ritchie's treatment of the legendary detective is very fresh and extremely entertaining. London's dirty streets in late 19th century have been captured almost to perfection. Robert Downing Jr. is THE Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century audiences. Sarcastic and witty this Holmes not only possesses a razor sharp brain but also terrific fighting skills! Definitely not what Arthur Conan Doyle had in mind but hey we've seen that Holmes a lot of times before. The plot is complex and intricate and the action sequences have been well choreographed to make a complete action thriller. Jude Law as Dr Watson has done a very good job where in his part has not been completely overshadowed by Holmes and in fact Holmes does rely upon him quite a bit. Go to this movie expecting an action thriller rather than a mystery."

","If this has any other title, i would think it was a brilliant movie. Funny, action packed, itriguing... alas, it is called sherlock Holmes. When i was young, i was an avid reader of sherlock Holmes books. i read the likes of 'the speckled band', 'the hounds of baskerville', etc. How did sherlock became a pro fighter? And why is he such an asshole? Like always making Mary and Watson mad. Sure, he's a genius, but in no way does he demonstrate his smartness like some obnoxious egomaniac, like how he did with Mary. like, oh, you're a governess, you... then he prattles on and on. Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be a brilliant man, but nice too. And Irene Adler is a slut! Stripping sherlock, kissing him? And the black magic stuff is... weird. that seems out of place in Victorian england. The good points is that there is real chemistry between sherlock and Watson, and the acting is real good. the scenes look real too."
"Likes_Ninjas90","3","5","11","11 January 2010"," This is yet another Hollywood film interested purely in style over substance, storytelling or intellect
","After watching Sherlock Holmes one has to question whether the director Guy Ritchie or the three credit screenwriters had read any of the original stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. If they did it must have been purely to see how they could simplify and dumb down almost every aspect of the original vision. This film shamefully replaces the slow burning and tense mysteries in favour of violent fist fights and shootouts, leaving Holmes and Watson now as a pair of action stars, more on par with John McClane than anything Doyle imagined. It is a complete disregard for Doyle's work as Holmes was rarely a man of action. He was someone who spent a great deal of time alone, thinking about cases and then delegating tasks and adventures to his associate Watson. His reluctance to send Watson out into the field was because of the possibility of danger. In discussing Holmes' lack of communication as well, Watson states at the end of the book ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"": ""Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances"". Those who cherished the books will be dismayed with the removal of all of the subtleties, while those who are unfamiliar with the detective will just be misguided about his nature.<br/><br/>The character of Watson also suffers significantly under this new envisioning. Watson is left with little to do but become a fast fighting sidekick. He is given very little chance to show his intellect and value for reading clues. As with Holmes, he was never a brawler, but in this film he must one of the most violent doctors imaginable. Despite Holmes' meddling with the engagement there is also no hint of the homosexual tensions between the two men. The friendship is more the equivalent of a Hollywood buddy comedy or an odd couple, with Holmes as the messy one and Watson as the proper man who can't resist the adventure. The simplification of the characters, in trying to turn the film into the next Bond or Bourne movie for the MTV generation, suggests the filmmakers have little credit towards younger audience members, refusing to challenge them with anything beyond a highly formulaic action film. One of the producers was Joel Silver, and given his involvement with the likes of The Matrix, V for Vendetta and Swordfish, he must have been a prominent supporter of this new action-orientated Holmes.<br/><br/>By replacing much of the mystery with an emphasis on action, Sherlock Holmes' narrative is largely irrelevant. There are the obligatory double crosses and a master villain supposedly involved in supernatural magic, but hardly any of this is particularly intriguing or mysterious as it never adds up cohesively. A character named Blackwood can only be evil and any revelations about him are difficult to care about. Mark Strong's villain really lacks motivation, simply joining the lengthy queue of those who wish to take over the world. The rest of the performances suffer from this weak narrative too. Jude Law and Rachel McAdams, both capable actors, have largely wasted roles, the latter failing to convince as the femme fatale. Yet most disappointing is the casting of Downey Jr. As flawed as the script is, the casting of Downey Jr. is just illogical. There is nothing remotely English about his behaviour or his mannerisms and his attempt at an English accent renders every few lines of his dialogue almost inaudible. Though he might make the occasional cheeky remark to display his arrogance, his performance still lacks the quiet confidence, the restraint, the properness and self-assurance of Holmes as a thinker, not an action star. The attempt at comic touches, like having him wear a fake nose or a false beard or eye patch, are unfitting with the essence of the original character. That Downey Jr. has been nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Comedy or Musical Category for this performance, is further evidence that Hollywood award ceremonies are beginning to favour less deserving mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>Ritchie has declined to use few of the structural techniques that Doyle employed in his stories. Instead, he embraces the same hyperkinetic action styles and aesthetics that were popular with his flashy films Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Holmes often imagines in slow-motion how he is going to attack the body parts of a henchman and then proceeds to perform these kung fu moves in real time. Brief flashbacks are also used to quickly present expositional plot points, showing how Holmes collected a clue to solve something. The rapid editing worked in the two gangster films by representing the frantic and spontaneous lifestyle of the British hoods. The speedy editing techniques here not only feel anachronistic but they emphasise Ritchie's preference for action over plot or mystery. The clues are also rarely as smart or as clever as the ones of simple, but plausible logic, from the books. <br/><br/>Fans of Doyle's stories will be thoroughly disappointed and perhaps angry at the treatment here of the original works here. There has been a deliberate effort to simplify the essence of Sherlock Holmes into a dumb, formulaic action blockbuster. It is a pity younger viewers might leave this film thinking that this is indeed true to Doyle's written words. Even those who are not familiar with the original works will gain little from the derivative fight scenes and the miscast actors, as this is yet another Hollywood film interested purely in style over substance, storytelling or intellect."

","Although some might disagree, I believe that this adaptation of Sherlock Holmes is truer to the original than any of its predecessors. Downey's character seems to stand out quite well without being overshadowed by Jude Law who also played an excellent Watson. There was more action in this one that in previous version of the franchise, but I think that it was aptly suited for this day and age, where anything short of that might end up as a BBC miniseries. Overall its was fun, exciting from start to finish, had fair acting. I wish it could have lasted a bit longer and I sure hope, there is a sequel with the infamous Professor Moriaty. Overall good family film for all the ages. If you liked the Young Sherlock Holmes in the 80's, you will like this too."

","What comes to our mind when wit meets excellence - Robert Down Jr...this fact is well explained in this movie. From the plot, storyline, action, drama, comedy everything seemed to be so perfectly placed. The interconnections and not a missing link leave the viewer amazed with excitement.
The brilliance lies in the creativity of Sherlock and his ability at seeing things with a different view. That is reason he benefits at finding the logical explanations of Lord Blackwood's evil activities. Lord Blackwood is shows himself as the Lord of the dark using the marvels of science. 
The first encounter of Sherlock and Mary at dinner and Sherlock using his intelligence at deciphering the details is one of the most comical moments. Dr Watson, a good friend has to suffer being a companion of Sherlock but is a die hard friend who never backs out. 
The cinematography and portrayal of the 19th Century civilization is done as a marvel and so is the acting. The most brilliant was the fight at the dockyard and release of the ship and gear almost killing Sherlock---realistic. 
But the most beauty was the sound effects that were perfectly timed and executed. From the subtle movement to the action packed fight one could find the brilliant sound effects.

"CompuLOL","3","2","3","6 October 2013"," A nice attempt of making an updated action-adventure themed film; that just didn't quite cut it...
","It could had been easily inferred that this movie wasn't destined to be any good; at least by the original Sherlock Holmes character. Because not only feels that it was forced into a newer era; but that it was the first installment on a stupid, deficit attention series. I'm not against pimping it; a little. But this just went all overboard. So much, in fact; that it just doesn't make any sense. Which is an obv problem, specially in a series that prides itself on logical deduction and thinking. The first issue it had was that it simply was too modernized. The late 1800s settings were merely a visual style; for it could as easily been set in the mid 1900s, without any other noticeable contrivance. Eg, electromagnetism wasn't even well established; let alone the building of hand-held, singular radio controlled devices. What's next; gas driven automobiles?! So if you're going to introduce those elements in the grandfather of murder mysteries; then make sure there aren't so many anachronistic mistakes. Or you'll end steampunking your way into another pitiful, unintended comedy; like The Wild Wild West, and that's not a good idea. The second is that the movie also portrays Sherlock too unrealistic; even more than originally intended. Ie, as a spiritual new age renaissance man / master of disguise / mad scientist / weird delusional genius / expert hand to hand combatant / biological chemist / etc, etc, etc; you name it. Since he was so much high and mighty stuff; the question begs; why does he need Watson in the first place then? (Medical expertise obv notwithstanding) Well, it turns out, he doesn't really need anyone; unsurprisingly. At least, to solve this ""mystery"" (standard bland self revealing plot, really) Everybody that lives in the real world knows (even if intuitively) that things are probabilistic, not deterministic; without any need for modern convoluted physical models. There are lit thousands of explanations that could equally qualify for any given deduction. Eg, there's a scene when he gets ""wrong"" the finger mark of a ring on Watson's fianc√©e. So why is that the only thing he fails at it?! The ratio of hit/misses shown is obv statistically impossible. It's like he's even above godlike psychic normal humankind, and nobody else is on par; except at the final introduction of his commonplace nemesis. Yet another example would be that we're supposed to believe that he can ""infer"" where he's at; after being taken blindfolded for a carriage ride? Why do people bother to begin with; seriously!? I for once, would like to point out that the emperor is; indeed; naked. But thirdly and lastly, the worst was the plot itself; this was an even greater affront to all true Sherlock Holmes fans. Without revealing too much of it; it would be suffice to say that is also an extension of Sherlock's superhuman capabilities. Ie, just a coincidental dumb excuse to show off. It revolves around trying to stop a creepy clich√© guy for making himself ruler of the UK, and the US, as well. Again; why stop there, when you can have the whole world :rolleyes: Apparently common megalomaniacal villains from back then also never did bother to kill their adversaries from the start. Yet, it couldn't be more boring that sitting thru this movie. Or maybe he knew that Sherlock would have inferred his lame attempt; or that he'd then start dodging bullets Matrix style :shakehead: There just wasn't any stop to the ridiculousness of this silly film. Nevertheless, on a positive note; it was pretty to look at, had high production values, and had some decent performances (except Downey's accent obv); but it still wasn't a good addition overall to the Sherlock's saga, IMHO. Unless you're planning the next movie to be an even more ludicrous hybrid James Bond/MI type of deal, of course. Bottomline; it was just another sad case of form over substance cash-in milk cow..."

","When I was a kid, my father gave me the book as my birthday present in my native language. I was so excited that after reading the book, I bought another copy of the book of the original language. I dreamed about a healthy person with some peculiar habits. Sherlock was an intelligent man, who had a power of gathering and organizing information. A savvy man relied on experimenting when he had no cases that could entertain his mind. The man lived in 232/B, Baker street, England with his friend and associate Dr. John Watson. When I watched the trailer, I felt excited and waited for the movie. After the release of the movie, I somehow collected and watched it. After sometime I felt a spy person rather a detective. Director Guy Ritchie tried hard to focus on creating and giving a unique taste of age old Sherlock Holmes, but the story didn't fit with the memory from television show and book. The acting of Robert Downey Jr. was amazing but his superhero image from Iron man didn't fit in my eyes. Jude Law as Dr. John Watson in the movie was better than Sherlock. He presented himself as an intelligent, loyal helpful person as described in the previous resources. Two main lady characters (Rachel MacAdams as Irene Adler and Kelly Reily as Mary Morstan) were somehow contradicted with one another though the death of Irene Adler got some emotion from the viewers for the movie.

","This is a movie where solid acting, great art direction (costumes, buildings and decoration) and some funny comedy lines happen. There are even some sessions that feel a little bit yaoi-oriented (refer to Wikipedia), which might please Asian fans, especially girls, while for teenager boys and early twenties like me, it doesn't seem that strange due to the way we express our friendship being similar to that shown in this film. On the whole, the performance isn't contrived at all, even when NOT considering the fact that it's a comedy. The old London city looks awfully beautiful with many details that accurately captures and represents the feeling of the streets.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, the plot isn't great. You probably won't even take it as ""good"" if you like reasoning or logic that's supposed to be essential for detective fictions, you'd probably be disappointed. The reasons lie in two aspects. First, the reasoning portrayed in this movie relies way too much on professional knowledges; almost all the reasonings are built upon the knowledges of chemistry. Second, you don't get as many evidences and clues as Sherlock Holmes does; since the stuff he sees, or more literally, smells, are generally chemistry stuff, you won't know what he sees or smells or tastes until the end of the film. That said, you are totally impossible to solve the puzzle by yourself.<br/><br/>So whether it's a film for you depends on your taste. If you're looking for some entertaining dialogs, good acting and beautiful scenes, you won't be let down.

"jkysharma","7","2","3","4 July 2010"," The Adventure of the Ritchie deduction
","Ritchie's latest marked a return to the cinemas for me after a gap of three months, longer than any gap I recall. As a result, I'm inclined to look at the nicer aspects of this flick. And there are many if one can discern the intent behind the making of Sherlock Holmes. For starters, it's Guy Ritchie. A O Scott's (of NYT) observation is bang on - his approach to films is ""to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff"". Also, he seems to have a hold over London's sub-culture. Snatch and Lock Stock ... aren't cult films for nothing. They are intended to be precisely that. In his gravitating towards Holmes, I sense primarily an opportunity to milk the considerable London ethos that pervades throughout Doyle's work. Permit the brief digression but this is crucial to Holmes' (still unquestioned) exalted position in detective fiction. Poirot and his like do not preside over a criminal setting anywhere near as compelling. Only Maigret's Paris (grossly overused) comes remotely close. London represents a veritable treasure-trove of literary and cinematic possibilities and Ritchie makes considerable use of the latter. From Piccadilly Circus to the Tower of London, landmarks abound. It was particularly gratifying to watch sequences that weave their way through the alleys and lanes - most distinctive of London, and Holmes.<br/><br/>There's a cue for the viewer in the manner in which Ritchie goes about extracting the maximum from London. He does the same with every aspect of the film from the performances to the plot. In short, every ounce of cinematic potential has been squeezed from the material. So Holmes' modest claims to an understanding of Bartitsu are developed into full- blown martial arts exploits. Watson is hinted as being a bit of a ladies' man in the books and voil√†, Jude Law (competent) is cast, albeit with the necessary changes to his exterior. Far from being a mere accompaniment, Watson is very nearly indispensable to Holmes. Likewise, Lestrade is a nincompoop and Mrs Hudson in addition to being a super- efficient housekeeper, is also frankly expressive of her disbelief at Holmes' antics (""Some folk might say there was madness in his method""). Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes have a fling (the limitless possibilities of 'To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman' !). Only here they make the one patent mistake of the movie. A femme fatale and a thief acting under Moriarty's orders is stretching it a bit and Rachel McAdams doesn't help either. The less said about the disservice done to Mark Strong in terms of character scripting the better.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the flick is probably meant to be seen as a caper and plays out as one. Ritchie (like many others) probably wants to do a Bond movie. So he's indulged himself here with many elements that are a mark of that franchise. About Robert Downey Jr. then. His turn here is in keeping with all the above. The rapport he establishes with Law is the pillar of the film and is testimony to the skill of the actors. No matter how askew his take on a trait of the ace detective, the performance never loses credibility and most importantly, isn't an all- revealing act. It feels as if he has restrained himself and that leaves him with a lot in terms of options to exercise in the forthcoming films. I think he can build upon this if the possibility of a series were to emerge (as such a second is a given).<br/><br/>And do remain seated for the exquisitely well crafted credits."

","Sherlock Holmes as imagined by Guy Ritchie, is not the Sherlock Holmes of Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett. Downey brings a certain punkiness to the role which somehow I had never imagined Holmes to be capable of. Yes I know he was a morphine smoking junkie, but dash it sir, he was a classy one! I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, but it was all just a little frenetic for someone brought up on a more cerebral imagining of the great crime solver. Some of the geography left a little to be desired too. I mean they go into the sewers beneath the Houses of Parliament and pop up in no time at all, next to a half built Tower Bridge¬Ö.several miles away to the east along the Thames. Hmmmm¬Ö¬Ö.. curious my dear fellow.<br/><br/>The story involves some confection of Hellfire Club type sacrifices of young women, dastardly noblemen and a plot to take over the British Empire. Or something. It's really not that important. The costumes are pretty, the acting smart and the movie is entertaining, in a Friday Night Fluff kind of way ‚Äì in fact it's probably the best Friday Night Fluff I've seen in a year. Rachel McAdams is a beautiful Irene Adler and Jude Law is excellent at bringing some pith to Watson. It's a chance for any number of British character actors to pop up and earn a few bob, including James Fox, Geraldine James and the quite wonderful Eddie Marsan as poor old leaden footed Inspector Lestrade (Marsan was last seen as the vitriolic driving instructor in Happy Go Lucky.) <br/><br/>No, what annoyed me just a little was some of the rather cartoonish CGI. There were just too many places where it was obvious we were looking at a computer image, which in this day and age I find really inexcusable. And some of the studio scenes which were supposed to be outside were very badly lit, making it quite obvious that the action was taking place indoors. Perhaps I'm being a little pedantic, but if you are going to use CGI instead of real locations or studio sets, make it seamless, and if you are using studio sets get the lighting right. Thanks!"

Now let me get serious and say they make science very unrealistic in this film. For intense the taser mechanism he used. I don't believe that's how static what have you works in real life. I'm no scientist, but come on it would not have sent that guy flying across the room like that. I want to be shocked as much as the next guy does and maybe be drugged by a girl again and again until I get it through my head that maybe this woman is just not worth it. I probably won't end up naked with a tiny pillow covering my no-no's that's right Robert I said it was a tiny pillow you had. You also put a scene where it looks like the character ""dies"" only for him to walk out fine and alive in the next scene. STOP toying with your audience and thinking that anyone would believe that someone died because I don't think anyone really does in this film and for that I say that you suck. Also cults and Magic was never a thing in Sherlock lore. I don't like this film and take this hard if you catch my drift because I know my father watched the shows and read the books from this well known character. Never see this!"

","Wildly clever and wonderfully entertaining, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes surpasses all expectations I had for the film, and takes a place as one of my favorite mysteries of the decade. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law play Holmes and Watson, and both do so with great ease. Downey Jr. is by far the greatest standout in the film, truly capturing the mind of the character, while also giving him some much needed human qualities. Rachel McAdams also gives a grand performance as Irene Adler, and is certainly a character I will be hoping to see in future sequels. The film is quite enjoyable, with the pacing never seeming too slow, and the story keeping together quite well, despite some hard-to-follow attempts of showing certain events all the way through. The music in the film truly adds to the atmosphere and is quite delightful, as well as the costumes and set pieces throughout. Mark Strong's character of Lord Blackwood does seem a bit overdone at times, but it's all in good fun for a truly engaging and delightful mystery. In the end, Sherlock Holmes is one of the most enjoyable mysteries I have seen in quite a while, and I will be looking forward to what this duo uncovers next.

"akcenat","8","1","1","30 November 2019"," Good makeover on of Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"", it's not an amazing film, but it was pretty good one
","Director Guy Ritchie has tried to include something for everybody in the film - occult conspiracies, brutal fist-fights, a pretty face (or two) thrown in for good measure and you have all the ingredients for a fine non-summer blockbuster. Hans Zimmer's quirky score keeps the action moving along, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot's seductively dark cinematography gives London a Gothic atmosphere and the sets & costumes are all nicely stylized. Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are great fun together, Mark Strong is a suitably evil villain and even though the story has its flaws (for me, especially in a Dr. Watson fiancee Mary - Kelly Reilly) it is entertaining enough to fill the void between elaborate action sequences. However, it's at least 30 minutes too long and the film drags noticeably when Holmes and Watson aren't on screen together. At the end, ""Sherlock Holmes"" still was an enjoyable adventure and a worthy reboot of the franchise. As such it is a case that it is basically visual entertainment with action and quirky humor but for those who want more will find the convoluted mess of a story lacking. At the end, It's a rapidly paced and funny Victoriana adventure popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 8-"

Robert Downey Jr. is obviously a great actor and does a great job at portraying the beloved detective. He seems to really put an emphasis on the crazy side of Sherlock here as opposed to the more chill Benedict Cumberbatch (this may have something to do with the makeup and costuming). The writing and Downey together create a character that blends very well with Rachel McAdams' character and creates an oddly satisfying relationship. I appreciate how Jude Law's Watson is portrayed as his own person and not just as Sherlock's sidekick. The violence seems unnecessary but at least the fast camera during makes for exciting moments. The villain is mediocre and the music is the fun late 1800s tunes that contrast with the more serious low and slow tunes at other points. Overall enjoyable, especially if you like Robert Downey Jr."
"anselmdaniel","8","1","1","13 April 2019"," A strange working fit
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 action mystery movie. The film is based off of the Sherlock Holmes character written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson respectively. Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson are hired to foil a mystic plot in London.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is an incredibly fun movie. This movie has an electric style of editing and directing which makes the movie fast-paced and exciting. This Sherlock Holmes rendition has a different more youthful approach to the Sherlock Holmes character than other renditions of the character. This character has activities that the audience would not typically associate with Sherlock Holmes. One of these activities is boxing. It is crazy to think that this actually works in the movie's favor. The movie is able to portray the quirkiness and methodical nature of Sherlock Holmes' across all of the actions that he does.<br/><br/>The actual mystery in this movie can feel overly-convoluted. Since this movie is a Sherlock Holmes mystery, this movie had to have some grand mystery and reveal. The movie has a grand reveal but it felt like the movie could have done without a grand reveal. I had a good time with how the movie portrayed the era and characters that the grand mystery was only a small plus for me. I could have easily enjoyed the movie without the convoluted plot.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is grounded and is excellent. Once it was shown that Sherlock is a brawler, there was an expectation that the movie could have exciting fist fights. The movie meets this expectation and has great Victorian era fighting scenes. These scenes are bolstered by Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.<br/><br/>The acting across the cast is great. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the leading roles do an awesome job. The main villain of Lord Henry Blackwood played by Mark Strong does a compelling job. Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler plays her role perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie does have the fault of not being a stand-out movie. The scenes here do not excel at any one component but it does make the movie immensely watchable. The movie has no terrible scenes, but it does not have the greatest scenes either.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Sherlock Holmes.' This is a solid action mystery movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","27 December 2009. Downey and Jude Law bring an uneasy but fascinating chemistry to this crime-solving duo along with some finely crafted musical background and some powerful and compelling action scenes. The haunting and mysterious supernatural events hang ominously through out this movie bringing even more suspense and tension. The only apparent weaknesses are some of the fighting scenes which unlike BOURNE IDENTITY seem to be distractive and confusing rather than compellingly inviting and some difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue, SHERLOCK HOLMES is nicely editing with good pacing and some attractive and densely layered set designs. Overall, this movie is nicely balanced with a solid script with good explanations where necessary, little or no lose ends (except for the sequel) and is weighted with good emotional weight making this movie much more intellectually and qualitatively satisfying."
"bbinningokc","8","1","1","11 July 2018"," Entertaining
","This was a very entertaining movie. Being a Sherlock Holmes fan, I have read all the original books. This is the closest depiction of the original character I have seen. It is however, more exaggerated towards action. All the other movies and depictions have zero physical prowess for Holmes. In the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, Holmes is portrayed as an expert boxer, fencer and an expert with the singlestick or cudgel. He was also portrayed as a physically strong person in the original books.<br/><br/>I also liked how the movie was current with the technology of the day. The first voice transmission using radio waves was in 1900 and 1901 by 2 different independent people. I would expect that in the late 1800's of the movie, a binary on/off use of radio waves would be a first step.<br/><br/>This character is also shown as more disheveled with his apartment and his person. This is also more in tune with the original books. <br/><br/> I do like the old Basil Rathbone movies made in the 40's as well as most of the other portrayals (Benedict Cumberbatch series). However, they do not fully portray the full breadth of the character in the original books. Unfortunately, the pseudo intellectuals, who have obviously never read the original books, use the old movies and current shows as the guide line. They give this move a ""1"" because it is ""Not like the original character"" or the tech is beyond tech of the day. In reality they wanted ""Jane Austin"" or colorized version of the old Basil Rathbone movies. What they got Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on steroids.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a more action version closer to the original books (although exaggerated) this movie is for you."

","I did not hold any expectations while watching this as I had heard many composite responses. Going in I felt this was going to be a LONG 2 hr film with no real substance. I walked away more than pleasantly surprised the film was directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Joel Silver (Die Hard, Lethal Weapon), Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey, and Dan Lin. The adapted and brilliantly written screenplay, by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg, was developed from a story by Wigram and Johnson.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson respectively Law is clever, uniquely compelling to that of Downey's prowess as Holmes. Downey's performance showcases his diverse ability to delve into a character and make it his own.. Set in 1890, eccentric detective Holmes and his companion Watson are hired by a secret society to foil a mystic and warlock style craft of magic, a sinister plot to expand the British Empire by seemingly supernatural and dark means. Rachel McAdams stars as their former adversary Irene Adler and comes across feminine nut strong for the time of the century. Mark Strong portrays villain Lord Henry Blackwood methodically and conceptually dark, almost with a devious and mystic presence. <br/><br/>I thought the concept of the film brought a different style and approach to the legendary Scotland Yard investigator. It was well paced, and drove the characters nicely following the plot. I give it a 7/10"

The plot is decent, if a little shallow, and is aided by a smart and witty script.<br/><br/>The best part of this film for me though is the first class cinematography and production value. Everything looks so classy and expensive and I've never seen London look as good as it does in this film. Honestly, this film is worth watching for the visuals alone.

The good chemistry between Downey and Law is a joy throughout. There is something tragi-comically Withnail and I about them so, if Withnail floats your boat, this may be the Holmes for you.
The use of CGI is not overbearing and creates a very credible Holmesian London.
The supporting actors are, without exception, excellent; special credit to Mark Strong, Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, Geraldine James and Kelly Reilly.
It has now become one of the films I can watch over and over; as comforting as the crackle from the hearth on a winter day.

"HotToastyRag","4","1","1","13 December 2017"," A little too modern
","While there have been countless film and television portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson, the whodunnit genre is never one that audiences tire of, so why not continue to make them? Robert Downey Jr. stars as the famed literary detective, with Jude Law at his side. When I first heard of this film's production, I learned the cast and thought, ""Oh, Jude Law will make a great Sherlock Holmes!"" But, as is sometimes the case, Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg's script wrote Holmes to be the eccentric one with Watson as the straight man. Thus, Jude Law took second billing and saved his talent for later.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. already proved his flawless British accent in Chaplin, so it's no stretch to see him blend into his surroundings. However, he's one of those love-him-or-leave-him actors, and this movie probably won't change the opinion you already have of him. If you think he's talented, handsome, and funny, you'll like Sherlock Holmes. If you think he's overrated and emits an ego larger than his talent, you won't like it.<br/><br/>Director Guy Ritchie added an extra technical difference to his film, one that's also a love-it-or-leave-it feature. In the many action scenes throughout the film-this isn't a wordy mystery, it's an action-comedy-the footage is slowed down at random moments, showing details that would normally be impossible to spot. Someone throws a punch, and the camera shows the ripple of skin when contact is made, the expectorate from the injured man's mouth, and the low groan of pain to coincide with the slowed down footage. I found it a little too modern and jarring; I would have preferred every aspect to fit with the time period."

"EthanBJones_03","7","1","1","23 May 2017"," Fun Guy Ritchie nonsense and I love it; Would Recommend
","'Sherlock Holmes' was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law and Mark Strong. It is the story of world famous British icon, Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr) and his equally famous sidekick, Dr Jon Watson(Jude Law) who go on the hunt of the mysterious dark wizard, Lord Blackwood(Mark Strong). It is up to Holmes and co to solve this dark villain's plan before it's too late, and he has the entire of London under his spell.<br/><br/>This movie is weird. I can't explain specifically why I like this movie, I just do. It's fun, it's weird and it's full of ye olde Guy Ritchie-isms so what's not to love? The story was engaging, the characters are classical but done justice and it's a Guy Ritchie movie. The action is, of course, Guy Ritchie. The dialogue is, of course, Guy Ritchie. This movie contains more Guy Ritchie than his birth certificate. It's a well though out movie and I do recommend you see if because you'll probably get a kick or two out of it.<br/><br/>The story, for starters, is very engaging and contains a classical Sherlock Holmes-esc mystery. Of course you only watch a good 'ol mystery for the grand reveal(and this is no exception) but it provides you with a fun, interesting and unique example of Holmes' classic array of stories. I will say that some parts of the movie(for example 'Teleportation' were explained about as well as a gorilla trying to teach someone how not to get shot(too soon?). This movie is also made to setup a sequel(which I'm fine with) but I feel they took too much time focusing on setting up that sequel than they did focusing on the movie. <br/><br/>Robert 'The Drug Addiction'(Still love ya Robert) Downey Jr was pretty good as the titular character but he did come of as a tad too comical at points which I suppose fit the character but came off as a little forced and weird. Jude Law was fine as Watson and I can tell he relished in this role. Mark Strong was fine as Lord Blackwood but I think that his character only showed up at random intervals in the plot and merely served as a way to progress the plot along. Rachel McAdams was fine as Irene Adler. <br/><br/>Technically speaking, this is a Guy Ritchie movie and is primarily style over substance. That is completely fine in this movie and it is stylistically beautiful. The costume design was great(as was the set design) and looked realistic considering the time period this movie was set in. The cinematography in this movie was very good as per Guy Ritchie fashion and everything part of it screams Ritchie. <br/><br/>The action in this movie was pretty good but it did become a tad bit repetitive, especially considering it was the same hand-to-hand combat consistently. Not to say that the slo-mo sections of it were very well done and looked just awesome. The humour worked well but I think that is just down to Downey's charisma and less down to the 'Oscar Worthy' writing. <br/><br/>The actual 'Sherlock Holmes' theme of this movie was excellent and very enjoyable. The other uses of music paled in comparison and didn't work too well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you can handle enough Guy Ritchie to paralyse an elephant then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's got fun(sometimes bland) action, witty humour and is all around a good time. It is definitely more stylistic than substance which is fine and shouldn't bother many people but I do understand if it does. I do recommend this movie and I think it's a good re-imagining of this character.<br/><br/>7/10"
"YuunofYork","5","1","1","16 December 2016"," Flashy but empty first chapter in an otherwise promising franchise
","Guy Ritchie projects are never boring, but they do sometimes get lost. It was perhaps inevitable tackling such beloved material as this would generate mixed reviews, which is probably why his Sherlock Holmes effort seems to be for everyone and no one. Despite being alternately labeled schlocky fantasy or witty caper, the film attempts to cater to every possible expectation. Everyone, that is, who doesn't have a preconceived notion of what the Arthur Conan Doyle stories are - which is, again, everyone. And there's the rub.<br/><br/>If this is big, dumb action, then I have seen far larger and dumber. Other than short, Ritchified segments of Holmes' one-on-one deductive boxing (always shown twice, first deconstructed and then in real-time), the rest of the action is all set pieces. Well-executed set pieces at that, but not memorable ones. Still, they are coherent and well-choreographed, and usually peppered with enough broad humor to get you through it. It's a far cry from either Michael Mann point-and-shoot-outs or Michael Bay visual noise. No, in terms of its action sequences, audiences seem to have more of a problem which movie they're showing up in than anything else. The thing is it is perhaps not quite the departure it seems, as the Holmes character's association with underground boxing or ability to handle himself in a fight has certainly been implied before, just not this heroically, and never on screen.<br/><br/>If punching a given quota of man-meat is the price of getting films made today, the flip side in any Holmes adaptation has to be the cerebral unraveling of a mystery, or what is at least a mystery to the reader/audience. This is where Ritchie's film falls short. In a throwaway story that only serves as a springboard for the next (and better) chapter, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the manipulative Lord Blackwood (Strong) and his (obviously pseudo) supernatural aura of fear attempt a coup of merry old England as Watson (Law) prepares to leave Baker Street for a stabler relationship with a woman we never really meet for more than two lines. It also somehow involves murders, a dwarf, a Francophone giant, a secret society - and well, there I've nodded off again. It's weak stuff; there is not yet a Mycroft or a Moriarty in this story, except by weak acknowledgment, and only Irene Adler's (Rachel McAdams) interest in Blackwood offers any other level to what is essentially a non-mystery. It isn't merely unsatisfying, but morally, inherently wrong that the audience should discover the solution before Holmes does, but that is what happens here. It would be refreshing and too much to hope for if an action film could be produced without the fate of civilization hanging in the balance. Do producers really think audiences worry themselves with the global Realpolitik in their fictional enterprises? The only real positive is it isn't another boring origin story.<br/><br/>Where then, is the film's intelligence I alluded to earlier? It's in the dialogue. I'm not sure whichever one of the five writers working on this project we have to thank for that, but there are some real Sherlockian gems lurking in these lines, to repeat any of which would better constitute a spoiler than the limpid Blackwood plot. I've no doubt each and every one went over the heads of the holiday audience the trailer was marketed to.<br/><br/>The film's humor is in no small part possible but for Robert Downey Jr.'s transformative performance. It may not be the man we're used to, but he inhabits Holmes, proving his talent with some difficult lines, an extinct (if less than perfectly rendered) accent, and double-act with Law, with whom he shares a gift for comedy neither actor really gets to use often enough. The only criticism I have with RDJ's representation is, like the film, it's a bit kitchen-sinky. There is Holmes the neurotic, Holmes the sociopath, Holmes the emotional, Holmes the distant, Holmes the brilliant, Holmes the boxer, and he's intent on capturing them all like so many Pokemon.<br/><br/>Even the sets are middling. A certain ambiance is created through restriction of color to dull greys, whites, and browns, but that shouldn't have generated a nomination for art direction, should it? With static backgrounds consistently out of proportion to anyone standing outside another building and an aura of cleanliness no one would associate with smoggy, grimy 1890 London (or 1891? newspapers read each), I think people are too quick to praise.<br/><br/>I'm not sure therefore who this film can actually succeed in pleasing. It's a prelude of a commercial piece, one its creators certainly hoped would become a franchise, aimed as such at conglomerating every possible portrayal of a Sherlock Holmes story into the same movie. I'm unsympathetic to its most commonly-heard critiques (yes, actually Irene Adler was from New Jersey in the book, no, actually there is real wit here, but you have to pay attention to the mumbling on either side of the big set pieces to find it), but at the same time I'm conscious of its mediocrity. The whole thing is temporarily fun, but it has a lasting silliness. 5/10, but with the promise of things to come."

","Sherlock Holmes is a detective done many many times, but not in such an action orientated way, until now. Yes Guy Ritchie throws us into Victorian London and all the dark alleys you can bare for one movie, he not only creates a detective story but also makes Sherlock Holmes a dirty fighter as well. For me this movie was well kind of disappointing, I mean don't get me wrong this movie is not bad and I'd never tell someone to not watch it but it feels mediocre and just like a typically made movie full of action but the bad thing about all that action is it tries to divert you away from the poor parts of this movie. <br/><br/>Our story see's Holmes living in 1891 and he is of course working with his as ever present partner Dr. John Watson who is also his closest friend(if you could say he indeed really has any). The story revolves around a plot to basically take over the British Empire with supposed black magic; yes this is truly some supervillain stuff going on. Holmes is portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr. who makes Holmes kind of seem a little mad, I mean through his mumblings you can barely make out what he says but I did feel RDJ was OK and right for the role too. Jude Law is Watson and again he is OK but my main problem with both Holmes and Watson together is they really lack any chemistry when on screen, I felt when they were apart they were better as characters and although the odd joke works well between them, all in all it is fairly poor. <br/><br/>I liked but also disliked Guy Ritchie I mean he knows how to get this movie done, he churns out a movie that just goes over 2 hours and manages to at least make it bearable and not exactly boring. My main dislike is though that he throws into your face a kind of overly smart feeling, he wants Holmes to look smart and cool but for me he just doesn't feel that cool, sure the action scenes look good but as a character I disliked a lot of the lines given to RDJ where he is trying to make Sherlock look smart or funny. The ending is the best part of the movie; it is exciting at least and contains moments that make this slightly more enjoyable. The start is the slowest part of this and it feels like it takes a little too long to truly kick in with the pace it truly wants to go at. <br/><br/>What can be said is actually really good about this? ,well actually it has it's fine moments, the score by Hans Zimmer is nicely done and really sets the scenes well, one of the more memorable things contained in this. I enjoyed the Victorian setting as it looks nice and the sets and also to mention the costumes looks great, I respect Ritchie for getting the overall vibe right, dark when it wants to be but not always. I will say though this movie does feel like a Hollywood action movie shoved into a bottle and relabelled as Sherlock Holmes, it never quite gets it right I felt and yet again as I say people can enjoy this, for me it just didn't work though.<br/><br/>It's an average movie that lacks substance and also any refreshing new ideas that could have made this really quite great. The problems don't amount too a lot I mean this just amounts to a movie that is underwhelming but not exactly bad though, in fact it's not even poor in my opinion. One thing to say is that a certain person who I won't mention for spoiler reasons who is basically the bad person in this is really good and the person playing them plays a great villain's job, kind of ruined though by the overall plot. I think what it had to do was create a movie that didn't feel stale and also didn't have to divert the viewers attention from the under lying story with thrills and big fight scenes, I see why Ritchie did it though because I feel it worked."
"StevePulaski","7","1","1","17 May 2012"," Watch out Watson, that pitfall over there is littered with unfocusedness
","Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a well-mannered and fairly acceptable revival to a mystery character as old as time itself. His name has been associated with sarcastic remarks, among other things, and it seems that between two Hollywood movies and the BBC program that the character has waltzed his way back into the mainstream eye. It always seemed to me that the character of Sherlock Holmes was more of a hipster phenomenon rather than a mainstream one. The film manages to keep the look and feel of an ""inside joke,"" but unfortunately, can't escape its oppressive Hollywood weight.<br/><br/>Let's the start with the premise; It's 1891, and in the beginning, Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) chase down Lord Blackwood (Strong) so as to prevent a harsh ritual, wind up stopping him, and have him arrested, to learn three months later that he is dead. Watson looks forward to escaping the mundane town to marry his love Mary Morstan (Reilly) and leave Holmes to fend for himself. It isn't until Holmes is greeted by Rachel McAdams's Irene Adler, who tells him to search for a missing man named Luke Reordan, who is apparently the main puzzle piece to Blackwood's future plans.<br/><br/>The first problem is the central storyline, which isn't very gripping or involving, rather than just acting as a storytelling device. A plot to have one if you will. It's tolerable, but at times, it seems singled out by Hans Zimmer's extravagant music and overshadowed by the chemistry of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. One could easily become more entranced with character relationships and bantered wit much more than the filler storyline.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make an impeccable duo, as brazen and as enjoyable as ever. Quite possibly the best actors to ever portray these characters. Downey is a superb actor for the roll, brash and unapologetic in his words and intellect, while Law portrays Watson as a more subtle figure in Holmes' cross-hairs. The comic possibilities of the screenplay are explored in a divine form, making way for a lot of button-pushing and world play to come into great effect. Their banter is undoubtedly the most fun thing in the film, and both characters have ignitable chemistry and presence on screen.<br/><br/>As far as set designs work, Philippe Rousselot's ravishing cinematography, most of the time, works in the film's favor. Once in a while, it seems the backgrounds were more of the central concerns than the writing or tone, but it still comes off as fun and pleasant, without being too hard on the eyes or even heavy-handed and misguided.<br/><br/>For me, Sherlock Holmes was a tad thin and vacuous. Ritchie's direction is great, the chemistry between the cast is welcomed and unforced, and the cinematography and music all of likable quality, but the film's storyline is a tad too unfocused and dry, and the redundancy of the look and feel for over two hours becomes a little hard to digest. I'm not entirely sure what fans will think of it. The mystery aspect seems a little flushed out in favor of other things, which I believe was one of the best things in the original series and shorts, and Hollywood has yet again taken a perfectly capable idea and manipulated it to the point where repetition and familiarity comes into play before anything in the film does.<br/><br/>Starring: Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, and Kelly Reilly. Directed by: Guy Ritchie."
"jameskelvin","9","1","1","28 March 2012"," Modern Version of Sherlock Holmes works well!
","Robert Downey, Jr. IS Sherlock Holmes, and he NAILS this role down cold. The film deals with the supernatural Lord Blackwood, who is at the beginning of the film arrested by Sherlock Holmes whilst performing a human sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to death and hung. The following day, Lord Blackwood rises from the grave and puts into motion a plan that will completely warp the fabric of life as we know it, and it is up to Sherlock Holmes to stop him, alongside his legendary sidekick, Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law.<br/><br/>The film is less of a mystery and more about the ride, which might disappoint a few fans of the famed detective, but it's what I enjoyed so much more about this adaptation than previous adaptations of this classic character. The film does have a mystery, but rather than giving the audience the hints and clues throughout the film to try and let us solve the mystery alongside Holmes, we literally see and hear Holmes's thoughts as they're happening and we go along with him as the audience as he solves the mystery; this really comes through in the scene where Holmes pummels a Big Guy whilst in an underground street fight.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is very different than the trailers. The trailers paint it as a stupid amusement park ride made up of cheap thrills and explosions, while it has some fun action sequences, this is not a correct portrait. In actuality, this film had some thought behind the creation of the story. The script was filled with highly clever dialogue, and the witty banter between Holmes and Watson was hilarious, not to mention the chemistry between Downey, Jr. and Jude Law attributing to the success. Then, the villain, Lord Blackwood, is the first badguy I've seen in a longtime that legitimately creeped me out. Blackwood was mysterious and evil, being given that all-evil moment that I am always looking for out of a villain when he makes a man spontaneously combust! The only weak link to this film is Rachel McAdams. She just doesn't really work in her role as Holmes's love interest, Irene Adler, although her character does allow to set-up a potential sequel. Also, the action in the film is fairly generic, never having that memorable action sequence that would allow one to put this film alongside movies like Star Wars or Indiana Jones, even though all of the action sequences are fun, entertaining, and extremely well-done, even if they aren't highly original.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is an extremely fun time at the movies. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are great together, and I hope to see a few sequels."
"riley-jason92","6","1","1","25 February 2012"," Good film
","Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ""Holmes and Watson"". Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.<br/><br/>What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Of course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the ""good"" guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills."
"sjfelter","9","1","1","31 January 2012"," Characters, Graphics, Rating
","The characters in this film were chosen well. Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes was the best choice of all possible actors. His ability to act with a minor sense of schizophrenia really helped set the character of Sherlock Holmes aside from the rest. As for Jude Law playing Watson, bravo for being able to pull off the role of best friend and colleague and keeping the two separate enough to not interfere with work but also allow for the work to be more productive because they know each other on a personal level and know how the other thinks. Rachel McAdams was a wonderful choice in actress for playing the role of Irene Adler because she has been featured in films that make her out to be slightly promiscuous, which helped immensely for this film. She is also very convincing as a ""double agent"". <br/><br/>The film is rated PG-13 for one scene of suggestive material as well as violence. I'd say this is an adequate rating due to all the gunfights that occur throughout the film. I would recommend watching it before you let small children view the film, but anyone over the age of 11 or 12 should be able to handle the film in it's entirety. <br/><br/>The graphics in the film are superb. There is nothing that seems to be too obvious that it may be a green screen, nothing that takes away from the illusions the movie creates. They did a wonderful job making it seem so realistic. Scenes in which the entire set blows up are wonderfully directed and filmed. It also helps that the actors/actresses they have chosen to be in the film did a phenomenal job at acting like they were really happening directly behind them and beside them."
"Tweekums","8","1","1","23 January 2012"," An action packed and funny take on the Sherlock Holmes story
","Having recently enjoyed the BBC series 'Sherlock' I thought it was a good time to watch this film adaptation; it is safe to say they are very different! Here Sherlock is a man of action just as much as he is an intellectual. Set in the traditional Victorian era the film opens with Sherlock and his friend Doctor Watson capturing Lord Blackwood, the killer of five women; given his crime it is no surprise that he is hanged; indeed his death is certified by Watson√Ç‚Ä¶ this makes it all the more intriguing when he is reported to have risen from the grave! In the adventure that follows Holmes and Watson must figure out what Blackwood's ultimate aim is and then prevent him from achieving it in order to save the country. The situation is made even more confused by the arrival of Irene Adler, an old acquaintance of Holmes who is now in the employment of the man destined to become Holmes greatest foe.<br/><br/>This film took things far less seriously than the television series but that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining; in fact it was a romp from start to finish. The action was impressive with Holmes and Watson getting in numerous scrapes and narrowly surviving an explosion and death at the hands of an enormous Frenchman! Robert Downey Jr. puts in a fine performance as Holmes, Jude Law is equally good as Watson and Mark Strong is suitably menacing as the evil Lord Blackwood. It is nice to see director Guy Richie moving away from his regular gangster films as he has brought something new to Holmes and made a film that is exciting, amusing and suitably for adults and all but the youngest children."

The film also gives you an insight about who the bad guy is in the sequel. Professor James Moriarty. This film will make you jump, laugh and give you all the action you would want, but does not lose the amazing part when Sherlock figures it all out, terrifically fast, at the end!

"The-Sarkologist","9","1","1","14 January 2012"," Truly captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes
","Well I must admit that while I have not really been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, I am a big fan of this movie. In fact movies like this have a tendency to make you rethink your prejudices in relation to the stories that they are based on. This is not always the case though, since despite liking the X-men movies, I really did not like the comics, and though I did buy a couple of graphic novels, I ended up giving them away pretty quickly.<br/><br/>After watching this film for probably the fifth time, I decided to see how true to form Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes was, and a little research suggested that while not necessarily identical, he has remain pretty faithful to the original character. Many of us consider (or at least I did) Sherlock Holmes as being a very prim and proper and upstanding type of character, to be blunt, a bore. That is how I seem to find most of the detective characters in detective books that I have encountered. Okay, Sam Spade is not exactly the type of guy that the average father would appreciate his daughter bringing home, but then again, neither is Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Holmes is a driven man, but not driven by any specific purpose. He is a brilliant logical and deductive mind, and he is only content when this deductive mind is put to work. In the books, if he is between cases, he resorts to cocaine to keep his mind stimulated. This is brought out really well in the film, particularly in the fight scenes were you see him work through all of the actions that he needs to take to win the fight, and win he inevitably does. One of my favourite lines in this film is when he punches some guy in the ribs and says 'discombobulate' (whatever that means).<br/><br/>This movie has had an awful lot of thought put into it, and Robert Downey Junior simply seems to suit the character of Holmes. In fact, upon coming to this film and seeing the dark shadow of Sherlock Holmes running and jumping through the streets of London to stop Lord Blackwood from committing his crimes simply created a much darker and more mysterious character than I would have expected. Of course there is also the little touch where Holmes plays the violin, but without the bow. In the books it is suggested that Holmes does play the violin, but to our mind, we expect him to use the bow.<br/><br/>One of the other things in this film is the struggle between mysticism and science. Holmes is clearly a very logical and scientific person. Everything must have an explanation, and that explanation will become apparent through one's investigations. Holmes is able to pick up the smallest clues, link them together, and in most cases, reach the correct conclusion. Not always, as can be seen when he gets his reading of Mary partially wrong, but mostly. Dr Watson is the clear contrast to Sherlock Holmes. He is a very prim and proper figure, a member of the intellectual elite (he is a doctor), and is Holmes only friend. However, while he is loyal to Holmes, he also wants to live the proper life, that is get married, and this does create tension between the two. Of the other characters, there is Inspector LeStrade, who, I suspect, is a bumbling idiot who pretty much can attribute his success to hanging off of Holme's coat tails."
"mm-39","7","1","1","29 December 2011"," Not a bad movie!
","My wife wanted to see Sherlock Holmes and we just missed seeing the movie in the theater. My wife wants to see part two that is in the theater now. Therefore, I bought her part one for Christmas before we see Game of Shadows. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will like the movie. Sherlock Holmes follows the series formula. The script has a supernatural mystery which Holmes is eventually able to solve using his intellect. Holmes logically deducts clues into conclusions. The characters are presented well by the actors and the script and acting melds perfectly. Guy Richie, the directer, interjects comedy and suspense into the movie perfectly creating a good pace for the film. I am happy that we watched part one first for the ending leaves a storyline for part two. I give Sherlock Holmes seven out of ten. Regrettably the movie's trailer gives the film no justice!"
"sddavis63","4","1","1","24 September 2011"," A Definitely Interesting Although Overly Long Take On The Famous Detective
","Highlighting this adaptation of the character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are the performances by the lead actors - Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, respectively. Both were very good and both successfully put their own unique spins on very familiar characters. Downey's Holmes is still a brilliant detective, inexplicably deducing things from the smallest clues available, but in this he's also an action figure, and a fighter, engaging in the public sport of bare knuckle brawling. In short, there's a wee hint of a darker side to the great detective that I've not come across before. Unique though that take on the character may be, I was never really convinced that I liked that take on the character. In some ways it was too unique. You have certain expectations of Sherlock Holmes, and while an action version of the character may be what's needed in a big screen production, it's still a bit jarring. But Downey was excellent in the role. No criticism of him. Law's Watson was also unique. In the stories he's the loyal assistant to Holmes - and sometimes even more brilliant than the detective himself. His brilliance is maintained here, but he's not quite as loyal in this. In fact, he's ready to bail on Holmes; he's engaged and wants out of the partnership; he's ready to move on from the cluttered office he shares with Holmes. There's also more emphasis on Watson's identity as a medical doctor here. Law also worked well in his role, and to me, the differences in the Watson character were less jarring than those in Holmes.<br/><br/>Downey and Law and their characters aside, though, I simply was not taken in by the story, about some secret society and its leader apparently hell bent on taking over first Britain and then the world, using trickery to convince those around them that they possessed some type of supernatural power. The story was long and drawn out, and while interesting at times (and even though it did make effective use of humour throughout) I found it to be inconsistent. I have to say that I was less than enamoured with director Guy Ritchie's repeated use of slow motion to anticipate action moments that were going to happen, only to then repeat those very same action moments in normal time - which dragged this out even more.<br/><br/>In the end, I wasn't really impressed with the movie. Downey and Law I was impressed with, but I found the story to be less than stellar in all honesty. (4/10)"
"kevin-miller447","Null","1","1","14 August 2011"," Sherlock Reborn
","Sherlock Holmes is the ideal problem solver. We have been brought many different versions of Holmes over the decades and he has been reinvented in television and film over and over again to the point of exhaustion. Like many great detectives, he has a keen way of doing things and how he does things are rash at times but always gets the job done. When it was first announced that Robert Downey Jr. would be playing the iconic sly detective, my response was instinctively excited, because we all had out doubts about Tony Stark and look how that turned out. Robert has a certain gift for acting that allows him to read a script and know whether he can make good use of the material and bring out the best of whoever is co- starring with him on the silver screen. Guy Ritchie who's career has had its bumps on the road gives us a stylistic, funny and adventurous Sherlock Holmes in this new adaption of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original sketch of the man with unparalleled technique. Among all of the actors who have portrayed Holmes in the last few decades, Robert Downey Jr. is the first to really bring new light to the character and give us a side of Holmes that is true to who he is in the eyes of everyday Americans. Holmes will encounter a crime scene riddled with unseen clues to the audience's eye, but to Holmes, an entire symphony is playing in is brain as ideas and conclusions slowly twirl around his ego. While the audience is in the dark until the last scene in which all is spilt o the floor like a jug of tipped water, it's still fun to watch Robert in these scenes basking in the glory of his written genius and exposes the evil that cascades over the industrialized city. Jude Law steps into the shoes of Watson, one of the most memorable sidekicks in all of literature. Law brings spunk and truth to the character and shows the audience that despite the character not liking Holmes very much, he is still his best friend and would never leave his side even in the face of death. The friendship that builds on screen no doubt never left the set as the chemistry between the two is spot on and you never doubt these two for a second. The plot of this movie isn't the best nor the worst. The plans for world domination fall into the hands of Mark Strong and a machine that isn't foreign to us in our day and age of technology, but still manages to keep us on the track to a sequel that will more or less be better and upscale the first one. Amy Adams plays a dangerous/mysterious love interest to Holmes who knows him quite well and has no problem in outsmarting him in the simplest of ways yet still slinking to the role of damsel in distress in the last half hour. We also get some pretty brutish fist scenes that incorporate a bit of pre planning with the wit of Holmes and some slow motion that without Snyder's hand at directing feels a bit unneeded, yet satisfyingly shows off Sherlocks hand to hand skills in an over dramatized manner. I own this on blu-ray and yet I can't say that everyone will like this or accept this I guess as a true Sherlock Holmes adaption true to the original scripture translated to script. But I can say, that for those who do like the detective and want to see Sherlock in a new light, that this is definitely worth checking out."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","1","8 July 2011"," Great modernized update of the story and characters, without abandoning its classic themes.
","Being a Guy Ritchie fan will not automatically mean you'll like ""Sherlock Holmes"" but this also goes the other way around. You really don't have to be a Guy Ritchie fan or familiar with his previous work to appreciate this movie! This is really different from any other Guy Ritchie movie really, due to the foremost reason that this movie has an actual multi-million budget behind it. Ritchie is mostly known for his little British crime movies, such as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."". But there is nothing little about this movie though! Of course it still features some typical Ritchie touches in it, which mostly can be seen back in the movie its characters and its humor.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is of course one of the best known characters out of literary history but at the same time it's also one of the most old fashioned ones. He lived in a very typical British time period and he had a very distinctive old fashioned look to him, as well as some old fashioned customs. I can therefore understand the need of updating the character and story, which is something this movie does very well. It makes ""Sherlock Holmes"" a hip modern movie to watch but at the same time it manages to keep all of the things in it that made him such a wonderful and strong character.<br/><br/>And by saying they updated the character I don't necessarily mean that they changed him. The character is actually very close to the one in the books, by Arthur Conan Doyle, which some people don't seem to realize, since they only know the character from the older Sherlock Holmes movies and TV stuff, in which Sherlock Holmes was a way more sophisticated and well mannered person.<br/><br/>It also made Robert Downey Jr. seem like an odd choice to play the titular character but he was perfect for the approach they were taking with this movie and its main character. Same goes for Jude Law really. A pretty boy playing the good old doctor doesn't seem like a logic choice but again, it really suits the approach the movie is taking and besides, Jude Law does a great job with the character. No matter how much you like Peter Cushing or Basil Rathbone in their classic roles as the famous detective, you will also really like Robert Downey Jr., even though he gives a completely different spin on the character.<br/><br/>The movie isn't based on any of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle novels and so is a totally original one, though it's still really consistent- and fits in with the Arthur Conan Doyle stories. It's because it uses all of the classic themes, as well as a sort of supernatural undertone to it, which is something I always liked within a Sherlock Holmes story and movie. No, the story of this movie perhaps isn't that special but it at least provides the movie with plenty of entertainment and fun moments.<br/><br/>Lots of the movie its budget went into its large scale action sequences but also a large portion of it went into the movie its looks. The movie entirely recreates 19th century London, which is all fine looking but also a bit of a distraction at times when the movie pans out or decides to give you a wide shot to show off with what they have achieved. It took me out of the movie sometimes but this is really the biggest complaint I can think off regarding this movie, which should tell you something about how great and fun it is!<br/><br/>I'm actually more excited and anxious about seeing more new Sherlock Holmes movies rather than new James Bond flicks!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"thawedho","8","1","1","27 June 2011"," The Film Takes Numerous Liberties But Doesn't Stray From The True Holmes
","I understand this is supposed to be a movie review, and trust me I'll get there, but first I must uphold the movies integrity. Now, I'm just going to say that this film for lack of a better word surprised me in how accurate the character of Sherlock Holmes was to the novels. I expected the rehashed ""cleaner"" version of Holmes as seen in many of the preceding movie, but this film showed the ACTUAL Holmes that was in the novels. Yes Blackwood was definitely not so much the Blackwood from the books but a combination of Professor Raethe and the character Blackwood, but even so the film highlighted many of the characters true personalities. For instance in The Sign of The Four Holme's states, """"The amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back."" in response to his previous prize-fighting experience. I read numerous reviews from people complaining about this being a movie re-imagined for the ""MTV Age"" but I am going to tell you they did NO such thing, instead they tried to create a movie closer to the original novels. Holmes is described in the novels as a drug using fist fighter, which for the most part he definitely was here. Holmes still has all his cleverness as well making huge deductions out of small things, like the dead mans pocket watch which alludes to a sequence in The Sign of The Four.<br/><br/>Now as a movie alone this is a fantastic film, the art direction helps uphold a sense of mystery that is always ""afoot"" in Holmes novels and helps create that Gothic feel which the Sherlock Holmes series is based off of. The action has great pacing with the plot and isn't constantly tossed in your face yet tastefully applied. The movies casting is spot on and couldn't have been done better, the actors styles mesh greatly together and you gain a true sense of camaraderie that should naturally exist between the characters. I can tell you personally as a movie goer I was constantly on the edge of my seat and never bored which is any movies goal because naturally movies are there to entertain. I was thoroughly impressed with this movie and it's accuracy to the true Holmes that Sir Conan O'Doyle had envisioned."
"barbb1953","8","1","1","23 May 2011"," Surprisingly close to the spirit of Doyle's stories
","Just to get this out of the way first, Doyle's ""Lost World"" got quite a bit of the science (as it was known then) right, but it was terribly inaccurate in many places, for example, a volcano erupting in a sandstone plateau. However, that's what the readers and he envisioned, and he wrote it that way; it worked. The movie in 1925 was even more inaccurate, and really sliced up the book, but Doyle made a cameo in it and by all accounts enjoyed it quite a bit. The point is, the Sherlock Holmes canon should be always treated with deep respect but not absolute veneration; rather, with a spirit that its author might have enjoyed.<br/><br/>This movie, ""Sherlock Holmes,"" gets most of it right:<br/><br/>1. The opening focuses on building the relationship between Holmes and Watson; it may be a sign of the short attention spans of this age that they actually had to resort to a glance between the two when somebody talks about ""brothers."" <br/><br/>2. The visual interpretation of Holmes' thought processes and contrast between that and his later, incomplete verbal explanations is perhaps the most powerful insight I've seen yet into how Sherlock Holmes worked in the stories. It's also extremely well done. Kudos!<br/><br/>3. Direct sampling of many different stories. (***SPOILER FOLLOWS***) To the excellent list here at IMDb, I would add the last scene of Holmes and Adler on the bridge, with the approaching thunderstorm, as a reference to the ending of ""His Last Bow"" (more on this later) ***SPOILER ENDS***)<br/><br/>4. The occasional meanness of Holmes here is not too different from the post-Reichenbach Falls Holmes.<br/><br/>5. ""His Last Bow"" is one of the few stories in the canon told from Holmes' viewpoint, and that is really how this whole story is told, from the viewpoint of the most interesting and complex character. That may have influenced how they ended the film's climactic scene.<br/><br/>What they didn't get right include the fist fight (injuries overall really didn't get that dramatic until after gloves were introduced and boxers could hit harder without risk of hurting themselves; also, Holmes as himself rather than a street character could have only fought in the gentleman's version, not a pit); the lack of that courteous and gentle streak in him that Doyle included; the representation of Victorian London (Andrew Mayhew's description of the slums was effective precisely because most of parts of the town where the action takes place were clean, relatively safe, and decent places full of people well enough off to be able to care about the poor).<br/><br/>However, that representation of London works if you quickly adopt the reference frame that this is a Bizarro version of the setting (as we do in the 2009 version of ""Star Trek""); once that's done, it really is a treat to see how closely they actually stay to the original spirit.<br/><br/>Other treats include: <br/><br/>1. The Jeremy Brett homages, IMO, used in Downey's characterisms and voice.<br/><br/>2. Irene Adler (obviously this one never sang in an opera, but remember...Bizarro London).<br/><br/>3. The bonds and bickering between Holmes and Watson, of the sort that the good doctor would naturally have left out of his reports but which the movie explores in depth.<br/><br/>4. Watson himself (best movie Watson ever!).<br/><br/>5. That last scene, because it is so radically different from the stories and yet so close to them in spirit. It is also awesome."

","Before this movie, Sherlock Holmes was another book. I really never cared for literature or much reading. However, I walked into this movie theater expecting to see just another movie, but it turned out to be my favorite movie I have seen in my life so far. I have always been a fan of mystery and action movies and I like them even more so if they are together. When my parents brought me to this movie I had no idea that I was walking into Robert Downey Jr. showing step-by-step moves to take down his enemy. In the very first minutes, I was at the edge of my seat, waiting impatiently for more. As the movie developed, I enjoyed the sense of comfort of the connection between Downey and Law. They worked very well together. I loved the mystery in this movie and Holmes enhances it by the way he deduces. At the end of the movie, I was aw struck in thinking ""Why did life just stop."" I did not want this movie to end and when I got home, I immediately got on the computer to see when the second one was coming out. I loved the acting, the feel of the city, and the story line to the movie. I loved it so much, that it got me reading the whole series of the ""Sherlock Holmes"" collection. This is just one example on how much the new generation can take so much interest of olden times. It can be enjoyed in many forms, but for this, I am glad it was in a movie.<br/><br/>P.S. Thanks Mom and Dad for taking me to the movies that day. Love you guys."
"danhollow","9","1","1","22 April 2011"," A Great Surprise
","I (like most people) saw the trailer for this movie and saw a great literary character in a ridiculous action flick. I predicted action clich√©s and poor story lines that any idiot could follow, with one clever little twist at the end when Holmes (inevitably) figures it out.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised and exceptionally pleased when I actually saw the movie. Yes, there are a lot of action sequences, but they don't distract too much from the plot, and even they are integrated into this whole new world of Sherlock Holmes. We really see the world as someone like Holmes would see it; with compulsive attention to those little details Holmes is so famous for noticing, everywhere. We understand why he's so hard to work with, and why he spends so little time in the outside world. Every time Holmes opens his mouth, there's a lot of thought put into what he says. A big round of applause goes to Robert Downey Jr., an incredible actor who is finally getting the kind of recognition he deserves. It may be a mainstream role, but you can still see that a lot of work went into his interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. He's quirky, he's odd, he's as antisocial as they come (but Lord knows it's not from shyness), and he's got the fastest mind of any movie character I've ever seen. Walking out of this movie, I was just convinced that Sherlock Holmes was the Greatest Detective in history; that there was no case he could not solve.<br/><br/>Praise also goes to Jude Law as Dr. Watson, but not the bumbling Watson we all think of. Law makes a perfect foil to Downey, both as a character and as an actor. Law is straightforward, a versatile actor, although not quite a great actor. He sticks to formality as a general rule, and tries to make sure everyone else does. He's very professional and thus very marketable. Downey is well known for being unpredictable and a bit crazy, as well as quirky through the nose. We watch him to see how above-and-beyond he'll go. They make a perfect team, on and off screen.<br/><br/>This is an exceptionally entertaining film, and believe me when I say you'll remember the characters and the plot more than the action sequences."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","1","4 February 2011"," Well colour me surprised. Sherlock Holmes is quite good.
","As anyone over say 25 knows Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character renowned for his powers of deduction and reasoning. Funny that anyone under 25 will think Holmes is ""that movie guy who mumbles his lines and does parkour"".<br/><br/>Nevertheless that's what is on display here. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his loyal sidekick Dr Watson (Jude Law) kick-ass and dust for clues all over 18th Century England trying to hunt down a master criminal using only the power of Holmes's massively intuitive melon.<br/><br/>Fortunately there are a lot of things in the movie to deduce, although I think in the scene where they spent many minutes trying to work out how to get away from a band-saw might have been fast tracked by simply hitting the sawblade with a brick. Those things might cut through flesh like butter but they are brittle as a cracker if you hit them on the side.<br/><br/>Moving on...<br/><br/>Early in the piece Holmes and Watson end the reign of terror - and the life - of naughty man Lord Blackwood. Well imagine everyone's surprise when they are asked to solve another case, the case of why Lord Blackwood is back and wreaking havoc all over London with his zany satanic rituals and murderousness.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is Holmes's love interest and apparently somewhat of a master gold-digging criminal herself, for some reason she fascinates Holmes. Maybe it's her rack? As always on these things the detectives don't find themselves on ""a"" case, but ""the"" case. The case takes them through both the darker more sinister areas of London and all the way to the heads of Government - or are those things both the same? Downey Jr is at times hard to hear with his mumbling, but as always he remains interesting. Jude Law solidifies his position as the prettiest male actor still able to achieve some form of street cred (albeit cobblestone streets) and Rachel McAdams runs around wearing big dresses and will no doubt tell interviewers on her next film that she did the film because ""it can't all be about the awards all the time"".<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has never had a bigger budget and although nothing about this film screams All Time great it is a fun movie and moves along at pace. A couple of the setpieces worked very well and a sequence of explosions in particular appeared very dangerous and effectively drew me into the action. After Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels I thought Ritchie had a long career as an A grader ahead of him, then came Snatch which was only a minor notch down, then a couple of howlers. I'm glad he's found his swagger again here and think he deserves a budget that allows him to be more creative, after all if Zack Snyder and M. Night Shamalamadingdong keep getting work based upon a solid debut Ritchie is deserved of a couple more shots - after all the guy put up with Madonna for the better part of a decade as she transitioned from pop star to scary muscleman.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. A fun two hours. I would venture with more action, fistfights and bare chests than the novels!"
"Matt_Layden","7","1","1","21 September 2010"," Holmes Is Actually Quite Good.
","Sherlock Holmes makes it to the big screen with the help of Guy Ritchie with his first real Hollywood film. Robert Downey Jr. is the titled character, this time playing up more of the bad boy attitude. This role is similar to the recent Iron Man films, as both Holmes and Stark are egotistical geniuses with a substance abuse problem. Does life imitate art?<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr brings that same quick wit and attitude that we loved him for in Iron Man to Holmes and he plays of really well with Jude Law. The two have better chemistry than the supposed romantic relationship. The bromance between the two is one of the highlights in the film. Law, as Watson, brings his comedic skills to light as he tries to be the level headed one of the group. Rachel McAdams is the Irene Adler, the only person to get the best of Holmes. She is likable, as always and even though the relationship doesn't match what the boys have, it's still good enough to get a pass by me. <br/><br/>The film is more action oriented than what one would think a Sherlock Holmes film would be. But to my surprise, Holmes in the books did know martial arts. So in a weird way, it fits. I don't know how I feel about the slow motion sequences, but that's just a few technical nit picks here and there that don't really affect the overall story of the film. <br/><br/>Blackwood, the villain, played by the guy who seems to love the evil roles, Mark Strong. He uses black magic to try and get what he wants, something that Holmes doesn't believe in and this truly tests his theories and beliefs. Blackwood is caught at the beginning of the film and sentence to hang, but mysteriously rises from the grave days later. He is out to kill again and Holmes must stop him. <br/><br/>It's popcorn entertainment and exactly the type of performance one would expect from Robert Downey Jr. Ritchie handles the Hollywood budget well and gives us one of his better films as of late. I'm just happy he's not trying to recapture the Lock Stock and Snatch glory days anymore."
"ireneholmes202","10","1","1","11 September 2010"," Elementary My Dear Watson'
","If you went to the cinema anytime from early September last year, no doubt you would have seen the trailer for Guy Ritchie's first film not to be rated 18, Sherlock Holmes staring Robert Downey Jr as the enigmatic Mr Holmes, Jude Law as the faithful Dr Watson and Rachel McAdams as the only woman who has ever beaten Holmes twice, Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes sees our favourite consulting detective and military doctor arrive just in time to save the latest victim of a string of ritualistic murders lead by Lord Blackwood, the only villain not mentioned in the original books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Blackwood who, after being hung and miraculously manages to resurrected makes a plot that becomes a threat to all of England. Using all his knowledge and cunning Holmes must find and stop Blackwood before it's too late.<br/><br/>Downey Jr is simply fantastic in this movie and one which introduced me to his talents and the whole world of Sherlock Holmes. Watching Downey, it's easy to forget that he is actually American with his superb attempt at the English accent that could put native Englishmen to shame. Downey brings a certain charm and charisma that is a far cry from the Deerstalker wearing, pipe smoking stuffy Victorian man the public remember. However, I do have one problem and that's with his pronunciation. As I've already said, Downey is American to play Holmes, at some points I do have to rewind it back and listen again with the subtitles on to work out what he's saying.<br/><br/>Jude Law also brings Watson bang up to date. Gone is the fat baffled man we usually think of, to be replaced by one who can and will get stuck into anything he encounters. In this, we see Watson about to get married to his love interest Mary and it is quite clear that Holmes is finding it hard to let go of his best friend and work colleague.<br/><br/>Jude and Robert's chemistry is phenomenal in this movie, with hints of bromance laced throughout; it's enough to make the all audience feel comfortable without getting too much like Brokeback Mountain.<br/><br/>The Canadian actor Rachel McAdams, best know for her work in Mean Girls, The Notebook and Time Travellers wife, is also brilliant, making her character charming, dangerous and quite alluring at the same time. Men want her and women want to be her and looking at her co-star Robert Downey Jr who wouldn't? She probably had the hardest job as she had very little to go on for a character that had been in the original books.<br/><br/>The best scene involves Holmes fighting in a low end bar to vent out his frustrations using slow motion camera movements where Holmes details exactly how he would beat his opponent with bone crunching results , literally.<br/><br/>Some Sherlock Holmes purists may argue that the film is too far away from the books, but I disagree. If you watch carefully the movie refers to a lot of the detail without being an exact copy. <br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly recommend this movie and can't wait for the sequel that begins filming this autumn."
"psychoartus","Null","1","1","24 July 2010"," This film resembles a CSI version of Sherlock Holmes
","by Marie Abaya<br/><br/>The Last week of 2009 and the theater was pack. It wasn't because of Sherlock Holmes just open but of Avatar. Everyone was lining up to see the new James Cameron film, but Audrey and I had a different film in mind. We have to admit that the line for Avatar look intimating, but the minute we enter the theater for Sherlock Holmes all that just wash away. I don't know the source material that well for Sherlock Holmes. I know growing up that he uses deductive reasoning and forensic to solve cases. He also has a sidekick name Dr. Watson and that they both solve cases together and frankly I'm happy I know so little of these Characters.<br/><br/>This new age film directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Robert Downey, Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as his helpful companion Dr. Watson gives that new fresh smell in a old and forgotten story. I can't entirely get into details on the plot of the film but the basic premise centers around a man name Lord Blackwood coming back from the grave and terrorizing the streets of London. It's up to Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson to figure out what Lord Blackwood is up too and how's he still alive after getting hung.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie style of directing is a hit and miss for this film, at times you feel like you're in 1800's London chasing Lord Blackwood, but there are moments where you feel like you're on a sound stage in a movie studio lot. The one thing that Guy Ritchie succeeds in is the action sequences. The use of Holmes deductive reasoning in scenes that doesn't really call for it made you feel that you're Sherlock Holmes and figuring out ahead of time what's the next step. The story itself is very engaging and the use of flashback to make sense of scenes that wouldn't make sense without was fun and very ""CSI""ish. I say this because the film itself plays out like a CSI episode. You'll get glimpses of items that are only going to make sense at the end of the film. Don't try to figure out the film before it ends, because the things they show you aren't what they seem to be.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. acting in this film can be compared to Johnny Depp's acting in the Pirates in the Caribbean films. He became Sherlock Holmes and you forget that you're actually watching Tony Starks, another Robert Downey Jr. character from Iron Man, and watching at times a disturb but brilliant detective. Jud Law does a flawless job as his loyal sidekick Watson and they both bring a charm to these characters that made you really like them. Another notable performance came from the leading lady Rachel McAdams as Holmes witty and beautiful love interest Irene Adler. She does a fabulous job as the one female character that can stand up against Holmes.<br/><br/>The music from the film was also a wonderful addition. Hans Zimmer again shows why he's one of the top composers in the world.<br/><br/>Overall, this film resembles a CSI version of Sherlock Holmes. The acting is top-notch and if you're a Guy Ritchie fan then this film is for you. It balances the action and humor in scenes that many films are missing today."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","7 July 2010"," The Detective Is Back With A Bang
","The last time when Ritchie attempted something different, the consequences were disastrous. I'm referring to the horrible Madonna starrer 'Swept Away'. Now once again he takes a risk and makes Sherlock Holmes. It is both different and similar to Ritchie's previous works. It's larger, more expensive, more loaded with special effects and set in an older time unlike his current day gangster films. Yet the humour is very Ritchie. The characters also have shades of those from his previous works. Given that there have been numerous adaptations on one of the most famous fictitious character, the director has taken quite a risk but it was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>The execution is stupendous. Right from the visuals, special effects, camera-work, editing, score, lighting, sounds, choreography of action sequences to the performances, everything is top notch. The writing is solid as the story moves at a steady pace. At times it may appear far-fetched but this is wonderfully explained in the end where it is reflected that things were not as they seemed. The dialogues are smooth and witty. The mix of action, humour, drama and suspense is terrific. <br/><br/>Downey Jr. is outstanding as Holmes while Law is superb as his sidekicks. The latter is rather laidback and his performance comes across as very natural. Rachel McAdams pulls off Holmes's seductive classic adversary very effectively and Kelly Reilly is a delight to watch. Mark Strong is menacing as the broody Satanist serial killer.<br/><br/>'Sherlock Holmes' is an energetic thrillride for the eyes, ears and mind. Ritchie has created an entertaining feast for movielovers."

It had a lot of references to the books, but of course thats the only thing what it had common with the books. But no one ever said the movie is based on books, it is based on the main idea and the characters. I really liked the interpretation of those characters, especially the more agile Watson. At the beginning I was thinking, like ""what is this black magic mumbo-jumbo""... But don't worry, i'll get explained eventually. At the end of a movie we are made aware of doctor Moriarty, what hopefully leads as to the sequel soon. Btw I also quite a lot like another movie based loosely on Sherlock Holmes characters: ""Without a Clue"", starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley. That movie is more of a comedy, but a good movie indeed."

","Depicting too many details is a classic Sherlock Holmes trait from the timeless sleuth stories of the infamous detective scribed by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, Director Guy Ritchie took that to an extreme level by ingesting his film adaptation of ""Sherlock Holmes"" with TMI syndrome which caused a severe case of cluttermania to the baffled viewer. The ""Sherlock Holmes"" plot focuses on a deranged Lord Blackwood who has a Gothic sinister plot to rule the world. But Holme don't play that, so it is up to Sherlock and his BFF Dr. Watson to stop the Blackwood Magic Man to cause havoc to England and the rest of the world. Seems like ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" and this worn-out plot formula continues to bring out tears & fears in me. It took a scribe team of five screenwriters to peg the ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie story down. I am no Sherlock Holmes, but that was significant probable cause of the writing offense of the movie. Again, excess is not best. Another piece of evidence that hurt the film was the humdrum performance of Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, a former Sherlock fem conquest who might or might not be betraying the Sherlock. However, not every case was cold in ""Sherlock Holmes"". Robert Downey Jr. was delightfully divine as Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law was efficiently operable as Dr. Watson. Their character chemistry was more than elementary, it was exemplary. The film's cinematography & art direction also got passing grades for their effective ""mise en scene"" to old England. Unfortunately, those positive contributions did not provide sufficient evidence to give some ""pipe dream"" positive recommendation to the overrated & over-hyped ""Sherlock Holmes"". *** Average"

Jude Law is OK but his role is not really necessary.<br/><br/>Bad points: Guy Ritchie's style of directing is confusing and he packs in too much plot detail into every single minute.

Interaction between the leads was strained.<br/><br/>Acting: Robert Downey's speech is unclear and hard to make out. Couldn't understand about half of his dialog. Why didn't they just cast an English man in this role? Story: There are very few funny or witty moments. The trailer is about as funny as it gets. So it is not a comedy at all. The dialog is not very pleasant or entertaining The overall confusion and chaos leaves you unsatisfied. Still don't understand the new crime at the ending. Or the role of the professor.

","Guy Ritchie can do better.<br/><br/>Anyone who watched Rock'n Rolla would be disappointed with his latest effort. Sure, his Holmes if new and gritty and affable enough but where is the darkness of Guy's other movies? This movie can't make up its mind if it's a comedy or a dark fable. Certainly it's not a mystery story which is what one might have expected from a Holmes story.<br/><br/>It's not a love story either. Not quite a fight movie. Not quite a film noir. In fact it's not quite anything really. Frankensteinish in its multi-faceted cleverness, it missed the mark I'm sure Ritchie had in mind when he started.<br/><br/>In short, a big disappointment."

","This is just my opinion, no intention to offend anyone who enjoyed the movie...<br/><br/>***Kept spoilers to a minimum possible***<br/><br/>Developed two hypothesis regarding this movie:<br/><br/>1. Sherlock Holmes is a futuristic cyborg which came from the future to solve a sort-of mystical case which could change the course of history. Here's his special skills:<br/><br/>-Incorporated matrix-like computer with less than 2 Nano-seconds response time (the fight scenes)<br/><br/>-Fire proof skin/fire resistance aura which protects him and his friends for the devastating explosions...(the survival at the butchery)<br/><br/>-Hyper-developed sensors which catch even the most subtle smells, also at least 8x optical zoom incorporated in his eyes (his travel to the occult organization leader, the way he sees the leader's iris from like 5-6 meters away and deduces he's related with someone...won't tell who, and others)<br/><br/>-Titanium skeleton - no matter how beat up he is , he keeps getting back on his feet again<br/><br/>-Huge encyclopedia stored in his brain<br/><br/>2. He is a genetically improved human, created on the same purpose as the first hypothesis. Not only he is improved, but also have a guardian angel which protects him and his close ones by harm.<br/><br/>He looks more like an eccentric action hero out of his time, worthy more of a comic book than a film that pretends to be serious. Seriously, is he meant to be an intelligent detective of the dark ages, or Neo from Matrix? Everything is exaggerated in this movie until the point when it gets ridiculous and ..grose.<br/><br/>About the 'mystic' part of the movie, been there done that, virgin sacrifice, hermetic drawings all seen over and over in so many other movies.<br/><br/>I think it's just a wannabe, a mixture of some other movies, GOOD movies. I can clearly see the resemblance with Prestige, Matrix (fighting scene), Letter from Hell (there sure are others that don't come in my mind right now)- all the three wonderful movies with a strong storyline perfectly fit within the spirit of the times it happens and even innovative ideas in my opinion- and some typical Hollywood-like themes. if you pull out the parts inspired from other movies, nothing really remains - no originality whatsoever, no idea which makes you thinking after you leave the cinema, a pretty childish copy of some more profound movies fitting in this genre.<br/><br/>Gave it a 2 even though I would give it a 4/10 stars normally, but I think now it's too overrated.<br/><br/>Guy Richie should stay within the genre which made him famous on merit, this is a big downside for him. He entered an unfamiliar territory, a ground on which others before him built much much more!"

"Turfseer","4","3","6","12 June 2010"," Basil Rathbone rolls over in his grave with new interpretation of Sherlock Holmes as wacky Bohemian
","Here is the newfangled Sherlock Holmes, courtesy action director Guy Ritchie. Ritchie initially wanted to cast a younger actor for the part of Sherlock Holmes but settled on Robert Downey Jr., after envisioning the new Holmes as a Bohemian artist type. This fit right in with Downey's belief that Holmes is supposed to be ""quirky and kind of nuts"", an interpretation which was suggested to him by his real life wife, Susan Downey. What appealed to Downey about this interpretation of Holmes is ""quirky and kind of nuts"" is the way he views himself! <br/><br/>Now I have no problem with Holmes being depicted as eccentric (which is precisely the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle conceived him) but there was also a certain meticulousness and dignity which Downey runs away from in his interpretation. Start with Downey's unshaved look throughout the picture‚Äîwould the meticulous Holmes allow himself to look so scruffy while everyone else in proper Victorian society is so well manicured? Despite his amazing powers of deductive reasoning and ability to solve cases, Victorian society would never accept a Holmes that refuses to conform to its basic norms. I'm also thinking of the ludicrous opening scene at the Baker Street apartment where Holmes is shooting bullets into the wall in an attempt to develop some kind of early 'silencer'. Can you imagine Basil Rathbone, from the original Sherlock Holmes movies, shooting at the walls and terrorizing his landlady and the other lodgers in the building? <br/><br/>And isn't it beneath Holmes to be so petty in his relationship to his perennial sidekick, Watson? The scene at the restaurant where he brings Watson's fianc√© to tears and causes her to walk out, just seems so out of character for Holmes. Yes, he's supposed to be cold and insensitive at times, but that happens when he becomes absorbed in attempting to solve his cases. It should not apply to a social gathering where he boorishly undermines the relationship between a close colleague and his fianc√©.<br/><br/>The childish interplay between Holmes and Watson goes on for a good two thirds of the movie. I fail to see the humor in such scenes as inside the carriage when Holmes teases Watson by keeping the money he won gambling the night before (Watson of course is an inveterate gambler) and Watson then (tit for tat) throws Holmes' vest outside the carriage window. Both Robert Downey and Jude Law both seem to offer up the same over the top interpretations for Holmes and Watson and I found I couldn't distinguish very well between the two characters. I much prefer the buffoonish Nigel Bruce as Watson opposite Basil Rathbone in those old movies since at least the contrast between the two was evident.<br/><br/>Ritchie's plot runs into a great deal of trouble for the first two thirds of the movie due to slow pacing. There's an attempt to pick things up with a couple of action scenes which grow tiresome. I had no trouble with the early scene of Downey as action hero in the boxing ring which Ritchie claims is derived from the original Sherlock Holmes stories; but then there's a long drawn out sequence where Holmes and Watson battle an evil giant and then end up destroying a ship while in dry dock. Then there's the scene with Irene Adler interacting with a hidden Professor Moriarty; we end up seeing the scene twice since Holmes ends up explaining what he deduces from his confrontation with the evil Professor to Watson.<br/><br/>Nor is the rest of the story very exciting leading to the climax. Reordan, the man Adler has been looking for, turns up dead in Lord Blackwell's coffin, despite Blackwell being hanged earlier for the murder of five women. Then Blackwell murders his father who heads the Temple of the Four Orders.<br/><br/>Finally things begin to pick up when Holmes confronts Home Secretary Lord Coward. In one of the best scenes in the movie, Holmes tricks Coward into revealing that Blackwood and company intend to wipe out all members of the House of Lords. Holmes is initially brought to Coward in handcuffs but it's later revealed that Inspector Lestrade has given Holmes the keys to escape. Lestrade, by the way, reminds me of the excellent late actor, Donald Pleasance, and ably acquits himself in the thankless role of second fiddle to Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>For those sticklers who find all of the evil Blackwell's machinations to be completely implausible (such as how he manages evade detection in staging his own death by hanging), I cannot disagree; however, the film is not supposed to be taken too literally or seriously. Ritchie finally gets things moving at the climax and I liked how Holmes dispatches Blackwell on the under construction Tower Bridge. I'm not so sure however, how Irene Adler survives that fall after Blackwell pushes her off the bridge.<br/><br/>For purists such as myself, the scenes where Holmes uses his deductive reasoning (such as his ability to follow a carriage's path while blindfolded) are quite welcome. Nonetheless, with Robert Downey choosing to play Holmes for a good part of the time as a lout who resembles a drunkard and a completely nondescript Watson who serves up no significant contrasts to his wily colleague, the new Sherlock Holmes lacks the main ingredient that has been found to be offered up by some of its predecessors: charm!"

","MAGNIFICENT.<br/><br/>This is a hugely enjoyable adaption of Sherlock Holmes. Adaptations depart from their originals in movies through necessity - movies don't work like prose so new elements have to be introduced and ineffective ones removed, simple as that. Adaptations should be assessed on their own merits. A good rule of thumb in a re-imagining of an old story is to see how people who don't know the original react and my friend who didn't know much about Holmes thought this film was excellent.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie! Most of the movie's driven by its humour and most of the humour comes from Holmes being wonderfully obnoxious.<br/><br/>Many complaints will be/have been made regarding the new Holmes/Watson dynamic - I think it's hilarious. What would be the point of just re-filming the Brett take? The whole point of doing the same stories/characters again is to find different things and see if they work. I say this version of Holmes works! In fact...<br/><br/>I'm really REALLY impressed with RDJ's and Guy Ritchie's take on Holmes - an OCD maniac with manipulative tendencies, impatient to the point of despair with what he must see as the slowness of those surrounding him, incapable of switching off his brain, never still. RDJ has made a Holmes that is frankly superhuman, not merely an elegant, witty and superbly disciplined intellectual, but some kind of freak that just can't stop analysing everything around him. It's actually more faithful to Conan Doyle's vision than a lot of people are going to give it credit for.<br/><br/>And I'm ANNOYED with people complaining about the extra weight placed on fisticuffs in this movie - Guy Ritchie goes entirely out of his way to include a scene wherein Holmes wins his fight hands down not with superior brawn but with superior *knowledge*. And then has the sense to balance this with that huge French guy later in the movie to show that even Holmes isn't indestructible. The physical violence isn't predictable in this movie, it matters and adds weight and power to the story. It simply isn't comparable to the silly Matrix-styleeee fight scenes that have plagued the movie industry of late! AND they had Irene Adler. And they mentioned Mycroft. AND a certain someone else ""appeared"" who was portrayed very cleverly, oh yes, and oh YES, Mr Ritchie, if THAT'S what he's going to be like, I WILL come to watch your sequel! There's just one quibble. RDJ's Holmes was a teeny bit too cool for Mark Strong's Blackwood to confront convincingly. But never mind. with luck, Guy Ritchie will ramp up the baddie a notch or two in the next instalment... wink, wink, Mr Ritchie..."

","Review<br/><br/>If you want to know what Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is like, imagine ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch"" and then put them in the late 1800s and add Sherlock Holmes. If you are imagining the most kinetic cinematic rendition of ""Sherlock Holmes"" ever, you're probably not far off the mark.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Sherlock Holmes"" doesn't relent too much. It keeps a rapid pace and doesn't quite care if you're not connecting the dots as quickly as Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes with a sort of manic dishevelment. His own living quarters at 221B are a mess but his mind is forever organizing minute details and usually alienating a friend or two in the process.<br/><br/>Watson (Jude Law) is an intelligent sidekick, always feeling obliged to lend a hand or a prognosis. Instead of the typically daft Watson of cinema history, Law plays Watson with a certain cunning and wry humor that a hero like Holmes desperately needs.<br/><br/>The plot of the film seems half baked. It concerns an evil occult leader Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for murdering five women in a sacrificial ritual. When Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave, Holmes is called in to investigate. As is typical in all mysteries, the villain gets away with a bunch of crimes is foiled before he can perpetrate the biggest crime he was intending to commit the whole time. Sorry if I gave away that this film ends with Holmes triumphant.<br/><br/>The real strength of ""Sherlock Holmes"" is its look and energy. The sets are marvelously macabre and Ritchie does a good job synthesizing them with a CGI rendition of 1800s London. The cinematography is energetic but never confuses the action ‚Äì I particularly enjoyed when Sherlock Holmes anticipates his next eight moves in a fight and then executes them with flawless precision. I also liked a scene in a butchery that served as a throwback to the old silent film clich√© of a damsel in distress tied up and being conveyed towards a buzz saw.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams plays Ira Adler, the presumed love interest of Holmes but she seems more like an afterthought; her only real purpose in the film is to give precedent for a sequel. But in the end, if you can just sit back and relax, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is pure popcorn and you'll like it.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>On a scale of one to Casablanca this film is a ""Matrix Reloaded"" (2003).<br/><br/>Rationalization:<br/><br/>Don't enter this movie thinking that by its end you'll come out wiser, or better, or more thoughtful, or with your thoughts provoked. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an action movie with a slight mystery at its center. There are some excellent sequences and great one-liners, but it never instills you with the same terror or wonder that you find in other mysteries like ""Rear Window"" (1954) or ""Se7en"" (1995) but it is way better than most action movies coming out today (i.e. ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" (2009))<br/><br/>http://www.iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/"

","I must admit I did have reservations about the pairing of Downey and Law, and would have preferred a pair who looked more like my and probably many others' perception of what the two should look like. Having said that, I thought both actors did a great job in what was a really entertaining film. I also had reservations that Guy Ritchie might ruin the story by trying to be too flash, but no, it looked great and London looked stunning. My only critical comment would be the fact that Irene got from the Houses of Parliament to Tower Bridge in a ridiculously short time when anyone who knows London also knows that they are a long way from each other - it reminded me of Kevin Costner walking from Dover to Nottingham (about 150 miles or more?) in a day in the appalling Prince of Thieves!"
"Eaglegrafix","10","3","6","2 January 2010"," Authentic Holmes, At Last!
","EXPERIENCE THE REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES This is the authentic Sherlock Holmes, not the antiseptic version played by Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Bretts. The Robert Downey Jr. Holmes is closer to the Holmes created by Sir Arther Conan Doyle than any other portrayal I have seen. Holmes was a mess. An addict of many things and almost uncivilized. Holmes was also brilliant and expert in many things which this movie shows when no other have. As most genius characters, he did not fit in his world or his world's expectation of proper behavior.<br/><br/>In this film, Guy Ritchie has left his marks, for certain and one of his marks is to portray life as it was or is in any period his characters are set. London itself was a filthy dirty city during that period. Good personal hygiene was pretty much found only among the upper class. So the setting is authentic as is the character. For those who have trouble understanding the story, or finding the mystery to be solved, that is, in itself authentic to the books. Frequently Holmes is solving a different mystery than the readers (and in this case the viewers) are led to believe. Twists and turn-abouts abound, authentic to a Doyle plot. In the end...well in then end I will not spoil it, but will strongly recommend this movie as the best Sherlock Holmes I have seen to date. If you want to experience the authentic Holmes - a genius misfit, then see this movie."
"shadowulf10","9","3","6","30 December 2009"," Its elementary, my dear Wattson....
","I have always been an avid Edgar Allen Poe/ Arthur Conan Doyle fan. There is something about the writing style in their books, i don't know what it is but i do really enjoy it. It may possibly be the main character explaining to the reader how all of the tiny clue left throughout the novel all contribute and build up to a logical explanation for the seemingly supernatural and impossible events detailed in the book, it could be the way that the protagonists can give a blow by blow account of past events or details in a crime scene that are seemingly meaningless. I do not know what it is but this film certainly incorporated it.<br/><br/>I have seen a few reviews where people are whining that their beloved sherlock Holmes has been turned into a drug using, violent lout. Well unfortunately for them, he never was squeaky clean. He was always smoking opium in the books, with a fascination of martial arts and science.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Victorian London, during the industrial period. The atmosphere created by Guy is incredible. Everything about the set and the cast made it feel like a portal back in time. Not a single detail was missed. Robert Downey Jr made a fantastic Sherlock Holmes, having researched the character and the period of time extremely thoroughly. This is not an easy character to portray well and without knowledge, would be impossible to create a sense of character from the script alone.<br/><br/>The plot, although not a Sherlock Holmes story i know could have easily been one. It could have easily been a best-seller written by Arthur Conan Doyle himself.<br/><br/>So, overall then, an excellent film with good action sequences, romance and some comic relief. Excellent costumes, set and atmosphere. Superb acting from all members of cast. I would highly recommend it although children may find it slightly hard to follow."
"zardoz-13","10","3","6","29 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes Rebooted!
","The last man you would imagine as the ideal producer for ""Sherlock Holmes"" is none other than high-octane ""Lethal Weapon"" producer Joel Silver. Nevertheless, between action movie maestro Silver and audacious British director Guy Ritchie, the English counterpart to Martin Scorsese when it comes to making English mobster movies, Silver and Ritchie constitute a dynamic duo. Similarly, American actor Robert Downey, Jr., would seem least qualified to incarnate Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal sleuth, but the ""Iron Man"" star makes it a neat fit. Well, neat might not be the appropriate word. While hygiene proves to be an annoyance to him, Robert Downey as Sherlock Holmes is nothing short of brilliant when he comes to making flawless deductions that would never occur to the less observant. Holmes notices the minutest detail, and he is forever cataloguing facts as well as experimenting with his own inventions, such as a handgun silencer. Silver and Ritchie have assembled a top-notch cast, including Jude Law, Mark Strong, and Rachel McAdams. <br/><br/>Mind you, Holmes purists may hoist their supercilious eyebrows when they learn that Downey shuns the indispensable Basil Rathbone deerstalker cap and maintains a disheveled appearance. Incidentally, Rathbone played Holmes more times than anybody else in the Twentieth Century Fox/Universal Pictures franchise between 1939 and 1946. Meanwhile, Silver and Ritchie have lovingly recreated the Victorian setting in London during the 1890s, complete with Holmes' rooms at 221B Baker Street. The latest Holmes strives to be more charismatic and less haughty than either Nicol Williamson in ""The Seven Per-Cent Solution"" (1976) or Robert Stephens in ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" (1970). Freshman scenarist Michael Robert Johnson, ""Invictus"" scribe Anthony Peckman and Simon Kinberg of ""X-Men: Last Stand"" have penned a preposterous but wholly entertaining screenplay that bristles with 130 minutes worth of serpentine twists and turns. You will definitely get your money's worth. ""Sherlock Holmes"" pits Holmes with his faithful colleague, the dapper Dr. John Watson (Jude Law of ""Cold Mountain""), against the Voldemortian-style villain, Lord Blackwood (creepy Mark Strong of ""Body of Lies""), who conjures up more evil than Holmes has ever faced. The maniacal Blackwood invokes dark magic and kills helpless women to enhance his powers. Initially, Holmes and Watson thwart him from slaying his latest female victim. Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan of ""Miami Vice"") packs the predator off to the poky for the inevitable date with the gallows that Blackwood so richly deserves for his dastardly crimes. Watson officiates as the doctor who confirms Blackwood's demise and signs the death certificate. No sooner has Blackwood been safely buried than the bugger shatters his tomb and walks the earth, creating hysteria in London, and making Watson look incompetent. Like any worthwhile villain, Blackwood has ambitious designs now that he is back among the living. Blackwood convinces everybody in London but Holmes that he possesses paranormal powers that make him indestructible. He plans to implement some sweeping changes in London as well as the world unless Holmes can thwart his evil designs.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr., and Jude Law generate the same chemistry that made Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the 1940s Sherlock Holmes movies so popular. Unlike Bruce's bumbling Watson, Law is treated as an intelligent equal to Holmes and they carry on some lively conversations. Usually, Watson isn't given much to do in these adventures, but Law shares a greater part of the burden. In ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Watson dresses like a GQ Victorian gentleman and plans to marry Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly of ""Pride & Prejudice""), and Holmes does everything possible to prevent it. Incidentally, the character Mary Morstan appears in the Doyle novel ""The Sign of Four"" as Watson's lady friend. Meanwhile, Holmes has his own hands full of a seductress, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook""), who likes to slip knock-out drops in his drink and leave him in embarrassing predicaments. Indeed, Adler appeared as a character in multiple Doyle stories about Holmes. She has been sent to confound Holmes by an unknown individual in a carriage who wears a derringer up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Holmes and Watson's bickering seems even more amusing than the larger-than-life action set-pieces that Ritchie orchestrates with vigor and aplomb. The funniest scene has Holmes battling a towering French ruffian who literally destroys a dry dock. Ritchie doesn't direct ""Sherlock Holmes"" like an ordinary mystery, but spruces it up with flash-forward scenes that dissect the action‚Äîusually Holmes' startling deductions‚Äîlike something you would see in a ""C.S.I."" television episode. For example, in a ""Snatch"" like scene where Holmes boxes with a superior opponent, our hero explains how he will topple his adversary with various blows and then Ritchie presents it in real time. People who hate the idea of Holmes as a pugilist should go back to the source material. Doyle describes Holmes as a formidable bare-knuckles brawler in the novel ""The Sign of Four"" and Holmes even used martial arts against Moriarty in ""The Adventure of the Empty House."" Consequently, Holmes' boxing exploits are not a great stretch since his literary counterpart performed these feats in literature. When Holmes makes a deduction, Ritchie draws us back in time to when Holmes acquired his insight that prompted his deduction. The finale on the London Bridge, which is under construction, caps off this sprawling adventure. <br/><br/>Whatever the case, ""Sherlock Holmes"" represents the first time in twenty years that a film about Doyle's eccentric amateur detective has illuminated screens in America since the 1988 comedy ""Without a Clue"" that starred Michael Caine as a fraudulent Holmes. Ultimately, your decision to see ""Sherlock Holmes"" will rest on your willingness to accept the makeover that Holmes received. It is really not that radical a stretch when you remember the 1985 movie ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" where Holmes and Watson were teenage colleagues. Most of what happens here with both characters can be traced back to the literary Holmes. Boasting brains and brawn, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is anything but elementary."
"alexthomas28","1","7","20","24 January 2010"," Pathetic
","Sherlock Holmes is an absurdity. The Sherlock Holmes that Rober Downey Jr plays is an impostor, stripped of the essence of Arthur Conan Doyle's Baker Street detective. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law seem more like a very poor(underlined) imitation of James West and Artemus Gordon. The only other imitation that I can think of is again a very poor imitation of Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in Shanghai series(those were a lot better movies).<br/><br/>The story is rubbish, the treatment is rubbish. The movie is a waste of time. They tried something on the same lines as Batman Begins and failed miserably. Where Batman Begins had a soul, Sherlock Holmes had neither soul nor story nor anything else.<br/><br/>Enough said, this movie needs to be trashed into the bin of remake horrors."

","I had the opportunity to sit through an avant premiere here in Belgium -- organized as a part of the music for life anti-malaria-rally. The movie started with some delay, as everyone was required to hand in their cellphones before entering (wtf?!) -- as if anyone would want to watch crappy pictures or video recordings made on one of these. Anyway, the theater was packed with a fairly young crowd, and everyone seemed to be rather quiet. It started off rather unsharp and dark, and went on like this for the remainder. How easy it is to get spoiled by the many digital titles these days. Quite a contrast with the one I saw just last week: Avatar.<br/><br/>The movie has a bit of everything, humor, some adventure, a bit of action, mystery; but I would not call it perfectly balanced as one of the other reviews here does. Feels more of the opposite actually. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is too hip in his role of an analytical and logical detective. Jude Law does however do a better job playing the sidekick, Watson. Together, they go from place to place, arriving right on time, in the right spot. <br/><br/>We don't get to know that much of any of the characters in the picture. Aside from his apparent brilliance, we just don't know why Holmes is that messed up. Nor why there is this constant like-dislike thing between Watson and Holmes. We're just presented with a rather simple story of the both trying to save London, England, and the world from a mad man with supposedly dark magic powers. <br/><br/>Some of the Holmes fighting scenes were quite nice, showing of his brilliant analytic mind in his, surprisingly, strong body. But they didn't serve any purpose in the movie beyond making that point. Other action scenes just involve some pushing and pulling, some missed gunfire, and a totally unbelievable contraption involving stored current. <br/><br/>Overall, a dark storyline told by a rather dark picture, and yeah, Guy Ritchie seems to have a thing for dags.. err dogs. The effects succeed in showing a really old London, but at times they just break down. And not a single ""Elementary, dear Watson"" ! I'm shocked."

","One of the previews that preceded this movie was a trailer for ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", how apropos I thought after viewing this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. It appears Guy Ritchie has brought 21st Century hip actors (Downy, Law, McAdams et al) and transported them back to Victorian era London. A fun ride yes! However as someone who has been enamored with the Great Detective from childhood, this depiction pays more homage to Madonna, than it does Doyle. Cinematography and sets are wonderful, the feeling of that London of long ago is expertly captured here. Sad that the characters and dialog could not have been set in that time as well. Bottom line, if you want to see Ironman stalk Moriarty, this is your flick. If you want to remain true to the Cannon and immerse yourself in England of the latter part of the 19th Century, I suggest you purchase or rent any of the Granada TV produced Sherlock Holmes videos, with Jeremy Brett and David Burke."

","A review of Sherlock Holmes the Movie by a close friend. The best thing about ""Sherlock Holmes"" was Robert Downey, Jr. That man could turn a 5 o'clock news script into comedy. I reckon I could see him in anything. Oddly, Watson's character was turned on it's head by attributing him marshal arts skills, romantic involvement, and intellectual astuteness. Then Hollywood created an antagonistic relationship between the two men since Holmes's Bipolar mania annoyed Watson's desire for a quiet marital life with a woman for whom he couldn't get around to finding a ring due to his tempting escapades with Holmes he couldn't resist. The fiasco of casting Rachel McAdams as the femme fatale was like seeing Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz in S&M leathers. I bet Hollywood was thinking, I know, let's change literary characters to create an action movie! Maybe next time we could change the hideous Spiderman to Butterflyman, and instead of saving folks, he can work in magazine publishing, yeah, folks won't know the difference! So there's my two star review of a potential well acted movie with intriguing plot full of clever deducements, reduced to a pugilistic affair of recreated literary figures."

Have you ever seen the beauty, charm and grace of The Dancing men with Brett as Holmes? Fantastic acting, sober and as real as one can imagine life was back in the nineteenth century. A perfect visual and auditory treat. That's what this version has to compete against. The problem is not that this is a bad film, but that it has to compete against years of what has been made before, and to which we are accustomed. Everything in this movie may be true to the books, but it isn't true in our heads, and that's where it counts. Guy has made a sharp and interesting film. The music was brilliant I thought.

","Sherlock Holmes is one of the most iconic fictitious characters of all time. Created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800's, Holmes is an incredible detective who is able to solve a case out of the mundane details in life that nobody else seems to be able to notice. However, prior to this movie, I was not very well-educated on the character. So, I went in with a fresh, open opinion and was very pleased with what I saw. This tells the story of a man named Lord Blackwood, who is supposedly involved in black magic. He is caught by Holmes and his partner, John Watson, early on and is sentenced to death. However, Blackwood is resurrected, and Holmes needs to solve the case. I wasn't so keen on the black magic elements of the story, but when the explanation came at the end, I was really pleased. It made me really appreciate the rest of the film a lot more. I liked the characterization of Holmes, and the mannerisms given to him by the fantastic Robert Downey, Jr. Downey plays Holmes perfectly, getting every little quirk the character has exactly right. There were a number of small things in this movie that I absolutely loved, like the little banter between Holmes and Watson, Holmes and the Inspector. However, what is quite possibly the best thing in this movie is the scenes where Holmes is shown sitting there, but you can hear all the other conversations and noises around him. That is really what defines his character, displaying his brilliance perfectly. There were some problems I had though. The film does run a bit long, and there are a number of scenes that could have been trimmed. The ending is also a big problem. It ends on a cliffhanger, and while I don't mind, I wish they would have saved the cliffhanger stuff for later installments. But, despite that, I really liked Sherlock Holmes, and am looking forward to further installments in this series."

I never thought i'd like a movie by Guy Ritchie this much, but this one is SUPERB in every way! Robert Downey's amazing performance makes him my Best Actor of 2009, and Jude Law's Dr Watson is most endearing. Mark Strong gives us a wonderfully diabolical villain that makes Avatar's Col Quaritch merely cartoony. The script is also very witty and the plot believable, two essential qualities if a Sherlock Holmes movie is to be credible. There is much wit to be found in the music score as well.

","If you love Sherlock Holmes movies, then we finally have a chance to enjoy these played by an actor that can merge the character with the action deliver required by modern audiences. My take on Sherlock Holmes is the character was created by Sir Doyle as a result of Jack the Ripper murders in White Chappel. The times required a detective that could piece the puzzle together and solve the crime; no matter how disconnected the pieces were. Now with Robert Downey playing Sherlock, let's start with my area Martial Arts. The last time I witnessed a physique like Robert Downey's was Bruce Lee. The fight scene where Sherlock is fighting in the ring is essentially Wing Chun, and Downey executed it perfectly. There is also a scene earlier in the movie where Downey maps out what is required to disable one of the bad guys; which in the real world is exactly what you do. Yes fight scenes are set up via choreography; however, Downey obviously isn't just a mindless automaton carrying out a series of clumsy boring moves with all the Hollywood magic thrown behind it. Downey obviously trained for a while which showed in this movie. The movie has plenty of action for modern audiences, yet had some thought provoking moments, as well as some hilarious scenes that make the movie a great buy for any movie goer. Enjoy!!!"
"marissas75","5","3","7","1 January 2010"," Detective-story / action-movie hybrid doesn't always work
","This new ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an attempt to make the iconic Victorian sleuth cool for the blockbuster generation by punching up the story with fights, explosions, and steampunk style. And, while I'm not morally opposed to the idea of an action-hero Holmes, it makes the movie kind of a strange hybrid. Action movies work best when they are ""dumb"" (that is, when they have a relatively simple story), but Sherlock Holmes movies work best when they are ""smart,"" with a twisty mystery that requires Holmes' intelligence to solve. Therefore, the plot of ""Sherlock Holmes"" is way too convoluted and contrived for what should be a simple action movie. But it's not really satisfying as a mystery story, either, because the constant onslaught of action scenes means that the audience never has time to stop and think about the clues.<br/><br/>Additionally, the story, about an evil lord and his secret mystical society plotting to take over the world, seems like the Victorian equivalent of a Dan Brown novel. It's a lot of hokum, in short, and I couldn't get myself to really care about it.<br/><br/>So this movie would really be terrible if it didn't star Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson. Their presence proves that even in a silly blockbuster, it's worthwhile to cast people who know how to act and entertain an audience. Because Downey always comes across as the smartest guy in the room, as well as a total eccentric, he was an inspired choice for the role of Holmes. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where he and Jude Law's Watson bicker like an old married couple; they make a great buddy-movie pairing.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams doesn't have much to do in the role of Irene Adler, the designated love-interest, but she still seems miscast. Irene is supposed to be an international woman of mystery, but McAdams comes off as too young and too contemporary.<br/><br/>So the intelligence in this movie comes from Downey's performance as Holmes, which I guess is as it should be; I had just hoped for more intelligence in the writing and direction as well."

","I agree that Ritchie and his team of writers have taken a lot of liberties in this movie but i think thats good or else it would have turned into the same costume dramas of yore. Ritchie's brought in his unique Tarantino like style and feel to this movie about a character that has had umpteen interpretations since the dawn of the age of cinema. Its fresh (even though it has a feel of 'Snatch') and in a lot of ways very interesting as the story tries to catch the essence of Conan Doyle with modern Thomas Harris like leanings. I would be very much interested in a sequel and i would also be interested as to who might be cast as professor Moriarty (Tom Wilkinson/Gary Oldman comes to mind)...Kudos to Ritchie. The divorce didn't dampen his creative juices."

","We had noisy and explosive blockbusters in summer etc.Transformers 2, G.I Joe. While they were entertaining, they were just into the action with simple story and some lame jokes. So now comes December, other than Avatar, another so-called blockbuster is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is a reboot by Guy Ritchie which shows the younger Sherlock and his partner, Waston. Whether it is a true reboot, I don't know as I am not familiarise with the original. But this reboot will definitely get some new fans.<br/><br/>The story: It has a good mix of genres, action and thriller/suspense and mystery with a touch of humour. In the end, Guy manages to blend them together and forms an entertaining, thrilling and good movie. Sherlock does action, he does boxing and he seems not to be afraid of pain. Not only he knows perfect action, he also can visualise. That is what makes him so deadly. Other than that, his mind is smart and can observe background fast and still manage to say quirky humorous jokes. Robert Downey Jr is good for that Sherlock. Han Zimmer also does a perfect job in creating the electrifying music.<br/><br/>Overall: It is worth a watch. Even if you don't know who is Sherlock Holmes, it is still good to watch this and who knows, you may even become a fan of him. It is a good blockbuster as the summer has noisy and non-sense blockbusters, this actually has a plot with twists and at the same time packed with action and thrills."

Furthermore, the performances are AWFUL. Sorry, but Tony Stark as Sherlock was not convincing as Sherlock. Watson was maybe OK, but that's all the compliments I have for the acting.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the script is bloody awful.

"lewiskendell","5","2","4","28 April 2010"," Holmes by name, only.
","I don't know if I just saw a Sherlock Holmes movie, or a mash-up of House, M.D. and Harry Potter, set in the nineteenth century. We have a scruffy genius with few social graces, who correctly draws astonishing conclusions from minute details. His long- suffering partner, who constantly (an unwillingly) gets caught up in the schemes of the main character - and despite his frequent exasperation, seems to be the only person who can truly put up with him. And then we have a villain who gains power through seemingly dark magic that is rooted in the deaths of others. Greg House + Voldemort = basically this entire movie. <br/><br/>My point is, the protagonist of this movie felt little like the classic character of the great detective only occasionally. I almost wish that they would have scrapped the Sherlock Holmes title entirely, and made this a completely original movie. Is it Robert Downey Jr.'s fault that I see him and think Tony Stark? No. But the fact still remains that as good as he is, he never fit the part for me. He's a great actor, but this wasn't really suited for him. <br/><br/>Once you get beyond the title, you'll see that this is a pretty standard adventure movie. There are action sequences sprinkled in liberally, to keep the pace moving, a fairly simple plot, fight scenes, and even a few explosions. And somehow with all that going on, I still was bored and ready for the movie to end, long before it was over. Besides that, Rachel McAdams' character was completely unnecessary and annoying. I know mainstream movies generally need some kind of a love interest for the main protagonist, but Rachel was a complete mismatch for her role. <br/><br/>The sense of cleverness that goes into a tale about Holmes was also missing. Every part of the mystery boiled down to some new invention or rare compound that only Holmes and the villain had knowledge of. He was supposed to be a great detective because of his uncanny deductive reasoning, not because he had memorized every random poison on earth. <br/><br/>Maybe by the time the inevitable sequel is made, I'll be acclimated to this modern version of Sherlock Holmes. It's great for RDJ's career that he has had so many mega- successful movies in the last few years, but that also makes it much harder for him to disappear into a role. This is one example of his fame being too big for the character."

Downey had such potential to portray the brilliant Holmes, but he turned out to be a drunken, festering, mumbling, Johnny-Depp-like weirdo. I swear I couldn't understand half the movie. London ended up being a dreary urban slum and the movie focused less on deductions and clues, and more on karate chop action scenes and special effects. Jude Law was the only redeeming quality here. Sadly, I can't recommend this movie. And as usual, the original books are much better. btw, ""The Mummy"" used the line ""death is only the beginning"" over ten years ago."

For me however, I thought it was really a great twist, not a better Sherlock Holmes, but a different one.<br/><br/>The fight scenes (or ""pre-fight scenes) were my favorite parts of the movie, how he would break down in his head what exactly he would be doing, and then perform the actions without error.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much, so I'll end the review with this: If you are a hardcore original Sherlock Holmes story fan, this may not be the movie for you.

","If you like Holmes the way Conan-Doyle wrote him and expect a story along those lines, stay away from this movie. The movie contains characters with names that are familiar.

Well, that ended any pretense that the characters really were Holmes and Watson (and Mary Morstan or Irene Adler or ...)<br/><br/>That said, once I got over the false advertising of the character's names.... it was a fairly decent whodunit with a few interesting plot turns.

","The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked ""Sherlock Holmes."" Yet another classic hero has been fed into the f/x mill, emerging as a modern superman. Guy Ritchie's film is filled with sensational sights, over-the-top characters and a desperate struggle atop Tower Bridge, which is still under construction. It's likely to be enjoyed by today's action fans. But block bookings are not likely from the Baker Street Irregulars.<br/><br/>One of the comforts of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories is their almost staid adherence to form. Villains and cases come and go up the staircase at 221B Baker Street, but within that refuge, life stays the same: Holmes all-knowing and calm, Watson fretful and frightened, clues orderly, victims distraught, never a problem not seemingly insoluble. Outside is the fabled Victorian London, a city we all know in our imaginations. I think I became an Anglophile on those winter nights when I sat curled up in my dad's big chair, a single lamp creating shadows in the corners of the room, reading the Modern Library edition of the stories while in the basement I heard the comforting sounds of my parents doing the laundry.<br/><br/>Every Holmes story is different and each one is the same, just as every day has its own saint but the Mass is eternal. ""Sherlock Holmes"" enacts the strange new rites of hyperkinetic action and impossible CGI, and Holmes and Watson do their best to upgrade themselves. Holmes tosses aside the deerstalker hat and meerschaum calabash, and Watson has decided for once and all to abandon the intimacy of 221B for the hazards of married life. Both of them now seem more than a little gay; it's no longer a case of ""oh, the British all talk like that."" Jude Law even seemed to be wearing lipstick when he promoted the movie on Letterman.<br/><br/>Well, Holmes, like Hamlet, has survived countless interpretations. The character has been played memorably by Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Frank Langella, Peter Cushing, John Barrymore, James D'Arcy, Michael Caine, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Rupert Everett, William Gillette, Stewart Granger, Charlton Heston, Anthony Higgins, Raymond Massey, Roger Moore, John Neville, Leonard Nimoy, Christopher Plummer, Jonathan Pryce, Nicol Williamson -- and now Robert Downey Jr., who is not the least of these.<br/><br/>Downey's Holmes is at once more dissolute and more fit than previous incarnations. Holmes' canonical devotion to cocaine is here augmented by other drugs and a great deal of booze. Yet Holmes has the body of a lithe athlete, the skills of a gymnast and the pugilism of a world champion. He and Watson (who is, you recall, only a doctor, although one with clients who must be puzzled about his office hours) spring readily into action like Batman and Robin.<br/><br/>In a really very good opening sequence, the two burst in upon the fiendish satanist Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) in the act of committing a dastardly act. Blackwood is sent to the gallows and sealed in his tomb, only to reappear (to Holmes' undeniable satisfaction) seemingly still alive. This sets off a series of action set pieces in the streets of London, which have never seemed more looming, dark and ominous; I had the impression Jack the Ripper had just darted out of view.<br/><br/>After the initial apprehension of Blackwood, Holmes retreats to his digs. In Conan Doyle, this is often explained as ""a period of study"" and implied drug reveries. In Ritchie's version, he trashes his rooms like a drunken undergraduate; they lack only empty pizza boxes. This will not do. My Sherlock is above all fastidious. But never mind. Blackwood's resurrection gives him a new reason for living.<br/><br/>There is also interest from two women: Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), of course, said to be the only woman to ever touch Holmes' heart, and Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), Watson's intended, who may be in for more than she knows. The advent of Mary on the scene sends Holmes into fits of petulance; how dare the doctor prefer a woman to his own fascinating company? Watson has always maintained quarters elsewhere, but in this film, the cozy confines of 221B make his other rooms seem more than ever like a beard.<br/><br/>The Conan Doyle stories are still read, and probably always will be. Most readers get to at least a few. But among moviegoers on Christmas night (traditionally one of the busiest movie nights of the year), probably not so many. They will be unaware that this ""Sherlock Holmes"" is cheerfully revisionist. They will be entertained, and so was I. The great detective, who has survived so much, can certainly shrug off a few special effects."

","This review is strictly my point of view and many may not agree with me, I being a Guy Ritchie fan, I do admire most of the things he brings on screen, so keep that in your mind before my recommendation.<br/><br/>This version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters, where the bromance of Doctor and Holmes continues with a stylish narration of Guy Ritchie. Guy Ritchie's narrative style is not for everyone, it contains a bit more of action and fantasy substances that will not be accepted openly by everyone.<br/><br/>People may feel that the action sequences are opposite of what the authentic characters possess, but what I felt is in this version Guy Ritchie tried to create the action sequences in such a way that it was mentally calculated and not just physical capacity of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>The editing, camera, and the technical team of Guy Ritchie done a much-appreciated job that you will cherish the visuals, and a very supportive music by Hans Zimmer makes the experience much better.<br/><br/>And of course, you will enjoy Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma and also the chemistry between himself and Jude Law.<br/><br/>I rate this a 70%.<br/><br/>WATCH IT for a stylish version of Sherlock Holmes, especially if you like Guy Ritchie narration.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","3 April 2020"," Sherlock Holmes adapts the eccentric detective through narrative mysticism and visual flair.
","Victorian London, 221B Baker Street. Home to the medically inclined Dr. John Watson and the reclusive yet ingenious private detective Sherlock Holmes. Embarking on many mysterious crimes that the city police have the intellectual incapacity to investigate. Missing person? Done. Unresolved murder? Easy. Stolen jewellery? Say no more. 1890, a ritualistic murder performed by the seemingly mystical Lord Blackwood is interrupted by Holmes and Watson, after asserting dislocations to several patellas and jaws. Blackwood, now sentenced to death for the grisly slaughtering of five women, forewarns Holmes of additional murders to come. ""Steal your mind Holmes, I need you"", he gently whispers. Graciously ignored, Blackwood is hanged, only to defy the laws of nature and resurrect himself a day later. Inexplicable actions aside, London is shrouded in terror, and it's up to Holmes and Watson to solve this mystery enveloped in both science and magic.<br/><br/>Ritchie's adaptation of Conan Doyle's legendary literary figure, is undoubtedly his best non-British gangster film. There, it's been said! The director himself has a peculiar style. Very frenetic, often hyperactive. An aesthetic quality that seamlessly harmonises with the eponymous fictitious character and his personality. The eccentricities, from the elongated narrational splurges of explanations streaming from Holmes' consciousness to the erratic behaviour perpetuating the unsociable skills he has acquired, are brilliantly captured in a story that is essentially moulded by them. Each uniquely discovered clue, whether that be an object or a location, usually leads the pair into a brawl with some ""propa"" feisty henchmen, including a colossal French behemoth aptly named Dredger. Ritchie effortlessly merges the mystery elements of a classic Conan Doyle novel with the general entertainment of a blockbuster, even if this diverts from the source material, without diminishing the overall investigation.<br/><br/>There's a narrative buoyancy that maintains a level of humour and amusement throughout, mostly due to the hugely accessible screenplay. When it's not inserting substantial amounts of foreshadowing (trust me, there's a lot...), the script primarily focusses on the amicable friendship between Holmes and Watson, exploring the differing qualities they inhibit and emphasising their contrasts. Considering Watson desires to become happily married and remove Holmes' eccentricities from his life, he can't let go of the adrenaline. The two, often bickering like a married couple, supply the energy Ritchie's feature requires. Holmes' exaggerated bohemianism granting him several memorable scenes and asserting the character's peculiarities almost immediately, such as utilising musical theory to create order from chaos with a group of harmless flies trapped in a glass cylinder (don't ask...).<br/><br/>Again, the film works solely based on these two, with fantastic central performances to accompany the characters. Downey Jr., exercising his long forgotten 'Chaplin' accent, fully embraces Holmes physically and emotionally. The erratic body movements and rapid line delivery were executed exceptionally well, to the point where he became the character. His chemistry with Law, whom excellently portrayed Watson as a typical Victorian-era doctor, was infectious. McAdams, playing the femme fatale love interest, unfortunately was weak in comparison. Assuming the role of an underdeveloped Irene Adler, of which rarely presented any romantic chemistry with Downey Jr., likened the character to a plot convenience than anything else. Strong, typecast as the villain once again, exudes a menacing presence despite the weak showdown atop Tower Bridge that relinquished that terror almost indefinitely.<br/><br/>Supplementing the ornate art direction, is Zimmer's score. Iconic. Utilising authentic instruments including a ""broken pub piano"", banjo and cimbalom, he crafted yet another outstanding composition that brought life to Victorian London. A contender for his best score yet? Quite possibly.<br/><br/>It retains Ritchie's blend of modern entertainment with ancient stories, that's what makes Sherlock Holmes enjoyable. Clues percolating into action. Revelations dissolving into ultimatums. He crafted an authentic adaptation that would appeal to the masses, whilst pleasing hardcore fans of the novels. With credible performances to balance out the uneven moments of brutal foreshadowing, Sherlock Holmes solves the case brilliantly and opens himself up to a new potential mystery with his arch-nemesis..."

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","0","31 March 2020"," A new conception of Sherlock Holmes
","In this film, Sherlock Holmes and his adventure companion Dr. Watson, face the threat of a occult master who has been executed for several murders but, mysteriously, comes back to life. I confess that I am not a particular Sherlock Holmes fan. I read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales and stories and found them interesting, but I always preferred other authors. However, I decided to watch this film and give it a chance, since it is a character that is rarely seen in cinema.<br/><br/>I have to confess that the famous series ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", from the mid-eighties, marked my way of imagining the characters. In this series, Jeremy Brett brought the detective to life in a way that, I think, is the closest to the author's original conception, and the most in line with the Victorian gentleman. This film, however, shows us a very modern Sherlock Holmes in his way of acting, speaking and behaving. The character acts like someone of our time, in a dissonant historical period, creating an anachronism. However, surprisingly, it did not affect me. I'm not a fan of anachronisms and I often criticize period films because of that, but the way this film was conceived made it acceptable.<br/><br/>In fact, this film is not an adaptation of any of the original books or tales, it just take advantage of the characters and creates a new story with some adventure, action and even a supernatural scent much to the Victorian taste. If this film were an adaptation of any of Conan Doyle's stories, I think the director - an unlikely Guy Ritchie - would not have that freedom.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie would never be my first choice to direct a film like this. Against all my expectations, he proved to be more skilled and intelligent than in any of his other works (at least, those I know). I appreciated some of his options, like the dissonance between the period and the characters' attitudes or the use of slow motion sometimes. However, the film relies heavily on the quality and performance of the two main actors. Robert Downey Jr. is in the best moment of his career and it was a safe bet to bring a bold Holmes to life, closer to an action figure with a hint of mad genius than to a pure intellectual who analyses facts coldly. Jude Law, who brought Dr. Watson to life, is just as good and both are excellent when working together. Law's Watson, by the way, remains, as it always has been, more conventional and cautious than its companion, making a pleasant counterpoint to the main character. In the supporting cast, Mark Strong is a charismatic villain and Rachel McAdams gives additional support when its needed, but it has been largely underused.<br/><br/>Technically, it is a film that uses and abuses CGI, green screen, visual and sound effects of quite regular quality, without anything extraordinary. It is something common in a film designed to be a blockbuster. The action and fight scenes were well done but they are not breathtaking. The cinematography tried to be darker, perhaps as a result of our idea of Victorian London as a misty and humid city. This worked fine most of the time but there are moments when it was too much. Post-production and editing was regular and the soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, was not as successful as many others by the same composer. At least to me, it sounded too much like a sailors song."

","A surprisingly action packed mystery. Sherlock Holmes is a very well executed detective movie. It brings a lot to the table, there's always something interesting on the screen. Whether it's a key plot point or banter between actors/characters, there never seemed to be a dull moment. I don't think this would have been possible without the story how it was written and the actors who played roles in this movie.
 The movie starts out with a chase scene and the introduction of our main character Sherlock (Robert Downey Jr.). He's running down an alley at night chasing someone. We then moments later are introduced to the films main villain, Lord Blackwood. He is a evil figure that is seeming to use black magic in the movie, and is gaining power. Sherlock's partner and friend Watson helps him with most everything throughout the movie. 
 I believe that Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for Sherlock Holmes. Just like Sherlock, Robert has played many whitty characters so this role fit him very well. I would compare how he acts in this to how he portrays Tony Stark in Iron Man. For this movie adaptation i couldn't see anyone else playing Sherlock except Robert. Sherlock's companion and friend Watson who is played Jude Law. They make the duo perfect. This was good casting of actors. The director Guy Ritchie did practically everything right. I believe almost everything was executed perfectly except a few loose ends. The camera angling and shots were done incredibly well. They took every opportunity to have an interesting angle alongside movement of characters. This is similar to what Taika Waititi did in Thor: Ragnarok. The positioning of characters in both films is great. It's perfect for every scene in each movie. Fight scenes in each movie were perfectly thought out which made it way more entertaining to watch.
 One thing Sherlock Holmes could have done better was set up. In some point in the film I don't think they had enough. For instance even though we all are aware of who Watson is in relation to the story, but I think they could have introduced better and more thoroughly. It's a small flaw but I feel like it would make Watson a much better character. In the beginning of the movie we have our main character Sherlock running through a dark alley at night, chasing someone or something. Quickly we see Holmes in a building sneaking around and we are introduced to his thoughts, he goes through situations and scenarios in his head with his great intellect. This is a great way to introduce a trait or ability of the character. A word we can use for Holmes is ""Ratiocination"", which is the process of exact thinking. A train of thought that has reasoning. This is huge to Sherlock as a character because it can be a big part in his deduction skills.
 Sherlock Holmes overall is a incredibly well thought out movie with mostly everything going for it. A multitude of different people will most likely find themselves enjoying it. It's got great timing, a touch of comedic effect and even some sass. Sherlock Holmes is definitely a movie I would 100% recommend you watch. The only people that shouldn't watch this movie are people who dislike fun and exciting action, with a touch of humor.

","Guy Ritchie after a spell in the doldrums returned with a big budget production of Sherlock Holmes with a rejuvenated Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law playing a more brutish Dr Watson.<br/><br/>The villain here is aristocratic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has been foiled when partaking in a ritual sacrifice and despite being hung for his crimes, seemingly returns from the dead and kills others by use of black magic it seems as he aims to topple the British establishment.<br/><br/>Irene Adler turns up in the shape of Rachel McAdams with a hint of romance with Holmes and there are plenty of hints that Professor Moriarty is lurking in the background.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has gone for a grimy, steam-punk setting of London. There is plenty of CGI the more effective being the partially built Tower of London but the CGI looks just that and has aged badly even though the film was only released in 2009.<br/><br/>Ritchie still sticks with his London setting of cockney schemers and wheeler dealers. Its a muscular film with slow motion fight scenes as Holmes anticipates the combat in advance. His Watson is also handy with his fists, you actually wonder if he is a pugilist rather than a doctor. I did find the sub plot of Holmes being put out that Watson is engaged to get married rather irritating and not funny at all.<br/><br/>Still Downey is enjoying himself and gets to try out his English accent again after Chaplin ad Richard III. This is a muscular action adventure film, less of a mystery as the plot places an emphasis on the supernatural and some of Holmes famous deductions are actually laughable."

","Exactly how a Sherlock Holmes movie shouldn't be done! This wasn't a drama of deductive reasoning. It was a period light action movie. Think Shanghai Knights (except not as good).<br/><br/>The one thing that can be said for it is that it's pacey. There must have been five- plus decent prolonged action scenes.<br/><br/>But this isn't what I put a movie called Sherlock Holmes in to my DVD player to see!<br/><br/>The detective work is mostly limited to Holmes predicting the direction of his opponents next punches. Robert Downey Jr, who plays Holmes, is totally opposite to the character I expected (although I suspect this is partly the point).<br/><br/>In the end this movie wiled away an evening fairly innocuously but I'm not going to rush to see the sequel."

","Ritchie finally takes the hints and allows others in on his creations. This time he leaves the script alone, so we are free from his mockney ""Cor blimey geezer"" dialogue. Instead, there's more charm and wit here. Law and Downey Jr. make an excellent couple, and aren't afraid to show a true love between Holmes and Watson. They bicker over everything, but it's easy to see they were meant to be.It does have all the action you would expect from a modern Hollywood take on the character, but it doesn't feel too intrusive. Having Holmes plan out his fights in a logical way before making his moves fits an action version of the character. Strong is an excellent villain and an amazing actor. It's an enjoyable romp, even if it doesn't quite break the mold."

","""All emotions were abhorrent to him. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world had ever seen."" - The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892) <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie directs ""Sherlock Holmes"", a fast, funny, but completely disposable ""re-imagining"" of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic private detective. For a better update of Sherlock Holmes see 1998's ""Zero Effect"", which stars Bill Pullman as our detective and features a plot that is unofficially based on ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", an early Holmes classic. Hardcore Holmes fans regard the film highly, but not many know of it. See too ""They Might be Giants"", an underrated take on Holmes from 1971.<br/><br/>Still, Ritchie's film has some things going for it. It's a surprisingly under-lit blockbuster, Ritchie using muted, murky, messy lighting to simulate the grungy tone of late-1800s Britain. And of course Robert Downey Jr plays this incarnation of Holmes, the actor bringing a frenetic, schizophrenic timbre to the Great Detective.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, this is mostly junk. Ritchie's script is lazy and cheats often, Holmes magically solving problems, deus ex machinas whimsically conjured up and our heroes figuring out ridiculously complex problems simply because their screenwriters will closure into fruition. In Ritchie's defense, this is exactly how most Holmes tales functioned. Interestingly, while your typical detective story ends with a coda in which the hero ""explains"" and ""ties together"" the story the audience has just watched/read, Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is packed with miniature mysteries within the main mystery which are ""solved"" using similar flashback/flash-forward devices. The film thus offers a ""heightened"" form of your typical detective walk-through.<br/><br/>The film's villain is Lord Blackwood, a character who may or may not possess supernatural powers. This is apt. Charles Darwin published the ""The Origin of Species"" in 1859 and Arthur Conan Doyle his first Sherlock Holmes story in 1887. It is commonly thought that Doyle's hero owed much to the development of the nineteenth century scientific method, with its emphasis on observation, logic, deduction and a dash of imagination and daring, but Holmes, with his unbelievable gifts for problem solving and frequent impossible leaps of logic, was originally meant as a joke, a mockery of the flurry of scientific discoveries that the era saw being made. Doyle was himself fond of mysticism, spiritualism, magic and often wrote about the Dark Arts. He cooked up Holmes as an attempt to ridicule that which he believed was slowly killing off various branches of enchantment, religion and spirituality. Of course this backfired completely. People are fond of order, control and the commanding aura of Holmes, and quickly took the detective to heart. From then on, Doyle found himself unable to abandon the character. <br/><br/>Ritchie's film stars Jude Law and Rachel McAdams in supporting roles, but they're not given much to do. The film features some neat, Victoria-era scenery, most of it CGI paintings. The sequel's even funnier.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Better Holmes flicks: ""Zero Effect"", ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (1939), ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939), ""They Might Be Giants"" (1971). Worth one viewing."

","I have never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories but ever since I have come across the Granada series with Jeremy Brett (most of which I love), I have become fascinated with the entire Sherlock Holmes world and canon. So I was very interested in seeing this movie from the start. Although it is not the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made, it is certainly a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. take on the character is not up there with the greats perhaps but it is uniquely his. His Holmes is often rude, droll, but his deductive brilliance gets him out of deadly situations.When bored he smokes opium while doing drug experiments with his dog. Jude Law makes very good young Dr.Watson as someone often bantering with Holmes and having to put up with his selfish and impulsive demeanor. On screen, Downey and Law show great chemistry as Holmes and Watson playing off each other very well. Rachael McAdams makes a good Irene Adler (a character from the story ""A Scandal in Bohemia"") and Mark Strong is strong (no pun intended) as Holmes's nemesis Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>The script is full energy and is able to hold your attention from start to finish moving at a quick pace. Yet, Holmes purists may have problems with the fact that this movie has more action and adventure than it does mystery (which is not to say that it doesn't have elements that keep you guessing or that Holmes doesn't use his traditional deductive methods of investigations). Sherlock Holmes has always been a cerebral hero who rarely gets into fights but the Holmes in this movie gets into a lot of them and survives many deadly encounters. Still, taken as an exercise in escapism which is what movies are for, it does succeed.<br/><br/>The film is cleverly directed by Guy Ritchie. He gives a special look and feel to the film. In terms of pure visual design this film is something to admire. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is first rate. The production values are superb where instead of showing Victorian Era London as beautiful they present it's alleys and street corners as dingy, grimy, with the air full of industrial smog. The music score also blends in with the scenes and imagery beautifully. Without, any doubt this movie is technically well made.<br/><br/>So this isn't a great movie nor is it the kind of film that you would want run home about. Yet, taking it for what it is, which is Sherlock Holmes combined with action and adventure, I found it enjoyable. I certainly prefer it over it's recent sequel."

","Excellent film, but few niggles. Blackwood would, as an executed man been buried in unconsecrated ground, usually within the confines of the prison, so he would have found it difficult to ""rise from the dead"", when under six feet of earth. Also the Thames at this time was probably little more than an open sewer, so Sherlock would not have willingly dived into it! (I am open to correction as to the dates of the comprehensive sewer construction of London, but I think it would still be pretty foul). Also the Thames really was not deep enough for a big ship to sink.Another bone of contention is that there were women in the holding area at the prison?. Women would have been in a separate area, not allowed contact with the men. Apart from that a very entertaining film."

I think it'd be very wrong to search for comparisons with the Sherlock from the books. This is not the purpose of a movie, which is always limited in time and expression.

"JRmoviereviews","7","0","0","21 December 2011"," Awesome but sadly falls short in a few areas
","Sherlock Holmes was one of my most anticipated movies from 2009. The story begins with Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey JR.) thwarting a masked demonic worshiping crook known as Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). Lord Blackwood is put in prison until his execution. He is hung for his crimes of black magic. After he is presumed dead he is of course buried. Not long after, Blackwood has miraculously risen from the dead to complete his master plan of world domination using his dark demonic powers. This all sets up for a good story but story is my biggest issue with this film.<br/><br/>The directing is fairly good, so well done on the part of Guy Ritchie. He manages to make very well done scenes complete with Holme's witty dialogue. Another place where this movie hits a home run is in fact the duologue. Sherlock Holmes is very witty and even condescending at times but it all fits the character quite well. This also applies to his sidekick and brother Dr. Watson (Jude Law). I love the visuals of this movie, i love the dialogue and directing, and the idea is quite good. There are a few flaws in the story which actually hurt the film quite a bit.<br/><br/>My main gripe is that at times i was completely lost. For the first 3/4 of the movie it seemed as though nothing made sense. It is not until later in the movie where you are shown what everything you have been seeing means. So much happens throughout the movie but you just are not shown how it adds up. I feel like the movie would have benefited quite a bit from allowing us inside the head of Sherlock Holmes more. It would have been fun to try and solve the mystery with him. With mystery movies i want to either try to solve the case or at least know what the main character is thinking. Once you are shown what everything means the movie becomes a lot better. It seems like the plot was simply lagging behind the rest of the movie. It wasn't entirely clear what was happening until the end and that's where the film falls short. I was sadly disappointed with the story telling. A movie with such good dialogue and characters should have been a lot more entertaining than it was.<br/><br/>My overall rating is a 7 out of 10 Pros: Directing,Witty Dialogue,Visuals Cons: Confusing and a lack of engagement with story telling."

I actually thought they could have played to this a bit more. Cast overall is solid, but Rachel McAdams is somewhat wasted in her role. Solid directing from Guy Ritchie, he plays it straight for the most part but brings his little direction touches. I like his look to London, it suits the film well.

","Some audiences has been bashing on this movie because it has that bit of a modern feel going for it.

It just didn't seem like it went this direction because of the majority of audiences but because this added a bit of flare to it. Without it ruining the original books while reaching out to the mass audiences. This is a big case that Sherlock is trying to solve and a interesting one for the most part although it can be predictable at times. It isn't the most articulate and intelligent case ever, but it's decent. And just about anyone can understand exactly what is going on. Robert Downey Jr. was good as Sherlock Holmes although over-exaggerated at times and Jude Law was likable as Watson. They have a bit of a bromance going but they make a great duo and it's entertaining to watch them work together. Mark Strong does what he does best, playing a charismatic villain. Rachel McAdams is cute but she didn't really seem to fit her role as Irene Adler, she just seemed more girly than a seductive thief. She wasn't bad but just didn't seem to suit the role she is given all that well. When it came to Sherlock I enjoyed watching how he constantly used his senses and intuition using his surroundings and environment to get closer to finding out what is going on. Anyways to sum it up this movie has style but also has a bit of substance as well, it has enough action and mystery to keep the mass audiences entertained.<br/><br/>7.7/10"
"Agnelin","Null","0","0","21 August 2011"," A+ action, F- mystery
","""Sherlock Holmes"" is a nice entertainment movie, if the action+comedy+witty jokes sprinkled around+bits of romance mix is your choice. It is a funny little revision of the classic detective and the whole galaxy of characters around him: Watson, Lestrade, and so on. Holmes is shown here as an athletic and street-smart action hero, but also as a surprisingly erudite person who happens to have the exact piece of information, obscure as it may be, exactly when it's needed (but, on the other hand, that's what we expect from this character in a movie like this!).<br/><br/>The movie is best in the numerous action sequences, in those where Holmes boasts his uncanny deductive gifts and in the dialogues between Holmes and Watson, where their homoerotic chemistry shines in all its glory (another very good point about the movie). Rachel McAdams is the weakest character in the whole movie as Holmes's old flame and female counterpart, although the movie would have been better off without the romantic interest between them, for the reasons mentioned above. Also, the main characters -except for Irene Adler (McAdams)- are quite strong, and well-written.<br/><br/>Where the movie seriously lacks is the mystery part. I absolutely expected some of that, come on, it's Sherlock Holmes! But the suspense-mystery-guessing part is completely missing from this otherwise efficient combo. There is little for the public to guess, and the little bit that is present will only fool the viewers with sparse viewing experience in this genre. If you, like me, went to watch this hoping for some intelligent twist, and a solution that Conan Doyle himself would have envied, then you will be seriously disappointed.<br/><br/>My score is 5/10."
"elamin02","Null","0","0","26 July 2011"," Sherlock Holmes was a great movie with fantastic cinematography
","Starring: Jude Law, Robert Downing Jr.<br/><br/>This movie took me completely by surprised. When i initially seen it in the movies, I did not know what to expect and was happy with what the director, Guy Ritchie delivered.<br/><br/>The movie is set in what seems to be London in 1891 where profound detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Robert Downing Jr.) and his right hand man and roommate Dr.John Watson (played by Jude Law) is on their way to infiltrate a devious plan by Lord Black well (played by Mark Strong). The movie immediately opens up with action and suspense, which is a plus in my book. The director does a fantastic job of the lighting even in the darkness within the scenes.<br/><br/>The cinematographer does a great job with action and portraying the film within the movie. When the action scenes arise the director first has Holmes explain the scene in detail, exhibiting his master mind of thought and skill, then slowing the frame down to seen exactly how the action is delivered. This is the highlight of the movie, it truly shows how fantastic Holmes is which is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>The lighting throughout the movie I felt was fantastic as well. The director mostly did the scenes at night which was a major aspect of the film. I feel these scenes were a great touch to leave the mystery on the rise. The scenes when Holmes was chasing the guy through the shipyard was done in the dark but I feel it through the movie off from the other shadowed scenes of the night. However the scene where the characters were on a ship going to Blackwell's hideout was filmed in just enough light to lead you in curious of what will happen next.<br/><br/>The language and costumes were extremely useful in capturing the movie as well. The author made sure to keep everything in its time of 1891 and just played on the line of modernism. The demography was still based on the past days of London but the characters had some modern day language that you could still follow the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all for me the movie was a great success. The director delivered an unbelievable cast with exciting plot and adventure. The background and setting of the film kept me in 1891 but still left me in the present with the dialogue and upbeat language. The film truly showed the essence of the true Sherlock Holmes and Watson duo, which I believe it was meant to do."

","Sherlock Holmes- where to begin... This was my first proper introduction to the world of Holmes (I knew the basic story), and it was instantaneously captivating. Guy Ritchie's stylistic approach to film-making enhanced every moment of the film, especially the style in which the flashbacks and Holmes' 'preparations' for an attack are portrayed. His direction is sublime and the cast could not have been better. Mark Strong has a huge on-screen presence as antagonist Lord Blackwood, whilst Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr play off of each other with such ease and perfect timing as Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes. The banter and awkwardness between them is very funny to watch and at the same time very thought-provoking. One thing my Film Studies teacher pointed out was the subtle hints at a homosexual relationship between Watson and Holmes, and when you watch it you will see that play out. Ritchie does a fantastic job of utilising and authentically creating the Victorian-London setting, with a climatic scene happening on an unfinished Tower Bridge. Despite heavy use of CGI, it fits together seamlessly in Ritchie's interpretation of the world of Holmes. To the plot itself, you can expect twists, turns and surprises- there's never a dull moment in this action-heavy detective drama. Witty dialogue, exciting action, dynamic characterisation, mystery and bromance- you'll be wanting to watch it again and again and again. I don't want to give too much away, because there is much more to be said about this film, but I think I'll leave you to discover it for yourself and I hope this review has given you enough of an insight into the film to make you want to watch it. The reason I didn't give it the full 10/10 is because some elements of the plot are, admittedly, a bit far-fetched. But hey, this is film- why not indulge in a little impossibility? And on that note- case closed."

","Well, they have done it again. Another Sherlock Holmes update and not even a good one for that matter. I praise Robert Downey, Jr. for his charming performance as the eccentric detective, but that is probably the only thing worth seeing. The use of long, sleep-inducing action scenes is unnecessary. Guy Ritchie is marketing to a younger audience and he fails to meet the intelligent story that a Sherlock Holmes film should have. In this Holmes yarn, Sherlock uncovers a vast conspiracy set up by Occult leader (Mark Strong). Ritchie wastes little time throwing brainless action scenes at us, but does take his time to unravel aspects of the characters. Even with Downey's witty and even at times brilliant performance, the movie fails as a whole."

I think Rachel Macadam's is gorgeous and actually was quite well suited to the part. I think that Guy Ritchie is a really good director and admire his work but only in a particular genre, namely movies about London Cons, in this he excels. Basically Sherlock Holmes should have been good but it was actually mediocre drivel that would have had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spinning in his grave. Anyone who had ever watched Edward Hardwick and Jeremy Brett as Watson and Holmes need look no further. They were brilliant and totally but exquisitely typecast. Brett was Holmes to the end of his life. The settings were well researched and authentic, the costumes amazing. The acting and direction amazing and above all it was very intelligent and rewarding in the extreme. All of the cast and Guy Ritchie would have done well to have read 'Sherlock Holmes' and to have watched the Brett/Hardwick version because then they would have had some idea of what would have been expected. Ridley Scott should have directed this movie. Charles Dance should have been Holmes and Ralph Fiennes, Watson or maybe Jeremy Northam. Why wasn't I consulted?

","There is nothing worse that a simple fun oriented film and story that pretends to be an intellectual artistic exercise. I find this sort of pretense not only annoying and deceiving to the spectator, but also artistically contrapuntal as you cannot seat and just watch the movie for what it is. If you want to show off your feathers, better be real! Guy Ritchie, the actors and producers have insisted that this movie not only captures the essence of the original, but also reinvents it, but both statements are delusional. In fact, I thought that the TV series ""Sherlock"" offers more artistry, inventiveness, interestingness and mystery that Richie's, it is true to the original but still adds elements of modernity that can be enjoyed by modern audiences.<br/><br/>I have read the books, which I immensely enjoyed, and I did not find Sherlock in this movie, or at least the SH I had imagined when reading the books. Robert Downey Jr destroys the credibility and essence of the original character and turns it into an eccentric clown; he is funny, actually, but is not SH to me. Without a good Sherlock Holmes, the rest is not worth a penny. The rest of the acting is OK: Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong. and Kelly Reilly are Dr. John Watson, Irene Adler, Lord Blackwood, and Mary respectively. Robert Maillet was fun as giant Dreader. Eddie Marsan was unconvincing as Inspector Lestrade, though.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining, as all SH's stories are, has some moments of fun and is visually stunning, full of action and special effects. I liked the visual style of connecting slow/fast motion elements (typical of Ritchie) with SH's deductive way of thinking, which makes clear for the viewer why SH immediately gets what is happening and what is going to happen. The digital recreation of London and the mood of the era are certainly impressive; I specially liked the slumdog sort of areas and shops, not as much the general views of the city that looked a bit oniric and cartoon-ish (video-game-ish actually) at times. This is an action-packed movie that relegates to a second place the logical deduction, pace and essence of the original books.<br/><br/>Utterly pretentious, mildly entertaining, easily forgettable."

","Firstly: This movie was so far off base of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, it was ridiculous. Irene Adler being an ex-lover, and the absent heroin/cocaine addiction being the biggest things changed.<br/><br/>But even with that, it was a watchable movie. I can't quite explain why; I would typically say, that if it wasn't based off a book, it would have been quite a good movie. But that doesn't quite work here. I wouldn't watch it again, but I don't consider it a total waste of my time.<br/><br/>So I guess watch it to make up your own mind. It's quite a decent movie, just incredibly different from the books, in serious and large ways.<br/><br/>*spoilers* I hate it when they take a classic, and turn it into a PC romance, which is just what they did. Anyone who has read the original stories will know Holmes would never have been in the company of Irene Adler except to arrest her. And his cocaine addiction -while not a focal point- is something that comes up frequently in the stories, as something he does to keep his mind sharp in between cases. Also, Holmes would NEVER have considered using 'mystical' powers or whatnot. He was hard-core empirical, and would have continued searching for a logical, scientific explanation till he died, rather than mess with something he didn't believe in, and -on more than one occasion- was disdainful of."

In a fight, we see Holmes plan his next several moves the split-second before he needs to use them.

Holmes values Watson's companionship and doesn't want the duo to split up. Their differing styles complement each other so well. Rachel McAdams plays the female lead, Sherlock's old flame and a cunning thief.<br/><br/>This movie isn't quite like earlier screen incarnations of Arthur Conan Doyle's literary hero. But that is in no way a bad thing. This film stays true to the essence of the master detective, while telling a fun and exciting story. Downey's Holmes is unquestionably a genius intellect, as well as a master of disguise and a decent fighter. He smokes a pipe, he plays a fiddle, he has odd hobbies, he's very witty, and he's a tad inept socially. Law's Watson, an army veteran, is a man of action and a capable right-hand man (a departure from the bumbling image the character sometimes conjures up). The film is fairly action- packed, with some brawls and a couple big CGI set pieces. But the focus remains on Holmes and his impressive deductive powers. The tone set by the director and actors makes this a fun Victorian Era adventure. (The whole affair has an almost ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" vibe, on a smaller scale.)<br/><br/>The main case is a complex web of murder and mysticism, but the fun is in accompanying Downey's Holmes for the ride."

","I was sort of interested in a new version of one of literature's greatest detectives, and then I was worried when I saw Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) was directing, but I watched it nonetheless. Basically Detective Sherlock Holmes (Golden Globe winning Robert Downey Jr.) and his faithful companion Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) have caught one of the deadliest killers in London, Lord Henry Blackwood (Mark Strong), who killed four people and was on his fifth with a satanic ritual. Months later his sentence of hanging is carried out, and with no cases to solve for ages Sherlock has resorted to fighting in the boxing ring, while Watson is engaged to be married to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). They are brought back together however by the reports that Blackwood has returned from the dead and is resuming his killing spree, so they are looking into all the facts as to how and why he is doing his stuff. While examining the clues, the pair get help from the capable former lover of Sherlock, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), and they also contending with the dim-witted Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan). All the clues lead to the big plot Blackwood has to take over the British government, and ultimately the world, with the help of a little black magic and some deadly chemical contraptions. In the end, Sherlock not only stops the plot, saves Irene and kills the villain, but all the facts are laid out for you to re-examine and fit all the pieces together. Also starring William Hope as Ambassador Standish, James Fox as Sir Thomas Rotheram, Hans Matheson as Lord Coward, Calendar Girls' Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson, Robert Maillet as Dredger, Clive Russell as Captain Tanner and William Houston as Constable Clark. Downey Jr. was good at the English accent, and had a few very tiny giggles, but I found him just a little too eccentric as the famous detective, Law was alright as his sidekick, McAdams is quite sexy with her accent and attitude, and Strong is okay but pretty wooden as a villain. It was alright to see Holmes without the stereotypical deer stalker hat and calabash pipe, but at the same time, I might have preferred it, but for all the action and follow the clues element, not a bad period mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction and Best Music for Hans Zimmer. Worth watching!"

","Guy Ritchie is the British equivalent of Stephen Spielberg here in the US. He has great talent, he works with big named actors and the movies he makes are usually successful because everyone knows who he is. But unlike Spielberg, Ritchie is a film maker that is know as a formalist, where the film is all about ""does everything look good?"", rather than the realistic style of film making where one would ask ""could this actually happen?"" <br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes"" is a perfect example of this, because you don't care if the story good, (if there really was one, it just seemed too labyrinth like, and any where you turn could get you lost or going in circles.) But a movie doesn't need a story to be good, it just needs to look good (which this film does), sound good (which this film does thanks to both the sound and music departments), and have very strong and likable actors (which this film does for the most part.)But the majority of the film was about Robert Downey Jr. kicking some hardcore butt, giant explosions, very well executed sense of humor and the overall mood of the film matched perfectly with the setting (and vice versa.)<br/><br/>Was this film like the original Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Doyle? You bet your sweet lippy it's not. Of course it is nothing like the original Sherlock Holmes, because Holmes was just an English detective, as opposed to the film where he was an English detective and at the same time an Irish Cage fighter.But that is not important! Mr. Ritchie just took Sir. Arthur's classic character and made him his own.<br/><br/>There were a few times where I was confused, the ""story"" that the film was trying to tell got a little too detailed, and I felt that scenes where Holmes shows how he was going to beat up the other guy in slow motion step-by-step before he really beat the guy up was repetitive and pointless. But besides for that, I really enjoyed the film, and Guy Ritchie has some extraordinary talent as a film maker. I just hope he doesn't screw up the sequel to this, and Mr. Ritchie I am still waiting for the release of the sequel to ""Rock and Rolla."""

","Guy Ritchie's re-imagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary detective Sherlock Holmes takes the original character and updates him for modern audiences. The setting is the same (Victorian England) but Holmes is now as adept with his fists as he is with his powers of deduction.<br/><br/>In this film, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his stalwart companion, Dr. Watson (Jude Law), become embroiled in a mystery which seems to suggest authentic diabolism. A recently executed Lord has risen from the grave (or so it would seem) and Scotland Yard is baffled. We follow Holmes & Watson as they work their way through London in search of clues that will reveal the solution to this mystery.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law play the title character and the good doctor, respectively. They play the characters well while also introducing a physicality that isn't present in other interpretations of the roles. Rachel McAdams plays the requisite romantic interest and I'm pretty apathetic to her presence here. Mark Strong makes a fine villain, though, and the rest of the cast seems pretty well chosen.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie might not have been the best choice to direct this film but I guess that the producers were looking for something different. He basically directs it like he would any of his modern crime flicks, though he's got a bigger budget to work with this time around. The results are certainly passable for a blockbuster with the focus on action but I still would have preferred another approach. As for the soundtrack, I don't think that it bears comparison with Ritchie's other films, which typically excel in that department. God only knows why ""The Rocky Road to Dublin"" pops up a few times.<br/><br/>For what it is, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a enjoyable ride even if it isn't necessarily an award-worthy film. That being said, I was intrigued enough that I would watch the inevitable sequel when it arrives, so I guess that the film served its purpose."

","I'm a huge fan of director Guy Ritchie's firstlings, ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", two movies dealing with petty criminals on the streets of London with infective humour and a great, high-velocity visual style. Then Ritchie married Madonna and turned out a load of cinematic rubbish. Now the newlydiv is back with Sherlock Holmes, not your regular, stout Sherlock but a superhero flick set in Victorian times.<br/><br/>I'm not too sure about the result. As a retrograde superhero movie it works great. If that's your thing. Ritchie still knows his stuff, and Robert McDowney Jr. (Sherlock) and Jude Law (Watson) are impressive.

","Sherlock Holmes is entertaining enough, as many Hollywood products are, but it overall leaves us viewers wanting more. Or, that is, wishing more had been done, especially in the way of plot and character. The whole thing is a bit disjointed, and we the audience can never seem to emotionally attach ourselves enough to the film to really root for Sherlock and Watson.<br/><br/>As for plot, it seems the directors just couldn't settle on one path. The film starts out in London but eventually finds itself in an old, Western saloon. It mixes overly elaborate, highly complex schemes with bare-knuckled, Western-styled brawls. At times, I had trouble determining whether I was watching a 19th century crime investigation or a 18th century fight contest.<br/><br/>As for characters, my two largest qualms are with Holmes and his antagonist, Lord Blackwood. Downey plays a fantastic Holmes, but that is to be expected: the man can adapt himself to any role. But the character that we see on the big screen is far different from the traditional Sherlock Holmes. This film presents him as a witty, slightly crazed, bad-ass action hero, rather than a classy, shrewd, quirky detective. What is he, a UFC fighter? And what about Lord Blackwell: is he a ghost? We see far too little of this nemesis, considering how much havoc he reeks during the whole film. It seems we may see more of him in ""Sherlock Holmes II.""<br/><br/>However, the scenery is incredible: backdrops, buildings, furniture, streets, wardrobes, even makeup. Moreover, the cinematography is splendid from beginning to end. I was instantly drawn into the film from the movie's opening where some brilliant pulley-shots and zooms are used. Slow motion is employed in many of the ever-so frequent fight scenes, during which Sherlock explains how he'll defeat a villain before we actually view the fight in real time. Visually ‚Äî and intellectually, to explain how devastating Sherlock's attacks are ‚Äî this works well. <br/><br/>Another interesting technique is used during which we watch an intricate montage of pictures and clips while Sherlock recollects past evens in an attempt to making sense of Lord Blackwood's magic. It's one of those requiem, through-the-mind's-eye pieces: a fragmented, fast-paced sequence that is meant to visually represent thoughts pulsing through the brain. More of this technique is applied again at the film's end to reveal how Blackwood's magic was actually quite unmagical, and I rather enjoyed learning these answers in such an aesthetically-pleasing fashion. <br/><br/>I rate Sherlock Holmes as a 6/10. It's definitely worth recommending to moviegoers who enjoy a faced-paced, action-packed flick. It's visual appeal and cinematographic prowess make for a fun experience. And, of course, Robert Downey Jr. is all too good an actor for any die-hard Holmes-traditionalist to avoid watching this newest Sherlock film just because of its lack of adherence to the character's literary roots. Just don't expect to forget that you're watching a movie ‚Äî this one can't quite capture our emotions enough for that to happen. But enjoy the beautiful picture and impressive explosions."

","I want to start off by saying that as an action movie, this was just ""okay,"" but as a Sherlock Holmes movie it was the worst thing ever made. However, to enjoy it to its fullest you must pretend that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the character created by Arthur Conan Doyle. The visual aspect of the movie was excellent, stylized to make London look as bleak and godless as fit with the mood of the film. There were several cool images like opened handcuffs sliding out of smoke that a captured Holmes is supposed to be in. The bad guy is sinister and enigmatic, but not particularly ""attractive"" or charismatic. The foreshadowing by Holmes that he uses to beat people up is clever but overused in several meaningless action sequences. But the main problem was something subliminal. Similar to the repellent nature of the colors in films like ""Alexander,"" Sherlock Holmes has a color scheme that makes one drowsy. Plus, the story's not that interesting.

"TheUnseenMovieLover","8","0","0","4 June 2010"," An Energetic, Exciting Blockbuster
","Director Guy Ritchie's track record has been pretty mixed. I loved Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I enjoyed Rock'n'rolla and I strongly disliked Revolver. I haven't seen Snatch or Swept Away (the latter I am not interested in seeing), but their reputations seem to back up my point. So when I heard that Guy Ritchie was doing a tough guy, action version of Sherlock Holmes, I was concerned. Even the casting of the legendary Robert Downey Jr. didn't douse my fears, and the promotional material makes this seem more like a mindless action blockbuster than anything else. <br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised when I first this at the cinema, and watching it again on DVD, I've come to like it even more. This is because, whilst the 2009 vision of Sherlock Holmes is an action blockbuster (and a highly enthusiastic one at that), it also takes care adding layers of complexity to its two main protagonists. This is helped no end by two terrific performances by Downey Jr. and Jude Law.<br/><br/>The story kicks off with Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) apprehending the villainous Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who is responsible for a series of murders in London. Three months later, Holmes has become a recluse and Holmes is engaged to Mary (Kelly Reilly) and is planning to move out, leaving their partnership in the balance. The dynamic duo have just one last mystery to solve; the recently hung Blackwood have apparently returned from the dead, and is scheming to bring down the government through the use of dark magic. Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), the only person to ever outsmart Holmes, is also thrown into the mix. But who is the mysterious figure she's so afraid of?<br/><br/>The pulsing centre of Sherlock Holmes' appeal are the meaty, crackling performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Over the past two years, Downey Jr. has grown to become one of my favourite actors, and his performance here is as wonderfully idiosyncratic as you could expect from an actor of such a high calibre. There are many layers to Downey Jr.'s performance; whilst he is a deductive genius, he is also a social pariah (the beautiful scene where he attempts to embarrass Mary in front of Watson nails this point). There is also a nicely understated sense of loneliness in Downey Jr.'s eyes. Whilst Holmes isn't an entirely sympathetic character, Downey Jr. makes him someone who you can relate to. However, Holmes is only half the equation without Watson, and all credit should go to not only Law, but also Ritchie and the writers for giving us a Watson who doesn't linger in Holmes' shadow, as could have easily been the case. Watson doesn't have the same deductive power as Holmes (then again, who does?) But he is still a smart, capable and tough guy who is more than willing to face off with Holmes if he crosses the line. Law brilliantly mixes his usual charm with battle-hardened wit and discipline, making Watson so much more than your usual sidekick. The supporting cast is solid. Mark Strong is effortlessly sinister in yet another top-notch villainous turn. He is becoming typecast as the bad guy, but only because he plays these characters so well. Eddie Marsan is wonderfully dry as the annoyed Inspector Lestrade, whilst the beautiful Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly work wonders with their relatively underwritten, romantic interest roles. But it's the effortless chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law which raises the film above so many other action movies, and which makes Sherlock Holmes engaging, more so than the twisty plot or the big action.<br/><br/>Speaking of the action, it is surprisingly exciting. The first five minutes are breathless, quickly getting you swept up in the story. The first two fights have a original touch in which Holmes' thought process on how best to dispose of a opponent is shown before he actually launches the attack. Whilst it's a shame that it's dropped after these two fights, it nonetheless effectively shows that Holmes wins a fight through the use of his intellect, rather than sheer brawn. Only the final show-down between Holmes and Blackwood is disappointing, as it is over way too quickly, although it is saved by Downey Jr.'s deductive speech. As an action blockbuster, this is very entertaining. However, it works mainly as a buddy comedy, the banter between Holmes and Watson bearing some really funny results.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is technically astounding. The production design is stunning, with London becoming a living, breathing character along with the characters. There is a lot of detail here, and the mixture of gritty realism and blockbuster fantasy is just right. Hans Zimmer's score pulses with organic energy, giving brilliant atmosphere to the film. And, apart from one rather obvious sequence involving a huge boat, the visual effects are seamless, effortlessly recreating 1800's London.<br/><br/>Ritchie deserves a big round of applause for his direction. He brings real energy and enthusiasm to this, and makes sure that the characters are actually worth caring about. Considering his personal problems (namely, his deteriorating relationship with Madonna), Ritchie should be commended for throwing himself into his work. The screenplay is also nicely written, combining darkness and wit with a playfulness which is surprisingly endearing (although it's a pretty far stretch when Watson yells out ""Nut him"" during a scrap).<br/><br/>Overall, Sherlock Holmes is an immensely entertaining piece of entertainment. It isn't flawless. The plot is overly complex first time around, although it becomes clearer after numerous viewings, whilst McAdams and Reilly deserved more screen time and the screenplay has some all-too-modern moments. But under the well-made action sequences and the top-notch production values is a wonderful relationship between Holmes and Watson, brought to life with relish by Downey Jr. and Law, which brings the film to life. Bring on the sequel!"

The main characters play well off each other, I must admit not being a Jude Law fan I was quite dubious that he was the best choice out there but I cannot fault him as his Watson is exactly what I wanted from the role.<br/><br/>I believe that working with such established characters the movie didn't stop to introduce them, instead we move straight into an excellent pre credit scene where we see the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) unveiled early on, with his supposed super-natural abilities that are later revealed to be the illusions they are. Unfortunately Mark Strong, with whom I have high hopes for if he continues his recent run of form, was massively underused considering his natural talent for playing the bad guy.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's take on the late 1800's London is dark and dirty, but sets the tone perfectly with a half built Tower Bridge catching the skyline and being the setting for the movies climax. The action scenes have had some scrutiny in some of the articles I have read but I don't see it, I feel they fit the films pace and subject, as he is a detective after all and he wouldn't get very far by blowing everything up. I particularly liked Holmes plan of attack, step by step going through each strike and assessing the damage it would do before executing them.<br/><br/>It is left wide open for a sequel with Holmes' primary enemy Professor Moriaty seemingly pulling the strings behind Irene Adler's (Rachel McAdams), Holmes old flame, involvement.

","Sherlock Holmes has fascinated me as a character for ages. Despite I've begun to read the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle just recently the character of Holmes has been familiar to me through movies and TV-series. Personally I don't mind variation from the source what comes to adaptations, but there's couple of things which need to be present in a Holmes story: his keen intellect, superiority over foes and of course Watson. And all these things are present as well the trait of Holmes to do first and then reveal his plan to the viewer (or reader).<br/><br/>So in this new version of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey JR.) our master detective is against a conspiracy coined by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and together with Dr. Watson (Jude Law) and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) he must stop this seemingly supernatural fiend.<br/><br/>As it is with Holmes he's deeply rational man who is not fooled by mere superstition while others may be blinded with sleigh of hand. So we see him outsmarting people left and right and the story ends with a cliffhanger with the looming threat of Moriarty in the future.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has assembled a fine cast, but the structure of the movie is a bit troubled. The story begins strong and it has great scenes through out, but there are some parts in it which feel like the makers had run out of steam and ideas. At first I also did find the sound track a bit distracting, but it did start to work better towards the end. All in all Sherlock Holmes gets better towards the end, so it ended up as a pretty entertaining movie."

He breathes new life into Sherlock Holmes, this being the first Holmes theatrical film in 21 years. He brings a grittier, seedier take on the role (there is one scene where Watson nags him over his poor personal hygiene!). This is one of the few Holmes films where you will see him fighting with his fists as well as with his wits. The thought that I had watching this very entertaining film is that I hope they make a sequel (SPOILER ALERT, they leave the door open in the end). In addition to lauding Robert Downey, I also wanted to praise Jude Law for being a fine Doctor Watson. In the Basil Rathbone films, Nigel Bruce played Watson as a doddering old fool and I thought that was making Arthur Conan Doyle turn in his grave. Law plays Watson as he should be played. Watson is no bumbling, fool, in Doyle's stories he was a skilled doctor and a brave steady man in a crisis. In fact, the script plays Watson as Holmes equal in every way! There is even a scene where he saves Holme's life. The plot is intriguing, the special effects and action are magnificent but in the end its Downey and Law who make this film worth your time."

","Guy Ritchie has directed a Sherlock Holmes film. And it's turned out as you'd expect a Guy Ritchie directed Sherlock Holmes film to be like.

He engages in bare knuckle boxing, has a distinctly Mid Atlantic accent and makes clear his disapproval of Dr. Watson moving out of Baker Street to live with his fianc√©e. The plot is as much action thriller as whodunit with a couple of epic chase sequences that Arthur Conan Doyle must have left out of his books in error.<br/><br/>It is a highly enjoyable film though. The plot is suitably far fetched, involving the take over the British government through Black Magic. The cast are excellent. Robert Downey Junior obviously has a ball as a charming and cynical Holmes. Jude Law is nicely understated as the resourceful doctor. Mark Strong is an excellent villain.

","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, only to revive him when the public reacted unfavorably. If he were alive today, he'd probably come to the conclusion that he made the right choice, since the medium of film has truly made sure the great detective will never die: from Basil Rathbone to Billy Wilder via Disney's The Great Mouse Detective to TV's Dr. Gregory House, there's a version of Holmes for all ages and tastes. And now he gets the Hollywood treatment again, albeit with a British director, one Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>Rather than adapting a specific story, the film goes in its own direction: Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) has just solved a series of grisly murders, but is unhappy because his loyal assistant Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is moving out of their apartment on Baker Street to live with his fianc√©e Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Soon enough, though, he has more important things to worry about: his former adversary/lover Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is back in London, and a new chain of macabre events, linked to the alleged resurrection of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), requires his full attention, especially as the fact seem to go against his belief that everything has a rational explanation.<br/><br/>The announcement that Ritchie, the man behind Snatch and RocknRolla, was going to direct Sherlock Holmes was met with some preoccupation due to his fast-paced, ""hip"" style which many see as the polar opposite of the traditional Holmes story. Additionally, the fact that five writers worked on the script caused some extra anxiety. As it turns out, there was no need to worry on either front: the screenplay has enough smarts and wit to satisfy Conan Doyle purists, while Ritchie's ""action"" take on the character, which is vaguely rooted in the books (Holmes has been described as a decent amateur boxer), never distracts too much from the mystery, the humor - Holmes' occasional mockery of the police makes for some hilarious conversations with Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade - or the flawless reconstruction of Victorian England (although he could have avoided the use of slow-motion in the fight scenes).<br/><br/>Cast-wise, the two leads are perfect: Downey, no stranger to quirky roles, nails the detective's accent, sarcasm and brilliance with relish (the script also allows for a subtle reference to Holmes' cocaine addiction), while Law counterbalances it with a more serious but charismatic Watson, getting as far away as possible from the chubby buffoon seen in previous incarnations. Strong, always among the best things in any movie where he appears, is an enjoyably sinister antagonist, and McAdams is funny and alluring in equal measure, despite the lack of depth granted to her part (the same goes for Reilly, the other woman in what is otherwise pretty much a ""bloke's movie"").<br/><br/>All in all, this new, ""youthful"" version of Sherlock Holmes gets most of the vital things right: it is a blockbuster at heart, but still packs enough charm and potential to make sure the practically inevitable sequel - whose focus on Professor Moriarty is hinted at numerous times during the film - will be the kind of superior big-screen treatment Holmes craves and deserves.

Guy Ritchie has set the stage for a re invention of a timeless character, Expect more to follow."

","The movie tries to remain spiritually faithful to the iconic figure of Holmes, although for many, it may not be the Holmes one is used to. Robert Downy Jr. & Jude Law were excellent together, they got it right on the first shot, the chemistry between them was really on point. (I guess thats because they're great Actors). Also I think If Robert Downy Jr. keeps it up he's going to have Hollywood on lock as the go to actor for the next couple of years. Overall the movie was very enjoyable and I can see it being a good re-branded franchise. So I dare to recommend it if you haven't seen it yet. , I found the film enjoyable and an homage to what's gone before, giving Holmes humanity, displaying his dark days and neuroses as well as his brilliance. Downey, despite his total lack of Holmesian physical attributes, succeeds - and Jude Law is the perfect Watson. If you're a staunch purist, skip this one."

","I found it strange when I read reviews that people were labeling Guy Ritchie's new film as a travesty of sorts to the canon of Sherlock Holmes. Not only did I find the film delightfully refreshing, it is easily one of the best thrillers of the year. It plays like a classic mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes and injects enough kinetic action into it without sacrificing the integrity of the Holmes canon. In fact I would argue that not only does it not sacrifice the integrity, it ENHANCES it.<br/><br/>The vision of Sherlock Holmes with the deerstalker cap and the clogs and the meticulous tidy demeanor is one concocted purely in some fictional alternate universe where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle apparently never existed. The Sherlock Holmes from the book was a fast-living, eccentric, drug-abusing, fairly obnoxious character whose intelligence was not only a gift, but a curse; it managed to alienate everyone he had ever known, save for a few friends in the police force who admired him and his dearest friend, Dr. Watson (played by Jude Law). Not only is he a more energetic Holmes, he's a much more accurate and faithful one too. We get to see more of his physical side (in conjunction with a considerable amount of his mental side, in fact; I can't begin to count the number of times in the film we see Holmes use logical deduction and quick thinking to piece together facts, even at the eleventh hour). This is, again, in keeping with his character from the stories - he does know martial arts and he is a master of disguise.<br/><br/>The story itself is immensely entertaining too. The film starts out with him supposedly closing a case involving a Satanic serial killer, who turns out to be a nobleman in the House of Lords, namely, Lord Blackwood (who is yet another cameo character). Blackwood is tried and hanged soon thereafter, and old flame Irene Adler (ANOTHER cameo character - see, how can the Holmes enthusiasts NOT love this film?) comes to him with a case. There is a subplot about her working with another person, which I won't reveal as it's a fantastic revelation near the end of the film, but Holmes quickly discovers that her case is connected to Blackwood's - who apparently is no longer dead and has risen from the grave. The film is largely spent trying to figure out Blackwood's endgame, making logical leaps throughout and culminating in an intensely exciting climax.<br/><br/>Dr. Watson is a heavily improved character from the bumbling comic relief he served in the television series - in fact, he is more accurately depicted (though without the limp), as a veteran of the Afghan wars, and a stout, powerful man with some martial arts capabilities of his own. Most importantly, his relationship with Holmes as his closest friend, more than a brother, is given high importance and much more respectful treatment. Holmes is devastated to learn that Watson is not only getting engaged and married, but that he's going to move out of 221B Baker Street. The two prove to be nearly inseparable companions, although of course his irritation with Holmes does occasionally reach a boiling point (as it should).<br/><br/>Anyone - including those new to Holmes and Holmes fans/enthusiasts - is going to love this movie. It takes a ton of talent to produce a movie like this and I can't wait for a sequel."
"ryshpr","9","0","0","5 February 2010"," A brilliant reboot.
","Sherlock Holmes, the latest offering from Guy Richie is a pretty decent movie if I'm honest. Not at all what I expected. For the most part you don't even feel like you're watching a movie. For instance, part of the opening titles are superimposed onto cobblestones and the other part is written in a newspaper-like form. It's a pretty refreshing change.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear from the outset that Downey Jr. nails Holmes' accent and speech patterns. Not once do you believe the actor playing Holmes' actually has an American accent, and the same can be said for Jude Law as Watson.<br/><br/>Although I don't usually comment on the soundtrack of films, I do feel I should mention the soundtrack in Sherlock Holmes. Hans Zimmer's 'Discombobulate' is used at various points in the movie, most notably in the opening credits and it helps greatly in setting the scene. It's hard to imagine a better fitting score for this movie.<br/><br/>Although this is going to sound pretty clich√©, Jude Law is on fine form here, his portrayal of Dr. Watson as both a friend of Holmes and as a professional is literally flawless, the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law works extremely well. Mark Strong is brilliant as the movie's villain Lord Blackwood, he seems to play bad guys pretty well, he's all you could want from the 'dark side': mysterious, cunning and quite creepy. A notable highlight here for me was Rachel McAdams' portrayal of Irene Adler, a criminal and past love-interest of Holmes'. McAdams has certainly come a long way since her Mean Girls days and really shows exactly what she can do with her acting skills here.<br/><br/>Acting talent aside, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to my local cinema to see Sherlock Holmes. The martial arts aspect was new to me. I've never pictured Sherlock Holmes as a martial artist, but it did bring a decent helping of action to the table. There's a pretty decent helping of humour here too; the movie works surprisingly well with a small helping of comedy thrown in here and there, although there's not enough there for big laughs, it brings a certain charm to the scene.<br/><br/>I won't ruin any of the story in this review as I'm aware my past two reviews were a little too revealing in terms of plot details and spoilers. All I can say is if you haven't already, I would strongly recommend going to see Sherlock Holmes. There really is something there for anyone.<br/><br/>http://ukmore.tk/"

","There have been many versions of sherlock holmes before but this is definitely the best so far. Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) portrays Sherlock Holmes brilliantly and is greatly supported by Jude Law as Dr. Watson. This combination has brought life into this classic. The movie is fast paced and has some good twists. Though the overall character development is not perfect the chemistry between Jude and RDJ was awesome.<br/><br/>The narration is half baked and very repetitive in certain portions. The other characters also do justice to their roles and have shown great scene presence. Guy Ritchie has done a great job in the direction department has again shown that his movies have a dark comedy element to it like some of his previous flicks like Lock Stock or even Snatch.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes in the script but again they are because of the poor narration and some screenplay flaws. The background score was pretty commendable. Also certain dialogues cant be understood clearly at all due to mumbling by RDJ(really irritating at times).<br/><br/>The art direction needs a special mention for some great sets and the overall look. The movie is a definite entertainer and a will be a great watch. The movie's ending shows hopes for a great sequel and looking forward to that<br/><br/>Verdict : 7/10"
"Henry_Ireton","9","0","0","1 February 2010"," Elementary My Dear Ritchie
","The first thought I had when hearing about this film was one of disappointment that director Guy Ritchie had clearly pandered to the American box office audience and chosen an American to play Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential Victorian gent. However it must be said that RDJ does an excellent job at portraying the opium addicted waster genius of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books so over looked and avoided by other versions of the film.<br/><br/>There is an odd sort of chemistry between RDJ and Jude Law which makes this particular pairing of Holmes and Watson one you like and care about. Jude Law is not one of my favourite actors but he seems to get it just right as Watson and you sympathise with him the entire film. Whilst both characters are portrayed in a way that is totally unreal for the age in which the film is set, they are real as characters. Ritchie gives them the earthiness we've come to expect and throws a degree of London wide boy into the mix as Victorian London meets Lock Stock and two smokers. As a director he has clearly unshackled Jude Law from the chains of Nigel Davenports bumbling Watson and freed Downey from the pompousness of Basil Rathbone's Holmes.<br/><br/>The CGI is excellent and not over worked, Ritchie thankfully holding back from using too much CGI but instead there is a wonderful use of set & costume design which really adds an ambiance to the movie and carries you off to the age. Dialogue is rich and strong, the script and plot carries nicely and you feel yourself on a roller-coaster ride not wanting to get off.<br/><br/>Here comes the spoiler, of sorts, you are inevitable introduced to professor Moriarty, those of you familiar with the books would have guessed it all along so it's not really a spoiler as such, but Ritchie cleverly introduces you to him in a way which leaves the movie hanging and you walk out the theatre with the sense of an impending sequel or series of Holmes Movies to follow, and why not? This was a great film which I thoroughly enjoyed, I didn't want it to end and would urge people not to wait for the DVD but go to see it on the big screen."
"rharwoodx","8","0","0","1 February 2010"," Superb action mystery
","From the opening shot of a camera rushing up behind a cart on the streets of London Guy Ritchie's signature kinetic style is on full display, and it is the fact that this energy is matched head on by Robert Downey Jr's exuberant turn as the titular hero that in large part makes this such an enjoyable film. This is a film where you cannot point at any singular part of the whole as the strongest part as it is impossible to imagine any without the other. The energy and wit of the script match the performances and the direction. It seems to be one of those movies where everything just fell into place.<br/><br/>For me some of the most enjoyable moments of the film were just watching Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr's banter as they go back and forth, they inhabit their characters in a way rarely found in larger Hollywood productions nowadays. Some of the awkward moments that occur between the two as they traverse their complicated and realistic relationship with each other are priceless. This isn't a deep movie by any means but it does touch on some interesting themes of friendship and the choices we have to make as we move forward in life.<br/><br/>A word must be said about the fight scenes. While they won't be winning any awards for kung fu choreography the melee is universally impressive and believable, except where it's turned on it's head for comic value. This ability of the film to jump back and forth effectively from violent comical romp to period mystery and back almost seamlessly illustrates Guy Ritchie's assured hand behind the camera, never veering too far into gravitas, and at the same time wholly avoiding camp. They are never making fun of the material, they are having fun with the material.<br/><br/>As far as I could tell the production design was flawless, every scene seemed as big or as small as it needed to be, and there are a couple of impressive set pieces thrown in there too. This movies budget came in at about $90 million and you can surely see it in the scenes where the set is literally being ripped apart. All in all Sherlock Holmes has a strong script, good acting (superb from Robert and Jude), great casting, and confident, imaginative direction from a director who seems to have found a project that plays to all of his strengths and none of his weaknesses."

","Just finished watching it, and had some good feelings, unfortunately only at the end.<br/><br/>First of all, this is really the first Sherlock Holmes film I've seen with real, living characters. Actually, this is only partly true. Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams plays almost real characters, unfortunately sometimes still not enough, and the rest of the cast is just the necessary clich√©.<br/><br/>All the film long I was thinking, and that is really unfortunate, it should grab me, and it just does not happen. There were not even a single moment when I could have felt anything i.e. worrying towards the characters, not even a single emotion, except the humor.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock Holmes really the best ever, and Jude Law's Dr. Watson is an interesting interpreting of the original character (I mean, almost nothing to do with).<br/><br/>Although, the camera is fine, the music is sometimes quite good, and the directing is not mediocre -and not fantastic, either-, the story is a good plot but less well-written, forgettable CGI, good editing; the movie works mainly by the hilarious Downey-Law duo. The whole movie is not as interesting, entertaining as their comedy parts. This could have been a Holmes-Watson stand-up comedy...<br/><br/>Anyway, first film I find Jude Law a watchable actor, and again, a very positive disappointment in Robert Downey Jr, despite sometimes he himself turns to be his own parody.<br/><br/>Well, ""Guy Ritchie"" signs can be recognized in some fight scenes, what is surprising and good for the first and second time, but then just tiring and boring, the dialogs and the main duo's atmosphere is good, sometimes great, however he fails to give a dark feeling, or any drama proposition. Fortunately, it is not a typical Hollywood cheesy action pop, but the best parts -when the movie start to work at all- are these scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, only Mr Downey makes this movie work, and worthy to watch, because of him, despite the fact, he seems to be old for this type of character..."

","So, what do we do whilst we are waiting for the next James Bond film to come along? Well, here's one suggestion, go watch the new version of Sherlock Holmes! This Sherlock certainly has all the elements you would expect of Holmes - the pipe, poor violin playing, untidy quarters, a methodical mind, and, of course, his reliable side kick Watson. But what makes this Sherlock stand out is the way in which he goes about his job - here chasing after a mysterious figure (a wonderful Mark Strong creation) who may, or may not, be using the dark arts to bring down the world order - is the fact that he throws himself (and Watson, LeStrade and just about everyone else who happens to be at hand) into his work ala Mr Bond - all fast action, shot-em ups and near misses - all neatly wrapped up at the end with all the good guys living happy ever after! Does this approach work - well, yes! And it does so mainly because of the way both Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law look like they are really having fun - as do all the females (especially Rachel McAdams). The film rattles along at a cracking pace, and any holes in the plot are nice smoothed out with some clever 'wrapping up' at the end. Also the atmosphere of Olde London Town is nicely done - all fog and mist, muck and horses etc.<br/><br/>If you like your Holmes fast paced and full of action then this is the Holmes for you - if not, go along and you still might enjoy the difference."

","This is not the 221b Baker Street sleuth as we are used to him, but instead a character who is as muscular as he is cerebral in an action-packed romp that starts as it goes on with lively music (Hans Zimmer) and even livelier direction (Guy Ritchie). Robert Downey Jr would not be an obvious choice to play the London detective but he is a charismatic and very accomplished actor who here affects a very passable English accent. The interplay between Holmes and his assistant Dr Watson (Jude Law) works really well, but the female characters (Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly) are sadly underplayed.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes effectively recreate late 19th century London and the depiction of a half built Tower Bridge is wonderful, although how various characters manage to climb from the depths of Parliament to the top of the bridge - quite some distance down river - utterly escapes me. So I guess it's better not to enquire too closely what is going on (it's often rather confusing), but simply enjoy the entertaining ride which sets us up nicely for a sequel in which Holmes will face off with that dastardly Moriarty."

At least they were not teenagers...<br/><br/>Was it too far fetched? A little, but the books were also a mix of mystery and cat and mouse games. Was the movie too flashy in its special effects? Yes, and so rendered the fabled deduction capabilities of Sherlock Holmes as nothing more than parlour tricks. His sense of smell was more prevalent in the film than his thinking. Was it entertaining? Sort of, but never over the top.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if they would have cut short on the steam age supertechnology and the action sequences and made the script a little more involving, it would have been a much better movie. As such, it remains a silly action film in the same league as Indiana Jones, entertaining, but never engaging."

","I was unsure of what to expect at first, given the book's wordy structure and the trailer's emphasis on the action scenes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a very entertaining take on Sherlock Holmes. It balanced, very adeptly I might add, both action and mystery. The film is, of course, Holmes trying to get to the bottom of a mystery; the way this is done, however, is very entertaining. The look inside Holmes's mind in the form of short flashes of video, coupled with the grainy style of the movie is very compelling. I especially liked the expositions and the clever ways the film makers used to advance the plot. I feel, in fact, that I am hard pressed to come up with a reasonable complaint, given that all my expectations were met and exceeded. I suppose that it was a tad ridiculous and elaborate, but then it wouldn't be Sherlock Holmes if it was not. I guess my favorite thing about this movie was that, when I left the theater, it made me want to be able to do those crazy detective things. I know they are mostly impossible, but never the less, I really want to be able to examine a given situation and deduce something about it. I realize that the acting was not exactly Godfather level, and that it didn't really leave any haunting psychological questions about human nature in my mind, But I don't really care. It was a really awesome ride."

","In recent times films set in the Victorian Era have become more popular, examples being Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and The Prestige. Sherlock Holmes has been big property over the years, from novels and short stories, to film and TV programmes. Even when Sherlock Holmes was in it's cinematic hiatus, there was still TV movies and programmes, and Holmes has always been in the public consciousness. Warner Brothers has had great success with franchises like Harry Potter and Batman, and obviously want to continue with more established material. It has also become more popular to reboot franchise because of the success of Batman and James Bond.<br/><br/>In Victorian London Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) prevent the murder of a young woman by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a Occultist responsible for four other murders. He is sentenced to be death. In the midst of all this Watson has found love with Mary (Kelly Reilly), and plans to move out, much to Holmes' distress. They take a hiatus in crime solving, with Holmes continuing with their experiments. But the pair are thrown back into the case when Lord Blackwood seems to have risen from the grave. This becomes a threat to Watson's reputation who declared the man dead, and could lead to a revolt by Blackwood's followers. Holmes is also brought back into contact with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), an American theft, who he loves, and the only person to best him. She ask for his help, to find a man, a scientist. Holmes quickly finds out that this is linked to Blackwood and his people. He is thrown in even deeper when a secret society, whom leaders include the Home Secretary, the American Ambassador and a senior Judge. They want to stop Blackwood, who plays to murder to make himself more powerful.<br/><br/>The aim of the reboot is to try and bring Sherlock Holmes to a younger audience. They want to take away all Holmes clich√©s like the Deerstalker Hat and Watson as a bumbling fool. Holmes becomes a man who gets very involved in action, and shows he is an inventor. It is meant to be closer to the books by Arthur Coyle Doyle: I don't know if it's true because I haven't read them. This version of Sherlock Holmes was made as an action/comedy, namely a buddy comedy. They are some decent action scenes, but some were over edited. There was also some psychical comedy, but the best comedy came from the buddy relationship between the two lead characters. Holmes and Watson are basically an old married couple, bickering throughout, but do respect each other and need each other. There are chalk and cheese, both be very different. The dialogue was key and I'm sure Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Ritchie had a hand in it.<br/><br/>The best member of the cast was Jude Law, which is surprising. Watson is made into a straight, tough war veteran, who shows to be intelligent and has skills as a detective. He is a loyal friend to Holmes despite everything he has done. Downey is decent, and he obviously play the character against type. He gives the character a comic edge but shows that he is able to think ahead and sees clues that no ones else does. Mark Strong is a top actor, who has worked with Ritchie before; and makes an excellent villain. However he isn't given enough screen time. Rachel McAdams in 2009 has become a big star, staring in State of Play, The Time Travelling Wife and of course Sherlock Holmes. She is obviously an attractive woman and has a future ahead of her, but I thought her performance was lacking.<br/><br/>After the success of Lock, Stock and Snatch Guy Ritchie career was seeming to heading for great things, but ends up torching himself when marrying Madonna, and making two massive floats. Divorcing Madonna was the wisest thing he did, having a partial return to form with Rocknrolla, and now he has finally done his first blockbuster. He injects energy into the action scenes, adds wit, and because of the setting there is no mockery gangsterism. He brings in his own style, I thought the slow motion bits surprisingly worked, and the flashbacks and showing of clues reminded me of his previous films.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is the script. One of the writers was Simon Kinberg, who is one of the worst writers in Hollywood, having written XXX 2, X-Men 3 and Jumper and acted as a script doctor to Charlie Angels 2 and Fantastic Four (hardly a good CV). His aim is focus on action and not on plot. At least he was working on a screenplay already written by others first. This was written as a action film, when it should have been written as a detective film with action in it. The focus should have been the case. The plot itself isn't anything inspired and more thought should have been used to make it a tighter story. It was just a series of events leading to action sequences. The revelation at the end which is meant to lead to the sequel also felt a bit too forced. Hopefully the sequel will have better writers. The film also felt longer then 2 hours and dragged in places, especially in the beginning. Never a good sign.<br/><br/>Overall, fairly enjoyable. I give it a 7.3 overall. I liked the dog in the film as well."

","From the trailer alone, I knew that Guy Ritchie's take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic character Sherlock Holmes was a departure from what I had imagined this ace detective to be as I read his books. Of course, the keen eye for detail and the amazing powers of deduction Holmes is well-known for is there. But seeing Holmes shirtless, bare-knuckle boxing for money, and looking like Robert Downey Jr., was certainly not the image of Sherlock I had in mind.<br/><br/>The lead cast is instrumental in bringing this film to vivid life. Robert Downey Jr. recreates the role of Sherlock Holmes and made it his own. His delivery of those witty one-liners are too funny. Jude Law is very good in his portrayal of the fastidious Dr. Watson. He also isn't exactly what I imagined Watson to be, but is close enough. Their chemistry together is impeccable, very effective in driving this film forward.<br/><br/>However, I did not really like the main supporting cast. Rachel Mc Adams, I do not really like this actress since ""The Notebook"", and I think she wasted the Irene Adler character. Mark Strong as the main villain Lord Blackwood, had a strong and sinister face on close-ups, but his overall appearance and bearing in full body shots were not imposing enough to conjure fear in the audience.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this was a very good movie. The script was interesting, humorous and intelligent. The action sequences were exciting and well-executed. They made good use of computer imagery to recreate Victorian London and the diabolical mysteries afoot. Overall, this was a very good mainstream effort by Guy Ritchie. He had succeeded to transform the cerebral Sherlock of old into a brawny blockbuster hero fit for these hyperactive times."

Sticking close enough to the original tales and their relations as well as adding enough flavors of current time dark cinema and his own personal traits (the feel of typical British crime-comedy that made him famous) this film works like a charm. Fast paced, a sinister plot and many logic deductions (amongst many other things).<br/><br/>Downey and Law do well as Holmes and Watson. Holmes comes across as highly intelligent, yet thoroughly vile and somewhat of an egocentric bastard while Watson comes across as the help against his will and better knowledge.

"sanddragon939","9","0","0","18 January 2010"," The World's Greatest Detective is back; in a new old-fashioned way!
","The foggy gas-lit streets of 19th century London. The shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. The deerstalker hat, the violin, the pipe, the array of scattered notes, chemicals and weapons and the man, the legendary figure behind all these trappings...Sherlock Holmes. Ever since Arthur Conan Doyle exposed this, the greatest fictional creation in the history of England, if not the world, Holmes and his trusty companion Dr. Watson have enthralled millions with their antics in print and on screen, both big and small, light-hearted or dark, simple and complex...from the goldmine of Doyle's original short stories and novels to the propagandist wartime atmosphere of the Basil Rathbone films, to the Jeremy Brett TV series par excellence and much more. It was the latter actor's masterful portrayal of Holmes that has invariably stuck in the public consciousness and as such most people perceive Holmes as a highly introverted intellectual, a perfect middle-aged Victorian gentleman albeit slightly neurotic, a man more accustomed to using his mind than his fists. However in the process, people did forget that Conan Doyle's Holmes was a multi-faceted character, a man of action in addition to his intellectual pursuits, and not necessarily the prim and proper gentleman his screen adaptations often displayed him as being. Guy Ritche however has boldly set out to reinvent Holmes for a 21st century audience, albeit keeping in mind Arthur Conan Doyle's vision for the character and especially the 'other side' to him that was largely neglected previously.<br/><br/>The Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. is not merely a detective (though his feats of detection are no less legendary than those of the literary version of the character)-he is also a legendary hero, a one man army, a Jack of All Trades-a martial arts expert, swordsman, shooter, master of disguise among other things. Far from being the perfect gentleman, he is a misfit, a bit of a rogue, blessed with a sardonic wit and a tinge of arrogance that he subtly and humorously reveals at times. Perhaps a greater departure from the previous screen versions of Watson is Jude Law's rendition of the doctor as a young, capable and highly competent man of action, an amateur detective in his own right. Holmes and Watson's relationship in this film, which critics have misinterpreted as being homosexual in nature, is in fact intensely amusing. Also notable is Rachel MacAdams portrayal of the femme fatale Irene Adler, the master thief and temptress who also happens to be the only woman Holmes has ever really cared for. And Mark Strong completes the strong cast with his powerful portrayal of the villainous Lord Blackwood who harnesses one of the greatest and deadliest forces the world has ever known: the power of belief and superstition.<br/><br/>Ritche may portray Holmes and Watson in the 19th century albeit he portrays them from a 21st century artistic viewpoint. The characters we see are Doyle's characters but from a modern perspective. For instance, Watsons exasperation with Holmes more unnatural behavior, while manifested rather subtly in the original stories is emphasized greatly in this film. Holmes and Watson's fighting prowess while no doubt alluded to in the stories, is vividly portrayed in the film. Even Holmes's attraction towards Adler, while very subtle and discreet in the Doyle stories, is made somewhat blatantly evident here. This modernization of perspective does not take away from the characters but rather enhances them greatly and makes them far more relevant and relatable to the present day cinema audiences.<br/><br/>Also to be commended is the vivid reconstruction of Victorian-era London."

","I like abstract adaptations of old classics, like Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet with guns and SMG's instead of swords, and especially Titus Andronicus with IC equipped crossbows, shotguns and 1932 Fords in background, but ... this 'Sherlock Holmes' is nothing like that, despite what you may have heard. If you like me expected to see tribute to Wild Wild West and Bruce Lee action flick, you've been deeply misguided. And that's the only thing I was disappointed for. It's a typical Guy Ritchie - 'Snatch'/'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' movie with a lots of CSI elements.

"Robert_duder","8","0","0","17 January 2010"," Fast and full of action...if nothing else it breathes new life into an old classic
","Some say there is no originality left in Hollywood. Sherlock Holmes is about as far from original material as you can get given there are probably hundreds of Sherlock Holmes films and TV Episodes and yet could anyone other than Hollywood put together a completely new spin on an age old idea. And this is building Sherlock Holmes from the ground up into a completely new genre and franchise. There was already a lot of hype around the film when I got to seeing it. Mostly the people around me raved about it as a terrific action flick and they weren't wrong but I think the film wasn't quite the masterpiece some made it out to me. I mean ultimately it was the age old idea with the same action genre ingredients mixed in. Even bringing on a director with flare and style (although I've never seen a film of his) didn't change the fact that there was nothing particularly outstanding about the way the film was made. Nonetheless sometimes, even most times, a movie is just about having fun and Sherlock Holmes is exactly that. Terrific cast, solid action, great humour, and just simply a fun romp.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. has always been a respected actor but as of late, especially since Iron Man he is a Hollywood star of the highest calibre. As the infamous Sherlock Holmes he is funny, neurotic, brilliant, and as always ignites the screen and is always watchable. If anything he has brought Sherlock Holmes into a new generation. No one else could have played him like this. I wasn't sure about Jude Law playing the world famous sidekick Dr. Watson. I've always see Law as having a bit of an ego and I didn't think he could tone that down to play second fiddle to Downey Jr.'s character. I was wrong in every way. Law is amazing as Watson and the two of them have amazing chemistry which is a necessity to this team. The two of them together are funny, and eccentric and just awesome. Their banter and co-operation is just fun. I enjoy Rachel McAdams, she's a versatile actor and beautiful but unfortunately as Sherlock's love interest and a vivacious thief she is very underused. I think her character could be fascinating and her and Downey have the hint of solid chemistry but they aren't given the chance to really get down to it. I hope she returns for the series and they utilize her more with Downey. Mark Strong is solid as the evil mysterious villain Lord Blackwood. He isn't the best foe I could have imagined and his performance doesn't quite match that of Downey or Law but he is decent. I am more on the edge of my seat to see Moriarity materialize.<br/><br/>As I said I have not seen a Guy Ritchie film but I've heard of his unique and strong indy style from previous films. I think what he brought to Sherlock Holmes was a strong feeling of updating the character and yet still keeping the main ideas in tact. Holmes is still brilliant, he can decipher just about anything and is incredible intuitive but this Sherlock can also break bones and hold his own in a scrap. Nowadays a great hero needs more than just brains and clearly Ritchie and the rest of the film makers got that memo loud and clear. Sherlock Holmes (although opening on Christmas) jumps starts a solid year in 2010 of great entertaining movies. You can see the film and have fun and not have to wonder if it's critically acclaimed or whether it will walk away with awards. It's a feel good, fun time, and while it has it's share of violence and a little sexual innuendos the language was completely clean which is surprising and welcome. Go see Sherlock Holmes because it's well worth seeing on the big screen. It might not be mind blowing but it's the beginning of a great franchise. 8/10"
"georgioskarpouzas","7","0","0","16 January 2010"," a flashy detective but London is the real focus
","According to my humble opinion the hero of this movie is the city of London, during Victorian or Edwardian times.The contradictions of prosperous clubs and industrial squalor, the affluence of the elite and the plight of the masses, all that in the canvas of the grey misty London sky and the amazingly alive if unclean river Thames form a very strong picture in the mind of a foreign viewer as myself.<br/><br/>Truly the protagonist Holmes is of a more alternative version than the usually conservative English gentleman portrayed. He has an affair with a girl that is openly having illegal activities- is actually an international criminal- although a charming one.<br/><br/>He gives rational explanations to the magical phaenomena of the movie- although I find them far-fetched and unconvincing- i liked the magical explanation better. He has marvellous powers of observation and stops a plot to overcome the British Empire- which is of course completely unbelievable in itself- as if a quack magician could hold sway over the mother of parliaments.<br/><br/>Watson is the dependable Englishman, the sturdy English yeoman and is finely portrayed by Jude Law.Also MacAdams the actress plays with charm and gusto the seductive criminal whose love for Holmes makes her betray the criminal mastermind who controls her.<br/><br/>Still, the most impressive feature is London: multifaceted, ubiquitous, rotten, foggy, splendid, dirty, miserable, inspiring, all at the same time."
"blanbrn","7","0","0","13 January 2010"," A roll along adventure with a different take on the legendary crime fighting figure.
","I for one was never a die hard Holmes fan, yet over the years as a kid I would on occasion read some of the literature of the legendary figure. As seen here director Guy Ritchie who had a much different take on Sherlock showing him more as an action and karate fighting warrior who still has crime solving skills. Anyway it's setting is in typical fashion of 1880's London you find Holmes(in a bold and fun performance from Robert Downey Jr.)as a mysterious master of disguise and clue sniffing problem solver who leaps out of buildings and fights crime with his bare knuckles just like an action super hero. In a good yet whimsical supporting role is Sherlock's good friend and sidekick Dr. Watson(Jude Law)as both carry on like old classmates, yet still serious they both have one goal in common and that's to rid London of the evil and mysterious magical Lord Blackwood(Mark Strong).<br/><br/>Along the way this is a film of fun fighting thrill ride chases and fun entertainment even though it seems a little exhausting as this take on Holmes shows him more of a brutal and intense brawler than as expected the norm of a book solving wizard. Introduced as an interesting thorn to the film is an ex love of Holmes that is Irene Adler(Rachel McAdams)who's a sneaky and manipulative dame in such an old fashioned Victorian way that you don't know if to take her as a good princess or evil witch type. Overall this film isn't the best I've seen yet it's explosive pace makes it a franchise because the character is enriched in great storytelling and history so this film is certainly the start of something special so enjoy it's new look and clever ways of an iconic mystery fighting figure."

","Those fans of the sleuth of Baker Street, let alone those who are devoted to the BBC series with Jeremy Brett will be aghast at what Guy Ritchie has wrought on the big screen. Not to mention those of us who remember Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.<br/><br/>Dusting off the English accent he perfected in Chaplin, Robert Downey, Jr. plays the redoubtable sleuth with Jude Law as Doctor John Watson. But as for the characters that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created, these two might well have had different names all together. They certainly are one antagonistic pair of roommates. <br/><br/>In fact Dr. Watson is tired of Sherlock's pleasure seeking where he's been reduced to a little more than a dope connection. He wants to marry a nice girl played by Kelly Reilly and settle down. He's packed and ready to move when one of Holmes's old cases comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>Holmes put away serial killer Lord Blackwood played by Mark Strong, a nobleman who would have made the Marquis DeSade look like Mister Rogers. Strong is hung for his crimes, but later his grave turns out to be empty and new horrors are happening and awaiting London. It's up to Holmes to stop it.<br/><br/>To do it, Downey makes Holmes an action figure and only in The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, the second of the Rathbone series was Holmes ever this much of a macho dude. It might be fun for fans, but I like my Holmes as cerebral as Conan Doyle wrote him.<br/><br/>The film does convey the atmosphere of Victorian London no doubt, but Arthur Conan Doyle would never recognize his creation."
"lingonberrysquirrel","1","3","8","6 April 2012"," Probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
","I'm going to make this short because I need to go and vomit soon.<br/><br/>I wonder why most people who praise this crap are from the U.S. I wonder if Guy Ritchie ever read a Sherlock Holmes book, or if he did, I wonder if he understood any more than the four-letter words.<br/><br/>Dear American audience: Sherlock Holmes is British. Robert Downey Jr. is apparently trying to do the British accent. I'm sorry to hurt your feelings but he's doing a poor job. As I watched this film, no, movie, I couldn't keep thinking of Hugh Laurie doing the American accent. Downey's acting is poor. He looks and sounds dull. Monotonously spoken typical Holmesian lines, utterly boring action scenes and the ""funny"" comments (simple enough for the American audience) in between the fights don't constitute an eccentric, ill-behaved but brilliant-minded detective. In the documentary part of the DVD, the actors applaud the ""reinvention"" of Sherlock Holmes as a more dynamic, humorous, ""modern"" figure. In that case they shouldn't call it Holmes. OK, Holmes studied martial arts and did drugs, but there was more to him than that. And why change the character of Watson? Holmes and Watson were NOT Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. If I want to see fighting and world-saving miraculous action with special effects, I will watch Bruce Willis. He saves the world much better. Ha! Now, where's the intelligent approach to the intelligent hero? If this is the proper way to do it, why don't you reinvent the Bible? <br/><br/>By the way, this movie is said to take place in the year 1891. Dr. Riva-Rocci introduced his blood pressure measurement cuff in 1896. It was only possible to measure systolic pressure at the time. Dr Korotkoff combined the use of stethoscope into the routine in 1905, which enabled the measurement of diastolic pressure. Blood pressure monitoring became a part of routine clinical examination in the early 1900s. This is not the only historical discrepancy in the movie.<br/><br/>To summarise, this movie is nothing but a lousy action piece made for mediocre, feeble-minded audience. They've tried to put in science but it doesn't help because it doesn't work. This is disgraceful. I gave one point because zero was not an option.<br/><br/>Now, will you excuse me. Vomiting time. Then some good old intelligent stylish Granada series with the brilliant Jeremy Brett. My one and only Holmes."

","I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since my childhood days. I've read the books and watched the movies. I won't be telling you which movie or book was best etc. I just wanna say, that this film just ain't about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. <br/><br/>In this movie you're going to watch two men, one is very eccentric, most of the time some sort of tiddly, a fighter and wanna be brilliant mind, the other is snobbish, violent, vain and some sort of male model of those days. Now, here's the question: Does that sound like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson ? <br/><br/>I'm sorry to write these lines but they transformed these two characters into action heroes, trapped in old London and put them in a long-winded story.

"ger-64","4","3","8","24 January 2010"," Not What Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Intended Im Sure
","This film is entertaining in many ways (effects, stunts, storyline) but it is not what Sherlock Holmes is truly about. I was bitterly disappointed that Guy Richie didn't pay more attention to detail with special regards to the cast, original character depiction and more importantly the era that Holmes was based.<br/><br/>My major criticisms are as follows: Firstly, Holmes was well known for his meticulous eye for detail and an unrivalled intelligence on a multitude of both academic and non-academic topics. He certainly was not well known for his athleticism and would not have been capable of defeating a bare knuckle fighter twice his size and strength.<br/><br/>Secondly, i felt Robert Downey (jnr) was not convincing in the role of Shelock. However, i don't feel this was not his own fault, but rather a casting error. Surely an English man would have been a better choice. The accent is obviously floored to anyone who isn't American.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the most unforgivable point for me personally was that Sherlock is dressed more like a pauper or coal man than the great detective, who was among the socially elite of the time. Does Guy Richie honestly believe that a person dressed like this would rub shoulders with the bourgeoisie for any other reason than to deliver their coal. I seriously think not. At one point Watson (Jude Law) actually comments on how bad Homes smells. Unbelievable! All in all this film is entertaining, what with all the special effects, stunts and general Hollywood influences. However, if your expecting a story in any way based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyles vision of the great detective, you will more than likely be disappointed, like i was.<br/><br/>This film does little to threaten the two best Sherlock Holmes actors there was, being Basil Rathbone & Jeremy Brett. If only Guy Richie had actually watched these great actors in the prized role then maybe the film would have been more original. Unfortunately, i doubt this happened. All i can say is elementary my dear Guy Richie and better luck next time."

Go see Dr. House instead, or some real Holmes movies, like Hands Of The Murderer or Murder By Decree. Or Without A Clue. Or anything else. Not this.

The idea is none less than ""Superman"" and ""Spiderman"", so there should be no need to drag this movie down with aged acting when we have the great Robert Downey Jr. here to give us what he does best, and that is pleasing the crowd.

","If you go see this one, I suggest you arrive early. I found the cobblestone pavement morphed to look like production company logos during the opening credits to be this movie's strongest feature. There are also some nice in-scene flashbacks. When Sherlock Holmes is sharing the results of his investigations, we actually see him snooping around in fast forward, rather than hear him talking about it. At other times, the action flashes forward in slow motion as Sherlock premeditates his martial art moves before he actually strikes in real time. Not that you haven't seen this before. In general, the movie is surprisingly uneventful for all its high-paced action. Both director Guy Ritchie and his leading man Robert Downey are trying hard to portray Sherlock Holmes as a Victorian James Bond, neglecting some of the more sombre facets of the character. Robert Downey and Rachel McAdams do make a handsome enough couple, but there's too much tinsel for their liaison to go anywhere. Jude Law, as Dr. Watson, is his usual ridiculous self."

This is another of those non-stop action from start to finish movies. So you didn't think that Sherlock Holmes was an action hero? I guess that I didn't either. He is in this movie. I was hoping for a more clever movie, not a blunt action piece. The performances are very good, so that's a saving grace. I also expected the abundance of flashbacks at the end to explain the whole thing. I don't find it suspenseful or even interesting when a movie explains something at the end, that the principal character knew all along, but never acted on or let on that he knew it. I like to add a logical score to the overall. This movie isn't horrible in that vein, but there are some whoppers. Nothing like crash landing on an arbitrary planet and running into Spock in a cave."

The effects were pretty good - what would be expected in any modern Hollywood movie, but in spots they did look somewhat fake, mostly when panning back and getting a view of the entire city. They were good, don't get me wrong, just not any different from any other modern movie. Nothing groundbreaking. Effects and action-alone do not solely make a good movie. Holmes is almost a clone of House from Fox TV. He's depressed, unlikeable at times, appears to hate everyone (even the dog), has a British accent, and is smart. Watson was a pretty big whiner. They also set it up at the end for an obvious sequel, which I'd probably wait to rent for $1 from Redbox.<br/><br/>I can see why people like this movie.

"scurvytoon","1","2","5","11 January 2015"," Robert Downey's Sherlock Holmes or Guy Ritchie takes the mick
","Sunday, 28 November 2010<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS<br/><br/>Well lets start with the basic requirements of any entertaining film. It fails in every important way possible. It's badly cast, badly acted, poorly written, overly violent for no apparent reason , the story makes little or no sense, lasting about 120 minutes but feeling like 4 hours. It's called Sherlock Holmes, but resembles Holmes about as much as a fat hamster resembles a cheetah. It could have been called Indiana Bond v the Evil doer ninjas and not have changed a single word save a few names, it was that removed from even being slightly about Sherlock Holmes. But since I was made to sit in plain view of the promo monkeys, I could hardly walk out at the 15th minute when I wanted to. Had I left, I would not have seen the complete list of atrocities inflicted on movie goers in the name of Guy Ritchie's bank account and Robert Downey's ego. And so having been made to watch this, I will tell you in exquisite detail why it's 2 hours of my life I would have preferred watching repeats of old industrial films or having a root canal.<br/><br/>Oh Yes! As a Sherlockian I can tell you it treats the core characters with as much respect as an illiterate bully looking for porn mags at the library. Holmes should have no difficulty paying the rent as he's quite wealthy. Holmes and Watson do not have gambling problems, Holmes is not a slob, Irene Adler is not a master criminal but an actress/singer. As for the whole Mary Morstan story, Holmes is the one who hooks her up with Doctor Watson in the stories. So for Holmes on film to be jealous and to make trouble is insane and clearly he can't use deduction on her as he already knows her.. Holmes and Watson never come to blows and Mrs Hudson is Scottish and not afraid of Holmes. One tiny detail... Holmes and Watson do not own a dog of any kind, let alone a dead ringer for a certain insurance selling bulldog. Oh Yes ! Can you say product placement? For the writers to take a few over the top episodes from the books and wrap them in rubbish does not make for an alleged accurate portrayal with a twist. As for the costuming, it's a dogs breakfast of styles from 1840 through to 1925, Rachel Mcadams in particular is dressed so poorly for the period, it's clear this was never ever made as anything but a cash grab at horny teenagers who can't afford internet porn. There are more cockneys per square inch than there were in London at the time and there appear to be only a handful of upper class people and they are all without exception, Evil. London was not an eternal lunar landscape forgotten by the sun and the constant less than subtle reminders that Ritchie once made Lock Stock and two smoking barrels means the film was never more than a sad call for attention from a film maker who's last few films have been without exception, turkeys. <br/><br/>So what's the story?<br/><br/>Holmes has to stop a megalomaniac from taking over the world through alleged Satan worship, but is in fact Kabbala. The baddie who dresses like a Nazi from 1933 and speaks like one, wants to create a new world order. Where have we heard that one before? Oh yeah, Indiana Jones or was that WW2?<br/><br/>The greatest offence, as if what I already mentioned wasn't enough, is the clear use of Jewish iconography and objects to create a sense of evil and danger. People who could read Hebrew, were shocked to see the following.<br/><br/>1- A passage supposedly from the Kabbala , a practise that was so deeply shunned at the time by Jews, it was cause for expulsion from the congregation. The passage purported to be about a ritual with animal parts was in fact a text about the elements of life and completely harmless.<br/><br/>2- At one point, the film casts evil intent on the character of some high nobles with the inclusion of a richly decorated ceremonial box. The box in fact is a Tzadakah box or charity box. You select a cause to donate to and drop your change in to eventually give it to the charity of your choice. To elevate such an object of good to symbol of evil and danger is the same as equating a breast feeding mother to that of a murderer.<br/><br/>It gets worse<br/><br/>3- During the film there is a massive overly long, slow motion explosion. The music played is the same as is used in every WW2 special about the concentration camps. It was creepy and unsettling.<br/><br/>4- Lastly they plan to kill off most of the members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons by using a device to activate poisonous pellets that will send the deadly smoke into the House of Commons turning it into a gas chamber.<br/><br/>This film is flawed in so many ways, but the use of Jewish symbols and sacred items in combination with the gas chamber imagery is beyond the pale. As a Holmes film it fails, as an action adventure it's a complete mess from beginning to end, not having any particular hook or creation of tension onto likable characters. Lastly it is offensive to any person who knows their history .. I can only hope this film dies a quick death.<br/><br/>My last word on this, if you want to watch quality Holmes stories,stick to ITV's Jeremy Brett, but at all cost avoid this piece of dog's droppings,it's not worth the price of admission, even if you don't read Hebrew."

Here, he is a man of deeds, as he was intended to be.<br/><br/>The failure of this film is in Downey. He gives us the worst impression of Holmes imaginable. He is not convincing, and you cannot understand a single word this hack says.

A few characters work, the giant and the bad girl are fairly well designed. Other than that, ho hum.<br/><br/>We have no idea what is going on, or where these places they go to are.

","Sherlock Holmes, what a disappointment. When I saw the original trailer I thought this would be an exciting movie. Not so. I am a Robert Downy fan, but even he can't save this film. At one point I turned to my fianc√© and said sarcastically ""didn't see that one coming"". Shortly after that, we walked out on the film, 55 minutes into the movie to be exact. To give this bad movie a little love, the fight scenes were cool, but it wasn't enough to keep this movie alive. A big budget period picture with a great cast and an intriguing storyline, but nothing to back it up. Maybe hardcore Sherlock Holmes fans would find this entertaining, like the one woman in the theater that I heard laughing hysterically (may I mention the rest of the audience looked just as bored as I)."
"shenanton","5","2","5","31 January 2010"," Bad Editing, Bad Script & Bad Directing!!! Even Guy Richie Fans Are Disappointed!!
","Disjointed and badly directed. By disjointed I mean the way the editing from shot to shot was done, there is no feeling of flow. Many of the sequences have been edited down so much that they don't have enough time to make an impact on you or affect you in any way. It feels more like an action computer games at time rather then a film. So many action sequences and story sequences are stupid and inconsequential and leave you feeling dizzy and disappointed. Although overall I thought the film looked great the CG effects are NOT top notch and some so obviously are CG. This is a forgettable boring story. I paid good money to see this in the cinema, don't make the same mistake, watch on TV or not at all. This movie will only appeal to undemanding patron or teen audiences. <br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is developed as an interesting flawed character with world class attention to detail. This starts off great but you soon get tired of the same message thrust into your face again and again. It seems like the director / screenplay writers simply ran out of material and Holmes solved every problem either with his fists or his amazing deductive powers, which don't related well with or connect to the audience. It feels like you are watching a B grade episode of a Detective TV Series and at the end of the episode the solution is thrust on you and explained away. Seemly very clever however it demands nothing of the audience, there no sense of participated, there is no mystery. This is a big problem of this film, it is very hard to have any emotional investment in any of the characters. <br/><br/>On the positive side... Sherlock Holmes character is wonderfully accurately depicted as the Holmes who is a miserable, irresponsible drug addict and times dirty, other times insulting, irresponsible and even cruel. Fighting, drinking and slumming his way around. Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection.<br/><br/>Doctor Watson played excellently by Jude Law represents a refinement that enters Holmes life that influences him to become a ""respectable"" member of society. <br/><br/>Unfortunately great character casting and good acting can't save this film from bad directing, bad editing and a bad script. Boring and Deeply disappointing. <br/><br/>** Spoilers ** 1) I will give you just two examples out of the hundreds : When a man is murdered with fire and falls the window the scene is just edited to be too quick and you have no interest in the event. It might has well have been a scene of someone lighting a cigarette, it would have made no difference. 2) Even the CG effects are not top notch for example the scene on the bridge near the end of the movie is so obviously CG it looks more like a computer game then a film. ** End of spoilers **"

","Is a good movie, but i expect much more, the could not find better actor for play this version of sherlock homes that robert downey junior, it is like a detective tony stark, the personality of tony stark and sherlock homes is very similar, downey junior put the fun in the movie. Jude Law plays dear watson role jeje watson it's more serious than homes, the complement each other. The chemistry between Downey Junior and Jude Law seems a little bit forced, besides the great friendship between their characters, this bound between them was not reflected in the screen, this thing is natural so i think the director did not notice that.

"fantasyescapist","Null","2","5","19 January 2010"," A fun Victorian romp that works on that level but not much more than that.
","This isn't Sherlock Holmes ... this is Guy Richie's Sherlock Holmes. Somehow, someone thought Holmes needs updating and how does Hollywood like to update something as quiet and collected as Holmes? Why by adding lots of action and some shirtless scenes, of course!<br/><br/>As Holmes and Watson have been transformed into wisecracking action heroes, Downey Jr enthusiastically hams it up as the intelligent layabout, while Law plays sidekick Watson as a annoyed babysitter to Holmes, who's also handy with a pistol.<br/><br/>The standouts are Strong as the effectively creepy 'sorcerer' but wasted are Reilly and a miscast beguiling temptress McAdams - both women look too modern for the period as does Downey Jr too. They all might as well have been listening to iPods as that's how out<br/><br/>The plot is pretty much a seeming resurrection and 'tonight Lords, we're going to take over the world' by means of 'black magic'. The homo erotic undertones of the bickering pair is glaringly obvious and initially amusing but gets tired pretty quickly. As for Holmes powers of deduction, it's pretty feeble here, like a particularly weak episode of CSI. Holmes just doesn't seem to have the great deductive mind he's made out to be. I don't find it wholly convincing. Him as a drunk, fine. As an intelligent mastermind? Not really.<br/><br/>I dislike Richie's visual style of slow-mo and speed-up, quite violent fight scenes. However, where I think the film main enjoyment lies, is in some good set-piece action scenes. Victorian London looks authentic enough(dirty and bustling with life) but as aforementioned, the anachronistic looking Downey Jr, McAdams and Reilly take me out of the period in scenes they appear.<br/><br/>The score by Hans Zimmer is another one of the strengths of the film - jaunty, tongue-in-cheek, dark(in places outside the main leitmotif) and memorable, it sets the tone of this barnstorming adventure well.<br/><br/>Overall: It can be enjoyed as a geezer type update of Holmes and is entertaining on that level, but lacks in other vital areas that make Conan Doyle's shrewd sleuth who he is - these two could just have been any other fictional Victorian adventures, to me. Fun, but quite insubstantial ."
"imdbbl","Null","2","5","19 January 2010"," Style over substance, very disappointing
","Despite being a well known pop culture figure, I had little to no contact to Sherlock Holmes until today. I never read the stories or watched the films and mini series. I knew, of course who he was and a little bit about Watson as well because, well, their reputation proceeds them. Sherlock Holmes is so popular that the Guinness World Records has consistently listed him as the ""most portrayed movie character"" with 75 actors playing the part in over 211 films. An update of this classic tale sounded like a great idea. Unfortunately, Guy Ritchie's adaption is rather disappointing. The story begins with Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson finally catching serial killer and occult ""sorcerer"" Lord Blackwood. He gets the death penalty. But Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave and resumes his killing spree. Holmes, then reopens the case and tries to unravel the clues to this mystery... Ritchie's rendition of Sherlocke Holmes is somewhat engaging and entertaining but it also has the typical flaws of a blockbuster. First thing you'll notice in the film is the weird camera angles, and the freeze-frame edits. It's Richie's trademark and he seems to love it because he does this in all of his works. Visually, it's definitely a stylish film but sometimes Richie goes a bit over the top creating certain situations with little or no relevance to the plot just to show his skills, like the bare-knuckle boxing sequences. The script is a mess; it's all over the place, lacks focus and the plot twist, if you can call it that, is nothing more than a setup for the inevitable sequel. Honestly, the big mystery is not that interesting, captivating or well written for that matter. The strength of the film lies in the performances of the lead actors even though, I've seen them doing much, much better. Robert Downey Jr was very charismatic as always but he was clearly out of his element. Jude Law did fine but I almost feel he's too good of an actor to play such a small, underdeveloped character; and Rachel McAdams, was energetic and vibrant as usual. I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Ritchie. And this film didn't change my opinion one bit. His approach to film-making is much more style than substance and this film is the clear evidence of that. Those expecting something clever and well thought will be disappointed.<br/><br/>5/10"
"blackmamba99971","10","2","5","16 January 2010"," Classic
","What an excellent film this was, and what memories it brings back of watching some old classics of Sherlock to now. Robert Downey Jr. was fantastic as the eccentric detective who looks at the smaller things in life and deduces it perfectly with an extra added bonus to keep you on your toes. Seeing the tiniest detail is what makes him so astute of his environment, which of course makes him the most sought after private dick of the times. I have to say that Jude Law was also excellent in his portrayal of Watson, the flamboyant Doctor of medicine as well as post Mortem forensics. His ability to see the obvious with the negative aspects of a case is why Holmes is so impressed with his continuing deductions, and how he has honed them to near perfection. But not in the same class as Sherlock. But when both are together, there is no case that can't be solved. I especially loved the rustic Pre nineteen hundred era, where the world is just beginning to awaken to technology. And where there is tech, there is Moriarty, ever needing such devices he will try anything to control the world with it. Which is why its most likely that a film like this as well as all the other Sherlock Holmes films will remain as classic as they come. Brilliantly made."

Then add Rachel McAdams in the mix and I'm thinking it's gonna be an interesting ride. However, I was very surprised at how well they all worked together and how well they performed their roles. I've never been a fan of Jude Law up until this movie, he was pretty fantastic. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in the role of a broody, cooky, way-to-smart-for-his-own-good, Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law was pretty awesome in the supporting role of Dr. Watson. I do wish however that Rachel McAdams had been in the movie more because I loved her character and she was also fantastic in her role. I was amazed at the costumes and how beautiful they were. Especially Rachel McAdams dresses, they were perfect for the character and amazing for the period. Although the director did take some liberties in the technology and fashion of the period during the climax of the movie. McAdams is wearing a pants suit and there is a device that would have needed batteries to work. But it made for a fantastic ending, McAdams looked fantastic and the movie ended with a bank. Which was the whole point of the movie anyway probably."
"brimatt2412","9","2","5","11 January 2010"," The game is afoot!
","Sherlock Holmes is a fun movie that benefits from terrific casting and great chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson. Their banter was a joy to watch and Downey and Law really seemed to have fun in their roles. Downey has really taken up his game the last couple of years and I can see an Oscar in his future. He portrays Holmes's quirks nicely and he is quite charismatic. I liked how they showed Holmes planning to incapacitate an opponent before he actually did it.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is alluring and charming as Irene Adler, the only woman who has ever bested Holmes- she worked very well with Downey. My only complaint with the movie was that her role was underwritten. Hopefully, if there is a follow up (a good bet) and she is brought back, her role can be expanded. Mark Strong (who reminds me of Andy Garcia) makes a good villain as Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is a fun movie that offers mystery, action, humor and enjoyable characters. I highly recommend it."

","Some of the sleuthing was very 'Hollywood'. There didn't appear to be much in the way of foreshadowing for viewers who like to play along and solve the mystery with Holmes step-by-step (I don't happen to be one of those people, however, so I didn't mind¬Ö ) Downey's chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent. The production design was great, and there were one or two stunning set-pieces carefully crafted and choreographed within the story.<br/><br/>Mark Strong did very well with what seemed to me to be a very underwritten bad guy¬Ö So much time is spent upon establishing the relationship between Holmes and Watson and setting up the mystery, that the villain's motivation and grand master plan doesn't receive the depth of explanation it perhaps warrants. This facet of the plot is pretty much dealt with in its entirety using only one scene.<br/><br/>For those seeking more of an action-adventure than a procedural, this should be a treat. Stands in my opinion as Guy Ritchie's best film yet (although since I didn't like him much in the first place, that's perhaps not saying much!)"

","This was a very good adaptation of the classic detective series. While purists of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels may sniff at the liberties that Film Director Guy Ritchie took with the title character Holmes and his faithful sidekick, Dr. Watson, the movie was highly entertaining with great cinematography and a fast paced plot that didn't let up throughout and kept the viewer in suspense up until the very end. In other words, it was well worth the money and I will be looking forward to the next installment, which will feature the better known nemesis, Dr. Moriarty.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as Holmes. He is one of the best actors for this type of role, a flawed super hero who doesn't take himself too seriously. Jude Law was up to the task of playing Dr. Watson, and Rachel McAdams was excellent as the mystery woman who is both the object of Holmes affections and a possible adversary. The rest of the supporting cast was also first rate. Guy Ritchie deserves a lot of praise for pulling all of this together. It's nice to see him making entertaining films again. <br/><br/>Great movie and well worth checking out."
"phl222","9","2","5","3 January 2010"," Want to know what a knowledgeable Sherlock Holmes fan thinks?
","First, bravo to Guy Ritchie for pulling it off. I'm not only a traditional Sherlock Holmes fan. I wrote a new Sherlock Holmes story for a screen writing class back in 1995, and read every one of Conan Doyle's original stories, as well as re-watched the entire British television series starring the unmatchable Jeremy Brett as part of my research into the character.<br/><br/>So with all this psychological baggage in hand, I went into the show with a less than optimistic expectation. For example, I initially thought that whoever decided to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Sherlock probably didn't have the slightest idea about the character Conan Doyle intended. That said however, I will admit Robert Downey Jr. did indeed succeed in doing the part justice given his exceptional acting talent. Nonetheless, there were other more ""suitable"" choices out there that would have been entirely in keeping with the classic depiction. And since Jeremy Brett is no longer with us, others like Charles Dance, who appeared in Michael Collins which starred Liam Neeson, should have been on the ""A"" list of contenders because of his intended resemblance to the character. Another ""no brainer"" candidate would have been Hugh Laurie of Dr. House fame.<br/><br/>Remember all those years when everyone wanted Pierce Brosnan to play James Bond, but he was unavailable because of his television contract obligations to play ""Remington Steel""? Was Hugh Laurie your first choice but was unavailable? All Hugh Laurie would need is to have his hair dyed black and slicked down with oil, and he would have suited the role perfectly, with a ready-made fan base to boot.<br/><br/>Otherwise, as one experienced writer to all those who worked on the script congratulations. Many witty lines, a few inside jokes, and a generous dose of trivia elements only the well-read Sherlock Holmes fan would likely pick up and appreciate, like the main character's ability to speak French owing to his partial French ancestry, or Dr. Watson's first name (John), or Watson's future wife's name (Mary), or Sherlock's brother's name (Mycroft)... and one could go on.<br/><br/>But then there was the injection of a non-Sherlock Holmes influence in the way of a big bad guy akin to the giant in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Was that a Guy Ritchie homage to the film that first got him into film? <br/><br/>But the foregoing are not the reasons I'm not giving this film a 10. It's because of the film's over-reliance on ""action"" sequences to tell the story, while de-emphasizing the intellectual dimension of classic Sherlock Holmes stories. If Ritchie could have brought the same amazing genius he was able to effect in ""Revolver"", by allowing us to hear more of the inside of the mind of the main character working out the guts of the problem, than just in certain slow-mo fight scenes, he could have done no less here, for the mind of Sherlock Holmes is a story dimension onto itself. <br/><br/>The depiction of London was superb of course. It caught the flavour and set the right mood, especially Tower Bridge under construction.<br/><br/>Finally, just a few other small hiccoughs. I found was that the viewer is really never given enough clues to piece the solution to the story for himself, unless of course one was a veritable student of chemistry. I'm not sure if Conan Doyle would have approved of leaving so few clues for the reader or the extremely rapid pacing of the story. But it was still an entertaining film to watch, and as I said in the opening, Guy Ritchie and cast pulled it off."

I wish there had been more of the banter and dialogue seen in the early scenes of the movie, like the restaurant scene with Watson's lady. Robert Downey Jr is very enjoyable as Holmes. I think perhaps Guy Ritchie used a lot of influences from Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone (listen to the score - sounds like Once Upon a Time in the West, and the hanging scene as well).

After gangster films like RocknRolla and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, he might have finally found his big hit, both foreign and domestic. Downey, Jr. is hilarious as the titular sleuth. He's funny when he has to be, and smart when he has to be. That's why he rightfully deserves a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. The action is also pretty darn good, especially the slow motion close quarters fights. It's like they added some pieces of Fight Club into the movie. I also really enjoyed the score by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. His piano bits are the best parts, playing to the feel of 1800's England. The only problem is that at a few points, the movie gets a bit too smart on us. Holmes is a genius, but I'm not fully interested in his Einstein like blather.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a well done mix of action, humor, thrills, and mystery. I give it a 9 out of 10."

","Anyone who is anyone knows that Sherlock Holmes is the world's greatest detective¬ÖHands down¬ÖSorry Batman. And also like Batman, James Bond, Superman and so so many others, the remake was bound to happen¬Ö..yet unlike many of the others that have come out¬ÖThis one is actually good.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. (Who is just awesome to begin with) gives a more realistic and updated portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, almost like a old time London Grissom from CSI. Holmes is someone you can relate to and who is likable from the start, but who is still way smarter than you will ever be. Oh yea, he can also kick butt, full UFC style kick butt. Add in Jude Law as John Watson and strangely you get a duo that really works, which is weird because Law always seems so distant in his other roles, this one fits him perfectly. Instead of Holmes being the super smart one and Watson by his side agreeing with him constantly, this team is an actual team. Both have parts to play in the scheme of the mysteries they solve and they seem to be on an equal friendship with one and other. Most of the dialogue between them seems like ad-libs more than script, and comes off so realistically that you could almost believe it to be true. The end credits will roll and you will want more, it pulls you in and makes you honestly care what happens to them. <br/><br/>Yet unlike Bond or Batman, this Remake doesn't give you the old stuff from before made new (No 'Elementary Dear Watson' or 'The Game is A foot' or the old hat for that matter) but what we do get is a truer take on the character than we've ever seen before. I think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be very happy with this version of this detective, very happy indeed. <br/><br/>Yet, having said that, there were a few things that made me wonder, like¬Ö. <br/><br/>#1-Holmes keeps using his drugs and experiments and what not on the dog, yet no one thinks to take the dog away from him? When is enough enough people? <br/><br/>#2-Watson gets all the shards of wood and what not in him after the explosion on the dock, and you're telling me he doesn't stay in the hospital longer? Old time medicine sure works a lot faster than ours does. <br/><br/>#3-On that same point, Watsons arm is in a sling after the explosion, yet when he is rescuing Holmes form the river he uses both of them to reel Holmes in without a wince of pain. What gives? <br/><br/>#4-There was a lot of, 'Oh that is a coincidence' moments in the movie, like at the end. It was a coincidence that the rope was under Blackwoods foot, a coincidence that there was an anchor there to pull him down, a coincidence that there was an ax there to cut the rope at the right time¬ÖYou get my drift. <br/><br/>#5-In parliament, there are like 6 guys holding hands to keep people from getting out of the room as the gas is about to come in. Sorry, but if it was me knowing something like that was about to happen I would beat past those guys and get the hell outta there right quick. <br/><br/>There are more but I won't bore you, the plain and simple of the movie is this. Its good clean who done it fun at the movies, a nice break from vampires and aliens. It's good to see more of Robert Downey Jr. he is an amazing actor and the roles he is picking now a days fit him to a 'T'. You go Tony Stark! <br/><br/>If they keep this type of storytelling up, there is no reason why this couldn't be a nice little franchise to revisit in the future. James bond could get a run for his money. As for Sherlock Holmes himself, after so long away, it's nice to have him back again."

Really? but I totally changed my mind when I saw his performance! Law and Downey Jr work incredibly well together and their roles are very likable. <br/><br/>A few things I thought they could do better were: > Rachael McAdam's role- I thought they could have included her more > 'Mary' should have been featured more > The part where Holmes is chained to a bed naked. Guy Ritchie could have done so much with that! Yet it only lasted for under 7 seconds...<br/><br/>If you are pensive about seeing Sherlock Holmes, you are in for a great time if you decide to go.

","Holmes, struggling to come to terms with Watson moving out to marry, is drawn into a case involving the apparent rise from the grave of Lord Blackwood, hung for a series of occult-linked murders. Complicating the matters is the return of Irene Adler, a woman Holmes is drawn to...<br/><br/>The first thing to note about this new Sherlock Holmes movie is that it is not based on any one story. It's an original script that uses elements of the Holmes character, in what is essentially a period buddy movie. The banter between Holmes and Watson is pretty funny at times, and it is clear there is a close friendship between the two. It helps that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are both clearly having a lot of fun in the roles and this does come over to the audience.<br/><br/>The supporting cast get mixed results. Mark Strong as Blackwood is a compelling villain. Eddie Marsan as Lestrade is also quite good. However, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler does her best, but the part floats in and out of the movie at times, and she doesn't get a lot to do. <br/><br/>The big surprise though is actually the director, Guy Ritchie. I've never been a huge fan of his work, but he does a very good job here. The pacing is just right, the humour works well, and the action sequences are well done.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches, such as Holmes thinking out how to defeat an opponent in a fight, slowed down as he thinks it through, then showing at normal speed as it actually occurs. The visuals of Victorian London are impressive as are the sets and costumes. <br/><br/>If there are concerns with the movie, it's actually in the interplay between Holmes and Watson. Although as I said it is funny, at times it comes over in a similar vein to humour in previous Joel Silver movies, such as Lethal Weapon. But it is a minor issue.<br/><br/>In the end how much you enjoy this movie will actually depend on how you feel about Holmes and Watson. If you are a die-hard fan of the characters you may feel that the portrayals here are not the characters you know. If however you are not a massive fan, you may enjoy it as a well made, fun movie."

The dockside explosion sequence. All the playing around with time(Here's what's going to happen/let me explain what just happened). Hans Zimmer's score is terrific as well. There's just a lot to enjoy here. Robert Downey, Jr. continues his amazing comeback, although it's something more than that. He was never as big as he is now, with so many terrific artistic and commercial successes under his belt in past five years.

","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I entered this film. In fact the only reason why I went to see it is mainly because of it's three killer leads. Safe to say that was reason enough. Although Guy Ritchie might not be the right director to bring this stylish and smart new franchise to it's full potential. The chemistry and style injected into the proceedings is enough to make for a wonderfully smart if at times too fast but entertaining update the classic source material. Robert Downey Jr is of course wonderful in the lead role of Sherlock Holmes. He portrays the character with a manic sensibility befitting a crazed genius with a genuinely strong physical side. He is equaled by Jude Law's brilliantly charismatic sidekick Watson who has just as much brain and braun as his counterparts but is equipped with a little less passion but a lot more common sense. They are joined by the likable Rachael McAdams in her first real meaty role since The Notebook. She stars as the love interest of Holmes a seductive, brilliant and courageous but sneaky thief. The film's only weakness is Ritchie's manic and chaotic direction which I liked more here than anyone of his films. But still the film would have benefited by having someone much more skilled behind the camera. A strong sense of cinematic artistry accompanies the film in it's set design, costumes and cinematography and it's just a really fun time. One that I will will spawn another sequel very soon."

","I enjoyed this movie. I heard of Sherlock Holmes before but never read any books involving him. So I went to this movie with an open mind and I have to say, that I really like his character. I know his character has been modified to appeal to the current generation of moviegoers, but he is still very much likable. Comical, brilliant and charismatic. Robert Downey who plays the role of Sherlock Holmes, was perfect. The character was so lively.<br/><br/>I am just upset that the movie was so dark, in fact it freaks me out.

"gary-444","8","2","5","26 December 2009"," A Triumphant Remake
","Guy Ritchie finally comes of age as a Director with this compelling re envisaging of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie's love of London, and his status as a Londoner, permeate every aspect of this tale as he cleverly uses familiar settings to represent familiar characters in a modern, yet faithful way. Robert Downey Jnr plays Holmes as an eccentric, other worldly eccentric. Jude Law plays Dr Watson as the straight ""foil"" in a pairing that exudes chemistry and the obvious enjoyment of both men in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Past Ritchie movies, in particular ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch"" have offered some wonderful set pieces, but a disjointed narrative. With the benefit of Holmes and Watson having an understood back story, and a well written and clearly defined plot, the surprise here is that this frees Ritchie up to deliver some excellent scenes in context. A fight in a shipyard's slipway is the pick of the bunch, closely followed by peril in an abattoir with shades of James Bond, a marvellously recreated bare knuckle fight reprises the grit that is his trademark, and the showdown on Tower Bridge is a glorious piece of kitsch.<br/><br/>Many of the backdrops are computer generated , but this in no way detracts from the credibility of proceedings. Beautifully, and authentically costumed, but often shot in the dark, a slightly surreal sense of fantasy is created which serves the purposes of the plot perfectly. A witty, quick-fire script has verbal and visual gags aplenty which help to keep up a relentless pace in between action sequences. The editing never allows a pause for breath and the two hour running time flies by.<br/><br/>Although the plot itself is neatly topped and tailed as villain Lord Blackwood, gleefully played by Mark Strong, is vanquished, an accomplice vanishes, leaving the door open for the sequel which will surely follow . That this will certainly be Ritchie's most successful film to date, yet contains no bad language or graphic violence, will cause many to reappraise his talents and may encourage Ritchie himself to explore further hitherto untapped areas in which he shows both promise and talent."
"Michael Fargo","8","2","5","25 December 2009"," No shirt, Sherlock
","This is an entertaining film, but it adds nothing to the canon of filmed versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective. As some have mentioned casting Robert Downey Jr. was certainly interesting, but Downey seems insecure with the role (and the accent). He's enjoying his performance much more than the audience.<br/><br/>Jude Law is‚Äîas ever‚Äîreliable in what he's given to do. His exasperation with Holmes' peculiarities seemed a little intense for what would have been a lifelong acquaintance. But it doesn't help to compare the Sherlock Holmes enterprise with this particular film.<br/><br/>If I were casting this movie, I'd have put Mark Strong as Holmes (he has the stature, composure and profile) and Downey in the role of Lord Blackwood¬Ö. But here again there's no point in wishing this film and its concept were somehow different. We have to look at what's on the screen.<br/><br/>It's basically a ""Classics Illustrated"" version of Doyle's detective. Pow! Bam! Boom! being operative¬Öa lot. The washed out gray palette is appropriate (and right out of Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd""). Dirt is everywhere, even under Holmes' fingernails. The ""mystery"" here is of the Indiana Jones variety, and, in fact, the whole tone of the movie has that kind of daring do. The opening sequence is right out of Martin Campbell's ""Casino Royale."" And while this film isn't badly directed, it's just nothing new.<br/><br/>It would be nice to see Guy Ritchie get serious. He has talent, but he doesn't trust it. He wants to shock us, and, I guess he doesn't go to many films. Because today, the audience really can't be shocked. Downey rips off his shirt and has an extended ""boxing"" brawl to hone his¬Ö. Well we're not sure. But it gives Ritchie the opportunity to do something that has nothing to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And that isn't shocking; it's just silly.<br/><br/>""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,"" ""Sherlock, Jr."" were interesting shifts in points of view of this famous character. Ritchie's point of view is truculent, and it winds up looking, if not childish, sadly adolescent."

","Jude Law was the best part of this horrible mess; he actually did a decent job of portraying Dr. Watson, even with bad dialogue and direction. I normally love Robert Downey Jr.,but not in this; half of his dialogue was mumbled, whispered or spoken so fast it was difficult to understand. I'm not familiar with Rachel McAdams so I don't know if she is always a horrible actress, or was just bad in this. Everything is monochromatic gray, brown, murky and depressing; it might as well have been filmed in black and white. Except of course Irene Adler who was bright scarlet, perhaps because she's a scarlet woman? (eye roll), which just made it campy. And when did Sherlock Holmes become a ninja? I thought it had morphed into a Jackie Chan movie. I'm sorry, I read Arthur Conan Doyle's books and this would have him spinning in his grave. It's one pointless fight scene after another with boring dialogue, boring characters, boring scenery, boring direction and a boring plot. At points, it appeared to be trying to emulate Snatch (another Guy Ritchie movie that was actually well done) which just did not work here. Almost everyone's facial expressions and reactions seemed over done; from a lot of people who are normally much better actors, so I assume again it's bad direction. I finally shut it off maybe halfway through; I just didn't care what happened. and I was bored senseless."

"bob the moo","Null","2","6","7 January 2010"," A blockbuster (with the weaknesses that that brings) but entertaining and fun with good work by Downey and Law
","Having themselves witnessed the hanging and burial of murder and self-styled ""master of the occult"" Lord Blackwood, Holmes and Watson can close another case ‚Äì perhaps their last since Watson is planning to settle into marriage. However, a ruptured tomb and a missing corpse suggest that there may be something to Blackwood's threat to Holmes to return from beyond the grave and commit further crimes. With London in the grip of a panic over the supposed resurrection of Blackwood, Holmes and Watson attempt to solve the mystery even as the stakes are escalating.<br/><br/>The news that Mockney king Guy Ritchie was working on a new film of Sherlock Holmes was greeted by many (including myself) with trepidation at best and outright horror at worst. The inability of Ritchie to break away from the clich√©s and rather tired genre that he himself helped create led me to assume that he would simply be doing another version of his one trick but with a character probably called Sherlock ""Sleuther"" Holmes in it. Although there is an element of Ritchie doing his usual stuff, this didn't turn out to be the case because the film is all rather entertaining and makes for an enjoyable winter blockbuster ‚Äì perhaps not impressive enough to slug it out in the summer season, but certainly good enough to be in cinemas now. It must be said that some will have an issue with Holmes as a bare-knuckle fighter and other such ""updates"" but my attitude is that the Rathbone/Bruce films from the 1940's were not the most faithful either and put entertainment as their focus ‚Äì to the point that Holmes was moved forward in time to join the war effort against the Nazis for several films.<br/><br/>So the question is whether or not this new Holmes film is entertaining or not and whether or not the many liberties taken will annoy the casual viewer or not. The answer can be found by watching the film because mostly it is very easy to enjoy as a blockbuster film. The plot has weaker moments but is mostly good enough to keep things moving and, while it does rely on special effects and convenience at times, it does have sufficient meat (or at least appearance of meat) to make you feel like there is some logical substance to it. Of course the plot produces a lot of action, which is mostly reasonably good but is certainly not as exciting as it could have been. The editing is part of the problem as it employs a blurry style that seems to detract more than it adds. The use of CGI as well is best described as ""solid"" because while not bad, it is not as seamless or as well-used as one would have hoped. While mentioning the visuals I will add that, while it may have just been a poor projection in my screening, the whole film seemed poorly lit ‚Äì I'm fine with a Gothic dimness, but this was murky across the board and just made it harder to watch rather than adding atmosphere.<br/><br/>Ritchie's direction is solid as well. He produces some of his usual tricks but I did like his use of slow-motion at key moments, not because it made those moments more exciting (it didn't ‚Äì indeed it makes it a bit less so), but rather because it is different and does give the film a feel that makes it stand out a little from the other blockbusters that would do everything as fast and as noisy as possible. The main selling point of the film is not all this though, but rather the main thing that makes it fun ‚Äì which is the good work of the cast. Downey is surprisingly good as Holmes ‚Äì a fun character with a playful logic but also selfish and perhaps self-destructive streak. Likewise Law plays his Watson well, perhaps not bringing a lot to the character but allowing for the relationship between the two to be part of the film. Strong is a good villain of the piece, while Marsan does a typically ""two steps behind"" Lestrade. McAdams is good but it must be said that I did get the feel that most of her performance was about how good-looking she is rather than her abilities as an actress ‚Äì it works though.<br/><br/>The decision to leave Moriarty as character in the background is a good one because it gives the sequel(s) a strong card to play ‚Äì and one that I would return to watch. Ritchie's Holmes is not without weaknesses but it is solid enough to entertain, thanks mostly to the good turns from Downey and Law (individually and together) adding to the sense of fun that the film has."
"alienworlds","Null","2","6","5 January 2010"," Cast in reverse for some reason
","This film was, in my opinion, a perfect example of casting gone bad...Jude Law would have made an excellent Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downie Jr. would have made an excellent Dr. Watson...alas, they did it backwards, and the results are a funny Sherlock and a serious Dr. Watson. In short, it is quite the bastardization of the original concept, which is an excellent and timeless work of creative fiction. Also, and this should come as no surprise, the action sequences (action sequences in Sherlock Holmes?) were out of step with the original work, and came off as kind of tasteless in the true sense of the word-as in like eating cardboard. Maybe a fun bang for your buck if you are stuck at a shopping mall one afternoon and you have decided to depart the shopping experience for a film escape-it is that, but it just isn't up to snuff as far as film adaptations go. The historic time period visuals are left behind in the wake of casting the film the wrong way round, as is much of Sherlock Holmes dialogue, which is also frequently muffed by actor Robert Downie Jr."

","Well, what do you know? Guy Ritchie has gone all high-tech and mega-budget on our arses in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" the umpteenth movie incarnation of the world's most famous literary detective.<br/><br/>As embodied by Robert Downey Jr., this Holmes is no brandy-sniffing, pipe-smoking effete intellectual, spending his time peering at clues through an enlarged magnifying-glass, but rather a rough-and-tumble, athletic bad boy who boxes in his spare time, swan dives into the Thames to escape a villain, and performs more acts of gravity-defying derring-do than 007 on a busy day. In this installment, Holmes is locked in mortal combat with the dreaded Lord Blackburn, a murderous cult leader who miraculously returns from the dead after being hanged for his crimes. Jude Law plays Dr. Watson, Holmes' friend, confidante and personal physician, who is thinking of dissolving their crime-fighting partnership in favor of blessed domesticity in the form of marriage to one Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Rounding out the cast is Rachel McAdams as Holmes' one true love who just happens to be entangled in Blackburn's nefarious schemes.<br/><br/>As written by Robert Michael Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is long and loud and filled with enough explosions and detonations to keep the most restless 21st Century action movie fan rooted firmly to his seat. But all the stunt work and pyrotechnics are ultimately wasted in the service of one of those trite and tiresome plot-to-take-over-the-world scenarios that have become practically de rigueur in the world of big budget spectaculars these days. The Victorian Era period detail is nice, but it would have been a great deal nicer had cinematographer Philippe Rousselot seen fit to crank up the lighting a notch or two so we might actually be able to SEE some of it (hopefully, this flaw will be rectified in the DVD version).<br/><br/>That leaves us pretty much with the acting, which is dependably good given the caliber of the players involved. So revel in the performances and ignore the rest."
"phantom_fan89","8","2","6","1 January 2010"," Anything But Elementary
","FOR MORE REVIEWS FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ <br/><br/>Fresh from the superbly crafted RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie churns out a hugely entertaining, high voltage thrill ride which is by far the most superior popcorn movie of the year.<br/><br/>After the capture and execution of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood, reports surface that the evil genius has somehow risen from the grave. With Watson in tow Sherlock Holmes sets about solving a series of murders somehow related to the case whilst dealing with an old flame who has mysteriously re-entered his life.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film every pre-conceived notion you thought you had about Holmes mythology flies out the door (for the better i might add) as Ritchie's vision contains far more laughs, action and thrills than poor old Basil Rathbone or any other Holmes imitator could ever hope to imagine. For want of a better word Holmes and Watson kick butt, majorly. Not many directors do action better than Guy Ritchie and the sequences in the film has his unique stamp all over them.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a cracking good start, both fast paced and intriguing. Unfortunately it begins to meander during the middle as the increasing number of elements to the case become more and more convoluted. The film also spends more time setting up for a sequel than other movie in recent memory. The faceless villain Moriarty, who is all set to be Holmes next nemesis, nearly gets as much screen time as Lord Blackwood! Despite the poorly paced second half, the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is enough to keep you watching.<br/><br/>Downey Jr makes the role of the infamous detective all his own whilst retaining much of what made Holmes so special in the first place; superior intellect,wit, arrogance and petulance. Physically Downey Jr is about as different as you can get from the popular yet unsubstantiated Holmes iconography that we are usually presented with in adaptions. Yet this new Holmes is so darn likable that you really wouldn't want him any other way. Jude Law is also a far cry from the image of the balding, middle aged doctor we usually associate with Watson. Law invigorates the role, playing seamlessly off Downey Jr. Their relationship is reminiscent of the great buddy films of yesteryear and is one of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does not fare as well. The usually scene stealing Mark Strong is kind of a ho-hum villain. We do not spend enough time with his character or know enough about him to consider him a real threat, especially after sitting through endless acts of genius by Holmes, you never really fear that he will get the better of the wonder detective. Rachel McAdams is also miscast as Irene Adler, Holmes love interest and rival. Adams does not possess the maturity in her performance to make you feel as though she is the street savvy, criminal genius that she is made out to be.<br/><br/>The look of the film is fantastic. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot does a superb job at capturing 19th century London in all it's glory; from the docks, to the gritty mean streets to even Buckingham Palace, the film is rich in colour and authenticity. Ritchie's frequent editor James Herbert is back, bringing with him the techniques that make the film look typically Ritchie esquire. From the action sequences to the interweaving of past and present timelines, the editing is top shelf. To round of the high quality productions is super composer Hans Zimmer's musical score, which is one of the best of the year and adds to the overall excitement of the picture.<br/><br/>So if your in the mood for a rollicking, fun filled adventure flick that is anything but elementary, you won't do much better than Sherlock Holmes this holiday season"

","Going into this movie I was not expecting much. It did not receive the best reviews and did not really look like the best adaptation of Sherlock Holmes to me from the previews. After watching it I do think it was a little better than I was expecting, but it still had very much wrong with it.<br/><br/>First off, there was too much humor and dumb jokes for my taste. Some are certainly appropriate, as this is not meant to be the most serious movie of the decade, but it felt like every other line in the film was some stupid little joke.<br/><br/>I thought the story started pretty bad and was pretty bad throughout most of the film. I did not care for all the supernatural aspects. But of course it turned out that it was all a trick, which made the plot as a whole a bit more acceptable for me. <br/><br/>The worst part of the film was the conveyor leading to a saw scene. How clich√© was that? I feel like I have seen this same scene eight hundred times before. Of course they are going to save her one inch from being cut it two. That is the way it always plays out. The whole conveyor belt leading to death scene should be banned from all movies from now on.<br/><br/>I did like the way that Holmes deduced and explained things. Everything from the breakdown of his fights, to how he figured out his location when he was kidnapped, to his explanation of the case at the conclusion. It was all very in the spirit of what Sherlock Homes should be.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this for the price of a normal theater ticket, but perhaps for the cost of a movie rental."

Seeing these two names put together and on top of that reading the list of cast members made me lose all my calm and squeal as a piglet smelling a juicy carrot.<br/><br/>Right from the start mysterious villain calls out Robert Downey Jr. to prove his skills in acting, fighting and radiation of immediate charisma. Together with Jude Law they make an unbelievably good duo. Many times already we have seen a crime fighting couple that balances itself: crazy smart Holmes with precise and calculated Watson, but the manner they handle themselves is incredibly charming and the style is impeccable.<br/><br/>The plot stands out with its outstanding logic and moments of almost inhuman wit and fastness of thinking of Sherlock Holmes. Guy Ritchie's vision has helped us to admire the skills of unorthodox detective with far more drive than all the versions before. The nonlinearity of storyline keeps your mind working and the tension never drops to the point of boredom.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the music. Hans Zimmer once again delivered the soundtrack that reflects the character and the events to the point where they merge into one, engulfing viewers and taking them away from reality right into the action.<br/><br/>Summing up the observations I would say that the movie is definitely worth your attention. Once seen the urge for an additional portion of non-trivial mystery with a high quality action."

"josephrygaard","6","1","2","2 December 2019"," Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes (2009)
","""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) is an intellectual mystery movie featuring a great deal of character through Downey Jr. and Law. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>The character known as Sherlock Holmes is perceived in pop culture as a charismatic investigator who with his almost-supernatural set of abilities can crack even the toughest murder mysteries. This movie follows suites and is filled to the brim with wit, charismatic glee, and the essential, almost stereotypical antagonists (which borderlines the Satanistic realms, so sensitive watchers to that are cautioned). Nevertheless, the dynamic relationship which Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law showcases glues the movie together and fill in the cracks excellently - save one point.<br/><br/>The thrill of the movie, as well as the plot itself, hinges on the clues and details scattered throughout the runtime. They are obvious to recognize, but practically impossible to understand and put into context, save to Holmes. Where Sherlock Holmes could have its audience analyzing and pondering about the implication about the revealed objects, it instead saves the relevance until one big presentation after the climax, at which point the objects have lost a great deal of interest. This lack and use of information can lead some audiences to feeling alienated, uninterested and possibly frustrated, which is something to be cautioned about beforehand. As average entertainment, however, Sherlock Holmes does just fine.<br/><br/>The music from Hans Zimmer deserves a mention for its creative use of contemporary instruments blended in a dissonance still harmonious. A unique piece for sure, and one of a few great things that still makes Sherlock Holmes a pleasant watching experience, which is even enhanced in the sequel.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a frustrating but fun 6/10.

Another reason this movie is OK is Guy Ritchies cinematic story telling by rhythym of shots and cuts. It keeps the movie at a interesting pace.
The resolution of action shots were cool but the scripts specifics were weak and not logical, such as; Watson (an insightful doctor) who pronounces the evil Blackwood dead yet fails to not notice any rope marks around his neck because we are supposed to believe the reason for Blackwoods survival is by police corruption and supernatural concoctions. Holmes' ending explanation sequence doesn't land and therefor NO PAYOFF.

Let's just say this film moves slower than a tortoise, taking forever to become interesting or engaging.

The fact that my mother was itching to see this film meant that it was in a foreign dialect with subtitles, was about a tale of a forbidden love, or was done in black and white. I guess you could say ""family movies"" (in actuality whatever my mom wanted to see) didn't exactly have a positive connotation in my mind. My mom had her qualms about action-packed thrillers and films she reported were ""too unrealistic"". <br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure what my mom was taking that day, but for whatever reason she actually chose a decent film. More than decent. The scary part is that I think she liked it, too. In fact I'm pretty sure this was the first film my entire family found entertaining, so much so that we've probably all seen it a good three or four times and made it our priority to see the second one. <br/><br/>What was so good about Sherlock Holmes? Well I don't want to get into too many specifics, partly because I'm afraid I'll give something away, but mostly because I fear I've somehow muddled the first and second movies together and may make some comments that just aren't correct. It has to do with the pure genius of Robert Downey Jr.'s character. It is almost as if one is invited into the intricate abstractions of a most powerful mind within the very first scene. The whole audience gets to have the glory of feeling ""intellectual"" for the duration of two hours and eight minutes. Here we are met with a new superhero of sorts, one who relies entirely on his all-powerful mind. But he is not one of those bookworm geniuses caught reading in the library or wearing a lab coat, rather he is a man of intellect who relies on his intuition with all disregard for the law, or any obstacle, for that matter. <br/><br/>Holmes leads an atypical lifestyle, rooming with Dr. Watson, fighting for profit, testing out inventions at his will, and having an uncanny knack for sizing people up at first appearance. His character is not one that is revered, rather sourly accepted. His sarcasm and disregard for ""being liked"" add comedy to the film and his casual manner in the way he goes about his investigation is complemented by his overwhelming arrogance.<br/><br/>A man of such little care for the opinions of others would be nothing without his ""cher Watson"". Watson gives depth to the film, acting as Holmes' moral compass and best friend. What is a superhero without his trusty sidekick? Although in this case I might argue that Watson isn't actually his sidekick, and that the two share a corroborative relationship. Or maybe it's that Holmes is in fact subservient to Watson, but like an inquisitive dog, he begs for leash. When he gets that leash he runs off with it and is later brought back to heal when he finds that he is in a compromising situation. If you didn't see the movie you're probably perplexed by my analogy. Allow me to elaborate. Holmes has a certain distaste for doing what is publicly acceptable; he has a propensity to doing things such as insulting another or blowing cash away on a fight. Dr. Watson, on the other hand, plays the more respectable role of being a conscientious and hard worker within the boundaries of what is acceptable in society. Watson constantly advises Holmes on what not to do, but Holmes, being the egotistical outsider that he is, often dismisses Watson's pleading but often finds he is in need of the acclaimed Doctor's help. Watson's role is just as much that of a parent as a friend. <br/><br/>Being invited into the world of Sherlock Holmes is being invited into a world of strategy, darkness, and a strikingly refreshing use of slow motion play-by-play action. The mystery in Sherlock Holmes isn't really the basis of the movie; it serves more as an added inquiry. It provokes the viewer to try and think ahead of the plot line, to solve what inevitably will be solved, and to try to beat out Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>Of course there is some romance. The exchanges between Holmes and Irene Adler suggest a more than comfortable past between the two characters, which adds to the suspense throughout the film. Adler is a highly strong-minded feminist woman, a novel idea in nineteenth century London. She is independent and plays just as much the adversary of Holmes as she plays his infatuation. In contrast to society's belief of the woman as being the moral compass, Adler plays for the dark side, manipulating Holmes and asserting her valiance. By no means does her character conform to the general depiction of a nineteenth century ""lady"". <br/><br/>The best scene in the film takes place rightly at the end. This is the summary of Holmes' findings and thought process, the point at which the crime unravels and the audience shares that final ""ahah"" moment, leaving the theater with the same satisfaction as if they had cracked the case themselves. The last scene is the one that wraps it all together, and the cliffhanger ending leaves one's mouth watering for more of the clever antics, complicated romance, scintillating action scenes, and ceaseless intrigue¬Ö the perfect setup for a sequel."
"BA_Harrison","5","1","2","17 December 2011"," Nothing to write Holmes about.
","A life-long fan of Basil Rathbone's classic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, I had my reservations about Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of the character, particularly with Guy Ritchie directing (let's not forget that the man was responsible for turning Vinnie Jones into a movie star!).<br/><br/>As expected, this 21st century reinvention of Conan Doyle's great detective bears very little resemblance to any previous movie incarnation, Downey Jr. playing the sleuth as a scruffy, smug, loutish, and reckless brawler, while sidekick Watson (Jude Law) is considerably smarter‚Äîand handier with his fists‚Äîthan Nigel Bruce ever was.<br/><br/>Seeing the usually dapper detective and the equally eminent doctor portrayed in such manner is hard to come to terms with, but wasn't a deal-breaker for me‚ÄîI can appreciate a new spin on an old theme‚Äîbut the asinine script and unnecessarily flashy direction sadly was. An illogical, plot-hole ridden piece of guff, the film is peppered with juvenile humour and heavily stylised action set-pieces in a desperate effort to try and detract from the many weaknesses and flaws in the narrative, which start with a highly implausible fake execution and become more and more strained as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>As a piece of mindless popcorn nonsense, I guess this fares no worse than many a modern Hollywood blockbuster, but as a case for the finest crime-busting mind the world has ever known, it's far from brilliant."

","Most people often dismiss Sherlock as a boring detective who speaks in rather complex sentences. Supposedly, that's not exactly how he is in the books as this film demonstrates. The filmmakers apparently revealed the detective's true colors as a hard hitting, resourceful, and deductive individual.<br/><br/>Plot: Sherlock and his sidekick Dr. Watson find themselves on the trail of one of their toughest foes yet: Lord Blackwood. Blackwood claims that he has powers beyond human understanding and has plans that will shake the foundations of the world, but the undaunted Sherlock Holmes remains ever so persistent and will give any one of Blackwood's thugs that stand in his way a thorough beat down as he solves the unsolvable.<br/><br/>Sherlock is like Batman in so many ways. He has a reliable sidekick (Watson, like Robin), he's skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he uses tools, and he analyzes things to the smallest detail. He does have his own unique twists, being manipulative and being slightly egotistical, which makes him very humorous. In fact, a lot of scenes that he shares with Watson tend to be pretty funny. The action scenes are awesome, often employing slow-motion and clever camera work. The mystery that surrounds Blackwood really messes with your mind and it makes you interested in how all this is done and what are the relations.<br/><br/>Amazingly well done, this film is sure to entertain and beyond. Check it out."

I've read some of the other reviews, and I'm having a hard time understanding how some can just flat out criticize this movie. To each his own, I guess. The plot is a little far fetched, but so what?

","I've never read any Sherlock Holmes book or even watched any other TV or and films adapt ions so i'll have to rate the film standing alone. First of all, Downey mumbles it such a low key croak that words are heard to pick up. Nevermind, his character was likable enough.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes, it seemed that Guy Ritchie focused entirely on character development and that the chemistry between Law and Downey, that he totally forgotten about the story. The art design was second from none and the atmosphere was dismally morbid. These two elements juxtaposed very well with the story that soon begins rolling after those 45 minutes As you expect, everything is top notch. Acting, writing, costumes and designs, everything. But me not being a Holmes fan, i didn't rate it much"

","I have to say that this movie was better than I had initially presumed. Even though I never had the chance to see it in theaters,sadly, this movie was still worth watching, even if it was on cable. My only disappointment was that I did not get a chance to view it in theaters, as I am sure this is one of those films made for the Big-Screen in. This movie also brought back memories of the old B&W movies from the 1930s & 40s that I would watch with my father. Law and Downey Jr did a great job of breathing life back into these dusty old character's with strong support from Mark Strong and Rachel McAdams! This movie has settled snugly and comfortably into the recesses of my heart. My only complaint about this movie was that the plot was not much of a brain teaser and rather elementary. I might have given this movie a 10 star mark instead of an 8. Even so, it's a great movie and one that is worth watching more than just once. Enjoy!"
"ajs-10","8","1","2","9 January 2011"," Very enjoyable!...
","I originally saw this one at the cinema in early 2010; it was a small room, packed out and not much of an enjoyable viewing experience. It has now made it to the small screen and I am able to watch it in comfort¬Ö so much better! Now, I don't know if it was the better viewing conditions, or the fact I have a better sound system than my local cinema, but I enjoyed this one a tad more second time around. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please walk Gladstone, the dog, while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Holmes and Watson occupy rooms at 221b Baker Street, however, their idyll is soon to be disturbed because Watson has got engaged and plans to move out to be with his new bride. It's Victorian London and they currently have more pressing matters, the game's afoot! We begin with Holmes and Watson closing in on Lord Blackwood, who is in the throws of performing a satanic ritual in the catacombs below London. They successfully apprehend him and he is arrested by Inspector Lestrade. Sentenced to death, Lord Blackwood calls for Holmes and warns him that there will be four more murders. Having been hanged and pronounced dead, by Watson, his body is interred. The following day his tomb has been opened from the inside and he has been seen wandering about the graveyard. It seems Holmes and Watson have another mystery to solve. At this point, Irene Adler, a former adversary of Holmes appears on the scene and commissions him to find a man involved in the Blackwood case. This will lead them to a conspiracy that threatens the bedrock of British society. She is in the employ of a very mysterious stranger, a professor of some kind. I think that's enough to whet you appetite¬Ö I don't want to give the game away.<br/><br/>A very well made film with plenty of action and some really great comedic moments. I loved the interplay between Holmes and Watson; they were almost like an old married couple at times, which was really amusing. Great performances from all of the leading cast, Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lastrade and Robert Maillet as Derdger, Holmes's fighting nemesis.<br/><br/>I found this a most enjoyable film to watch second time around. The score, by Hans Zimmer was spot on and fitted the action on screen perfectly. Although the dialogue does get a little bogged down at times, there was still plenty to keep the viewer's attention. The fight scenes, and one scene in particular featuring an explosion in slow motion were all excellent¬Ö hats off to the stunt and technical guys for those! Over all, very entertaining and well worth a viewing!... Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.8/10"
"Prichards12345","7","1","2","27 December 2010"," Enjoyable Fun
","I've been a Holmes fan since I first read the short stories at the age of 13 - I know them very well and am familiar with a lot of the adaptions of Doyle's work. And there is very little in this film concerning Holmes' character that isn't mentioned somewhere in the ""Canon"". I found it a neat trick to re-emphasise Holmes' abilities, instead of the reasoning machine who is talked of being an expert boxer we get to see it. Many of the little details are taken directly from the stories - Holmes' poisoning of Watson's bull-pup for example.<br/><br/>I found Robert Downey jr to be an excellent, if more dishevelled Holmes. But if your idea of the consulting detective is the Jeremy Brett t.v. series you better forget it here. Jude Law, an actor I've always found to be an acquired taste, is also a fine Watson, and the two get involved in as much fighting and fisticuffs as detecting. In short, it's great fun, ably handled by Guy Ritchie. I thought him a strange choice to direct a Holmes movie before I actually saw it: but I was wrong. Richie captures the seedy Victorian London milieu splendidly.<br/><br/>The story is in the vein of a supernatural happening that Holmes has to try and disprove, like Hound Of The Baskervilles or The Sussex Vampire. The solution to the mystery is a little far-fetched to say the least, but then, it's surely meant to be. There's a lot of geographical jiggory-pokery going on, too. Holmes purists will not be pleased, but I'm not so stuffy: an entertaining ride with plenty of humour."
"Jakealope","5","1","2","31 October 2010"," Not Really Sherlock Holmes, More Like Norris as Bond
","This is a Guy Ritchie movie first off. If you liked ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock.. "", you'd probably like this one. As just a movie, it is par for a modern detective buddy kick ass movie like Lethal Weapon, dressed in Victorian garb. He is supposed to be Sherlock Holmes but he's more like Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon's Riggs, an unstable violence dealing character, than the staid, calm, thoughtful Holmes most of us are familiar with. That part is what bothers me in all these re-imaginings ala Star Trek, where some icon is turned into a ass kicking machine full of non stop stunts & special effects. Ironically, the main saving grace is Robert Downey Jr. who did a good job bringing his dissolute but ass kicking Holmes character to life. For instance, Holmes engages in bare fisted underground boxing matches, like Pitt in ""Snatch"", to raise money & stay fit. Okay, the old Holmes was no wimp, but he was not into large amounts of hacking, kicking & blasting that modern blubber heads demand from their heroes. Rachel McAdam was okay as some sort of Catwoman nemesis, accomplice and love aspect Irene Adler to Holmes. But even she was more like Alice from ""Resident Evil"" than what an upper class Victorian woman would be, with her fighting skills almost on par with our dynamic duo. Jude Law played the dandified but equally bad ass Dr. Watson, with a Felix-Oscar like tension between the two heroes over Holmes-Downey's obnoxious, dissolute ways, which was funny and added some humor.<br/><br/>Okay, there is some plot about some evil Lord Blackwood, played by the same guy who was the evil don from ""Kick-Ass"", Mark Strong. He and his upper class pals are into some black magic Egyptian like Satanic cult. He mysteriously comes back from the dead, after a well deserved hanging, to terrorize London and bring his black magic cabal into power. Well the Black Lord is scaring the bejeesus out of everyone except Holmes who is dogging him and his crew through London with the seemingly unwilling help of Watson & Adler.<br/><br/>In this, the movie reminds me of the far better ""From Hell"" which featured a dissolute but far less lethal detective, played by Johnny Depp, dogging some mumbo jumbo star chamber cult that was butchering whores ala Jack the Ripper. That movie spent some time exploring the bad part of town and more intangible magical aspects, as opposed to the detailed but utterly phony CGI London in this movie, a set that never stopped crying ""High Price FAKE"".<br/><br/>Okay, in brief, the acting made it bearable, but the perversion of such an icon, as well as the cheesy Victorian CGI set & EFX extravaganza made it lose what ever class and charm that one would expect from Sherlock Holmes."
"MBunge","7","1","2","11 October 2010"," Hoping for a better sequel
","Much like the new Star Trek movie, Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes breathes new, albeit imperfect, life into the master detective. Powered along by two energetic and engaging performances, this film is fun, funny and action-packed¬Öif a little ragged and unpolished.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Holmes and Watson (Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law) taking on the mysterious and seemingly mystical Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). After they catch Blackwood trying to sacrifice a young girl, Holmes and Watson see him die on the gallows. When Blackwood seemingly rises from the grave to continue his reign of terror in London, the world's greatest consulting detective and his stout companion must uncover the secrets behind Blackwood's magic and foil his sinister plan to take over the British Empire. Complicating matters is the friction between Holmes and Watson over the good doctor's impending engagement to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), which threatens to end their crime-fighting partnership, and the return of Holmes' old flame, the globe-trotting criminal Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, who has her own agenda involving Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is one of those movies where the things that are good in it are really, really good. The best of those things is the superb job Robert Downey Jr. does in giving us a different but credible take on a legendary character. Downey's Holmes is far removed from the cool, almost disembodied intellect of previous incarnations. His is a brilliantly frazzled genius of loose ends and rough character. He's less Basil Rathbone and more Tom Baker, the fourth Doctor from the British TV series ""Doctor Who"". Jude Law is Downey's equal, transforming Dr. Watson from slow-witted sidekick into a pillar of strength on which Holmes relies. This Watson may not be as clever as Holmes, but he's his equal in every other respect.<br/><br/>Downey and Law together are tremendous. Their chemistry as actors blossoms into their deep friendship as characters. This Holmes and Watson enjoy each others' company almost as much as they enjoy battling the forces of evil and it shows in everything they say and every move they make. Downey and Law could make a dozen more Sherlock Holmes films and they'd always be a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Director Ritchie also gives us a visually charged look at Victorian London that manages to be interesting without recalling the processed unreality of the disastrous mess that was Will Smith's Wild Wild West movie. Ritchie may have supercharged the energy and pace of Victorian life to make it more palatable to the Age of Twitter, but he keeps things grounded enough to avoid looking ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now, like the new Star Trek film, you don't have to look too hard to find quite a few flaws in this new version of Sherlock Holmes. The story is rather labored and when its mysteries are finally laid bare, you can't help but notice they're all closer to Scooby Doo than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Rachel McAdams is also more a hindrance than a help to anything. She's a beautiful woman and a fine actress, but she doesn't have the natural sass and strength for this sort of role. Compared to the solid and sharp Kelly Reilly as Watson's future bride, McAdams seems limp and lifeless when matched against Downey. That Irene Adler looks to be about one-third the age of Sherlock Holmes is also kind of glaringly incongruous. This script, as well, does one of the most thick-fingering jobs of setting up a sequel that you'll ever see. In addition, Ritchie's direction is weirdly unsettled. A couple of his action scenes are nearly indecipherable and there are times it feels like he's fighting against the flow of his actors and their dialog.<br/><br/>None of those problems change the fact that I like this movie. It's not perfect, but Sherlock Holmes is a damn sight better than the unadulterated crap that Hollywood too often spits out at us. It's fast without being frantic, light-hearted without being stupid and it's always working hard to try and entertain its audience. I hope Downey and Law get a chance to make a great Sherlock Holmes film. For now, I'm content with the good one they've already made."
"mukava991","4","1","2","13 September 2010"," so-so - but why these actors?
","Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a so-so 21st-century reimagining of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle detective and his sidekick as (surprise, surprise!) action comic heroes who operate in a cartoonish CGI version of late 19th century London ‚Äì big, cluttered, loud, ultra- violent, over-produced, over-scored, over-stuffed and hyperactive. But ‚Äì it's the 21st century, folks, so what do you expect?<br/><br/>When Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) aren't engaging in stunts they engage in often self-conscious attempts at witty banter, married-couple-style bickering, and in the case of Holmes, rapid-fire internal and external monologues reciting his brilliant deductions from whatever collection of facts happens to be presenting itself at any given moment, as if to grudgingly cram the essence of Holmes into a film that otherwise seeks to diminish and de-emphasize it at every turn. Sometimes the droll mutterings, following gasp-inducing moments of physical torment, are funny, thanks to the skills of the lead actors, but for Ritchie and his team ‚Äì of what? 5, 6, 7 screenwriters? - it isn't enough to present Holmes and Watson as two men who get along well, share quarters on Baker Street and analyze tangled masses of evidence by the use of deductive reasoning; he has to give them love affairs and superhuman physical feats to perform; the Doyle raw material isn't enough (oddly, it has served the reading public superbly for over 100 years).<br/><br/>For whatever reasons the film is burdened with two subplots involving Holmes's and Watson's relationships with females. Neither adds up to much.<br/><br/>When Downey and Law are given the chance to interact verbally in one-on-one scenes, they shine and command attention. But too often they are reduced to flying projectiles in the director's frenzied mise-en-scene. Downey gives it all he's got but never convinces. He is presented visually as a grungy bohemian pugilist, but he performs with elegance, understatement and refinement to the fullest extent possible under the circumstances; but the contrast works against the character so that he emerges as a sort of Indiana Jones. As an action hero, he's fine, but Holmes he ain't. Law, too, doesn't quite fit his role. He is a little too youthful, too spiffy in his tailored suits, too cute. But Law too, by the virtue of his skill and talent, almost overcomes it. But what is the point of such radical revamping of classic characters? Why not just create completely new characters, or do the old ones right? One would never, ever, having read any of the Doyle adventures, picture either of these actors in these roles. Fifteen years ago Jeremy Irons would have made a splendid Holmes and any number of British actors would have made an equally appropriate Watson.<br/><br/>For all the expense and fuss, there is really nothing new or different here. It feels like every other slam-bang-chase-explosion flick we've seen for decades. The unique flavor of Holmes and Watson is pulverized in all of the clattering mess. It could just as well be James Bond transported back into Victorian times.<br/><br/>At the end we are led to believe that Holmes's chief nemesis, Prof. Moriarty, the real evil behind this film's villain, Mr. Blackwood, is still at large. In other words, a sequel looms."
"fred-kolb","8","1","2","20 July 2010"," A modern take on the most brilliant literary detective ever, with a fantastic Downey, Jr.!
","Published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, sometime around the turn of the 20th century, the ""Sherlock Holmes"" stories have become classics of British literature, and have been turned into movies or TV Series dozens of times. But then, when you think you have seen it all, seen him solve every possible murder involving every possible scenario (my favorite still being ""The Speckled Band"" about a psychopathic ex-doctor and convicted murderer, who plans to kill his stepdaughters using a poisonous snake), Guy Ritchie comes along and makes a film with the incredibly original and creative title ""Sherlock Holmes"".<br/><br/>Now, the highly conservative Holmes fans will probably give this film ten minutes before they throw the remote control at the TV, but those who have never read the stories will most likely appreciate Ritchie's take on the material. From the highly intelligent, charismatic, professional, and dry character in the books, Holmes turns into a crazy, obnoxious and cynical figure, who enjoys fighting and gambling in the boxing ring and even has a love relationship, something unthinkable for the original. Rather than a classic detective story, this is a modern, action film with plenty of chases and explosions, set to the background of 1890s London and except for the basic outline, doesn't have anything in common with the literary style of Conan Doyle's works.<br/><br/>Lord Blackwood, a necromancer and practionist of black magic, is caught in the act of performing a deadly ritual on a young woman by Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson and sentenced to death by hanging. Initially, this was also the last case Holmes and Watson were to be working together, before the latter moved out their office and home at Baker Street 221B, and moved together with his girlfriend Mary. Holmes, not too fond of the idea of loosing his partner and best friend, tries to spoil Watson's relationship by any means possible, but he soon realizes that Watson is serious and fears that their long working relationship is over. But then, Lord Blackwood mysteriously vanishes from his grave and is seen wandering around London, murdering the leading members of one of London's secret societies, the Temple of the Four Orders. Watson, who provided the death certificate at Blackwood's execution, is convinced by Holmes to help him close this case, since not only the safety of London is in danger but also Watson's reputation. But soon they discover that there is much more to it, when Irene Adler, a former lover of Holmes shows up in London, but can Holmes still trust her, especially since she doesn't even bother hiding her profession of a thief from him? <br/><br/>Whether you like the modern approach to Sherlock Holmes is of very little importance when looking at the stunning sets that have been build up for this film. London looks fascinating, perfectly creating a nostalgic atmosphere and a creepy feeling in its narrow alleys. Then there are famous landmarks,like the half-finished Tower Bridge, or the Docks, which make the entire scenery even more realistic and it's amazing how easy it has become today to age even a city by 100 years without there being a single glitch in the visuals. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is wonderfully constructed as an action movie, with not excessively overused action scenes, but some greatly choreographed fights. There is a moment,relatively early in this movie, when Holmes is in the boxing ring with an opponent and the smug detective analyzes and predicts every single movement he needs to make against that rock of a guy to beat him,something shown in slow motion attacks. Many of the typical Holmes clich√©s are woven into the story just like that, and most of the time it's just incredibly funny how many references to the Conan Doyle stories are included, but yet this film never becomes a complete parody of the character. Hans Zimmer composed a great score, which has a wonderful old, but energetic feel to it, and was among this year's Oscar nominees for Original Score. The one thing that really bugged me about this so-called ""popcorn flick"" was how much stuff was thrown into the plot regarding the case, and when Holmes eventually starts to reveal the entire mystery towards the end, I had somewhat lost count of which chemicals were used and how exactly everyone met their demise.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. single-handedly brings the character of Sherlock Holmes back to life, and does it in such a funny, fresh, and crazy way, that he proves once more that he could probably play a brick wall and still receive praise for it. This guy really succeeds in all of his roles, and not only does he have the right charisma and believable ingenuity to play the detective, but he's just so damn sympathetic. Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law, who sadly enjoys a very unfair reputation concerning his looks being better than his acting talent has great chemistry with Holmes and makes a rather convincing doctor and, once again different than in the books, is more than capable of taking out guys with a bigger biceps and Pecs than he has. Rachel McAdams looks cute, certainly, but her chances to act are very limited and most of the time her job is either to look hot or seduce Holmes, making their relationship rather dry, shallow and sparkless, while Mark Strong, whom I already liked in ""Body of Lies"" gives a menacing and creepy performance as Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes"" deserves compliments for its freshness and originality in bringing an old-fashioned literary character back to screen. Conan Doyle would probably role over in his grace if he knew this film existed, but those who really want to see an exciting, fast-paced and somewhat unusual flick, should definitely not miss this one."

","When you think of a Guy Ritchie film...what do you think of? Corky, goofy, hilarious and always in your face. Sherlock Holmes didn't do it for me. Ritchie seemed to pull away from the interesting way he likes to make films and tried to make a movie closer to the likes of the typical, everyday boring Hollywood filmmaker.<br/><br/>His films Snatch and Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels are the best examples of his directing career. Filled with never before seen characters with never before seen attitudes he concentrated on characters and a strong story. However, with Sherlock Holmes he abandoned those virtues I grew to love and just...didn't seem to be fully devoted.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes seemed almost a sure fire win and when it came out I was very eager to see it. But for some reason it didn't feel like a true Guy Ritchie film. It felt forced and not altogether there. I also thought that with Jude Law the movie couldn't have been entirely bad, but even Jude failed to impress.<br/><br/>Even though this was quite a fail I am still looking forward to Ritchies next film in hopes that he will bring us a movie that includes his zany attitude and glowing characters."

","Robert Downey Jr. is an actor I admire, and I loved most of the cast, but Guy Ritchie's style didn't sit well with me, and in the end I caught myself looking at my watch more then once. The action set pieces are impressive, at least some of them but it's quirky style often bothered me a lot of the time, with Downey Jr's performance not being that great in my opinion. It was way too talky for my liking at times, with Rachel McAdams character not having much to do, and that irked me to no end because she's capable of so much more. I enjoy a lot of the older adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, but this one just didn't cut it. The atmosphere they had right, the costumes were magnificent and Downey Jr looked fittingly drugged up, but I just felt bored by it all and often wondered how it brought it in so much money.<br/><br/>Performances. Robert Downey Jr. is OK, but nothing more then that. He is convincingly drugged up he puts his swagger on, but I just felt he over did it sometimes, especially with the mumbling. Jude Law is much better here. He didn't have as much to do, but his performance felt more real. Rachel McAdams is gorgeous of course, but her character is terribly wasted in my opinion.<br/><br/>Bottom line. I didn't get what all the fuss was about, and in fact found it to be a very boring affair. If there is a sequel I'll probably check it out, but I won't be too eager too.<br/><br/>5/10"
"maatmouse-1","8","1","2","26 May 2010"," Guy's nice turn at an old classic
","It can't be easy coming to something like Sherlock Holmes and trying to find a new angle on it, without completely throwing out the essence of what Holmes is all about. However, Guy Richie manages to do just that.<br/><br/>The plot is a tangled one. Holmes and Watson are called to a mysterious house where a ritualistic ceremony is about to take place. Wielding the knife is the mysterious Lord Blackwood, played in very dark fashion by Mark Strong. Blackwood is finally arrested by Lestrade as usual and taken away. <br/><br/>After a trial, Lord Blackwood is deemed to be guilty and subsequently hung. Before his death, he has a visit from Holmes. It is Doctor Watson who pronounces the man dead. Apparently. A few days later, Blackwood apparently rises from the dead and begins a reign of terror. It turns out that Blackwood is a member of some weird and wonderful Masonic style cult who are intent, on domination of the government and country. It is down to Holmes, Watson and a mysterious associate of Holmes to stop him. <br/><br/>I came to this film, having read one book (A study in scarlet) and seen a number of TV series, including the Jeremy Brett Holmes. Initially, the trailer was very misleading, making this out to be an action film whereas it is one part action and mostly establishment of plot and delving into Holmes' relationship with Watson, who has moved out of Baker St and is trying to have a relationship with Mary, his fianc√©. <br/><br/>Downey Jr gives Holmes a nice, edgy performance, befitting with the character's upper class origins and intelligence. He also affords a glimpse into Holmes' experience as a bare-knuckle fighter which some purists feel is not in keeping with the character's origins at all. I personally felt Jude Law was good as Dr Watson, although the book makes Watson out to be an older man, dealing with the terrible consequences of fighting abroad and being world- weary in a way that Law doesn't quite manage to convey. Other characters are interesting but not particularly well realised. <br/><br/>All in all, a nicely done movie. Plenty of good plot exposition and some fine moments. Richie has managed to give us attention to detail which is always nice and hasn't gone overboard with CGI, which has a tendency to happen when you're dealing with a London which really, for the most part, no longer exists."

","I like detective series of detective movies. It's like Columbo; you already know who is the villain, but it's the question how to trap this villain.<br/><br/>So Sherlock Holmes starts good. You get to see the warner brothers logo in the street. That was beautiful done, this is immediately how the rest of the movie is; beautiful. When it comes to Holmes, Watson and Blackwood, I got the idea I was looking to Scooby Doo without an animated dog. Although the movie and special effects were beautiful, the movie itself was boring.<br/><br/>Then there is a female thief who had a relationship with Holmes. There are some scenes where she comes in situations where Holmes have to safe her. Well, I didn't care if she would die or not. Holmes is the main character. This woman cheats on him, so why would Holmes care for her life? Strange man.<br/><br/>The way Holmes calculates what he does, like fighting, was well brought into picture. It gets you to see how he thinks.<br/><br/>Jude Law gave a great performance. I was at the edge of my seat when he was blown away. Every time I saw Downey I was waiting for him to put on his Ironman suit.<br/><br/>So now Richi is thinking about making a sequel. Ah well, Scooby Doo got a sequel too."
"jshadle0807","7","1","2","12 May 2010"," A Remake Done Almost Right
","Guy Richie has finally proved himself as a credible director. I never thought he was capable of something of this caliber and I am very happy to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is an excellent remake of the classic detective story. It also opened the eyes of the audience to the real Sherlock Holmes. He was by no means perfect and yes, Gregory House is very heavily based on him. Holmes drank, did drugs, started fights, and was a complete ***. Many people already knew that but over time, Holmes has become almost a role model. He's not.<br/><br/>The cinematography was incredible. Richie and his team brought old London to life on the screen. The costumes were perfection and added to the ambiance.<br/><br/>The screenplay was great. The banter between Holmes and Watson was witty and funny. You could hear the mutual respect for each other but we did see Watson become exasperated with Holmes several times for which I'm glad. No friendship is perfect and really, who could deal with Holmes with a smile all the time? Robert Downing Jr, Holmes, and Jude Law, Watson, had great chemistry. They were perfect together and their banter was so fast! Some of the jokes went over your head because they went so fast but I wouldn't change it. It was done right.<br/><br/>However, their jokes also cost them a star in my book. Some moments were very powerful and dark but then a joke would occur. Yes the joke was hysterical but it didn't fit. I think the screenwriters came up with the joke and didn't want to get rid of it which is fine but the jokes wrecked some really great moments in the film.<br/><br/>The other issue I had was with Irene Alder. (SPOILER) I felt like no one could decide if they wanted there to be a romantic interest between her and Holmes. Sometimes I felt like it would happen then the next second, nope. In the original series, Alder and Holmes weren't a 'thing' but I don't object to it happening on screen. But I just wanted them to pick! Also, who believed that she was the one person who could fool Holmes? Exactly, no one.<br/><br/>It was a great film but there are a couple of things that stop it from being excellent. It's also a little long but I didn't feel like it dragged like some other films. I'd recommend it to anyone but I'd recommend some other films first."
"revival05","7","1","2","26 April 2010"," Elementary with Downey
","In Sherlock Holmes as of 2009, under direction by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock is introduced using all his deductive skills to properly figure out how to kick a guy's ass in a matter of seconds and then proceeding to do it. For the rest of the film, Holmes is running about slightly neurotic with no sense of personal hygiene or taste. Yeah, exactly, he's played by Robert Downey Jr, you got it. Apparently there's two ways you can look at this and as far as I understand they are both valid - Robert Downey Jr is doing Sherlock Holmes more in the line of what the original Conan Doyle creation was. At the same time, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes are two steps away from joining the X-Men or the Fantastic Four. Makes sense too, I guess. It's the ""contemporary"" approach.<br/><br/>All in all though, this cartoon version of Doyle's Sherlock is a lot of fun. Amusement is the key word, and the big reason is Robert Downey Jr who lifts the entire film up and carries it in his arms from the very beginning to the very end. No, make that to the very ""to be continued"" (it's ""contemporary""). Not even Jude Law playing doctor Watson can do as much for the film as he does. The story - concerning the mysterious case of the gallow-dangling Lord Blackwood who apparently is coming back from the dead for a dastardly plot against the kingdom - only works because Downey Jr says it's worth following. The clues and the plot turns are only interesting because they happen to him. His fighting at the 19th century Fight Club and the 60's Batman style fight sequences only works because he's doing it and we only buy his deductive brilliance because he seems to believe in it himself. Even his love interest, the quite weak Rachel McAdams, works solely for the reason that he seems to be madly and problematically in love with her. In fact, toward the end when we are tempted with a sequel featuring Holmes' arch nemesis himself, I wanted to see the sequel just because Robert Downey Jr would do this one more time!<br/><br/>The only qualitative thing that Robert Downey Jr isn't responsible of, the film leaves to Jude Law and the sub-plot concerning his Watson getting married to some woman and Holmes being jealous over it. Holmes and Watson, arguably the biggest closet couple in the history of literature, are basically a real dynamic duo here, and it's interesting how the movie doesn't make any effort in denying their relationship. Nothing specific occurs and at the same time, there are no clever jokes or hints to the audience. It's just there, which is both a surprise and a bit of a progressive move. By simply assuming their relation to begin with, nothing more needs to be said and the MPAA can rate it PG-13 for some violence and ""suggestive material"".<br/><br/>It's easy to understand how old Holmes afficinados might treat this Sherlock Holmes with absinthe and a sad fiddle. But to be fair, it could have been so much worse and it's probably the most refreshing film Guy Ritchie has made in years. It's Sherlock Holmes with a bag of popcorn. All elementary, in it's own way."

","I first came across Sherlock Holmes when my Dad brought me a present from a trip he had been on.It was a Complete Sherlock Holmes Volume. I was about 10 and very disappointed. About a year later I was bored so I tried reading it. I was absolutely entranced and gripped by the stories and read them again and again. I have seen a few movies and tried the TV series but although not awful they were not satisfying. I had no great hopes of Guy Ritchie's entry into this particular ring. An American playing Holmes? Even if it were Robert Downey Jr (whom I love as an actor)? Well, dear readers, it works superbly. Downey and Law are a charismatic pairing and the movie is just about as good as it could be. Such energy is brought to the story , it carries the viewer along at a tremendous pace. The whole depiction of Victorian London looks and feels right and is as much of a character as any of the actors. The supporting actors themselves are more than up to the job too - Mark Strong's villain is imposing, dark and menacing - but then he is a fantastic actor and he too would have made for an interesting Holmes, in my opinion. Eddie Marsan always gives good value and his Lestrade fitted right in. I would have liked to have seen the pace slowed a little from time to time so I could take a breath, but that is nitpicking. An excellent venture and I and my wife look forward to the next one. A wonderful achievement by all."
"colinrgeorge","6","1","2","6 April 2010"," ""Sherlock Holmes""
","""Sherlock Holmes"" by way of Guy Ritchie sounds about as good a pairing as Michael Bay and the Old Testament, but the director's mainstream sensibility and testosterone-infused filmography color a surprisingly inoffensive adaptation, thanks in large part to the charismatic performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, respectively. I have a hunch that longtime fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's intrepid detective may be put off by Ritchie's brawn over brains approach to the material, which paints its protagonist as ostensibly an Indiana Jones, but the film suffices as harmless fun if not a serious head scratcher.<br/><br/>Action invariably supersedes mystery, and unraveling Holmes' latest case leads to fisticuffs more often than not, but purists needn't worry that their hero has been stripped entirely of his intellect. Even in one of countless gratuitous fight sequences with ""Matrix""-esque speed- ramping, Ritchie's Holmes is always portrayed as a thinker. He carefully calculates the impact of each of his blows, instantaneously deriving the quickest route to his enemy's defeat before its painful execution. The screenplay employs this method of doubling back on a scene to reveal the product of Holmes' clever schemes throughout, heightening sequences that might otherwise consist of purely expository dialogue.<br/><br/>Where I do take issue with the film, however, is in the mystery itself, which never packs the sort of revelations the genre typically needs to. The plot is centered on one Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), an occultist and murderer who is sentenced to death by hanging, only to return from grave shortly thereafter. Perhaps I pack my own skepticism in this interpretation, which is partly why I don't consider it a spoiler, but it was always clear to me that Blackwood was an illusionist. His feats of supposed magic don't seem incredible enough to not have a rational explanation, and as a result, the disclosure of their orchestration is less surprising than merely satisfactory. Fortunately, the sequence of events that lead Holmes to this predictable discovery is less transparent. In fact, often the contrary, though perhaps more due to staccato pacing and thick accents than legitimate intrigue, but it's nevertheless more fun to be one step behind Holmes than one in front.<br/><br/>Still, the film has plenty more going for it to make it worth a family or friendly outing. Hans Zimmer provides a memorable score, and the production design creates a surprisingly authentic turn-of-the-century London, especially in comparison to other big-budget period blunders like Peter Jackson's 2005 adaptation of ""King Kong,"" which took at best a half- hearted approach to recreating the thirties. Ritchie's team impresses with moody interiors and muddy streets only occasionally blemished by over-indulgent CGI cityscapes. The chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law compensates for a disappointing script, and keeps the film from feeling like a slog.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes"" is neither a triumph nor a disaster, and while 2009 may have brought us plenty of better blockbusters, it delivered just as many worse. ""Holmes"" has enough charm and wit to recommend for an impromptu cineplex Saturday, especially heading into what looks like a tepid January. It turns out the world-class sleuth and Guy Ritchie make a decent pair after all, and with an ending that clearly assumes a sequel, the greatest mystery is not if they'll re-team, but when."

The director did s good job with the cast Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law do an excellent job together. For me this movie was up there with Avatar. This movie went almost completely with the book and I left the movie theater wanting the DVD. I am impressed with how clean this movie is little or no sexuality whatsoever and little or no cussing. I read that Percy Jackson and the Olympians had more sexuality and cussing that left me woefully disappointed. It was supposed to be a FAMILY movie Sherlock Holmes was much better than that and the only reason I gave it a nine was because it was a tiny bit hard to follow.

"gradyharp","8","1","2","4 April 2010"," Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Transmogrified by Guy Ritchie
","SHERLOCK HOLMES a la Guy Ritchie - seems like a non sequitur, but the trade off of Doyle's cerebral manner with Ritchie's visceral visual version makes for a very interesting if at times frustrating film. The rather silly screen story was hatched by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson (who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg) and despite the general lack of resemblance of Ritchie's concept of a messy, hygiene-challenged sot of a Holmes (as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr) the overall result is a Victorian London come alive in a richly colorful way. Jude Law is placed in the shoes of Dr. Watson and makes them fit despite the original's more dignified persona. And the ever present quintessential evil - Professor Moriarty - becomes a rather excessively far-fetched immortal presence of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), his accomplice is one Lord Coward (Hans Mathesen). Rachel Mc Adams adds to the flavor of Ritchie's kickboxing fast forward fighting Irene Adler, and Watson's affianced Mary Morstan is a look-quickly-before-she- disappears Kelly Reilly. <br/><br/>To be fair much of the original smart and sharp witted conversations and mind-workings of Holmes have been preserved: the dialog of the author's style comes in quickly delivered digressions amongst the explosions and CGI effects. The film is a long song and may lose a few to nodding off before the final credits, but stay awake if you can, because the artwork of the credits is startlingly fine! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Sherlock Holmes and his faithful assistant Watson are on the case of a man who has seemingly risen from the dead to terrorize London. While the police seem clueless, Holmes is on top of things, and while his methods are unorthodox, they just might work.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is great in anything he does, but he makes a particularly fine Sherlock Holmes -- the English equivalent of Tony Stark. Jude Law is a respectable Dr. John Watson, and fleshes out what could have been a forgettable character. Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler, the love interest. I have a personal dislike for McAdams and view her as the weak part of the film, but that's likely just my own bias.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the film was great, but almost too polished at times, clearly computerized. This is a new venture for Guy Ritchie, who also has ventured away from the 'R' rating for the first time. He does, though, push the boundaries a bit. Ritchie was also said to remove Holmes' hat, and the line ""elementary"", which was clearly a good move... Ritchie has proved himself capable of much more than gangster flicks.<br/><br/>Some people have claimed the film has homoerotic undertones, while others have denied any such thing. I saw it immediately. You may write it off as ""friendship"", but there are plenty of lines that blurred the picture and the entire dinner scene with Mary was very tense in a jealous lover sort of sense.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer was robbed. If this film has no other Oscar-worthy things going for it (and that may well be true), Zimmer's score blew me away and really drove the film. I don't mean to say that the winner's score was bad, but if anyone thinks that Zimmer didn't take this music and thrust it into a whole new level of powerful soundscaping, you are deaf.<br/><br/>What this film probably does best is sets up for a sequel that could outdo the first... recall how ""Batman Begins"" left an opening for ""The Dark Knight""? A similar act is followed here. And while no sequel has been officially announced to my knowledge, I have to say that it's one of the most anticipated upcoming films for me... by and large because of the build-up created here."

","As a Downey fan, I make it a point to see everything he's done. Although I am not there yet, no way was I missing Sherlock Holmes. I made the trek to the movie theater on Christmas Day, which I do not usually do, because I had to be one of the first to see it. And what a wonderful Christmas present it was.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is, of course, perfect in the title role. There was much controversy about him playing Sherlock and the changes that were made. Every new adaptation has some changes; nothing can remain the same. It is a way of keeping the story fresh. Downey made Holmes his own. He did it without the infamous hat and pipe (although a hat and pipe of some sort are used throughout) and still managed to look sexy while doing it. Like any good actor, he also did his homework. He studied up on Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle before shooting this film. And his hard work paid off. He captures Holmes perfectly, at least from the standpoint of someone not familiar with the stories. The English accent is spot-on; a few times I thought he was channeling his role in Chaplin. I felt myself grinning the moment Downey appeared on screen and it never faded. I knew I was going to love the film. And I did.<br/><br/>Jude Law is his faithful sidekick John Watson. Watson is engaged and plans to move out of the home that he and Holmes share. He keeps trying to break away from the adventure but is drawn in nonetheless. Law is completely convincing as Watson; there were times when I wanted to smack him for being so arrogant. And other times when I wanted him to smack Holmes. The chemistry between the two leads is intense; you can see the friendship and brotherhood these two men share. Some would argue that there are homosexual undertones. I did not see that, but you will have to judge for yourself.<br/><br/>As Lord Blackwood, Mark Strong is creepy and slimy and PERFECT. He is doing the work of the devil and is out to get Holmes. He defies everyone who thinks he's dead and continues his killing spree; at one point killing his own father. Strong's performance was so good that I would smile at what he was doing, even if it involved heinous activities. I had not heard of Mark Strong before but definitely plan to check his other work out; he has made a fan out of me. That's saying something.<br/><br/>The only one that I wasn't that impressed with was Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler. It wasn't that she was horrible; she just didn't have enough to do in the film to really show her talent. Adler is the only person to outsmart Holmes and he never forgot her. I was given the impression that they were romantically involved in the past. McAdams is gorgeous and sexy but that was all that she had. I hope that if she is in the sequel she will be given more to do. It was a so-so performance.<br/><br/>The setting and costumes are accurate for the time and completely believable. The music rocks and the computer graphics give us the feel of nineteenth-century London. The rest of the cast is convincing in their parts (especially Watson's dog) and I hope to see everyone in the sequel, even Strong if they can make his character come back from the dead.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes has been brought into the twenty-first century. I hope that this new adaptation will spark an interest in those who have never paid attention before and they will want to read all Arthur Conan Doyle's work. If a film can do that, then it is successful. And that's just what happened with me."

Guy Ritchie did this beyond all expectations. Downey and Law were superb the movie had great atmosphere and the plot was over the top....

What's more, Holmes must contend with the return of his ex-girlfriend (Rachel McAdams), a master thief in the service of a shadowy mastermind.<br/><br/>Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking revision of the scholarly sleuth which uses kinetic camera work and cocky actors to coax out the characters lesser-known qualities.

"AudioFileZ","8","1","2","20 March 2010"," Old Classic Revamped Reverently
","Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a throwback to the old Saturday afternoon mystery serial..Except it ain't no serial, it's a blockbuster. Yes, it's delightfully fully blown and over-the-top in scope and execution ‚Äì and it works delightfully for the adventure as well as the Sherlock Holmes fan alike.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a most dark and sinister villain, Lord Blackwood, who is out to conquer the British Parliament and, yes, the world. When Blackwood mysteriously rises from his own execution, well, it provides just the perfect storm of fear from which Sherlock Holmes surely cannot resist. Oh, but one should never underestimate what Holmes will deduce given his uncanny scientific mind. This is the setup and what follows, though quite Hollywood in both effects and glamor, still manages to serve a classic because the story is worthy of the characters of both Holmes and Watson. Mr. Ritchie's dark and gritty style of film-making surprisingly works quite nicely.<br/><br/>Perhaps no surprise is Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Sherlock Holmes. Downey's portrayal propels the disheveled detective to new heights and remains true to Arthur Conan Doyle's literary icon. I get the feeling this will likely stand with the classic Basil Rathbone celluloid version for old viewers while bringing ""the franchise"" up to date, if you will, to legions of new fans. Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, is also close to perfection as he is evil without being cartoon-ish (nice restraint on Strong's part). If that isn't enough Jude Law mostly does the same for Dr. Watson and the somewhat greater role Mr. Ritchie envisioned for Watson seems to be on the mark as Downey and Law pair well, elevating the charisma of both through their natural chemistry. The backdrop of Old London is created and photographed so seamlessly it's hard to tell what's real or digital ‚Äì the setting is so realistic it simply couldn't be better.<br/><br/>So here we have a very good update that gives a nod to the classic nature of the material, the beloved Saturday afternoon movie serial, and brings the action level up-to-date while keeping the effects from stealing anything away. If you think this sounds a bit too implausible you should simply see it, in fact¬ÖSee it if you don't. Recommended."

","...if only to see for yourself whether the objections were justified.<br/><br/>I've read quite a few of the SH stories and a couple of the novels, and have stayed at the Sherlock Holmes Hotel in London on Baker Street, which is peppered with memorabilia from perhaps a century ago. Another seeding of my impressions of what SH should look and act like are of course the Granada television series starring the late Jeremy Brett. Everyone does different things with the characters and adapting the stories, and Ritchie's interpretation-- along with some decent acting-- are quite valid and within plausibility of the legendary yet fictional character's representation.<br/><br/>In fact, aside from being initially dismayed at (untrue) reports of anachronistic or non-canonical fighting scenes, the only things which made me wonder why the movie dared to include something which I didn't see fit, was that I hadn't read the SH story which might have explained or justified the inclusion!<br/><br/>The film was enjoyable and had a mystery to be solved, a few false leads to make it unpredictable, excellent cinematography and direction, crackling dialogue, a great transformation in portrayal as seen by Eddie Marsan and even Jude Law's mustache, seemingly authentic costuming, and a better use of Watson than as a dopey version of Ed McMahon (as we're used to seeing) or as a device to convey exposition to the audience-- which was done in another way.<br/><br/>Very well-crafted action movie with a cerebral, literary, and historical edge. Not offensive to SH fans, unless there's a bad pedantic apple in the bunch: I'm glad my friends' word-of-mouth trumped the trollerific nay-saying of the Great Unwashed & convinced me to see it.

"dromasca","7","1","2","12 March 2010"," Sherlock Holmes as a comics hero
","It was said that Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes would make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes turn in their graves. I believe this statement to be true to the extent that the latest had a grave.<br/><br/>Yes, this version of Sherlock Holmes - which I hear will be soon followed by a sequel - is much more 21st century entertainment. It resembles much more some of the latest and more successful entries in the genre like V for Vendetta or The Dark Knight than 19th century detective stories. It is dark and violent and has political connotations that speak only to these who lived through the 20th century history. It's the kind of entertainment which you watch first to relax (if you like the genre) but yet you do not end viewing it with the feeling that you watched a completely brainless piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Much of the quality of Guy Ritchie's version lies in the tormented version of the principal character that is being created by Robert Downing Jr. The rational detective from Baker Street is a man of all sins who is capable not only of reasoning but also of fighting and surviving in a brutal world, as well of feeling deeply for a cared one who betrays him not only once. Then we have a vision of London as a 19th century Cour des Miracles which is rendered in a strikingly poignant manner as a stage of all possibilities becoming true provided they they rely on 19th century most advanced science. I liked this vision and for once the perspective of the sequel does not make me uncomfortable."

The film is then summed up with a classic Sherlock Holmes, or any other murder story/screenplay, with him ""spilling the beans"" on how he figured out the crime. <br/><br/>I went into the film having doubts over it because although the concept was interesting, the fact that Guy Ritchie was directing it made me worry about the films style and success. But it seems that Sherlock Holmes is actually the least ""Guy Ritchie"" movie that Guy Ritchie has made, this may be down to the script not having been written by him. But either way, I left this film pleased and excited for a sequel. So thumbs up to Guy Ritchie, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law for this excellent version of Sherlock Holmes."

","Downey is always going to be good, you can't fault the guy.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the amount of violence that is in this but when you refer to the book, Ol' Holmes had his fingers in just as many eyes as he clues. <br/><br/>Faultless period setting... I have never really gotten into Jude Law as an actor, his father was my headmaster at school and was a very dapper and nice man... <br/><br/>The supernatural suggestions throw this into a good direction and you can tell if the numbers are good that there will be a sequel in the offing... aside from that you can guess the villainy and clich√©s that abound in such a production, but its all fun isn't it!? <br/><br/>A good take on an old classic."

","After watching the trailers and reading some comments, I was actually expecting a mindless action movie that has nothing to do with Holmes. But it turned out to be quite wrong. The movie is very nice and it is actually reflecting Holmes as much as possible. It is not a Doyle story but there is nothing contradicts with the Holmes portrait by Doyle. There is some action but it is nothing exaggerated and the dialogs are satisfactorily crafted in an intelligent and logical way. The sense of rationalism what is the main part of the character Holmes is always there. The only part I found strange was the involvement of Irene Adler. In the original series, she had a different role in the whole story. Also, Holmes is supposed have an accent but it was simply not there. Nevertheless, much better than I expected."

I mean, explosions? The occult? Robert Downey Jr.? GUY RITCHIE?!?<br/><br/>However, casting all of my prejudices aside I went to go and see it.<br/><br/>And, it was fantastic! Visually spectacular and very respectful to the characters of both Holmes and Watson. Also quite in-keeping with the original stories.

","I have always been fascinated with Sherlock Holmes and I was not disappointed with Guy Ritche's effort. Ritchie has had my attention since ""Snatched"". If you have not seen it, watch it without kids. It is as violent as they get. His version of Sherlock reflects his style of a movie but he worked hard to get it right. The movie has potential to be one of the few that are worth see several times. It is clear Law and Downing enjoy working together.The action is fast and the effects are believable. Downing is totally immersed as Holmes. Of course some think they are one and the same. Downing is the only one who pull off role. This is not a kid's movie. The movie makes you think and wonder about all the possibilities it brings. It has been awhile since a movie has made me feel this way. If you like mind twister go see it.

","This is Kiniest, Reporting from Land of Authors.<br/><br/>Review 1 : Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Introduction : Sherlock Holmes, a name I heard many years ago. Not ever again since. Not until Sherlock Holmes (2009) came out. I have been reading the whole collection. I honestly thought it would be bad because it wasn't an actual story from the collection. Did that honestly change much? Not really. Because this movie was made, I looked into the paper and saw 2 stars. I was unhappy, but I had decided to take a look at it anyways. Well, if I had to say, it turned out to be great, and to all haters out there, think whatever you think, but this movie was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Memoirs : As the book has no story of Blackwood or whatnot, there is still plenty or great things to mention. Yes, Sherlock Holmes is a cocaine addict. But his hygiene wasn't all that bad. But yes, he killed the dog. Twice. The one part that shocked the world was Sherlock Holmes's death. People started forcing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to bring him back to life, so, he did.. Whether or not there was some one who was engaged with Watson does not matter. You will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Acting : The acting in this movie was fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. Did a superb job of playing Holmes. Everyone seemed right in character. Even though the *cough* deleted... scene with Irene was completely out of character, taking off one point for Acting... The accent is complained of by many fans, and although it is not the actors fault, it still takes off one point. Everyone else seemed in place. [8/10]<br/><br/>Producing : The producing in this movie was pretty good. But it had some minor problems. It had a horrible start-up script, taking off one point. But it came back in quite fine, adding one point back. The producers found out about their script and fixed it to perfection, which started it better, the only problem is they took off a scene the public really enjoyed. (Sherlock's giving the ring to Watson) Negating one point. Everything else was just fine. [9/10]<br/><br/>Plot - Shine or Darken? : This is the time for the writers to shine.... or darken. So, now that we got through the above, does the story stay true to other Sherlock Holmes stories? The answer is yes. The plot is my favorite part! I just love to watch it, and I find this to be magnificent! How everything goes is wonderful. [10/10] (Shine!)<br/><br/>Elements Theme - Comedy : I found myself chuckling at some parts, but at some jokes in the movie, no one made a sound, negating one point. However on others, people laughed until they couldn't breath, someone went to the infirmary! OK, maybe not. but still, excellent jokes, and downer jokes, but overall, it keeps itself true. Please stop killing that dog, Holmes. What the heck... [10/10]<br/><br/>Overall : I honestly do not know what else there is to say, just bravo. I loved this movie, and if you see it, I hope you love it too. Everyone should watch this, as it is definitely worth your money, and not a waste of money, trust me.<br/><br/>Acting - 8/10 Production - 9/10 Plot - 10/10 Elements - 10/10 Overall - 9.5/10"
"PlutoandVenus","9","1","2","2 February 2010"," Loved Downey Hated McAdams
","I could watch Robert Downey Jr. all day. Those chocolate brown eyes (70% cacao) grab me and hypnotize. Even his wrinkles and crags are interesting. And while I know the magic of the silver screen smooths out the many imperfections of age, whatever it is ‚Äì his looks, disease, insanity, talent ‚Äì whatever it is, I love to watch it. Downey as Sherlock Holmes, another drug addicted, crazed, brilliant and erratic creature, is a perfect fit. I didn't even think about Basil Rathbone, whose Sherlock Holmes was equally, though differently, inspired. Rathbone's Holmes emphasized the analytical, precise, cerebral and obsessive genius while Downey went with an intense, physical, neurotic, humorous and homo-erotic Sherlock Holmes. Both were brilliant.<br/><br/>As John Watson (His first name is John?) Jude Law comes off reasonably well as the adoring and put-upon sidekick, though he doesn't dazzle as Downey does. His good looks are tamped down and he only occasionally entices with a twinkle from his razor sharp blue eyes. The love story between them, whether platonic or consummated, is an engaging development, absent from earlier portrayals of a dowdy Watson and almost asexual Holmes. This Holmes' interest in Watson is even more understandable when compared to his other option, Irene Adler as played by Rachel McAdams. What Hollywood forgot, or didn't care to acknowledge, is that Holmes loves Adler because she is as bright, deviant and intriguing as he is himself. McAdams' Adler does not reach this level. That McAdams/Adler is beautiful ‚Äì and I don't recall if Adler is in the books ‚Äì is secondary. Adler is the mysterious lost love of Holmes' tortured past. Here, McAdams looks like a precocious teenager, in make up and grown up clothes without a line on her face. Every time she opens her mouth, it is a tiny, flat, little girl's voice. ‚Äì no richness, no depth, no deceit ‚Äì no interest. It seems the only thing Hollywood directors want from their women performers is a tight butt ‚Äì and this, of course, McAdams does have. Difficult to miss in her painted on pinstripe trousers. Maybe that's all Holmes wanted after all, a nice piece of¬Ömmmm. No. Hollywood prefers to infantilize its women and usually, since their roles are little more than sex props for the men, no one cares. Every male actor over 40 must have a contract clause requiring a sex scene with a virginal actress. Downey passes in this film, which was odd until I noticed Susan Downey is a producer. Mystery solved. Anyway, McAdams comes across as an ing√©nue not a woman of cunning and experience. A love interest between Holmes and Adler on screen required something more than McAdams had to give.<br/><br/>Kelly Reilly does better as Watson's love Mary Morstan. She has some fire in her. As the sidekick's lover, she's allowed to be less attractive than Adler and therefore can show a little personality. Her shame, then disgust at Holmes's revelations about her past is compelling, unfolding in her few moments of screen time. The movie is better for it.<br/><br/>The villain Lord Blackwood is a one dimensional foil for the heroes. However, Mark Strong is elegant and sinister here ‚Äì a vampire bent on destruction ‚Äì so he provides what's needed. I spent the whole movie thinking the villain was played by Stanley Tucci, who is a great actor so the comparison is a complement. Then I found out it was Strong, who, I've never heard of. Now that I know who he is, I'll look for Strong next time in a¬Östronger role.<br/><br/>Neither Downey nor McAdams do well with an English accent, while Law's and the supporting casts' are naturally excellent. Downey's accent is passable to American ears but would never fool a Brit. At least he isn't jarringly American. Downey consistently drops his R's and breathes into his A's in a passing attempt to keep up the pretense. McAdams is noticeably worse as her speech breaks the mood of old England - her R's are as flat and hard as those of a New Jersey waitress.<br/><br/>The Special Effects are, as Mr. Rogers would say, special. Everything exploding, catching on fire, dropping into the river, the cameras twirling around; they are fantastic. Still, the scene that stays with me is Downey moving his face in and out of several pillars, stalking, hiding, teasing his nemesis as his eyes suck us in with a tidal pull."
"Greywolf907","9","1","2","17 January 2010"," Finally, Rathbone laid to rest.....
","It is rare...in fact possibly never that I have given a film such a high rating,but SH is most deserving of it and in the 3rd week of the new year I am doubting that there will be such a thrill of a movie yet to come along. Simply, the charisma of the two lead actors here, the way they squabble in their symbiotic relationship is cinematic gold. Guy Ritchie has done a grand job of elevating his career back on track, with his ex missus now out of the picture he can once again get back to something of his best.<br/><br/>Both Downey Jr and Law are on top form and are a delight to watch, the humour of the film is never far under the surface and there are plenty of light moments to keep even the most discerning of curmudgeons happy.<br/><br/>It's boy's own stuff, almost tongue in cheek yet never straying into parody, with plenty of action and Heath Robinsonisms to keep boys of a certain age purring with delight!<br/><br/>Wonderful film."
"larregaraygael","8","1","2","9 January 2010"," A great trip to old London with Downey Jr's glorious humor
","Entering old London directly as the movie started put me straight into that Agatha Christie's Poirot mood I adore. Unbelievable as it is, the set is really great and the digital parts are barely noticeable. I had only one wish then: to be able to return to a Baker street looking exactly like the one in the movie. Throughout the entire film, you get to travel through that wonderful London most people crave, that time when Tower Bridge was being built. Aside from the set, I have to admit I was quite curious about the Law-Downey JR couple. As it turns out, I haven't seen such a wonderful pair of actors in a long time. Law's(Watson) seriousness and attachment to Holmes(Downey Jr)is wonderful. He remains the actor we all appreciate, and he doesn't cross the lines a couple of actors have and failed at. He still surprises us with his really ""British-like"" behavior when it comes to answering to Holmes' jokes. The Holmes they deliver to us is more than I was waiting for. Downey Jr fit the role like no one else would have. There was this pinch of ""Depp in a Burton movie"" emanating from him, and still he clearly is building himself a good reputation. The way he handles the script and the humor is just so refreshing.<br/><br/>The movie in itself is good. The story line is well divided, the action is great, fun, and nicely old-styled, and of course there's a love story. Above that, what wiped away the two main love stories is the friendship between the two men. It sounded as though they were in love even though it's clear that it was just friendship. It's good to finally see such a thing. <br/><br/>Overall, as I mentioned, the movie was good, but it just comes in line behind other great ""old-fashioned"" action & mystery movies such as Vidocq. I still advise people to go watch it because it's not a waste of time."
"Jackpollins","8","1","2","7 January 2010"," Great performances from Downey, Jr and Law
","Sherlock Holmes is a new twist on an old classic, and before I further write my review, I want to make something clear. The thing I want to get clear is that this is not supposed to be anything like the old Basil Rathbone version, but a modern day version of Sherlock Holmes. If you do not like the idea of a modern day version of Sherlock Holmes, then don't see this movie. That said, if you do have even the slightest doubt that this could be good, go see it. The film is cool looking and entertaining. Since the movie is so good, I will mention the only flaw. The flaw is that Guy Ritchie, such a good director when he did Snatch, Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels, Revolver, and RocknRolla made the movie a little too frantic and in your face at times. The movie is so entertaining and involving that at most times, that doesn't matter. There are only a few times that got me uninvolved for that reason. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law both give great performances here, mixing humor and toughness nicely. Rachel McAdams plays Holmes' long-time friend Irene Adler. McAdams is good, as is Mark Strong as the bad guy Lord Blackwood. The film has a great look, and all in all the performances are strong. The film is at times confusing, which is not a bad thing per say, but it all wraps up in the end. The film is ultimately entertaining and definitely worth seeing."
"joliefille411","8","1","2","6 January 2010"," Surprisingly Good
","I happened upon this movie by chance, as I had been intent on seeing Avatar until I realized the length was practically 3 hours, which will no longer cut it in theaters unless I am SURE it's going to be spectacular. I came in with almost no expectations, having vaguely seen the trailer somewhere and really only knowing Jude Law was in the cast.<br/><br/>Which was completely amazing by the way. I will single out Law as the best performance (I do admit to a bias on that part), his take on Watson was a wonderful new (and can't help it- sexy) spin on the character. Robert Downey Jr. took a while to warm up to- I was beginning to worry in the first half if we hadn't made a mistake because his character was hardly investable in the beginning. And truthfully it was his relationship with Watson that saved him- wonderfully acted and set up.<br/><br/>The story was unlike the slim slice of Sherlock fare I've seen- gone was the stuffy old-man-ness and the deerstalker hat. There was a lot more kick-butt than the originals, which doesn't bother me, but the film definitely pumped up the (at times slap-happy) action aspects. Which doesn't say that the mystery suffered. Actually, I found the deductive skills of our favorite detective nicely highlighted- his most dangerous weapon was obviously his head. I was worried for a time that we were going to spin off into supernatural realms, but was pleased to find everything resolved (minus the obvious sequel setup) in the traditional Holmes manner.<br/><br/>The style of the film was also very intriguing. It was beautifully done, though at times a little too obviously digital. The way the camera got into Holmes' head was cool- reminded me of spook films, but tripped me up from time to time. The pounding, almost Indian inspired soundtrack was unlike most anything I'd heard for that kind of film- really fun and different.<br/><br/>This was really a surprise hit for me. What actually struck me the most was how clean it was. Very little language, the innuendo was mild, not a sex scene to be had. Without the gratuitous violence, this could have easily passed for PG. Which is a shame, as it was a thoroughly engaging film- I did get the feeling they padded a lot of the fighting so it would get more attention as ""adult PG13"" over ""kiddie PG."" Even though the effects were as entertaining as they were gruesome, it still bothers me that people feel that they cannot relate on a mature level to something that is ""clean"". Call it a pet peeve. <br/><br/>All in all- really gripping for a first viewing. But I was also aware that I was missing many details that would make further viewings enjoyable. And if there is to be a sequel, (as it seems obvious there must be) I would most certainly be in line."
"moviemanMA","8","1","2","4 January 2010"," Ritchie continues to impress
","Guy Ritchie has made three fine action/comedy films since 1998, starting with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and RocknRolla (I still need to see his 2005 film Revolver). He has a distinct style of film-making using slow motion, flashbacks, pauses, heavy British, Scottish, and Irish accents, and like many fine filmmakers of the day, a very strong musical soundtrack. With the exception of Swept Away, he tends to focus on the British underworld of gangsters, hit men, and junkies. He is quite good at telling these stories and one would naturally think that his next venture would be along those same lines.<br/><br/>Then came Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>I wasn't completely on board with this one. After seeing the film, I can confidently say that I am on board for this one.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. plays the famous British private detective. Along with him is his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law who steals the movie for me. He was by far the biggest surprise. I wasn't all over the idea of changing the somewhat reserved character of Dr. Watson into a rough and tough soldier turned doctor. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>We find Holmes and Watson fowling up the plans of Lord Blackwood, a powerful man who dabbles in the dark arts. Following his execution, Dr. Watson decides it is time to leave his partner and settle down with his wife to be. Sherlock has his qualms about the separation from his faithful assistant, but those are brushed aside when reports of Lord Blackwood rising from the grave start circulating. With Holmes back on the case, he does everything he can to get Watson back on the job with him.<br/><br/>Like I said, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think Ritchie's modern style would translate well to this story. What makes it work is his use of modern camera techniques and special effects to help bring to life the legend of Sherlock Holmes. The fight scenes are backed up by some period inspired music and the costume design, art direction, and set design all contribute in creating the right atmosphere for the story.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, Law played a very different yet favorable Watson. Downey Jr. was not perfect for the role but his accent was first rate and I especially liked his voice overs when he would play out a situation in his head before it would happen (although some of the credit goes to Ritchie and the editing department). The rest of the cast was fine, though I wasn't completely sold on McAdams in her role.<br/><br/>There isn't anything groundbreaking about this one, just a fun movie with a cool story. It's blatantly obvious that Ritchie intends to make a sequel regardless of the box office revenue (which should be enough to call for a sequel), though he set up RocknRolla for a sequel and I'm not sure if that is going to happen any time soon. I hope it does, but I think he needs another Sherlock Holmes movie to go through and then take some time to work on a good story for a RocknRolla sequel."

","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) successfully complete another case when they are able to capture Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is responsible for a series of ritualistic killings. Blackwood is sentenced to death and buried but when it is discovered that Backwood has been resurrected from the dead, Holmes and Watson are compelled to reopen the case.<br/><br/>The story contained in Sherlock Holmes is interesting albeit untamed. Plot development occurs at an almost rapid pace thus making the narrative seem more complicated than it perhaps is. It does not help matters that by the end of the film, almost every single scene seems to play some part in Holme's investigation: it feels forced at times and interactions feel scripted rather than natural. And for a film based on a highly intellectual detective, the logic of some scenes walks on thin ice. Nevertheless, Sherlock Holmes does contain some characteristics that were prevalent to the character in the original novels, such as the ability to fight. What is presented is a Sherlock Holmes who is just as capable physically as he is mentally. At first this may appear to overshadow Dr. Watson considerably, but thankfully Watson is shown to be Holme's equal allowing for a fair exchange in solving their case.<br/><br/>One of the interesting dynamics of the narrative comes from a couple of short segments where the audience is introduced, though loosely, to how Holmes contemplates overcoming an obstacle. This comes about a couple of times but only before he proceeds to completely defeat an opponent in hand-to-hand combat. However, this sort of scene never occurs when you would most want it to: when Holmes is using his intellectual prowess to discover clues for his investigation. Instead, Holmes is left keeping his intelligence a secret, which seems rather absurd at times considering how rapidly he is able to deduce information. It only becomes slightly more annoying when it is taken into consideration that there is very little in aid for the audience in terms of trying to piece together the criminals plan. Sherlock Holmes is less a crime mystery and more an action adventure but regardless of one's preference the film is a fun watch for the most part.<br/><br/>Acting is a far steadier factor for the film with Downey and Law putting a lot of energy into their roles. This pays off with both having evident charisma about them and their screen time together is easily among the best in the film. McAdams is not quite as consistent with the rare poorly delivered line yet any fault she may have is never detrimental. Strong provides a formidable villain in theory, but for all his character's intellect he is far too weak a character to ever feel like possibly ousting Holmes. This mainly comes down to a script which does not allow more scope for the character of Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>19th Century London is portrayed rather extravagantly with some great shots of the architecture and the attached gloomy atmosphere of a society still caught up in the industrial revolution period. Action sequences do not share the same flair and while they are workable they could have been better. Additional, music adds to the Sherlock Holmes experience but it never really enhances it and so feels more of an afterthought in the entire filming process.<br/><br/>The film contains no sex or direct nudity and language is just as mild serving only a couple of profanities. On the other hand, violence does make up a part of the film though it is never gory and hardly bloody as punches are thrown along with gunfire, hangings and explosions.<br/><br/>There is no denying that this new Sherlock Holmes adaptation is all about making the titular character appear more modern and exciting to the audience. The film is enjoyable with solid acting and a commendable story, yet the script has not appeared to have been scrutinized enough with its rapid nature and odd illogical mishap. You'd almost wish that Holme's himself had been asked to look over the script for the one second it would require of him: the film's story would be tighter and better for it."
"Rob-120","8","1","2","28 December 2009"," The Best...um...""James Bond"" Film I've Seen in a Long Time
","I enjoyed ""Sherlock Holmes,"" as much for its preposterous-ness as its visual style. I'm pleased that Guy Ritchie was able to make a halfway-decent movie.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Granada TV series, I know that no one will ever equal Jeremy Brett's performance as the greatest detective. But I wasn't expecting Robert Downey, Jr. to equal it, any more than I was expecting this movie to be the best ""Sherlock"" movie ever.<br/><br/>Downey is ""Sherlock Holmes"" in name only. He bears a few resemblances to Conan Doyle's eccentric detective (with emphasis on the ""eccentric""). Like a hyperactive child, he prances around the streets of London, drunk on his own genius.<br/><br/>In truth, Downey's Holmes is more like a self-employed Victorian James Bond (the Roger Moore version). Like Bond, Downey's Holmes bungles his way through his adventures, fights the bad guys with martial arts, uncovers the secret plots, jumps out of windows, and escapes death traps usually by tripping over them and setting them off. His genius intellect and acute powers of observation sometimes get in the way of his solving the case.<br/><br/>And like Bond, he usually picks the ""femme fatale"" to romance (in this case, the jewel thief Irene Adler, played by Rachel Mc Adams). As with Bond, the ""femme fatale"" romance often gets Downey's Holmes into compromising positions and embarrassing situations. And of course, as with Bond, the ""femme fatale"" comes over to Holmes's side before the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This time around, however, it's the bad guys who have the Q devices. Holmes's nemesis is Lord Blackwell (Mark Strong), head of a SPECTRE-like society that plans to conquer the world using black magic (or something like it). And they have fiendish doomsday devices at their disposal to do so, devices that Holmes must dismantle and occasionally explain to the audience.<br/><br/>Another nemesis (I won't reveal who) seems to be lurking in the shadows, observing Holmes from a distance. We see only his hat and his long black coat, with his gloved hands resting on the head of a cane...We never see his face. All that's missing is a white Persian cat sitting on his lap.<br/><br/>(On a personal note, I should have known who this character would turn out to be. But based on the fact that you couldn't see his face, I almost thought it was Jack Griffin, the Invisible Man.) There are a few Bond-ian scenes, such as the confrontation of the villain in his secret hideout, where the villain reveals his dastardly plan to Holmes, rather than shooting him. And there is a scene late in the movie where Holmes and Watson must penetrate an impenetrable fortress to foil the villain's scheme.<br/><br/>And of course, there are the usual shaky-cam shots, hyper-cut editing, and fantastic CGI backgrounds and visual effects that are what passes for style in a modern action movie. How much do you want to bet that the climactic fight between Holmes and Blackwell will take place on top of a well-known London monument high in the air? James Bond would have approved.<br/><br/>Mention should be given to Jude Law as Dr. Watson, the man who most often gets Holmes out of trouble, and who is used to his eccentricities. They gave Watson a fianc√©, of course, so that the Holmes/Watson relationship would not seem too ""gay."" But they had the sense to make Watson an intelligent man who can follow Holmes's observations and reasonings, and come to the same conclusions -- just not as fast as Holmes. The curse of the slow-witted Nigel Bruce Watson has been buried forever.<br/><br/>So that's it. Holmes as Bond. Ridiculous, but enjoyable. I guess we shouldn't be surprised. I'm looking forward to the next film in the franchise. Again, I'm glad Guy Ritchie had at least one good film in him. I hope he can make another."

Role should have been given to Ewan Mcgregor.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams even though beautiful, should be stuck to chick flicks or romantic comedies. Role should be given to Cate Blanchett as she can play Hepburn in the Aviator, an Elf in Lords of the Ring, a Russian General in Indiana Jones. She can play the role of anyone including a thief who is capable of loving and would even add spice to the role. Or Penelope Cruz, even though she cant be compared to Cate.<br/><br/>Watch it if you just want to see Robert."
"sam-fold","6","2","7","2 January 2010"," For better or worse exactly what you would expect from a big budget adaptation..
","It was a mistake to have such high hopes for this movie. Given that it was a big-budget Hollywood production, released at Holiday time and directed by Guy Ritchie I should have been able to deduce the outcome.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories as written by Doyle and so when I originally heard about this adaptation and its cast I was quite excited. I have high regard for Law and Downey and with so much material to draw from I figured both could do justice to their characters. In addition, I was hopeful that the screenplay would also draw from the wealth of excellent stories and history in the original novels.<br/><br/>The magic of the original stories is in these vital two pieces, plot and character. The film gets one of these right, character, but misses the plot completely. <br/><br/>I wouldn't have minded such a heavily action oriented movie if the plot had been immersive and realistic. Sherlock Holmes and his adventures were always realistically grounded, Holmes himself wasn't a superhero and his adventures were never as fantastical and unbelievable as the one portrayed in this movie. The events of the film were so over the top and ""out there"" that it ruined the sense of immersion and I found it hard to lose myself in the events of the film. <br/><br/>The draw of the original novels was never because of their action and fisticuffs. In fact, there wasn't a lot of fighting at all in the stories. Holmes's background in boxing was mentioned a few times but it never said he was the godlike fighter as portrayed here. In addition, if there was fighting in the books it was usually reduced to the final scene when the criminal was finally brought to justice. The meat of the stories was in the steps taken by Holmes and Watson to take each piece of evidence and edge closer and closer to realization and the solving of the crime. What made the solving of the crimes so enthralling in the books, was that the solution always seemed so near and yet so far. As a reader I always felt like the solution was on the tip of my tongue, yet when the solution was revealed I always was amazed that it was so simple yet a twist I could never have thought up.<br/><br/>The problem with the plot of the movie was that the crimes/problems that Holmes had to solve were so fantastical and irrational that there was no fun in trying to understand what was actually going on. The pace of the movie was so fast, the scene order so jumbled and the plot so bizarre, that I didn't feel any enjoyment in trying to understand the logic and mystery of the crimes. Indeed, when the solutions were revealed at the climax, most of the explanations relied on complex hitherto unknown chemicals or strange foreign concoctions. What a cop out! Oh, a man came back from the dead - answer? Ancient Chinese blah blah. Man spontaneously combusts? - answer? Random bizarre chemical known only by frenzied cultists. <br/><br/>The joy of the stories was the sheer intelligence of the plot and the final solution. One could tell by reading the books that Conan Doyle was incredibly bright and had an amazing mind. When contrasting that with the plot of the movie. Well, anyone can write a crime plot if the final answers just involve pulling out pseudo science chemicals that are capable of anything. The ending reminded of how any problems in Star Trek could be solved with some Pseudo Science Technobabble. I was hoping for a simpler story, less Dan Brown and more Miss Marple or Poirot, a murderer or kidnapping, with some clever twists and ingenious deductions which lead to the perpetrators capture or identification.<br/><br/>As for the love interest, she was purely put there to please the audience. Oh please. Sherlock Holmes was never the type to pine after a woman. He found Irene Adler fascinating, more because she outwitted than because he loved her or similar. The only person that Holmes ever really shows affection to is Watson. In fact, in the original stories it's more likely that Holmes was gay, although it's never explicitly stated.<br/><br/>The final point that annoyed me was the forced ending setting up a sequel. It was so clear that the studio influenced the ending of this film in order to setup the audience for Sherlock Holmes 2 that it completely ruined what could have been a decent ending to the movie. We all know that every successful modern movie gets a sequel, do we really need that fact rammed down our throats?<br/><br/>Lastly, the score was definitely uninspired, could definitely have been a lot better.<br/><br/>The good points were the action sequences and special effects which were well done, as can be expected by all big budget modern films.<br/><br/>Next time, pick a better director. I'd like to see what Bryan Singer or Guillermo del Toro could do with this material."
"nanianumolu","10","2","7","28 December 2009"," I was knocked out in 2 hours
","Sherlock Holmes knocked me out in 2 hours. He knocked me out so hard, I am writing my first ever review. I tried to watch the movie on Saturday after Christmas, but all the shows were either full or had front section seats. I did not want to watch this movie feeling some pain in my neck. I went home, booked the ticket online for the next day and left the theatre with a feeling of solving a mystery myself. YES!! I totally fell for the movie and throughout the movie I was sitting like I was the mystery solver. I would say this is tied with 2 other movies, The Inglorious Basterds and Avatar as my 3 best movies of the year.<br/><br/>I have seen RocknRolla and Snatch from Guy Ritchie and I like his stylish way of film making. I like the witty and dark humor and I would say I am pretty much impressed with Sherlock Holmes. Downey Jr. and Jude law were all over the movie. Critics may not give the best rating for this movie and either the IMDb rating does not reflect the caliber of this movie. This movie might not also fall into the Oscar section. But, but, but, for few of those out there, this movie stands out as one of the sexiest movies ever made for the background color it has, for the stylish look it has, and lot more. Most importantly, I never felt a single second boring, from the start of the movie. If you are not good with the English accent, you may feel some words are missing, but they are not too many. HIT THE ROAD, REACH THE THEATRE, WATCH THE MOVIE, and SHERLOCK HOLMES WILL KNOCK YOU OUT AND YOU WILL NEED A LOTTA TIME TO RECOVER."
"jdkraus","8","2","7","26 December 2009"," Amusing and thoroughly entertaining
","I've never read the original series of ""Sherlock Holmes"", so I did not know what to expect walking into the theater. To make things more complicating, I've read reviews that said it was far different than the novels. <br/><br/>As an avid moviegoer, I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. There's no boring dialog or voice-over narration that trumps the opening, rather it puts the viewer right into the action, like a James Bond film, and then progresses to a big climax. There is a lot of action in this film, but there's also a lot of mystery in it, like a detective show. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr., who I've come to appreciate as a decent actor, immerses himself into his character so well that he becomes Holmes. Not the one from the books as fans of the novels would say, but rather his own take on the character. He's sophisticated, smart, and charming, but also one hell of a brawler and a risk taker. Downey Jr. though doesn't make the show alone. Jude Law as his sidekick Watson is also wonderful. He's like Holmes in many aspects, but he's the more organized, and well-groomed hero who doesn't take as many risks. Downey Jr. and Law make a great pair, or as I like to call the new Batman and Robin. The other actors fitted their roles well, but I felt Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood was a weak villain; there was no depth to his character and his motives for why he wants to ""rule the world."" He does have an appearance of a good villain, but he doesn't really deliver as a great one. <br/><br/>But what makes up in this loss is the witty plot, which keeps you guessing throughout the film, and at the end throws a sudden, unexpected twist, leaving a cliffhanger for a sequel. The viewer is behind Holmes who pieces everything together, like Patrick Jane in ""The Mentalist"". <br/><br/>Adding to the plot is some of the most beautiful sets and costumes, I haven't seen in a long time. In watching the big screen, I felt like I was in London during the late 1800s. Adding to the authenticity of the sets and costumes is the sweat, dirt, and filth that was packed onto the streets and inside the buildings, which gives a taste of poverty that seems long since forgotten in London. The dim lighting, and deep shadows, (as well as excellent camera shots/compositions), gives the film a very dark and mysterious feel to it, like an eerie mystery should. I'll note that Hans Zimmer score however contradicts this tone with an uplifting tune that sounds very much like ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""<br/><br/>Overall though, Sherlock Holmes is a witty, fun, dark, mysterious, action-packed, funny, and surprisingly good movie. For you fans of the novel series, put the books aside and enjoy this film!"

","It is refreshing to watch a detective who is a non-believer of supernatural and rituals. How he solve each clue draws similarities to Batman - logical, witty and observant. From the man who acted as Iron Man, Robert Downey is in a ride for many good years ahead - with Sherlock Holmes sequel planned and Iron Man 2 and possibly 3.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Watson and Sherlock is great brotherhood bond. Great performance by Jude Law. I had negative opinion about his acting abilities in the past.

","All it took for Guy Ritchie to have another hit film was to divorce Madonna!? The brilliance is in its simplicity! (End Snark) First, I'll admit I'm naturally biased against any Holmes incarnation produced after the death of the great Jeremy Brett but life goes on as does the legend so I tried keeping an open mind tonight...and it paid off! Downey Jr. was a wonderful bit of stunt casting as he shares a lot of history with the Holmes character; the brilliant career almost cut short by drug use and all. And the abs. How old is he now? 60? Also, I've never been a Jude Law fan but add a mustache and a limp and-TADAH!-you have the hottest Watson ever! I'm talking Victorian FEVER! Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler? Meh. She was a serviceable plot device but there was 0 chemistry between she and Downey Jr. I just had a hard time believing she was Holmes' great love and intellectual equal and well...meh! The bad guy was scary but not in a ""I'll take over the world and destroy you"" way. It was more scary like realizing you room mate is an overzealous D&D or WoW geek who's really into black capes and ComicCons. The action and dialogue were funny, quick and reminiscent of Ritchie's other films although some of the lines where hard to hear in places but that could have been due to the crying babies seated directly behind me. And just so you'll know, a certain character was introduced toward the end that lead me to believe that there will be a sequel...or three."
"brownah18","8","2","7","25 December 2009"," Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are on the case to solve crimes and punch people out when they feel needed so!
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and John Watson (Jude Law) have stopped Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) from killing another girl and Watson saw to it to his hanging for the use of black magic and the death of five girls. By his death and talking to Holmes beforehand he said, ""I will return and kill three more, death is only the beginning.""<br/><br/>An old acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachael McAdams) happens to come back to see Holmes, but she may be up to more bad than good now. Both Holmes and Watson are always having fists pummeling the next unlawful hoe as well as gathering evidence to solve the case. Holmes has a way of analyzing everything and finding a solution to solve it whatever it may be. The funny thing is that Holmes and Watson fight about everything like they are brothers, but we all know they are just partners throughout. Witty jokes by both keep the seriousness out of the film. Quick witted and a personality that makes him a bit quirky Robert Downey plays the part perfectly as Holmes in this thriller of a film. McAdams character distracts Holmes yet keeps him interested in a beautiful glow that never strays her. Laws character fits him well and there are times that make you laugh with joy showing the flawed yet strong friendship the duo of Holmes and Watson share.<br/><br/>The music and as well as the explosions, fight scenes, and funny lines gives the film intensity and intrigues you to want to see what happens next. A fun fact about Downey is that at the age of 10, while living in London, Robert attended the Perry House School in Chelsea and studied classical ballet. So, to come go back and experience taking part in a movie filmed in London for most of it. It was something he experienced from his childhood must have been a treat for Downey as well as the audience to see the great scenes of London in the film. As for Guy Ritchie, seeing his films he directed in the past being ""Snatch"", ""RocknRolla"", and ""Lock, Stock, and Smoke two Barrels"" this film is a big step for him since I think his other movies didn't intrigue me, but left me wondering what I just saw and if I wanted to see it again just to remember."
"brownsugarforyou","4","2","9","12 January 2010"," Extra's poor acting - Is it a kids movie? Or repackaged adult movie?
","This is a movie that included pan shots of the extra actor's in the background. Pity that the many, many extra's didn't seem to be given much training or guidance in how to act that time period. Very poor acting by extra's, and bored looking extra's ruined a host of shots for me. Also for the love of god why does every single background have peeling paint. Is peeling paint supposed to symbolize the grimness of Industrial England? The whole film was too saturated with dark colours for atmosphere it was like the sun never shone for Holmes. And the casting... boring insipid lazy casting, RDJ is simply not a good actor, he has all of three expressions. Trite casting job of an older male with younger female interests. Sherlock Holmes is English yet there were so many references to America, and too much American casting with faked accents. I cheered for Holmes to die, sadly my wish wasn't granted. All Jude Law did as Watson was stare daggers at RDJ because he wanted to be caste as Holmes and JL's sole expression was a frown. Also this movie seemed to oscillate between being an adult movie and being a children's movie. There were cheap scenes like Holmes blowing his nose loudly into the handkerchief offered by a policeman that would appeal to potty humour little kids. Rent it so you can fast forward the boring slow parts and fight scenes. Not recommended, I went into this expecting a movie with a sense of fun, instead it was underwhelming, and RDJ couldn't even smoke a pipe properly. I want my time back."

The villains are predicable and as scary as play dough; the heroes, equally unremarkable. A story you will forget only seconds after you hit the stop button. Sad waste of RDJr's talents."

"lesleyharris30","8","1","3","25 April 2014"," Downey Jr. is a surprisingly Stellar Holmes,
","Sherlock Holmes is a good movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. I was not initially sure about Robert Downey Jr. playing Sherlock Holmes, he seemed like a very unusual casting decision, particularly with Iron Man in mind. However, he did a stellar job, he brought a lot of comedic value and had great charisma to the part, although it did make me feel like it was more of a parody to the Sherlock Holmes series more so than a real film at times, he did certainly bring a new and interesting personality to the character.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie was an unusual decision to direct this movie. While he certainly has a unique style, there are certain occasions where he's trying a little too hard to show off the skills he has as a director, rather than letting the story tell itself and allowing his actors to truly shine. The tone was a little inconsistent as well, there were times when it was very light hearted and funny, while other parts were dark and gritty, without allowing much of a transition between the two. <br/><br/>I think Jude Law was fantastic as Dr. John Watson. While Downey Jr.'s casting may have been questioned by some, this certainly was not, his personality suited the role perfectly, and he also delivered his own original take on the character very well. <br/><br/>Funny and, at times, quite intense. Easy to view and well acted, Sherlock Holmes is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good adventure or crime film. <br/><br/>The legendary detective must solve the case of a serial killer who appears to have risen from the dead.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","1","3","23 May 2010"," Hugely enjoyable, I seriously wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did
","First of all, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see this movie initially. It looked entertaining enough, but I was wondering is it going to be an entertaining and stylish movie or another generic block buster? My answer is this, and you can probably tell by my summary, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is not the best movie I have ever seen and it has its faults, but the thing is I thought it was fun, witty and somewhat original too.<br/><br/>Those who didn't like it as much as I did will probably question whether I have any knowledge at all of Sherlock Holmes, whether it is the books or the countless interpretations of the character and his stories. The answer is yes, I really like Conan Doyle's stories, they are clever and insightful and Holmes himself is a very intriguing character with a distinct personality, and I am a fan of both Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. If I had a preference I would say the latter but only marginally, Rathbone was excellent, he was sophisticated and gritty but Brett had that towering presence and generosity about him that made me like him a little more.<br/><br/>Back to this film, I liked how it was filmed. I for one found it stylish, innovative and clever. The camera work is really good, even in the fight scenes which were suitably gritty and invigorating, and the sets, costumes and locations look as though they took their time with it and to make it true to the period. I also enjoyed the score, it was jaunty and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Guy Ritchie's direction is solid as well, it is tight, assured and Ritchie does seem to know what he is doing, so we were treated to some fun set pieces.<br/><br/>The pacing was fine for me, in fact although people may disagree I for one was surprised at how quickly in general the film went, even if it did slow down towards the end. The script was very witty and smart, there were a number of times when my whole family and I laughed, and a lot of it was Holmes's dialogue, plus I liked the idea of the plot, it was an original (if a little convoluted at times) and it moved along briskly. I will talk later about what didn't quite work, but in particular the final solution is interesting. It may be one you need to rewind a few times in order to completely understand though. I also think it was a good idea to put Moriaty as a background character, the ending is highly suggestive of a sequel, and if there is one that would be a perfect opportunity for Moriaty to flourish with the right actor, some good dialogue and some good character development.<br/><br/>Finally the acting. In general, I was really impressed. Robert Downey Jnr, an actor who I like a lot, gives a very strong performance as Holmes. He plays Holmes as an avid boxer, as a keen martial artist, as intelligent being a master of logic and deduction and as a master of disguise, while tormenting his housekeeper in a playful manner and sometimes acting as selfish and self-destructive. Downey Jnr. delivers his lines pretty much brilliantly, sometimes saying them quite quickly, especially when Holmes is deducting but I loved his deadpan delivery. Jude Law is perfect as Watson, he plays him as young, intelligent, authoritative and there are some great moments when he tells Holmes off. The two do share a unique and effortless chemistry together and that really showed on screen and one of the reasons why the film was so enjoyable for me. Another strong performance is Mark Strong as Blackwood, a real villain he is, mysterious, cold, dark, suave yet charismatic yet deserving of one or two more scenes, and I liked Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade.<br/><br/>Despite all these strengths there were two primary weaknesses. While the plot was great and moved along briskly, there were some scenes that came across as rushed and unexplained, especially when Holmes and Watson save Irene Adler from being killed in the factory, that just felt like an action set piece and little else. Rachel McAdams I didn't like so much as Irene. She looks really pretty, with the lovely authentic hair style and her dresses were eye popping, especially the pinkish-red one which suited her perfectly, but acting-wise she looks stiff and unconvincing in her part.<br/><br/>Overall, just plain fun. Whether you see it or not is up to you, if you don't like it that's fine, this film's not for everyone. But I am going to conclude to say I loved it, it was entertaining and smart. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","3","3 May 2010"," Nice Updating of the Famous Character
","Sherlock Holmes (2009) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Updated version features Robert Downey, Jr. in the role of Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as his best friend and assistant Dr. Watson. In the film, a man (Mark Strong) dealing in black magic is hung and pronounced dead but soon he rises from the grave with plans that will change the world. Holmes and Watson are on the case along with an old flame (Rachel McAdams) of Holmes'. The character of Holmes has gone through so many changes since the silent days that there's no question people are going to have their own opinion on what the character should or shouldn't be. I personally thought this updated version was pretty good and it at least delivered a character that we haven't seen in any of the dozens of previous films. I enjoyed the visual style that Ritchie brought to the film and I think for the most part he nailed the atmosphere. In a lot of these recent movies that take place in the past, it seems like we just get CGI and no atmosphere but that wasn't the case here. The dark and gloomy look of the film is like something we would have seen from the Universal series of the 40s and that is a plus. There are a couple major problems with the film and the first being the running time. I'm really not sure why so many movies need to run over two-hours these days but a good fifteen-minutes or so could have been trimmed here and we wouldn't have lost anything. Another problem is that the actual story takes a back seat to the visuals, fast editing and loud sound effects. The case involving this man coming back to life was very interesting and when the film centers on this is works very well. The problem is that we get so many distractions that don't work like Watson's upcoming marriage. This woman plot never works and I'd say nothing with McAdams character works either. There's no question she's a fine actress but her role here was pretty worthless. I think Law works out very good as Watson as he has the ability to fit into the character good enough for us to believe he's this smart guy. Downey also manages to fit into the role quite nicely and I think the two men share some good chemistry together and help keep the film moving a lot better than it probably should have. For my money it's Strong who steals the show as the bad guy."
"Aaron1375","9","1","3","9 April 2010"," Robert Downey Jr. plays this role as good as he did Iron Man, Sherlock is rather astounding.
","I really wanted to see this one in theaters, but I unfortunately never got around to it. Instead I got the DVD as an Easter gift and have to say it was a really entertaining flick that I thoroughly enjoyed. Of course when you get right down to it I suppose I liked this one mainly thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the famous detective from England. He is quickly becoming my favorite actor which is kind of funny and sad that really no one in the younger generation can really carry a movie like this man who was once in very really danger of ending up like so many young actors who achieve success at a young age. Instead, he has rebuilt himself as a person who can take on action roles and is able to deliver humorous quips while in said movie. Let's face it who else in the younger generation is even close, certainly not say Shia LeBleaf a guy they say is the next big thing, but all he has done is star opposite Harrison Ford and giant robots both of which were the primary draw for people seeing those movies. Here Sherlock is shown at the beginning of the film foiling the plans of a man named Blackdale. He is apparently some sort of black magic practitioner. Well it is not to long after that this man is hung, but after a bit it seems that this man has risen from the grave and once again Sherlock must find out what is going on. This Sherlock seems equipped with an extremely sharp mind capable of processing information at an astounding rate. At times it seems he processes to much info which is probably why he is in need of a smoke from his pipe which contains something other than tobacco I believe. The setting is nice, I like the way the movie looked and the cast apart from Robert is good too as Jude Law made an excellent Dr. Watson. I enjoyed their byplay. Good action, good mystery and good humor in this movie had it all pretty much covered. There does seem to be a huge opening for a sequel, I usually prefer a movie to be standalone unless you already have the other movies pretty much made as was the case with the Lord of the Ring trilogy, but I will forgive it here as this movie was successful enough I believe to have a sequel green lighted. I do wish though that he had one more of his narrations where he says to himself how he is going to take someone out and then they show it. All in all though a rather complete film that was entertaining, hopefully Iron Man 2 will be as fun to watch as this one was."

They try to make him into an Action Hero. Who's next? Archie, that Drew Girl, Tom or Huck, Anne of whatever, Charlie Chan (not to be confused with Jackie Chan)?<br/><br/>Because of the promos, I knew I would have reservations about this film. I didn't want to see Sherlock Holmes as an Action Hero. I liked him the old way, serious, calculating, proper, genius level, well-dressed at all times with proper manners. Here they have him most of those things but looking and acting like a slob most of the movie. And, they had him a fighting member of some Fight Club for lack of a better explanation. Not my idea of Sherlock Holmes. Not anyone's idea. Sir Arthur is revving up for a twirl. <br/><br/>What was good? The cinematography was outstanding. The acting was good all around. The stunts were okay as were the CGI. It was kind of good to see Watson not be the passive sidekick we saw from the TV shows and Sherlock Holmes movies of the past. <br/><br/>The dialogues were good, but the clarity of them by Downey suffered. Since S. Holmes was English, and Downey is not, they had Downey talk light speed so you wouldn't notice he didn't have an English accent. Guess his English accent wasn't good enough and they decided to go with fast-talk-muttering. Many, many times I muttered to no one in particular, ""Whadee say?"" See? Jude Law, on the other hand, was clear as he is English. <br/><br/>What was bad? Most of the movie was shot in the dark. Too many fight scenes. Understanding Downey was difficult. And, worst of all, the movie was tooooo long ¬Ö¬Ö.and tedious. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I didn't care for or have any sympathy for any of the characters. As for humor, there was very little of it. Sir Arthur is gaining speed toward full twirl.<br/><br/>When Mary (Reilly) and Irene (McAdams) were on the scene, they were a breath of fresh air to this too darkly lighted movie. <br/><br/>Not really of any consequence, but: Holmes never wore the hat with the bill in front and in the back; Holmes never smoked the curvy pipe we were used to seeing ‚Äì here it was a straight barrel.<br/><br/>As Archenemy Professor Moriarty was mentioned at the end of this, a sequel seems to be in the works.

"cgedas","8","1","3","27 January 2010"," Sherlock Holmes adapted for XXI century
","I know I'm risking to be misunderstood, but I found that ""holmish"" feeling in the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" from Guy Ritchie. After a few not very successful variations on the ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" theme, director finally happened to create something of his own, but new. G.Ritchie returns again.<br/><br/>Yes, the story about Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) gives dynamics to action, no to thought this time. The movie contains as many FX as never before. The famous detective himself is a mix of House, M.D. and CSI agent. Too much fighting and too little sophisticated conversations between Holmes and Watson (Jud Law).<br/><br/>However, in my opinion, this movie is a transformation of XIX century detective fiction into the XXI century. The XX century had changed the very style of narration of adventures. Things which had been thrilling the reader in XIX century cannot affect the XXI century viewer in the same level. In order to reach the same highness of tension the radically different stylistic means.<br/><br/>The G.Ritchie's narration beginning give the reading clue instantly. In one of the first scenes Holmes is preparing to beat a security guard of Lord Blacwood, who is the main negative character in the movie, despite professor Moriarty. A prolepsis is given: Holmes in advance plans in which order and to which parts of enemy's body he will beat to knock him out. He also calculates what organs will be damaged and how long it will take them to recover. Then he accomplishes it. Yes, it is a detail of the XXI century movie. But it has ""holmish"" sagacity. However, for me personally, Holmes relation with his violin illustrates the transformation mentioned before most accurately. Long known as a fan of this instrument, the famous detective in G.Ritchie's movie plays with violin without a bow. He plays with it with his fingers, as if it is a banjo. This Holmes behaves with a violin as cheeky as a film narrator behaves with the traditional material about the legendary sleuth.<br/><br/>By the way, J.Law played Watson is also nonstandard. He is not the smart guy for whom Holmes is only cover as in some other adaptations. He is not a nitwit either, through whom an intelligent detective describes his deductional mind. This time the essence returns ‚Äì Holmes and Watson is a tandem indeed, the equivalent partners. There wouldn't be a successful end of any case without one of them and there wouldn't be an interesting story without another one."

","Well, here's a strange thing. Diamond geezer director Guy Ritchie, who has struggled to repeat the critical and commercial success of diamond geezer London crime movie Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, gets to direct a Hollywood blockbuster, complete with a couple of big names and special effects coming out the old wazoo. Not something I would have predicted, but there you go. So what's it like? Rather good fun, actually. It's a solid story, with lots of action, lots of detectiving, a fair amount of humour, and bags of period feel (albeit tempered with some knowing anachronisms, especially in the dialogue). At the heart of it is the relationship between Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson (a good deal ballsier than any Watson I have seen elsewhere, a diamond geezer in fact), which is greatly assisted by the genuine chemistry between the two actors. The script is entertaining, the two principals give very good performances, and they are assisted by solid support from Mark Strong (always first rate) and Eddie Marsan. Only Rachel McAdams fails to engage, but perhaps that's just me.<br/><br/>The effects budget has gone towards creating a very authentic looking Victorian London (although I can't help thinking that Baker Street, where I used to live, would have been wider than that back in Victorian times).<br/><br/>I have only two reservations. One, Downey's accent never convinced me for a second: I was always aware that this was someone doing an accent, not that it was Holmes' natural way of speaking. And, two, I thought that some of the music was ear-manglingly awful. The Irish jig and gypsy dance-type pieces not only did not fit particularly well in the sequences they were applied to, and were so intrusive that they threatened to pull me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie was hugely enjoyable."

","""It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you"" Remember this line from 'The Cardboard Box'? This seems to be the most pertinent and to the point review of the new movie Sherlock Holmes. The quick witted and masterful Holmes breaks all the shackles of his past and is reincarnated as the new Holmes, the Dark Knight of the future. He is eccentric, enigmatic and visually too cinematic to be the pipe smoking, aquiline nosed detective we all read about. The inhabitant of 221B Baker Street turns all clich√©d notions upside down with his fist fights and his potent love interest in his enemy turned ally, Irene Adler. Holmes is the Iron Man who like all superheroes fights and kills his adversaries. The intriguing plot meanders heroically as its protagonists; the brave-heart Holmes and the overpowered Watson try to outwit the dark lord, Lord Blackwood whose malicious and occult crimes threaten to annihilate the peace of London.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Junior is brilliant in his role, he is funny and entertaining. His accent is masterful and his gait dainty. He is however a little more disheveled than expected, lurking around his room catching flies and anesthetizing Watson's dog. But his mental acumen is strong, his reflective brain, his ability to deduce a person's character from the minuscule details brings to mind the character of the dear old Holmes. However his colleague Dr. Watson seemed at times more potent than him, solving riddles in a jiffy, romanticizing and even overshadowing Holmes at some parts. Jude Law is an actor par excellence and he has used his skill to the best of his ability thereby creating a made over Dr. Watson whom I simply loved. The colleagues share a fantastic bond; they are the ideal made for each other couple. In those grimy and grumpy scenes of slaughterhouse blood, dirty alleys and soiled laboratory, it is obviously the fantastic bond between these two that win over audiences with its charm.<br/><br/>Irene Adler who is first mentioned in 'The Scandal in Bohemia' and who is possibly the love interest of our old Holmes is resurrected here. She is a charming young lady of style, class and brawn. We never know if Mr. Holmes really loved her since ""All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind."" But in the cinema the emotion of love is more potent and discreet. They kiss and hug yet they always engage in a battle of wits. Holmes has the picture of Adler (the one mentioned in 'The Scandal in Bohemia') and he seems to adore and admire the lady. Rachel McAdams looks good in all the scenes but there is a missing ingredient in her chemistry with Holmes. They don't look like a great match, even though they try hard to portray the perfection, they just don't seem to hit it. As for the other characters, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood is both sinister and perfect. He combined the villainous instincts of a gentleman with great dexterity.<br/><br/>The storyline of the movie is admirable. The plot is fabulous and will leave you agog. One will definitely not find the flair of Conan Doyle, but he will surely enjoy the twists and turns. The cinematography is brilliant. The gloomy London skies cast a gray shadow in the movie. The movie has a dearth of color and the sequences are frenetic, fast and slow paced at the same time. The soundtrack is soothing, a little Irish but good to ears.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a brilliant and innovative experiment for director Guy Richie. The peppy Sherlock Holmes does look marvelous on screen yet somehow he lacks the appeal and the wisdom of the stereotyped Holmes and becomes a usual Guy Richie creation, perhaps just another extraordinary antihero."

","What a cracker of a film! I went not expecting too much, but thoroughly enjoyed a cracking story - great humanity in Robert Downey's performance and of course Jude Law doing his bit. The scenery was authentic (though all cgi of course), and the movies overall feel was League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Bourne Supremacy. Guy Ritchie has a great feel for an English-type story (poss from all his Gangster type pics), this is a strong thread in this film - the smells and sights of Victorian England are strongly drawn.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the story twists and writing. All the plots tied up and made sense. <br/><br/>There will be a sequel, but that's great. Ironman was the start of Downey's rehabilitation in the film world - this reinforces it.<br/><br/>Well worth the admission, and one I'll buy when it comes to DVD."

","Sherlock Holmes. The name synonymous with intelligence bearing a Victorian aura, reflecting upon criminal masterminds with sophistication, quick-wit and sharp deduction, is re-introduced to us by Guy Ritchie, the man behind 'Lock, Stock & two smoking barrels', 'Snatch' & 'Rock n Rolla'. He might not be the most obvious choice for such an undertaking but aided by an entertaining Robert Downey Jr., Ritchie pulls this one off the Lord's hat. For all the Jeremy Brett fans who did not see Conan Doyle's 'Holmes' in anyone but that sopshisticated, sharp, often loud and over-reacting personification with the aura of higher intelligence, Downey Jr. is here to re-define all those semblances while capturing Doyle's original character in rawness that is entertaining. In a spectacularly re-created London of the 1890's, an utterly insolent and messed-up Holmes is drinking medical potions to keep himself up, laying in his room for days without care and experimenting trials on a poor dog while being rudely blunt with Dr. Watson's girlfriend at an important dinner. This eccentric detective is a departure from the suave icon of yesteryears. But his true self is seen in his analytical thinking that helps him deduct the smallest, often unthinkable details around him. The calculating bare-knuckle boxer is a testament of the new Holmes, courtesy Guy Ritchie with the slow-mo capturing his distinctive style. Watson is displeased with Holmes' behavior but he cannot keep himself from being the able aid of the renowned detective. This passive, dismissive but ass kicking relationship is one of the highlights of the movie. The chemistry between the actors is great to watch and it sets the tone for this being an entertaining franchise. The duo intervene an act of sacrifice performed by the satanic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) resulting in his capture which only begins a twisted plot that as threatened, will change the very fabric of time. After his execution, the Lord emerges from the dead, bringing dread to the world and a renewed energy into Holmes who was restless so far for a new case. What follows is an action packed adventure that brings the investigation to the Parliament where the sinister device of Lord Blackwood is set to wipe out the existing government. With some additional help from Irene (Rachel Adams), Holmes while refraining from an obvious distraction, uncovers the Lord's plot in a climax atop the under-construction draw bridge. In a conniving manner, Ritchie leaves the story open ended with the foul smell of the greatest nemesis of our detective lurking in the case that will soon be re-opened. Eddie Marson as Officer Lestrade is perfect for his part while Mark Strong as Blackwood makes a sinister villain. Although, one would've hoped to see more of him. Jude Law adds composure to the entertaining pair while his chemistry with Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. Robert Downey Jr. may be the only actor to play two convincing action heroes with equal finesse and excellence. We can't get enough of his misbehavior and reckless acts till he gets everything right and emerges as the hero in his movies. Downey adds a refreshing twist to Holmes' character that is a departure from conventional versions but is distinct and Victorian just the same. Guy Ritchie captures London in dazzling fashion with construction omnipresent in the city's boom time. While he churns out enough explosions and raw action, his focus remains on a fine script that gives ample opportunity for Holmes to not miss any opportunity that can close his case. The one striking aspect of the film that makes it a winner is that throughout its 2hr30min duration, it incessantly entertains with every unfolding scene. Audacious as he was while experimenting with Holmes' character, he has succeeded in establishing all characters of this franchise while leaving scope for witty humor and deeper bonding between them in the future. Sherlock Holmes is re-invented for the new generation with the same essence of the legendary character authored by Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Downey Jr. packs enough punch with Ritchie's entertainment to make it elementary for you to not miss this opportunity.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.55 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"sidfargas","Null","1","3","7 January 2010"," Robert Downey Jr. is AMAZING!
","Robert Downey Jr. delivers just as everyone knew that he would. He has to be considered the greatest actor working today now that DeNiro and Pacino are past their prime. (No offense to Al & Bob) Cast anyone else in the lead and this film isn't as good nor as interesting. Most of the presentation works, especially the internal monologue of Holmes' actions and deductions. The director does display a self important heavy hand in some scenes but it never takes away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Rachel McAdams is woefully underused but sets up nicely for the sequel.

I'm no film critic, as you can probably tell but don't be put off going to see this film by the negative reviews bleating on about; Sherlock is too scruffy; its nothing like the books; Watson isn't old enough,etc etc. Who cares!!!

"dbborroughs","9","1","3","3 January 2010"," I can't wait for the sequels
","Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson have survived for the better part of 150 years thanks to to the characters ability to shift and change with the times. Despite all the shifts and changes the characters have always remained the same stalwart heroes at the center.<br/><br/>Such it is with Guy Ritchie's reinvention of Holmes as an action hero. Sure he is moving about in a more frenetic style, but at the same time he is at his center the same Sherlock Holmes we've always known and loved.<br/><br/>Here the case involves a certain Lord Blackwood who appears to have come back from the dead in a bid to take over the British Empire. Add to the mix the imminent departure of Watson for wedded bliss and the reappearance of Irene Adler and its clear Holmes has more on his plate then is usual.<br/><br/>What can I say but this is a perfectly adequate Holmes for our day, or any day for that matter. Downey's wonderful twist on the great detective is its clear he is neither infallible nor a machine. Homes missteps and he is very much a feeling sort of person, bother for what he perceives as his abandonment by Watson and his lust for the lovely Miss Adler. Downey makes Homes much more human than almost anyone I've ever seen other than perhaps Christopher Plummer in Murder by Decree. Actually I should note that the relationship between Holmes and Watson in this film and in Murder by Decree are the only two times where I find it clear why the two are friends. (Yes its clear in the Jeremy Brett series but there is more joy here and in Decree) I should also say that Jude Law's Watson is a wonderful man of action that runs roughshod over a century of ineffective Watsons.<br/><br/>I loved this film a great deal. And if there is anything that kept this film from making my best of the year list it's that the film's frantic pace becomes too much at the end and the film kind of loses its focus at the end ad events become BIGGER for no real reason other then spectacle.<br/><br/>A must see for anyone wanting to see a ripping yarn."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","3","3 January 2010"," Fun and smart
","I knew right away that I wanted to watch this. Ritchie has a unique style, and while I would not have considered the idea of him using that approach to this franchise, I am immensely happy that someone did. This is very different from what we're used to, which has little to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books(read the FAQ), and it hits the nail on the head for the core of his stories. Adding a gritty tone, his playing around with the speed of shots(and using it to greater effect than ever before in his films, I might add), and some exciting action/adventure, Guy has reinvented Sherlock, and without losing the essentials. The plot is brilliant, with plenty of twists. It will keep you guessing, and the ending is tremendously satisfying. The script is in general impeccable, with *hilarious* British verbal comedy(and the accents sound right, as well), and well-written, thoroughly developed and credible characters and relationships. Every acting performance is spot-on. Downey Jr. was the perfect choice, as was Law. McAdams is sensual, and gives a marvelous performance. I am thrilled to see Mark Strong, who impressed me beyond words in Body of Lies, getting a lead role in such a big movie, and I hope his career will continue to soar. The pace is amazing, and in spite of being fast, it doesn't overwhelm and you can follow it all, including the complex deductions. Editing and cinematography are simply excellent. The whole thing is beautifully shot, Victorian London looks *gorgeous*. This has a rather high production value, with sets, costumes, etc. all being stunningly done. The score is a tad unusual, and works well. There is continuous violence(I'd call it brutal, but I guess it was trimmed just enough to not be?), a little suggestive material and several bits of disturbing content. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys mysteries and/or Holmes, and who can live with the lack of the deerstalker and Callabash pipe. 8/10"
"LoneWolfAndCub","8","1","3","2 January 2010"," One of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in awhile
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.), with his sidekick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law), accepts the task of unraveling the mystery surrounding Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and his plot that threatens England and the rest of the world whilst dealing with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). A seemingly standard mystery is turned into an exciting, fast-paced movie thanks to many people. Guy Ritchie infuses the film with his gritty style and fast action which keeps the story running at a steady pace with no lull. The cast is excellent, Downey Jr. and Law are perfectly cast as the mystery-solving duo, with the perfect amount of side-by-side fighting and bickering to make it believable. Hans Zimmer's score suits the tone and style of the film very well, and late 1800s London is recreated realistically. The only weakness I found was the screenplay, which was not bad, but personally I found the story got quite convoluted towards the middle. Of course, Holmes' explanation at the end reveals everything very nicely. Sherlock Holmes is a great summer movie, a perfect balance of mystery, drama, and action with a charismatic cast and a brisk pace which should entertain everyone that is willing to go along for the ride.<br/><br/>4/5"
"krzysiektom","8","1","3","2 January 2010"," very modern
","It is a Guy Ritchie movie through and through. Frankly he might diversify his directing techniques a bit. Having said that, I like his style and I liked the film. The acting is top notch, the music interesting (nothing ""English"" about it...), two gorgeous women, fast tempo... What I disliked was too much editing of the fighting scenes, at times impossible to see who was doing what, but I guess it is a malaise of most young directors these days. The CGI-created London was a bit too dark and monotonous, and a bit artificial at times. Holmes's clothes were too ""bohemian"" and out of touch I think, I know he was a rogue character, very eccentric and so, but still very British, no?? The way he dressed was more apt for... Tom Sawyer, too American. The bit about ""re-conquering the colony across the Atlantic"" was tad corny, Ritchie playing to the US audience too much here. What surprised me, and I have not seen any comments on it, is how Ritchie ridiculed the greatest myth of Christianity: that of Jesus' resurrection. The same was done in the French phenomenal costume drama ""The Brotherhood of the Wolves"" a few years back, and also nobody seemed to notice it then, or maybe nobody cared. Well, I do not care either."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","1","3","31 December 2009"," Not Exactly Elementary
","In Director Guy Ritchie's vision renowned detective Sherlock Holmes is a martial artist and extreme intellect. Surprisingly, Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is more action movie than moody whodunit piece. In some ways this is strangely entertaining seeing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as an action buddy movie. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are up to the task as Holmes and Watson. Downey is amazing as Sherlock Holmes embodying an aloofness, keen intellect, and physicality in the role. Law is charismatic, comical, and dashing as Watson. Their friendship is almost marriage like with the intermittent bickering and underlying love for each other. Which glaringly points to forced romance involving Holmes's former love thief Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams. I am a fan of McAdams; however, her character seems more plot device and narrative foreshadowing of Holmes's greatest nemesis. <br/><br/>The story and screenplay by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg, and Lionel Wigram surrounds the evil Lord Blackwood (malevolent Mark Strong), who apparently returns from the dead to end the world as we know it. So it is up to Holmes and Watson to foil the evil and powerful Blackwood. Having these many writers involved is usually not a coherently good sign. At times it is not. <br/><br/>In the opening sequence Holmes dispatches Blackwood's henchman with martial arts precision. Apparently, Holmes's vast knowledge of human anatomy and his brawling avocation make him a dangerous marital artist. According to Ritchie this resembles the Doyle character. Watson is also a formidable fighter, despite his war injury. Watson wields his cane as a deadly weapon itself. Downey got shredded for the movie, and Law looks lean and strong. <br/><br/>In ""Sherlock Holmes"" Holmes and Watson apprehend Lord Blackwood before he murders another young girl in a ceremonial Black Arts sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to be hanged. His last request is a visit from Holmes. He warns Holmes, ""You must widen your gaze¬Ö"" Apparently, not everything is as it seems. Lord Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead to exact his revenge. The perplexed Holmes seeks to uncover the truth. <br/><br/>That supernatural storyline is engaging. What is really entertaining is the ""Odd Couple"" storyline of roommates Holmes and Watson. Turns out, Watson is engaged to capable and beautiful Mary Morstan (strong Kelly Reilly); thus, threatening Holmes's relationship to Watson. Downey is at his arrogantly funny best as he exposes Mary at dinner with Watson. At about the same time Irene (McAdams) shows up enrolling the aid of Holmes to find a man. Irene may be blackmailed into doing so‚Äîall very mysterious. <br/><br/>There are a lot of loose threads throughout ""Sherlock Holmes"" aside from the Blackwood storyline. Even that one is ""elementary"" in the words of the famous detective. Downey and Law however, engage and compel throughout. Often at odds, we know that their life and death bond is one of respect and love. That shameless bravado and the charisma of Downey and Law make ""Sherlock Holmes"" worth watching. And we can look forward to Sherlock Holmes's greatest nemesis in the sequel, perhaps."
"FranceAlber","9","1","3","29 December 2009"," Sherlock takes Action...
","Never having been an actual fan of Sherlock Holmes, I sat down in the theatre quite apprehensive towards the casting of Robert Downey Jr in playing the renowned English detective, but the moment the picture started rolling and the sight of a perfectly realistic late 1800s London appeared before my eyes, I realized I'd chosen the right picture. Apart from Robert Downey Jr's excellent British accent and the amazing chemistry between all the actors, the plot, set, and twists of the story left very little to be desired... I had before this seen television versions of the famous story of the detective, for instance THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. This series had left me with a terribly boring image of the detective, which got completely blasted away by this amazing and entertaining picture. The constant irony and bickering between Holmes and Watson, made the movie even more fun to watch, and an unpredictable Rachel McAdams in the part of Irene Adler gave the whole movie an extra twist and the hope for a sequel... I have been told that the image of Sherlock Holmes in this movie has been altered from the one projected in his books, however I believe that if you , like me, are ignorant of Holmes' original personality, then you will come to enjoy this movie very much. If you, like me, enjoy movies that make you take a step into the past and live adventures of which you have heard only legends and myths, then you should definitely see Sherlock Holmes."

We enjoy many actors at their best, certainly to be topped by Downing Jr.and Law, who both give Depp-like popcorn performances. Guy Richie has intelligent style in his direction. And Zimmer's score plays as a strong supporter of the plot.<br/><br/>To re-imagine Sherlock Holmes is not to just bring to life Doyle's Victorian detective.....but to confront the veteran movie goer with Christopher Plummer's detective, as well as Basil Rathbone's definitive interpretation. However, history does have an advantage here. There is no superb Sherlock Holmes' movie (perhaps Rathbone's Hounds of Baskervilles is close). And there still isn't. But there is another great interpretation to enjoy. And in this viewing, one will find these points of cinematic fascination.<br/><br/>1. Do all Hollywood blockbuster's today require heroes who fight? Maybe, but when Richie directs the scenes this well, we understand Downey's Holmes much better.<br/><br/>2. Why is Hollywood so male centered? Perhaps a movie based on two famous male detectives would not be the movie to ask this about, but Rachel McAdam's character brings this to point. She's very good, but for being such an important chacter, she gets very limited screen time.<br/><br/>3. Is this film great? Well, the narrative is a little jumpy. But considering how bad popcorn movies have bee this year(other than Star Trek) perhaps we all should just enjoy a very good movie.<br/><br/>Btw, be sure to savor the use of the violin for Holmes."

","Guy Ritchie is the wrong director for this character.<br/><br/>We saw this at xmas and while it was entertaining, and there were some very useful inventions in the cinematic experience, many scenes were overwrought with CGI.<br/><br/>To wit: the fight scene on the bridge totally lacked continuity and was, as a locus and so obviously CGI severely detracted from the story and was, in my opinion, unnecessary.<br/><br/>To his credit, however, the scenes where Holmes maps his strategy in his mind's eye and it is preplayed on the screen, were positively genius.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. is indeed a worthy, nay, necessary embodiment of Holmes, and Jude Law is a believable Watson.<br/><br/>There is no doubt this film is positioned as a franchise with as many iterations has Doyle had stories, and a prequel would be most satisfactory."
"cadillac20","8","1","3","28 December 2009"," One Of The Most Entertaining Movies Of The Holiday Season
","Robert Downey Jr. has, in recent years, made a reputation for himself and the movies he headlines. You can expect a few things from them. Firstly, they're probably going to be fun. This is evidenced by Tropic Thunder, and even more so, Iron Man. Secondly, there is a good amount of humor put into his roles. In this new version of the famous Baker Street detective, he continues his trend of blockbuster making roles as he serves up a joyous and often times funny portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>This time around, Holmes and Watson, played to a T by Jude Law, must tackle a seemingly supernatural case involving a resurrected Lord Blackwood back from the dead. The rest of the film is spent chasing the once deceased Lord and figuring out his next move. And it is quite a wild ride through London at that. The film succeeds in spades thanks largely to its perfectly cast leading men and a smart script that provides a fantastic maze of a story that has one guessing right up to the end, just as traditional Sherlock Holmes tales have done. Law and Downey Jr. work so perfectly together, it could be argued that this is the best couple of any movie in recent history. And what perfect casting. Jude Law, commonly known for more sophisticated, yet hard bitten, roles oozes such here with a Watson who is quite sophisticated and smart, but also displays a natural talent for fighting his way out of a physical confrontation. Likewise, Downey brings his usual mixture of crazy and cocky to it's most raw. It also helps that both characters are flawed in very realistic ways (Watson a compulsive gambler, Holmes an obsessive compulsive drinker), the way that the characters are often best done.<br/><br/>Another very positive element is the mixture of elements between the story, character development, and action, all of which work superbly. The action is much more down to earth and far less CGI-ey that was once believed. The story, while many have said is uninteresting, still commands attention as it sets up a fine and inventive mystery. Above all, the character development creates two very fun and fascinating characters that are two of the most enjoyable of any film in recent memory.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes isn't a perfect film. Far from it, Rachel McAdams is wasted here as a love interest and Mark Strong falls short of a worthy adversary for Downey Jr., whose Holmes is far more impressive than the lackluster Lord Blackwood. And some of the story seems a bit forced, as if elements were put it in simply to push the story through. However, these are not nearly enough to deter from what works in the film, and what works, works so well. Sherlock Holmes is definitely a great way to end 2009 in film."

Jude Law is incredible. We are planning to see it again soon, now that we know the outcome, to see what small clues we missed during the first viewing. <br/><br/>I think Rachel McAdams held her own against a formidable cast as Irene (the scene in the hotel room was particularly funny), and Mark Strong was chilling as Lord Blackwood. <br/><br/>There is a lot of humor throughout, and I loved the foreshadowing of Holmes' actions in some of the film. The actual style of the film was very well done, from the way the city was laid out, to the casting, costuming, make up, etc. All in all, it is an awesome film and very well worth the ticket price."
"Quinoa1984","7","1","3","27 December 2009"," a rollicking good time with a sophisticated blockbuster by Ritchie & company
","Sherlock Holmes has been done and revisited and re-baked so many times one wonder what else could be done with it (my first exposure wasn't even to Holmes directly but through Disney's Great Mouse Detective). So it was about time, I suppose, that Hollywood would tackle this as any other franchise and make it into a big smashing action movie... which sounds wrong, of course, as Holmes and Watson's adventures aren't meant to have super elaborate action set pieces or fights, and are more about the figuring-out of things and Holmes' dry wit and frustrating manner as a cocaine addict and eccentric personality. But luckily Guy Ritchie, making his first real step into a big studio situation (not his crime movies or misguided Madonna-inspired pics) is a success on a basic level: he gets audiences interested in the Sherlock Holmes detective story first, as well as the rapport between Holmes and Watson, and then lays in his own touches to the material.<br/><br/>It's another of those stories that, oddly enough like Great Mouse Detective, is as simple a plan as a villain's plot could get: take over England. In this case we have Lord Blackwood (nefariously cold performance from Mark Strong), who it would appear has been practicing dark magic, and has killed five people. He's hanged, but it also appears that he has risen from the grave and puts forth a dastardly plot to ""change the course of the world"", as a villain like him would put it so bluntly, and it's up to Holmes to stop him. While figuring out what's going on in the story, the detective work of it all, is fascinating, it's not entirely the true draw of the film. If there's any invention in the plot it's in the ways that Blackwood uses confounded technology from a turn of the 20th century period that works on a level that's fresh for 2009 audiences.<br/><br/>No, it's Robert Downey Jr and, also, Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, watching them on screen interacting with each other, interacting with others, and figuring out what's going to happen next (mostly this is Holmes, and nine times out of them he figures it out in an instant and spends most of his time explaining it away, accompanied by visuals), that makes it most compelling. Downey couldn't be more equipped to play a character like this, and like Iron Man it's a character that has more nuance and more going on under the surface than we might think looking at him. There's snark, there's sarcasm, there's a bad-ass bravura and a sense of entitlement to both characters, but in Holmes we see Downey (minus the coke habit of the original Doyle creation for a PG-13 rated film) tackle this iconic figure with the intelligence and grace found in previous versions, but his own spin on it as well. And Law is up to the challenge of Watson, even if, arguably, the roles could be reversed for the stars and played just as well.<br/><br/>The action set-pieces are good... not always terribly original (oh, big guy vs. normal sized guy, haven't seen that before), and the final confrontation on the scaffolding of the bridge may go on a tad too long with the exposition. But all in all Ritchie gives a lot of the fights and action real excitement and energy; my favorite was Holmes, in an act of clairvoyance for the audience's sake, shows what he'll do in slow-motion and narration to an opponent in a bare-knuckle brawl, and then just does it in regular-speed film. It's a creative angle on it without going too predictable. Oh, and did I mention the music is just about perfect here? Listening to the few songs, and most notably the old-time charged Hans Zimmer score, adds pep and inspiration to a lot of scenes, the twang of the guitar or violins and other instruments usual to find in a blockbuster, but a welcome treat.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is fun times, a kind of one-shot graphic novel turned into a movie that deviates from prior times with the books and stories, and still works as entertainment. It's not high-art. It's Robert Downey Jr. smoking a pipe, looking joyfully mad, and a stylish (and satisfying) revamp on Victorian-era London. 7.5/10"

","Wasn't sure what to expect as I'd avoided all spoilers & reviews... I've been a fan of Holmes for quite a few years now .... And ... I loved it... Fast paced action ...... suspense, thrill, humour and some serious whup-ass.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr was great and played a very interesting Holmes, (not stuffy and perfect as he's often portrayed), not to mention his awesome ability to kick-ass. Jude Law played a wonderful touchy-feely Watson and Mark Strong, deliciously depraved as always, an awesome choice for the sinister Lord Blackwood. I hope to see Mark in many more flicks to come. I wish we'd seen more of him in this movie, however his absence added to and built intrigue and suspense. I didn't like Adler too much - her character was somewhat boring and predictable.<br/><br/>Overall, cleverly done with mystery and intrigue it worked very well. It was a wonderful tribute to the great detective and his keen mind and overly alert senses. The scenes between him and Watson were brilliant and the tension he and Blackwood bad between each other held one on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>I wonder if Blackwood somehow managed to ""magic"" his way out of it at the end... it certainly looked like the end for him, but looks can be deceiving - especially with Sherlock Holmes of all things and Blackwood's so deliciously wicked it'd be a shame and a waste to off him after just one movie that's begging and screaming for a sequel. After all, with Moriarty sporting to be in the next, it would be interesting to have Blackwood's revenge including both the Great Detective *and* his Nemesis...<br/><br/>If not, I guess there's always fanfiction... ;)"

","The Robert Downey, Jr., version of Sherlock Holmes gives the Baker Street private investigator most of the fight stamina of comic book hero Iron Man, one of Downey's recent predecessor roles, without going through all the rigmarole of planting a nuclear-powered widget into Sherlock's chest. Holmes' frequent fight scenes serve primarily as a clever ploy by the multiple story and screenwriters to divert attention from a conspiracy theory plot which has more undercover bad guys involved than THE PELICAN BRIEF and V. combined. Ranging from jailers and hangmen to half the parliament and the American ambassador, the intersecting trilateral commissions no doubt have lizard people stashed somewhere in the background. The fact that the ritual murders staged as a red herring for the authorities needlessly involve top-level cabinet members as crime scene participants is the sort of thing movie-goers apparently are expected to overlook due to all the fisticuffs and explosions. However, the sets\art direction are in league with SEVEN, enhanced by seamless visual effects. As an update of the Sherlockian legend for the ADD set, this HOLMES merits 8 out of 10."

","Hi just watched this film (waited for it to come out on DVD). I was very pleasantly enthralled. I enjoyed the Sherlock reinterpretation, and Watson's character.

I look forward to seeing the follow up - in cinema though this time! <br/><br/>OK - got to stretch this out to 10 lines otherwise this site doesn't publish. What can I say....Robert Downey Jr is looking hot. He has certainly kept fit - and no botox either. That's so refreshing to see. Jude Law also looks nice and normal - not like so many actors whose had plastic surgery these days.<br/><br/>Oh, and finally - I loved the dog (can't remember his name). English bulldog and all that.

","I don't have much time, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Robert Downey Jr is incredible as Sherlock Holmes, and his accent perfect. Many say that he mumbles throughout this film, but personally I had no trouble understanding him. Jude Law was good as Watson, although not a patch on Downey. We've all heard about the ""bromance"" between the two of them, and it really does come across in the film that these are two guys who get along excellently. There is more chemistry between Law and Downey than there is between their characters relationships, such as Watson and his fianc√© Mary as well as Holmes and Irene Adler (played by Rachel McAdams), The film itself is very funny, exciting and never drags. Many people have been saying that it is not a very faithful adaption to the original Arthur Conan Doyle book series. There are no deerstalkers, magnifying glasses, trench coats or utterings of ""Elementary, my dear Watson"". However, if you actually read the books you will notice that Sherlock was characterised by none of these, and that the previous movies which used this stereotype make Guy Ritchie's version the most faithful adaption yet.<br/><br/>It may be more for the Brits than their North American counterparts, appealing to the general British sense of humour lovers. Go see it - at all costs. Excellent."

So at first I wasn't really offended with this Sherlock Holmes fighting his way through like he was Bruce Lee. But I was somewhat disappointed in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock. This Sherlock was incredibly average when it came to his deductive skills. It did seem a bit odd a brilliant sleuth preferring his fists over his mind. The whole time I was waiting for his genius to rise which never happened. And for this we can mainly blame the plot. It has to be one of the dullest plots ever. Never mind the fact that it isn't original. At least it could have been made more exciting and engaging. Where was the mystery? I was waiting and waiting till I realized that there was none. And with a run time of 123 minutes that can't be good. The only redeeming factor is the interaction between Robert Downy Junior and Jude Law.

He and Law make a strong duo. And Victorian London is beautifully captured.<br/><br/>But there's that ill-fated, shallow and repetitive narrative, full of overlong chase scenes and witless talk, lacking any sense of real mystery and melodrama while opting for a silly tale of pseudo-supernatural mumbo-jumbo instead.<br/><br/>At least, the original stories' pulpiness had style. This one's just mindless fun.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 passed out dogs"

","It wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped. Far too much fighting and explosions and the like as Holmes & Watson get involved in endless chases or being chased etc. I grew bored with all this. I'd expected more time to be spent on tricksy clues and challenges for us to solve. On the James Bond angle, neither the script nor the scenes of violence and so on quite convince even though on a superficial level it's very slickly done and you have to get used to this dirty, dreary London that's depicted as Victoria. I've no reason to doubt the authenticity and I imagine many filmgoers liked that a lot, but am I glad I didn't live then in that grimy sepia city. I wanted to get away from it but even Holmes couldn't allow us a clean room to escape into for a short time. Ugh.<br/><br/>I quickly guessed who was behind it all and I imagine most others did so that's no secret - in fact, I'd expect anyone who knows anything about Holmes to guess quickly. I was surprised Holmes didn't immediately get that too but I guess they wanted to preserve the secret as long as possible! Downey acted Holmes well enough though I felt he was a bit too young for the part. Jude Law I had noted was in the cast and I didn't expect him to be anything special in whatever part he had - I didn't even realise until the credits at the end that Watson was Jude Law!! He was simply splendid, definitely the star of the show.<br/><br/>I won't be surprised if there's a sequel since there's the option given the end of this one. It should be worth seeing.<br/><br/>This is a movie I recommend you to see once, but whether you'll want to see it again depends I think on what kind of movies you like. I wouldn't watch it again, not even on TV, because I feel that ""I've seen it, I know what's coming, there aren't any mysteries to puzzle over, so what's the point?"" Perhaps in a sequel they could challenge us more?"

","I certainly was curious about ""Sherlock Holmes"" as soon as I saw the first trailer for it a few months before it had been released, but I wasn't sure at all what to expect. From the looks of the trailer, it seemed it would be focused a little more on humor in the story than actual mysteries and characters, but fortunately I was wrong with that assumption. This may be my favorite movie of 2009 from what I have seen. The weird thing is, I don't consider this a GREAT movie, but a very well-executed one.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is one of those films that isn't perfect but feels like it is when you watch it. The scenery is absolutely commendable, along with the cinematography, and the score is a perfect fit for the main character and time it is set in. We all know from stories that Sherlock Holmes is a man with more than a couple problems, and the perfect man for the role was picked, Robert Downey Jr., because he considerably has had similar problems in his life. He also is a great actor with a certain type of charisma that he can only use to suit the role of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>The story is well-done and everything you see will be tested later on in the movie. Flashbacks to reveal the answers to the mysteries are nicely executed and perfect for the conclusion. The Performances are great from everybody, so there's nowhere specifically to recognize. The personification of the character by Robert Downey Jr. is also directed in a very authentic, accurate way that we can all enjoy.<br/><br/>Overall, if you haven't seen this, it's really fun and enjoyable, the action isn't too over the top and doesn't distract from the real story, check it out, because I consider it to possibly be one of the most well-made films of the past decade."

The fight scenes seemed tacked on, unnecessary, unbelievable, and generally just very un-Holmes-like. They interrupted what otherwise could have been a fascinating movie, and served to break the tension that was otherwise built up between the main characters.<br/><br/>2. I felt that the story would have been more compelling if the villain's motives were a bit more pedestrian or character-driven.

"tom-456","6","1","4","16 January 2010"," Too bad the action scenes are all chopped up
","There is no point in my repeating all the stuff that you can read in the hundreds of other reviews, so I am going to talk about one aspect that no one else seems to want to talk about. The action scenes are unwatchable because they are all chopped up. They are filmed from multiple camera angles and then the footage from the different cameras is spliced together in a way where no single camera remains for more than about a half second. I have noticed this technique in several other movies in recent years, a notable example of which was the first Bourne movie, and one of the Batman movies. This is a decidedly inferior technique, and any director worth a fraction of what they are paid should know better than to use this sloppy technique. The reason for using is probably twofold. They probably believe that many viewers like this technique, because the rapid camera cuts simulate fast action and increase the adrenaline level of the viewers. For me, it just creates nausea. The other reason is that it is cheap in terms of time spent with the highly paid actors. Rather than have them go through lengthy rehearsals with professional stunt people so that they can pull off a decent semblance of a fight scene, they step through a sequence of stop-motion or slow- motion poses. It amounts to stop-motion animation pulled off with real actors. It comes off as fake, and merely annoying. No movie that relies on this technique deserves a good rating, no matter how good it is in other respects. Were it not for this problem, I would have given this movie a 9 rating, because other than this, it really is an outstanding movie. But it is pulled way down by the use of this decidedly inferior cost-saving technique."

"dukevega","6","1","4","7 January 2010"," Few Touch Ups, But Nothing New
","They certainly did try to liven up Holmes by putting Guy Ritchie in charge and casting Robert Downey Jr, but there was no real differences to what we've grown up with: Holmes is still able to deduce in a glance what would take the cast of CSI a whole episode, he's still a man who craves stimulation to keep his mind on edge, and he can be somewhat insufferable at times. Sure, changing his wardrobe and giving him some brawling skill made him more accessible to modern audiences, but they really didn't do anything groundbreaking, like they did with James Bond in ""Casino Royale"".<br/><br/>But it certainly wasn't from lack of opportunity; at least twice they seemingly ""killed"" the few people he cared about, only to reveal a little later that the injuries weren't as bad as they appeared or there was a convenient platform that cut short their apparent fall to doom. Now THAT would have been something new for Holmes; how to deal with the loss of those people who were able to put up with him. How would he have reacted? But, unfortunately, that seemed to be too much of a risk to take."

","He's lean! He's mean! He's a kick-ass crime fighter and the baddest dude this side of Pickadilly Circus! He's Holmes, Sherlock Holmes! <br/><br/>Huh?<br/><br/>When it was announced that macho director Guy Ritchie was going to make a Sherlock Holmes movie, with the intention of turning the renown sleuth into a rough and tumble action hero, there were more than a few eyebrows raised. With the announcement that the part would be taken over by the very American, very sardonic Robert Downey Jr. further puzzlement followed. The mystery being ""Why?"" <br/><br/>Holmes is a legendary character, and his iconic image is firmly implanted in our pop culture. The continuing respect for the character is rooted in that image, not in the actual quality of the mysteries that were devised for Holmes to solve by his creator Arthur Conan Doyle. The prevailing image of Holmes as being tall, slender, somewhat solemn and the epitome of Edwardian gentlemanliness is hard to shake, whether the actor in the part plays it stoically (Basil Rathbone), neurotically (Nicol Williamson) or comedic (George C. Scott). The decision to give us a Sherlock who is violent, belligerent and of questionable hygiene is the biggest mystery in SHERLOCK HOLMES ‚Äì if Ritchie didn't like the traditional Holmes, then why did he bother to make a film centered on him? <br/><br/>In fairness, Doyle's Holmes was not above resorting to physical violence and using a firearm now and again. But those were on rare occasions, the traditional Holmes had intellect as his primary weapon and that sufficed quite nicely. Ritchie's detective comes off as a pistol-packing hooligan who frequents Fight Club matches, whose residence at 227B Baker Street could best be described as squalid and whose personal appearance could generously be called perpetually scruffy. While the traditional Holmes was of the upper class, but who could move around among the lower classes, it is unlikely that this Holmes would be comfortable or be accepted among the titled. In essence, the filmmakers have taken the less savory aspects of the Holmes adventures and moved them to the forefront, for reasons that just aren't clear. Maybe the filmmakers thought a character with genteel qualities would just be too uncommercial for modern audiences. That is rather sad. There just was no call to re-imagine Sherlock Holmes as being down and dirty.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Downey gives a bad performance as Holmes, only that he comes off as being Holmes in name only. He gives us a passable British accent and plays the part with a degree of shifting moods. Indeed, had he not been playing Sherlock Holmes, and had instead been cast as an original character, say, an Irwin Smithers or a Nigel Butterworth, then maybe his work wouldn't seem so vaguely disappointing. A bit more of his impish sense of humor ‚Äì which added so much to IRON MAN -- would have been a welcomed addition and helped ease in the character as a tongue in cheek homage.<br/><br/>But to pretend for a moment this isn't a Sherlock saga, how is the film? Well, Holmes' attempts to sabotage the impending marriage between Jude Law's Dr. Watson and his future bride, Mary, gives the film an unexpected homo-erotic subtext that is amusing and rather sweet. Beyond that, with it's impressive sets and CGI effects, elegantly overplayed supervillain, colorful assassins, overly choreographed out-of-nowhere fight sequences and a long-winded and convoluted narrative about a super secret organization and a megalomaniac's plot to take over the world all makes the film seem less a Sherlock Holmes adventure and more like an Edwardian version of a James Bond movie. In the end, it would seem that Ritchie tried to tackle one British literary icon and inadvertently made a film about another one -- though still as a grungy and unpleasant recreation.<br/><br/>The box office success of SHERLOCK HOLMES could inspire other nefarious re-imaginings; like Jackie Chan as martial arts master Charlie Chan. Or maybe Jean-Claude Van Damme as an intense adventurer named Hercule Poirot. I can see it now: ""She's hot! She's sexy!! She's the Hell-raising Mistress of Crime!!! Angelina Jolie IS Miss Jane Marple!!!!"" <br/><br/>Well, maybe not."

","With Sherlock Holmes, I've never read any of the old books, and I got my education pretty much from the movies. That'd be Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, who I still prefer to Robert Downey and Jude Law. But I do concede that great liberties were also taken even with those beloved 1940s Universal versions. It makes sense too when people point out that we love Lugosi's Dracula and Karloff's FRANKENSTEIN, but they're not the true versions as written either, not by a longshot. It really makes you feel like you want to give this movie a fair pass too, if you honestly consider that we let so many older things slide. However, I think it's not so much that there are changes and modernizing per se; the question is more: have these updates and changes worked for you? I liked the score in this film, which kind of reminded me a bit of the music in Jess Franco's ""El Conde Dracula"", of all things. I thought it was good having the story take place in olden times, and I liked Jude Law as Watson. As for Robert Downey, he did not strike me as Sherlock Holmes - that is, not the vision of Holmes I have burned into my brain - but if one is willing to be more open minded in this case, he was enjoyable in the part in his own new way. I despised Rachel McAdams in this movie; she just came off as way too 21st Century-like for this era. My main gripes with the film are the same typical problems I find with so many newer movies... way too many climaxes (is it over now? How about now?), and that annoying ""woooossshh!!"" speed photography and trick camera shots the filmmakers seem so compelled to do today, mostly for flashback moments. ** out of ****"

I must admit that the movie, was more of an action move than I expected, as I've always thought that Sherlock Holmes would be more within the genre of Crime / Thriller and less of an action movie. So I'm not quite sure how well the movie captures the real universe of Sherlock Holmes, so it might not be the best movie to watch if you really like the books and crime stories. <br/><br/>With that say I actually think they've done a quite good job creating Sherlock Holmes and Watson, even though the movie is a bit more about action that I expected. The actors do a great job too.<br/><br/>The story is good, although as mentioned a lot of time is spend on action. This means that the story is not that complete and I felt that some information were left out or simply not written, which is a shame. I also feel that it is hard to think a head in the movie, at least when I watched it I didn't think ahead to try to solve the mystery at all.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie, however it's more of an action movie than I would expect and I think if your mind is really focused on watching a crime movie where you should try solving a mystery you might be disappointed.

"YGoodwriter","6","1","4","26 December 2009"," Downey and Ritchie Successfully Make the Cerebral Victorian Detective into an Action Hero
","SHERLOCK HOLMES: Holmes' famous catch phrase ""the Game is Afoot"" should be replaced by Full-Speed-Ahead in this kinetic adventure film, directed by Guy Ritchie. The cerebral Victorian detective has been transformed by Ritchie into a thrill-seeking action hero. Whereas the literary Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle, would seek solace from boredom between cases by indulging in narcotics, this new Holmes is equally likely to seek out an underground fight club as he is a crack pipe.<br/><br/>That's not to say that this new Holmes (Played by the always watchable Robert Downey Jr.) is lacking in intellect. We naturally get the requisite astute deductions based on trivialities invisible to anyone else. However, this modern Holmes has a Fools-Rush-In-Where-Wise-Men-fear-To-Tread mentality. He rarely thinks things through until after he's waded hip deep into danger and mayhem. It's only when he's face-to-face with impending disaster that his magnificent mind kicks into action and starts plotting his strategy. For instance, when Holmes is going toe-to-toe with an opponent in fisticuffs, his great brain begins to pre-choreograph the battle. We see inside Holmes' mind as he anticipates every blow, lists his enemy's weak spots, calculates how long it will take for the bad guy to fall and how long it will take him to get up again. As soon as he's satisfied with his pre-fight prediction, we see Holmes leap physically into the fray, which invariably ends just as Holmes anticipated.<br/><br/>It's as if this version of Holmes needs to be under pressure in order to motivate his amazing deductions. He seems to be more in love with danger than with solving puzzles, as the classic Holes was. Downey's Holmes is much more of a warrior than earlier versions of Holmes. He's not the type to sit in his room, smoking his pipe until an epiphany hits him. This Holmes has danger as his muse. It's hard to imagine Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce (Who starred in the most popular classic film versions of Holmes and Watson) storming into a room full of armed thugs, carrying nothing but a walking stick and some Nun-chucks, and besting the baddies in a wild brawl.<br/><br/>And speaking of Watson, Jude Law makes a very dapper Doctor John Watson, and plays off well against Downey's quirky Holmes. Watson is engaged to be married to Mary Morstan (We don't know where Watson met Mary, since Holmes is only introduced to her after Watson has decided to marry her. Watson clearly didn't meet her in Holmes' case ""The Sign of Four"", as Doyle wrote her) who has a very unpleasant introduction to Holmes. Holmes is clearly threatened by Mary's relationship with Watson and does his best to sabotage it. (The scene where he uses a fake psychic to predict that Mary will become fat and grow warts is very funny). There is a subtle homo-erotic aspect to the Holmes/Watson relationship that today would be called a bro-mance. (They share clothes. Holmes doesn't like Watson's girlfriend.) But both men have their own love interests. Watson has Mary and Holmes has Irene Adler.<br/><br/>Irene (Rachael McAdams) flits in and out of the movie, tantalizing our hero with her feminine wiles. They have a Batman/Catwoman sort of relationship. Holmes is fascinated by Irene since she's the only one who has ever outwitted him (As she does several times in this film) while Irene herself is working as the agent of a mysterious enemy, but her feelings for Holmes cause her to waver in her mission. McAdams makes a very pretty Irene (Who Holmes does not refer to as ""the Woman"", the way he did in the Doyle cannon.) And‚Äîas you might expect‚Äîshe has the requite scene where the pretty girl beats up a couple of large guys.<br/><br/>The plot: Holmes has captured the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is using ritual sacrifices to call up some unnamed evil. Blackwood predicts his own resurrection and sure enough, no sooner has Watson pronounced him dead from hanging than Blackwood is back, up to his old sorcerer tricks again. It's up to Holmes to find out what the resurrected villain is planning before disaster hits England. Unlike the classic Holmes stories where our hero must save one of two lives, here Holmes is saddled with a Guy Fawkes type plot to destroy parliament and also to re-conquer the American colonies.<br/><br/>Downey's Holmes often seems more like Hugh Laurie's Greg House from ""House MD"". He's scruffy, witty, sarcastic and always messing up his best friend's private life. (As many already know, House was based on Holmes, so Ritchie brings the whole thing full circle by basing the new Holmes on House.) The bantering relationship between Holmes and Watson certainly seems inspired by House and Dr. Wilson.<br/><br/>There are lots of little Easter-eggs and inside jokes for fans of previous books and films to catch if they're paying attention. The standard Sherlockian trademarks are present, such as the disguises and the oft disdainful relationship with the semi-competent Inspector Lestrade. It actually retains more of the Doyle Holmes than the trailers and previews would make it seem. True, it strays very far from the source material and it may be hard for purists to accept Downey's unkempt urban warrior as the same character portrayed by Basil Rathbone or Jeremey Brett. However, if you can overlook the inaccuracies, this is actually a fun action film. Think of it as a Victorian 'Buddy Cop' action comedy and purists may enjoy it. As for people who don't know much about the Doyle Holmes, they'll find Downey's man-of-action version a lot of fun."
"st-shot","5","1","5","29 January 2010"," Latest take on Sherlock all noise and set design.
","Same super hero different costume and era in this crass, abrasive and sloppy take on the world's most famous detective. Robert Downey Jr. as the scruffy Sherlock is more Indiana Jones than London Holmes as he battles a Bela Lugosi attired villain and other imposing clich√© bad guys in what amounts to the usual loud and violent devoid of introspection formulaic pap that lines them up at the box office these days. For those it should not disappoint.<br/><br/>Ham fisted director Guy Ritchie delivers scene after scene of action blood and gore across London where it climaxes at the semi completed London Bridge in predictable style along with the requisite franchise blockbuster serial ending promising a sequel. Save for Sherlock's ambiguous homo-erotic inclinations towards Dr. Watson nothing is left to subtlety.<br/><br/>D Jr. does bring a roguish charm to the character of Sherlock (as well as many of his Iron Man qualities) but too little of the implacable deductive grace and style. Ritchie instead elects to have Holmes deductive powers announced by way of blinding flashes across the screen like light bulbs in comic strips. Jude Law's Watson is also an action figure while the female leads are more scrawny than fatale though one displays some trendy karate kicks in a nod I guess to market research.<br/><br/>What does make this Sherlock Holmes for its time somewhat palatable is the rich set designs, costuming and CGI evoking Victorian London in both its majesty and squalor. But then again Masterpiece Theatre does the same thing every time it does a Dickens or an Austen. This comic book Holmes shows you can dress something up but it is no guarantee it will have any manners."
"cl777","4","1","5","19 January 2010"," Downey Excels BUT......
","Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a fast-paced, edgy adaptation (to put it mildly) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's late 19th century creation. I have learned that Detective Holmes was apparently not too dissimilar to the way he is portrayed here and that previous films actually passed over this side of him.<br/><br/>Sherlock was in fact an avid boxer and a martial artist, had little personal hygiene, did sleep on the floor, drugged himself and his dog constantly, insulted Watson, played practical jokes on his housekeeper, and was generally quite an offensive character. He was also however a master of disguise; a genius of logic and deduction with an incredible memory and case solving ability. It is during his relationship and close friendship with Dr. Watson that he became a more ""respectable"" member of society.<br/><br/>Jude Law plays Dr. Watson perfectly, with understated charm and ease, and most importantly lets the light shine on Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock, giving him the true spotlight. Every pore of Downey's permeates this role and it's obvious he's loving every second of it. His brooding, tough, energetic and cunning Sherlock is what makes the movie entertaining in my opinion. He is one of few actors who has gotten better looking with time and age and in many scenes is reminiscent of a younger Al Pacino in Scarface. The Golden Globe that was just awarded to him is richly deserved. Rachel McAdams was a bit disappointing I thought and doesn't add much to the film.<br/><br/>I liked the well written interplay and complicity between Sherlock and Watson. However, the plot of trying to find Lord Blackwood who has risen from the dead and operates a secret society was way too far fetched for my taste. I thought the action scenes were too long and although I liked the dark, moody, filthy London that was conveyed, the special effects looked fake. I felt like I was watching an awful Dan Brown movie at times with all the symbols and secret rituals of the sect.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has delivered a unique movie by sticking to his genre of a testosterone driven, male charged environment where one wouldn't necessarily expect it and for that he should be applauded. There is a great fight scene in which Sherlock envisions and dissects the violent play by play of what will happen to his unsuspecting opponent in slow motion in his head, then Ritchie shows it to us unfolding in real speed. The movie is unconventional but I felt that a lot of the scenes dragged on, especially towards the end. RDJ's performance was enthralling but I strongly preferred the fast repartees to the fast chases.<br/><br/>My rating: 4 Fabio's: 4 Total score: 8 For more reviews please visit and become a follower at http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com"

","I decided to watch this as it was on Netflix. I'm glad I never went to the cinema to see it. Never been a Downey Jr fan and Jude law's best role was in The Talented Mr Ripley. Therefore I wasn't at al surprised when on watching this film I was presented with a dull, unenthralling bore fest. Guy Ritchie's trade mark slow motion scenes are there and to be honest I have no idea why Downey Jr is hailed as a bankable star as I really couldn't see much difference in his acting ability from Tony Stark..- SUCH PHENOMINAL RANGE. Eddie Marsan once tweeted that acting does not inspire him...I can only assume that it's a result of being in this movie. The attention to scenery, costume was excellent but the story was boring and the characters tedious."

","I'm not sure what I just saw, but it surely had nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes. I've been a huge fan of the stories these 20 years, went to the museum in Backer street 221b, and know the stories and characters by heart.<br/><br/>This is a Hollywood action flick with zero substance, which makes a complete mockery out of the characters. One wonders whether Mr. Richie even bothered to read the stories at all.<br/><br/>Robert Downey as Holmes could easily be called the biggest miscast of the century, if he wasn't surpassed by Jude 'Smug Face' Law as Watson, who's probably as believable in the role of the devoted, admiring, and distinguished friend of Holmes as Trump in the role of US president.<br/><br/>So, if you know nothing about Holmes and Watson and have a penchant for action flicks without story and substance, then by all means watch this movie, for everybody else: STAY AWAY."
"DonFishies","7","1","6","5 January 2010"," Entertaining enough, but far from perfect
","Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is terrorizing England until he is finally captured by Detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his trusty partner Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). But after being put to death, Blackwood returns from the grave and intensifies his plot to control the country. Of course, with Scotland Yard only moderately helping, it is up to Holmes to defeat Blackwood.<br/><br/>I was really pumped for Sherlock Holmes based solely off trailers, even if Guy Ritchie's contemporary interpretation did not necessarily coincide with the mainstream image of Holmes (a bare-knuckle boxer, really?). It also helps that in the tail end of the decade, Downey Jr. can basically do no wrong acting wise, as he either owns every movie he is in or makes subpar movies watchable for his performance alone (as anyone who has seen the Oscar-baiting film The Soloist can attest). But while the film's trailers make the film look like an riotously funny, action packed time, the film itself is a little different.<br/><br/>Having not even attempted to view Swept Away (or Revolver in its entirety), I cannot speak for Richie's complete directorial resume. But Sherlock is both his slowest paced film, and the least stylistically edited. Whereas Snatch and RocknRolla were both off the rails editing wise, packed with plenty of style and Tarantino-infused dialogue and scenery, Sherlock comes off as a far more brooding film. Right after the opening sequence, I knew the film would feel every bit of its 130-minute running time, and to my surprise, it felt even longer. Some scenes drag out far past their best before date, and others just feel like they could have been edited a bit better. None of this makes the film bad per se, but it does take away from the lasting effect the film gives. I enjoyed the rocking action scenes, but by the end of the film, I just really wanted it to end more than anything.<br/><br/>Compounding these lengthy scenes are more than a handful that take the viewer out of the film. I understand Holmes as a character has a penchant for being very particular about how he acts as a detective (by means of course, of someone from the late 1800s), but some of the more theoretical material just seems like it got beaten to death over the course of the film. One specific scene in particular, involving drugs and black magic, just looked totally out of place in context with the rest of the film. I was more confused than anything seeing some of these scenes play out, and really wanted to believe the filmmakers could have pulled some of it together more cohesively and in a shorter running time. I really wanted to adore the movie, but it was scenes like that which seemed like they were better off on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>What it seems like the filmmakers focused on instead was bringing the world of Sherlock Holmes to life. The atmosphere, the mood, the feeling of every set and every costume feels very much in the realm of what we have come to know and love about the character. It may have been made in the late 2000s, but it feels very much like it belongs in the late 1800s. Yes, some of the effects look like they could have been better rendered, but the world Sherlock lives in is near perfect. The scenery and art direction practically comes to life as the camera sweeps past its luscious beauty. Every single corner is very much of its time, right to the last minute detail. Visually, the film is stunning in every frame, and the running time only helps to showcase it strongly in each scene.<br/><br/>But the greatness that lies within Sherlock Holmes belongs solely with the cast more than anything else. Even at its most incredulous or boring sequences, never once does the cast change for an instant. Everyone is right at home in their roles, embodying them with a hint of class and a great deal of precision. They all feel just as real as the next person, and help make the film all the more authentic.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. as said previously can do no wrong and only further proves it in the title role. He is electrifying from start to finish, nailing the British accent to a tee, and nailing this new age Sherlock even better. While it is not quite as perfect a performance as his rendition of Tony Stark (who after multiple viewings, has proved to be the role he was born to play), his interpretation of Sherlock is very strong. The unreliable and questionable techniques Sherlock is known for are made all the better in Downey Jr.'s hands. The man has come a long way as an actor, and it is roles like these that stretch his range and make him all the better.<br/><br/>While I was baffled at the thought of Law as Watson, he proves to be even better than I imagined he would be. It helps that he is actually from the United Kingdom and is not just putting on his accent, but watching him act alongside Downey Jr. in some of the more fun sections of the film only proves that he was the right man for the job. While I would have liked a bit more emphasis on Black's Blackwood, he does a more than adequate job with what he is given. Much the same goes for Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler, who spends the majority of the film as more of an enigma than the love interest she should be.<br/><br/>While it is far from perfect, there is more than enough to enjoy from Sherlock Holmes. The feel of the film makes it a worthwhile watch on its own, but the performances of Downey Jr. and Law are what really drive the film.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"Jdc102","6","1","6","2 January 2010"," Underwhelming
","Jude Law is one of my favorite actors and I'm starting to really enjoy Robert Downey Jr after Iron Man. Guy Ritchie is stylish and can create a FUN experience at the movies (LSATSB). But after watching the first previews for Sherlock Holmes, I admit I was a bit underwhelmed. It seemed like they were going for style and very little substance. I think that is a shame, considering the substance is Sherlock Holmes, a character with a lot of potential. There is no doubt Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and fun, but I never really saw him as Sherlock Holmes, but rather Tony Stark playing Sherlock Holmes. For me to recommend a movie, it has to stay with me, but with a boring plot that I didn't care about, this movie was forgettable. The occasional bits of humor aren't even close to recommending it. Its a shame with such a talented cast. C-"

","Sherlock Holmes was just as good as expected, and a bit more. At 2 hours, it was a good deal that brought action, mystery, suspense, and obvious room for a sequel. Firstly, it's not exactly like the original Holmes, but modernized, and I think it's a good thing. It pulled in people of all ages - old and young, although it is a bit dark and scary for younger kids.<br/><br/>The acting and characters were, as said before, more action-y than the stories, but it's all for that awesome effect. Robert Downy Jr. did a good job, and with Jude Law, brought in humor. The other characters were played out well.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, and certainly had some twists, and without spoiling anything, keeps the case open for a second one. Guy Ritchie directed this nicely, and gave it a darker air than I expected. The scenes when Holmes predicted and solved riddles/enemies were very fun to watch. The mystery was too confusing for anyone to truly solve himself, but it described everything at the end. It was overall a fun, interesting movie that serves the old Sherlock Holmes well."
"tony.powell","6","1","6","1 January 2010"," This movie only sets up the sequel
","To be fair, let me say up front I'm a huge Jeremy Brett fan, though I welcomed and enjoyed Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes. The movie was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be -- incredible CGI of London, fun references (both in the script and in the sets) to other Holmes cases, etc. But (SPOILER ALERT!) introducing Moriarty into the film WITHOUT Moriarty being the primary antagonist (we never even see his face), makes this film a setup for the sequel. It is such a bold move, one wonders what in the world they would have done had the movie tanked at the box office.<br/><br/>I agree with some reviewers here that the story does seem incredibly contrived, almost as if Holmes, himself, has been called upon to play himself in a new movie about him. The eventual outcome doesn't seem to bother him much and, at any rate, is never in doubt (of course, it isn't, but they could have tried a bit harder to build suspense).<br/><br/>Also, as a Holmes fan, I found myself a bit embarrassed by how out-of- their-way the writers went to squeeze in esoteric (i.e. ""Holmesian"") language. Especially noticeable when Irene first visits him and talks about his favorite nuts and olives. ""Trying too hard,"" is what I mumbled to myself. <br/><br/>BUT, it is a fun movie, and better than no Holmes movie at all. I look forward to the sequel when Moriarty gets a crack at SH."
"Dunharrow","8","1","6","28 December 2009"," Great characters suffer from uninteresting plot
","I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They had great chemistry which allowed us to really grasp their characters' personalities. They squabbled in nearly every scene, and it was great every single time. But this film has an odd story, and if you've read a single Sherlock Holmes novel, you know how it's going to end. The villain is well-played, but not truly interesting from the audience's point of view. I would certainly watch this again in the future - it is fun, funny and has a wonderful balance of action, science and detective work. They have laid down a nice foundation. I hope that in the future they invest more time in the villain's character. He is one dimensional. The story, oddly enough, is too straightforward. Some more twists and turns next time!"
"cortlahman","6","1","7","1 January 2010"," Mediocre at best
","Releasing a movie on Christmas day for some reason is not always a bad idea. Sherlock Holmes is further proof that if you open a movie on the 25th of December somebody will watch it. However, aside from all of its praise, it's still fair to call this movie mediocre.<br/><br/>Not one aspect of this movie surpasses anything done by previous films of 2009. How can Robert Downey Jr, an English speaking man by nature, be almost incomprehensible in a theatre with speakers at ample volume? It was like he was mumbling through his lines because he forgot what he was talking about. In this day and age of masterful dialogue, I find that completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>Why did they drop the cool play by play action sequences in which Holmes beats up some baddies? Those few moments were far better than all the CG effects that plague the rest of the action scenes.<br/><br/>At no time did this movie attempt to involve the viewer in the mystery that was unfolding. One never got the feeling like they were as much solving things as Sherlock Holmes was. Rather, the movie just sort of spoon feeds you explanations of overly intricate schemes that in no way anyone could ever guess. As well some of the events that did transpire had no effect on the rest of the plot. Watson is caught in an explosion, seemingly very badly hurt, and is out of the hospital one scene later. Pointless.<br/><br/>Aside from RDJ's mumbling, he puts on a good performance. Law does a great job with what he's given as well. Late 19th century London is appropriately dreary and what you'd expect from another Sherlock Holmes film.<br/><br/>6/10, baby."

","Those who will start to watch this movie convinced that they will lhave the usual story of Conan Doyle's novels or the movies inspired in them, will be deceived because what this movie has in common with that is only the character's names: Holmes, Watson. Lestrade (and a reference to Dr. Moriarty). All the rest has nothing to do with the maint heme of Conan Doyle's stories namely the Homes' mental deductive capacity that leads him to solve crimes authorship and discover their authors. What we see here is Holmes and Watson as two young men (and not the usual middle aged ones sitting quietly at home) involved in physical fighting outside besides fires and explosions galore. Black magis is also present and figure yourself that Dr. Watson has even a girlfriend. We don't understand why makig a movie supposedly concerning Sherlock Homes, Dr. Watson and others without conveying the true literary fictitious well known characters. This movie story could be made with any other characters even because it has good images, sceneries and garment figures portraying 19th century atmosphere."

","In the third stage, many viewers who haven't seen the show may complain that they don't understand it. In the third part, Benedict travels back and forth between past and present dreams, and finally arrives at the famous reichenbach falls. Moriarty's frequent appearances in the various stages of the show, which disrupted cumberbatch's thinking, finally took off. And that's where previous cases come in. At first I wondered what was the point of such a banal case, punctuated by moriarty's occasional appearances. In fact, the case is probably a figment of cumberbatch's mind, just to convince himself that moriarty is indeed dead. When a bride dies, thousands of brides take her place. In the same way, if one moriarty dies, there will be thousands of moriarty. That's why Benedict says at the end of the series, moriarty didn't live, he came back."

This first film is actually surprisingly funny, the RDJ/Jude Law witty repartee is completely enjoyable and both parties are genuinely enjoying themselves and giving their all. It's a messier film, in a good way, it looks messier and RDJ plays a pleasurable bellend. Ritchie for all his flaws can manufacture a competently enjoyable blockbuster with enough visual wit and clarity and there aren't too many memorable steampunky Victorian action comedies so this stands out significantly.
I'm not a fan of the occult plot and en vogue Mark Strong sinister moustache twirling villain, but it seems suitably Conan-Doyle-esque and on rewatching it, it seems to be a fitting backdrop to the reinvention of these famous characters.
Little quirks like Holmes' kit bag, his sensible combat style and Watson's appropriately Victorian postmortem skills, are all fun little moments in a story about the end of a friendship, which is a natty place to start a franchise.

"SimonJack","7","0","1","28 July 2019"," A fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes
","One can't help but enjoy the performance of Robert Downey, Jr. in this film. His persona, with all its quirkiness, is funny and entertaining. But the idea that he could be the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's day and writing is a far stretch. The inclusion of Jude Law as Dr. John Watson adds greatly to the plot and enjoyment. Although he's a counter-character to Holmes, he's also adept at crime-solving, shooting and fighting. Of course, all of the latter is mostly out of character of the ""real"" Holmes and Watson. For, their brains, cunning and sleuthing were the modus operandi of the original characters.<br/><br/>After seeing this film on its release in theaters, I watched it again recently on DVD. It occurred to me that the device used in this film - of short stops in the story with explanations by Holmes almost as afterthoughts, might have been intended to inform (and thereby, better entertain) a modern audience that otherwise wouldn't have grasped the perception that Holmes had for small details. In reading Doyle's stories, one knows Holmes' uncanny deductions from the smallest of details. And in earlier and old-time films, audiences understood this after some comment on details by Holmes. But this modern film seems to have to make the many small details clear as a significant part of the story. After a bit, that seems childish and silly.<br/><br/>One other observation is important to note, I think. All of the CGI and high definition filming in this story makes the setting seem unreal - as if created for stage or film. I get the sense of something being unreal often with CGI. But here, the sharp detail and contrasts of black and white in street scenes gives them the appearance of being lifted off the pages of comic books.<br/><br/>While I found this film entertaining, it seems something of a letdown in story telling today. Hollywood apparently has to add lots of action in the form of fights, brawling, chases and conflagrations, in order to appeal to modern audiences -- even with classical and historical characters and stories. It's too bad, because with such modernizing of stories, I think the public loses out on the educational aspects of grasping the people, places, cultures and conditions of times past.<br/><br/>This is a fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes. For those who enjoy mysteries in more realistic portrayals and conditions, I heartily recommend the wonderful series of TV films of the 1980s and 1990s that starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson.<br/><br/>Here are a couple favorite lines from this film.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes, ""It's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.""<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes, after taking a deep breath, ""Ah, putrefication!"" (sic)"

He has the perfect balance of detective and fighter, just like he did in the books. Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Strong all do great as their characters. And the background and green screen really make you feel like you are in Victorian London. The only problem I have with the movie is the use of non-green screen CGI, such as when the boat is destroyed. It, and a few other effects looked fake. But other than that, the movie was great.

He rushes in where the police fear to tread and his casual insults to Lestrade are done in such a way the bumbling Scotland Yard man doesn't even seem to notice, pointing out his ineptitude. Irene Adler's place in Holmes' life is really built up in this one, though the real story between the two seems to have been more his admiration of her intellect and the fact she was one of the few people ever to best him, than a physical one. Nevertheless, it's fun, with a great villain and a secret society determined to bring down the government.<br/><br/>Placing the story in its actual time period makes this one of the better Sherlock Holmes adaptations. There are great panoramic vistas of Victorian London, so vast they have to be partially paintings.<br/><br/>Throw in a touch of the supernatural, some great effects, a dash of humor, a couple of explosions, and what's not to like?"

","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic crime-solver has been portrayed on film more than any other literary figure. The new version, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, has marketed the sleuth as an action hero instead of an intellectual. To my pleasant surprise, the film itself is true to its source material and Holmes' legendary mind is front and center in the narrative. The recreation of turn-of-the-century London is exquisite in its detail and the story builds steam as it goes on (indeed, I found myself enjoying it more and more as it progressed).<br/><br/>Downey, an American, flawlessly portrays the British lead, while Law's Watson is portrayed as less of a sidekick and more of a partner. The two have fantastic buddy chemistry, and their good- natured bickering is a delight. Parents should be aware that this PG-13 film, while very light on offensive language and sexuality (a woman's bare back is seen, as is a man's bare chest in a different scene, and there is one innuendo) does have a good deal of action violence and some blood. Also, the storyline involves the occult, which is displayed as evil and to be combated, but its portrayal may still make some uncomfortable. Sherlock Holmes comes recommended to those who enjoy action films with substance."

","This certainly is a more ""out there"" version of Sherlock Holmes, but I can day with conviction that I really loved this version. Robert Downey Jr. is great as the lead and Jude Law is fitting in the supporting role of Watson. Also in the supporting role category is Rachel Mcadams, and she is very good too. The movie will grab you right from the beginning, with it showing a man performing what appears to be a Satanic ritual, with a woman writhing and under the influence of whatever magic he is performing. I don't know about you, but when I see something like that in a movie, I wanna stick around to find out more. The action sequences are well done, some are actually in slow motion as Holmes explains exactly how he will beat up this person he is fighting, and then he does it in regular motion, which was cool to see. The mystery to the movie is good, no humongous twists here, but still the film is entertaining as anyone could ask for, and it will certainly keep ones attention. The acting is just so good all around by everyone in the cast too. Guy Ritchie directs the film beautifully, which I commend him for. I encourage you to go see Sherlock Holmes, I can guarantee that you will not regret it. Can't wait to see a game of shadows! 8/10."
"aramis-112-804880","7","0","1","9 December 2016"," Who and Doctor Watson?
","In older movies (specifically where Holmes is played almost to perfection by Basil Rathbone) Watson comes off as a senility patient in Holmes' care. By the time Jeremy Brett played Holmes to perfection (read the stories) he and his Watson(s) were equal partners. Now Jude Law plays a sensible young Watson with his life together and his wife in hand, while Holmes is reduced to crawling around on the floor.<br/><br/>The BAD: Robert Downey Jr is a good actor but he's not playing Holmes. While in private Holmes was not the neatest of men (see Brett) in public he was immaculately dressed, as Victorian gentlemen were. I apologize for saying it, but Downey ought to know something about playing a drug addict; but Holmes was not an addict, he took cocaine and morphine to reduce the ennui when he had no cases to hand. Conversely, when he had a case, he might spend days without eating, sleeping or dressing neatly while thinking. Calling this movie by the name Sherlock Holmes is a misnomer. . . or, rather, let us say Downey is playing a great Victorian detective of the same name.<br/><br/>But I'm a weird one. When I first started reading the Holmes stories in the 7th grade, way back in the early 1970s, I never liked Holmes much. I was a great fan of Doctor Watson and, until Brett's Holmeses came along I was disappointed Watson always looked a bit of an idiot (the worst being Stewart Granger's HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES with Bernard Fox as an absolutely brainless Watson).<br/><br/>SO . . .<br/><br/>The GOOD: Watson. He's young, energetic, masculine. Intelligent and not squeamish, as would be a man who went through Victorian medical schools. Good nerve, good shot, as a military doctor who performed surgery saving lives under fire. He only shacked up with Holmes the way young people today share rooms and houses, because they hadn't gotten their careers going. But Watson has his wife in hand, so he and Holmes won't be two middle aged men living together in a few small rooms.<br/><br/>Curiously, Watson met his wife through the real Sherlock Holmes, so that's another indication this is just another man by the same name, since Holmes and Mary Morstan have not yet been introduced.<br/><br/>Also GOOD, while so many movies and TV shows have talked about Holmes' abilities at deduction, this is the first time I've ever seen it filmed so the viewer can follow his reasoning. Kudos.<br/><br/>OVERALL, an enjoyable romp through Victorian London with the true Dr. Watson and a fellow named Sherlock Holmes. Downey and Law are both good actors who work well together; you believe they're a team. The movie has some very good ideas I haven't seen used before, it's exciting . . . but the fast cutting and execution of clues I think are meant to keep the viewer from getting a step ahead of Holmes by confusion rather than fair play. And while pastiches have often taken on supernatural elements, and in real life Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes' creator, became a wacky spiritualist, Holmes himself told Watson, ""The world is big enough for us. Ghosts need not apply."" Great movie for Watson fans (like me). But the pendulum has swung from the Rathbone/Bruce era of smart Holmes and dumb Watson; through the Brett area of an equal partnership; to now Watson being letter-perfect and Holmes being a basket case. It's time for the pendulum to swing back a bit."

","Sherlock Holmes (2009): Dir: Guy Ritchie / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Kelly Reilly: Classic literary detective figure brought to life by director Guy Ritchie with tremendous sets and visuals. Ritchie has achieved success with such humorous capers as Snatch, but here he creates a larger than life masterwork that looks every bit what Sherlock Holmes represents. Plot regards the resurrection of a black magic killer that Holmes previously brought to justice. Robert Downey Jr. presents the intellect and brilliance of Holmes plus his unappealing lifestyle. This all aids him in a field of broken trusts as well as villains that take on a spiritual type likeness. Jude Law plays war veteran Dr. Watson who proves a great ally. He and Holmes have their differences but both compliment each other with their skill. Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler who outwitted Holmes twice yet seeks his assistance. She will be a romantic interest but the film avoids formula clich√©s by presenting her as mysterious. Mark Strong plays the vicious Lord Blackwood whom is arrested and hung but his grave is empty leaving Holmes with haunting impressions. Kelly Reilly is underused as Watson's romantic interest and who is second fiddle to Holmes. Remarkable vision of the classic detective series that wins because the screenplay is clever and the visuals will hit home with fans. Score: 9 ¬Ω / 10"
"dyingtolive310","8","0","1","26 February 2016"," Little details make this a great film
","(This is more of an analysis than a review but I won't spoil anything)<br/><br/>I watched this again recently and I picked up a lot of little details I didn't notice before. To be honest I completely underestimated this film. I thought this was going to be a superhero movie with unrealistic or overplayed clich√© ridden plot devices. There are a few aspects of his character that are dramatized, however he isn't portrayed to be perfect or some inhuman divine being. He has flaws and weaknesses that help develop his character. More importantly he doesn't appear to be all-knowing which would make his partner, Dr. Watson, a useless character. Aside from a few moments of ""how does he figure that out"" the only time you'll question realism would be the fighting. Sherlock isn't said to be a great fighter however he's incredibly smart and plans out what he does in combat. To an almost perfect level of prediction but they don't focus too much on fighting, it's equally balanced with the detective segments. You might also enjoy the dialog and well placed humor.<br/><br/>Another plot device I expected was the damsel in distress who needed to be saved and carried throughout the film. The woman in the movie is named Irene Adler and she's the only person who has ever outsmarted him. Considering how incredibly smart Sherlock comes off as that says a lot about her character. To him she's simply called ""the woman"" out of spite due to her ability to challenge him, but deep down she's the one who got away. I like seeing strong female characters, especially when they're not overly aggressive about it. She knows she's a free spirited and independent woman who doesn't need to step all over men to prove it. Writers tend to make these characters seem resentful of men that just come off as if they're nothing but a cold shoulder.<br/><br/>Dr. Watson is also a well written character. At first it might seem like Sherlock is bad company but we get details of their relationship through actions. Watson clearly enjoys their adventures and he's having a hard time shifting into a more stable life. He isn't a saint who's above Sherlock and he doesn't act like it. Both of them share a mutual respect for each other and their skills which go together to create a very effective team. I did question the fact that he's a doctor who handle himself in an outnumbered fight, but they explain he was an extraordinary soldier who fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. <br/><br/>To me the characters are the most important aspects. When movies have bad characters the story will fall apart. We won't be invested or care too much what happens. We see their struggles and want to watch them pull through. So with the important aspects out of the way I would like to mention the writing. Every plot point, character development, conflict and resolution is carefully detailed to make for one amazing story. They cover their plot devices and stay true to the dramatic principle of Chekhov's Gun. The story makes sense all the way through and as a man of logic myself I loved the dramatic reveal at the end (which I won't give away). If you know a little about science you might notice a lot of the detective work actually makes sense. They don't invent a bunch of words or compounds to explain everything. Not everything is 100% accurate but it's a lot more accurate than I was expecting.<br/><br/>Simply brilliant."
"Bcmyl27643","9","0","2","2 December 2015"," Excellent Use of Cinematography to Accent Holmes' Complexity
","Directed by Guy Ritchie and released in 2009 Sherlock Holmes is an example of good use of cinematography. Ritchie did an excellent job of updating this classic story using modern techniques and editing. This movie is both a mystery and an action movie and Ritchie does an excellent job accenting both with his cinematography. Most of the movie uses cold color temperatures which when combined with the setting and the costumes reflect the time period of the movie and the cold dreariness of late 1800s London. In addition to the color temperature the movie predominantly uses low-key lighting, which creates a lot of shadows and contrast. Low-key lighting draws your eyes to what the director wants you to look at and everything else is obscured by shadow. To create the effect of mysteriousness Ritchie chose to use lots of side lighting, which illuminates one side of the face and leaves the other in shadow. Typically in cinema this is used to showcase a character's duality.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie by both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is spectacular. Both actors are able to build off of each other in order to recreate the Holmes/Watson pair. Robert Downey Jr. does an especially good job at portraying the complex, super intelligent detective while also portraying Holmes' other traits such as inventor, and brawler.<br/><br/>Overall I think that this movie is a great update of this classic story that stays true to the idea of the original Sherlock Holmes while giving it a modern flare that adds to the action and mystery of the story."

Robert presents Sherlock to us as an intelligent, entertaining, obsessive-compulsive (which explains his perception of fine details), and paranoid eccentric who has a huge hunger to the mystery. I must say that I got the same impression of Sherlock while reading the books and the adventures. I recommend all the Sherlock fans to watch this movie!"

Holmes is hired by a secret society to investigate into the matter, only to discover that his nemesis has been planning a more sinister plot all along.

","I must admit I don't know lots about the character of Sherlock Holmes in the books I just know the basics and as an unbiased fan I can say that I really enjoy this film. The premise sees Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson bought onto a case to capture the undead Lord Blackwood. Now Robert Downey Jr rediscovered his career with his portrayal of Tony stark in the iron man/Avengers movies but I think his performance as Sherlock Holmes is really underrated. He is really good in this role, he has the scruffy grit that a mad scientist like Holmes would have but he also has the charming nature that would make him a likable ladies man that you can root for, also I know people think this isn't a true depiction of the character but I thought he was great in this film. Also great is Jude law as Watson, he was a great choice to play Watson because he has the British suave to pull off the character and his chemistry with Downey is great. Rachel mcadams plays Holmes love interest and she is really good in the film, she was a strong female character that easily holds her own alongside Downey and law. Mark strong plays the villain Blackwood and even though you barely know anything about his character or his motivations strong does a good job as he seems to do in most things he is in. The story is where the film falls down a little, I enjoy the relationship between Watson and Holmes and the romance going on but sometimes this film gets a bit too convoluted and villains aren't given too much motivation. I also feel like this film had a little bit to much sequel baiting in it that felt like it wasn't focused enough on its current story. The script is great with all the witty dialogue hitting its mark and the comedy working the majority of the time. It does sometimes get a bit fast paced but if you pay close attention you'll be fine. The style of the film is great, the fight scenes are all done really well with a good use of slow mo. The setting was also great and made you feel integrated into the world of Sherlock Holmes. Overall this is a fantastic film that If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes you should definitely see."

But when Blackwood's body disappears from his grave, Holmes is hired by a secret society to investigate into the matter, only to discover that his nemesis has been planning a more sinister plot all along.<br/><br/>Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes carries all his trademarks whether it's the hyper- stylised narration, intersecting story lines, exquisite use of wit, frequent jump cuts or active camera-work and is possibly the most visually striking work of his filmmaking career. It also marks the first time that Ritchie didn't write the script for a film he directed but it doesn't make much difference for the plot & characters do carry a certain depth.<br/><br/>Production design team does a stellar job in coming up with period set pieces that nicely reflect the timeline this film is set in yet carry a modern feel to it. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera for it employs a number of tricks from slow-mo shots to high-speed photography to capture its drama & action. Editing keeps the narrative tight & gripping for the most part, and Hans Zimmer's score is simply magnificent for it enhances the entire experience by a great extent.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Sherlock Holmes features an outstanding cast in Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Mark Strong & Rachel McAdams, and their contributions certainly lift the film up. Downey Jr. further solidifies his star status by delivering a charismatic performance in the coveted role of Sherlock Holmes. Law also impresses as Dr. Watson and his chemistry with Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. Strong is dependable as always while McAdams does nicely in her role of Irene Adler; Holmes' former adversary.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Sherlock Holmes may not be the best transition of literature's greatest detective on the film canvas but it nonetheless succeeds as one deliciously humoured & downright fun flick that packs in an action-packed plot, captivating premise & interesting characters and benefits a lot from Ritchie's visual flair, Downey Jr.'s magnetic charm & Hans Zimmer's splendid score. Offering a slightly modified take on the popular figure to make the film more accessible to modern mainstream audience, Sherlock Holmes is one highly amusing & rollicking ride that comes delightfully recommended."

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","2","27 July 2014"," Good on its own, but not very true to the stories.
","My rating for this movie is 8.7. Personally, I prefer the new TV show with Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman to this, but it's not bad on the whole. I'll start with the negative. Sherlock Holmes is not an action hero, and this movie sort of made him that based off of very little from the stories. His deductive powers are also more combative in the movie. I do like the different form of deduction, but the action spirit takes out the usual spirit of the character. On a similar note, the storyline is sort of like a compressing of several stories into one big plot with distinct villains. It's not bad as its own story, but not quite what Holmes fans usually look for. I also feel that the conflict is made too important in the sense that all of London is at stake. Part of the beauty of the original stories is that Sherlock and Watson take part in cases that are interesting, but only concerning a small group of people. Lastly for the negatives is Watson. I like sidekicks and I like that Jude Law's Watson is not completely awed by Holmes, but he is too averse to his partner to be a convincing friend. The fact that he is actually helpful is good, but Watson was really meant to be Sherlock Holmes friend and companion before anything else. On the positive side, I thought it was well cast and the presentation of Sherlock Holmes' deductions is wonderful. Watson is a good if non-traditional character. The makeshift disguises are very entertaining. The action is good as well and is placed into the story at a reasonable frequency. Hans Zimmer nailed the film score like always, adding to the overall mood. Lestrade and Irene Adler are well portrayed, and making Irene slightly more of a protagonist than an antagonist works out well. Downey's quirks are enjoyable but he still retains Sherlock Holmes air of intellectual superiority. To conclude, this movie is a solid, entertaining, and interesting watch, but can easily be a disappointment for anyone that wants to see a story like those of Arthur Conan Doyle's originals."

All was forgivable when the later fights were much clearer and though the use of slow-motion has became much more of a gimmick (Thanks Zack Snyder's ""300""), the film thankfully doesn't use a lot of it. I was not really bothered with the violence critics initially brought up, and I imagined what with all the hell Shelock has put up with in past adventures it's no surprise his punching everything now.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes it had me lost in some spaces throughout the film, until they eventually go through all the clues at the end.

"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","21 April 2014"," Interesting and entertaining adaptation
","A mark of great characters is their versatility. There have been many iterations of Sherlock Holmes, many of them quite different from one another. Yet most of them feel true to the character, because Arthur Conan Doyle wrote him to have enough depth for such variations. Sherlock Holmes can be calm, deductive and collective. He can be passionate, intuitive and more than a bit crazy. He can be loving, he can be cruel, he can be unpredictable and if handled with care, it'll all feel true.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's take on the character, as realized by Robert Downey Jr., falls on the more eccentric end of the scale. His Holmes accentuates the madness of the character, the razor sharp edge between lunacy and genius. Yet he's never out of the line. There's reason to his madness and when he suddenly sobers up and functions with frightening purpose, it doesn't feel out of place. Beautiful performance by Downey and the utmost reason why this film works so well.<br/><br/>Though I feel I must praise Jude Law's take on Dr. Watson as well. His is a more subtle performance and whenever he shares screen time with Downey, he recedes to his superior presence. But that's the essence of Watson, so it feels quite fitting. I also really enjoyed his sarcasm and tired frustration. A nicer and more civilized Watson would have felt out of place next to Downey, but with Law they manage to strike the perfect balance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's an excellent film on the technical side of things. The soundtrack is superb, the set and clothing designs are marvelous, the action scenes have suitable weight behind them and as a whole the story is paced nicely. The plot itself isn't anything spectacular, but this is a movie you're going to see for the experience, not because it has something meaningful to say.<br/><br/>Are you a fan of action mystery stories with glib sense of humour, charismatic acting and excellent production values? Then I'd suggest giving this one a chance."

","Whilst the choice for Ritchie might seem odd at first, following the director's slate of tough-as-nails action films such as Lock, stock and two smoking barrels and Snatch (his momentary lapse of reason called 'Madonna' well forgiven), his apparent understanding of the underbelly of London society works wondrously. Both in depicting the tribulations of 18th century England and in updating the characters of Holmes and his trusted Dr. Watson from bookish detectives to bare-knuckle brawling bad-asses, Ritchie finds the right tone between action, adventure and comedy.<br/><br/>Whilst highly enjoyable, the film is not without flaw. The break-neck pace of both the character introductions and the plot exposition would leave any viewer unfamiliar with the source material dazed and confused, or at the very least unappreciative of the long running relationships between Holmes, Watson and the many secondary characters such as Irene Adler and Inspector Lestrade. It is of course impossible to demand Sherlock levels of character development, but with plans of a trilogy established early on in the development process the pacing could have been handled with a little more care.

You get to walk down street after street in 19th century London, streets packed with people and horses. You get to wander about in building after building. You get to travel up and down the Thames river. You get to cross the bridges. It gives the feeling of being a tourist wandering at random in a time warp. It is such a feast for the eyes. There is no stinting ever. Holmes and Watson and young and combative. They complain about each other. Watson is not the traditional all-suffering. He is feisty. There is quite a bit of physical fighting, a bit too much for my taste. However, to make it interesting, they invented a new fighting style, vaguely reminiscent of kung foo, and a whole new way to photograph it. The movie plays with the supernatural. The villain appears to have supernatural powers. You see different degrees of skepticism. You find yourself wondering how they can possibly explain everything without the supernatural. It is all explained at the end, Agatha Christie style. The plot whips along at breakneck pace. It quite hard to keep up trying figure out who is doing what and why.

The mysterious grifter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is Holmes' equal, and comes to him with a murky proposition. When Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead after his hanging, Holmes must pick up the chase once again.<br/><br/>This is a more action oriented Sherlock Holmes in director Guy Ritchie's hands. He is not the cool calculating academic sleuth that is traditional in the character. The three leads have great chemistry together. RDJ creates an unique Holmes. Ritchie has piled on a densely written story of quirky mannerism, and outrageous action. It can be confusing at times like most other Ritchie movie. But confusions aside, this is a fun manic movie."
"AMar_rom","Null","0","2","21 December 2013"," A refreshing film on the myth of Sherlock Holmes
","This is very good and quite refreshing film that manages to re-invent the myth of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is portrayed here by Robert Downey Jr in a relatively young age (late thirties/early forties). He is therefore a more passionate and foul-mouthed individual than the one we all know from Conan Doyle's stories. His clever but hasty remarks sometimes bring him into trouble and he ends up in some awkward social situations.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, do not make the mistake to underestimate the man. He has tremendous deductive abilities and sense of observation and judgment that make him an extremely capable detective.<br/><br/>I thought Robert Downey Jr was great in this role. The big surprise for me, however, was Jude Law. He plays Watson amazingly well and his interaction with Sherlock Holmes provides the strongest point in this film and makes it what it is. The ways Watson reacts to Holmes decisions creates marvelous dialogue between the two friends making Watson the alter ego of the gifted but a bit immature famous detective. One of the very good films of the year. The recreation of London of the times of Holmes is also quite of an achievement."

And, not to mention, the way Jude Law presented Dr. Watson, it simply gives you a feeling that this pair arrived directly from the novels.

","You think you know Sherlock Holmes? Think again! Guy Ritchie has taken the classic, beloved British detective and has given him a makeover with great success. I didn't know what to think of this new take on Sherlock Holmes, but when I saw it, I was quite impressed at the degree and lengths the director and cast went to make this reboot far different from the original films from the '30s and '40s. Robert Downey, Jr. (known for Iron Man) stars as the famed detective and brings his brand of dry, sarcastic humor to the character that makes him seem dislike-able, but who really has a soft spot inside. Jude Law as a much thinner and younger Dr. John Watson is a perfect catalyst for the wise- cracking and irritating (in Watson's opinion anyway) Holmes. The two set the film in motion and do an excellent job carrying the plot and film itself with help from fellow actors Mark Strong as the villainous Lord Blackwood and Rachel McAdams (The Notebook)as the sly, but beautiful Irene Adler. This film is a thrill ride with twists and turns at every corner and one of Holmes' toughest cases till the sequel 'Game of Shadows' came out last holiday season and is now available on DVD and BluRay."

","It's not terrible, just another lazy blockbuster. Casting Robert Downey as Holmes isn't a bad idea. And reminding audiences that Holmes wasn't entirely cerebral, that he was an accomplished boxer, is a legitimate way of broadening his character and his appeal. But Downey isn't a natural Holmes. He needs foils to bring out his edge or he seems too playful, too Wildian. The foils provided are not up to the job and the result is a lazy, disappointing film. It looks wonderful. Its re-creation of late Victorian London is convincing without being too realistically grimy. Very Hollywood but it works. The plot is adequate without ever challenging its intended audience. The problems lie in a script so anodyne that even Mark Strong can't overcome the villain's cardboard cutout qualities, in two crucial casting errors and finally in the over-reliance on action, for which read fight, scenes. Jude Law is much, much too bland as Watson. There's not enough contrast with Holmes. He's neither sufficiently irritating nor sufficiently irritated and it denies Downey's Holmes a proper frame. The result is a sort of buddy movie. Those issues pale into insignificance when we come to the casting of Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler. Who in God's name thought this was a good idea? McAdams is a good little actress and cast as a pretty little housemaid on the make, she might have done a decent job. But as Irene Adler, a woman smart enough and tough enough to thrive in that world, with an intellect to match Holmes' and a strength of character to make her irresistible to him? You've got to be kidding. All of which is probably why there are so many fight scenes. Without those, even the intended audience might notice the flaws. If you have a brain, don't waste your time on this. Watch BBC TV's recent Sherlock instead and see how it should be done. There are six of those, each one a feature length episode and the sixth is even better than the first."

"pfgpowell-1","Null","0","1","30 September 2011"," Ignore the lukewarm critics: this is good, solid, entertaining fare
","You've got to feel a little bit sorry for director Guy Ritchie: it seems whatever he does, it isn't right. Why? Well, it's not what he does which is at fault, but because he's Guy Ritchie. Just as some people - directors, politicians, sports people, anyone, really - seem never to lose the public's adoration (Quentin Tarantino has quite successfully overcome the appalling turkey of a film which was Glorious Basterds for no other reason, apparently, but that he is Quentin Tarantino), others somehow get off on the wrong foot and after that are never really forgiven. I have only seen one other Guy Ritchie film and that wasn't half bad. I'm told he has made a couple of duds, but I am in no position to judge. His other failing, of course, is that he married Madonna, although why that should be held against him - and it is - is a mystery to me. But Ritchie is Ritchie, so the logic goes, so his new take on Sherlock Holmes can't be all that good. Too flash, bang, wallop say some. Nothing like the Holmes conceived by Conan Doyle, say others. In fact, there are any number of complaints and criticisms of Ritchie's version, each one, it seems to me, pickier than the last. Ebert liked it but gives it only three stars, and other critics were all too often distinctly lukewarm. Well, my advice is to have none of it. I don't give a monkeys whether or not Ritchie's Holmes is 'true to the 'tec we all love and know'. He's a fictional character, for heaven's sake, and Ritchie is free to do with him what he wants. Then there are the complaints that there is too much fighting, that the film seems to go from one set piece punch-up to another. Granted, there is a lot of fisticuffs, but why isn't that charge levelled against other, in my opinion, far inferior dreck? As far as I'm concerned Ritchie has nothing to be ashamed of and a lot to feel proud of. His take on the Holmes franchise - no deerstalker in sight, thank goodness - is a rattling good tale, reasonably puzzling and imaginatively conceived. His production designer's Victorian London has come up trumps (with skilfully used CGI) and the rather cinematic look of the film - dark browns and shadow - works well with that London. The plot is a reasonably ingenious one, and I particularly liked Mark Strong's villain who comes across as an amalgam of would-be Nazi dictator (just look at the haircut) and Dracula. Robert Downey and Jude Law work well together and make a convincing Holmes and Watson and there is a lightness to the whole operation which rather pleased me. Ritchie's film sets out to entertain and does so, admirably, and doesn't take itself to seriously, which I feel is something the professional critics do a little. So go for it. There's absolutely noting wrong with Ritchie's take and a great deal that is right. The good news is that a sequel is already in the can."

"htmidas","10","0","1","13 March 2011"," An excellent, entertaining rendering of Sherlock Holmes
","This is one of my favorite movies to date; watching it again made me remember exactly how much I loved it and inspired me to write a review (well, recommendation, really).<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/><ul><li>The plot held up, keeping you guessing, but when the solution was revealed it didn't come completely out of the blue. There were clues, and re-watching lets you see exactly how the pieces came together in Holmes's head. Some people enjoy picking apart solid plots and declaring them imperfect and implausible, but this one really doesn't deserve that. Is there a movie plot in existence that *can't* be picked apart if someone tries hard enough? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cinematography was superb. Every set, every sweeping shot of grimy, rainy, nineteenth century London, pulled you into the same time and place as the legendary Sherlock Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson. The coloring was very dark and murky - blues, grays, and browns - and it fit perfectly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were fantastic in their respective roles; stellar performances from both of them, and their chemistry was great. They truly brought to life the strange friendship of Holmes and Watson: two entirely different individuals, yet ultimately dependent on one another.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It was witty. Sarcasm and dark humor joined with action (not necessarily fight scenes, but unceasing *activity*) to keep up the pace of the film, making it smart, entertaining, and funny (I actually laughed aloud a few times).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I loooooved the soundtrack. I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer, and he didn't disappoint this time around. It's very string-heavy (maybe that's why I like it? I play the violin) and sets the tone for the film nicely. Writing this, I have a part of it stuck in my head again.</li></ul><br/><br/>Con: <br/><br/><ul><li>Sometimes it was hard to distinguish exactly what was being said. The dialogue is very fast paced, and a combination of the accents and that mumbling thing that actors do way too often made it kind of hard to catch every line in the theater. If you're watching it at home (it's not in theaters anymore, so I guess you would be watching it at home), make sure you raise the volume, rewind, etc. because basically everything is worth hearing.</li></ul><br/><br/>I definitely, definitely recommend this. Sure, ""purists"" will complain that it doesn't exactly fit the timeline that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created (concerning Mary and Irene), but with so much material to draw from and condense into a movie, can you really blame them for reinventing it a bit? I think they did a stellar job of taking two well-known characters, fully fleshing them out, and placing them in an entirely new adventure. ""Sherlock Holmes"" only adds to the canon; it doesn't detract from it."

","This almost manic Guy Ritchie interpretation of Sherlock Holmes was not for me. It had tiny glimpses of what the Holmes Watson double act are about. The fact that these two actors tried to gel on screen was as good as it got. Very occasionally the humour was good and there were even traces of the books on this screen version. I noticed Holmes firing the gun which left holes in the wall was, in fact, shown in ITV series 'The Naval Treaty' ‚Äì so authenticity! Yet most of the time the action packed almost slapstick style way Holmes leaps about all over the place (yes I know he gets about quickly but not this quickly) plus the constant fight scenes; together with gun toting as in American westerns, and Jude Law's mate-y 'street' voice for Dr Watson put me off. Trouble is I have grown older used to the slower finesse, charm and sophistication of previous versions of Sherlock Holmes ‚Äì especially the ITV Jeremy Brett version. I have them all as CDs. In my opinion the ITV series is the benchmark others have to follow. Sherlock Holmes is not supposed to be filmed with the same aggression of The Terminator or The Matrix Maybe. At least this Sherlock Holmes 1, 2, 3, 4 series will appeal to those kids used to fighting it out on computers. I just hope it does not become a modern benchmark for Sherlock Holmes films."

For that matter, several other ""Holmes"" both in older times and more recent have captured that essence and symbiotic relationship with good old Dr. Watson. What we've got here is a total re-interpretation of a good thing, to the point of making this an action adventure instead of a psychological who-dunnit of old.<br/><br/>For my money, Robert Downey Jr. doesn't cut it as Holmes much as he tries-he reminds me too much of Charlie Chaplin. He's short, squatty and feigns to be a brawny muscle figure in this adaptation. The relationship with Holmes is never quite developed and the chemistry isn't there as it should be, nor is the humor. Frankly, if I want a technology driven action/adventure I wouldn't have sought this movie out. I'll go back to my set of Rathbone classics anytime, and I will tune in to the Jeremy Brett version as I've heard that is quite good as well.

"nkreview","Null","0","2","11 October 2010"," What perceptions do American made films make about other cultures?
","Sherlock Holmes is different from many current movies because it combines modern and traditional elements to captivate the audience. Because of this, it is a film that attracts viewers of all ages. Taking a deeper look, does this American made film make perceptions about other cultures that may not always be true? Holmes and John Watson are obviously the lead roles in this movie and they are both British. They are seen as very intelligent characters in comparison to the police officers who are also on the case. Holmes tends to be more eccentric whereas Watson is level headed and in control. They appear at times to be superior to others but overall they are gentlemen. Isn't this how the British are perceived quite often? The only American characters in this film were Irene Adler and Ambassador Standish. Standish refuses to follow Lord Blackwood's followers. Isn't this a typical perception of Americans? Aren't Americans usually portrayed as those who fight for liberty and independence especially from power hungry organizations such as Blackwood's cult? Irene is the other American in the film and the main female role. Watson's fianc√©e, Mary, is the other female role but she is more of a supporting character. If you notice, Irene comes across as this sexy and mysterious thief who toys with Sherlock Holmes and teases him throughout the movie. Mary, on the other hand, is prim and proper. She appears to be high class and her mannerisms are very traditional. The only rash action she makes throughout the film is when she throws her drink into Holmes's face. Does this once again support the way we perceive British women in comparison with American women? Is it true that American women are more flirtatious and wild compared with British women? This is what this movie seems to be saying. Overall, viewers need to keep in mind that all movies perceive different cultures in a certain way and it may or may not be realistic. Viewers need to be aware of this so that they are not taking these portrayals to heart. Sherlock Holmes is the perfect example of an American made film that makes cultural perceptions."

Downey, Jr. Dr. Watson's character also gets no short shrift here as J. Law adds logic, subtle wit and resourcefulness to his character, much unlike the rather bungling and shortsighted character of N. Bruce's rendition. This is neither a knock on Mr. Bruce, as his raison d'etre was precisely to be a counterpoint to the ever-so-shrewd Holmes of yore, nor on the old Sherlock Holmes episodes in general. This new version is fresh and invigorating, yet it doesn't diminish my appreciation of those most enjoyable episodes with B. Rathbone and N. Bruce at the helm.<br/><br/>So enter the madcap yet logical progressions of events ever so deftly conjured up by G. Ritchie and Co. A truly visual and poignant unfolding of a most clever story line mixed in with superior visual effects and creative casting make this a treat to watch. One most probably will have to view this film several times (I did!) before all the hints, tricks and flashback clues are assimilated and digested... but that's where the ""Rewind"" button comes in handy!<br/><br/>So Kudos for all, as too many names would require ""shout-outs"" to list here in this most captivating adaptation. In closing, my only question is: Do I see a ""Moriarty"" looming on the horizon?? He never seems too far away!!"

","Wow! For the past last month, I've been catching up on movies I missed on the big screen last year. So far ""Sherlock Holmes"" seems to have been the best thing I missed. Sometimes I wonder who the hell calls the shots in Hollywood. I mean, Guy Ritchie to direct a big action genre movie? But hell, I also like it when I'm wrong, especially when I expect to see an IMDb 6 movie and get an IMDb 8 one! To sum it up, this is what ""Wild wild west"" should have been, and more! It delivers on the grass-roots level as well as on big scale entertainment. I liked the plot, I liked the treatment (opens up like a Sherlock Holmes novel with all elements falling into place in the end), I liked the casting... everything. And about Ritchie's straight involvement: I loved every single frame of this movie. I mean, this movie FLOWED. Great stuff. Give me Sherlock Holmes. With the same director, please."

","Living with a die-hard Doyle fan, I had to hear all the terrible things about how this movie is ""nothing like the real Sherlock Holmes"" and how ""dumb"" it looks and ""look at how stupid the trailers are"" for months before this actually came out. So, naturally, the day after it opened (we weren't going to see it on Christmas!) I grabbed a friend and we went with the Holmes dork to ""see how bad it is"".<br/><br/>It's NOT bad. In fact, it's fantastic! I can't think of anyone who could've better delivered some of the sarcastic lines Holmes had than Robert Downey Jr. The role just seemed to fit him perfectly, and I enjoyed every minute of his screen time. (This might have been in part because he's just so hot but he played the role very well and deserved that Golden Globe he won.) And who could've better played the smart, mostly patient Watson than Jude Law? His funniest lines would demeaning what Holmes had just said, giving you a two for one- laughing first at what Holmes would say and then laughing again at the reaction. The ""bromance"" these two have on screen is just perfect. You couldn't ask for a better duo.<br/><br/>What the Holmes geek I went to see this with didn't understand is that people nowadays love seeing explosions and fights and hot romance. No, this movie didn't over-stress mindless fighting and random explosions. If one happened to come up it's because it fit, not because they wanted to pawn off mindless explosions.<br/><br/>Probably one of the best things about this movie is it's soundtrack! I rushed home and bought it and have since found myself listening to it over and over again. Half of them are somber and quiet, while the other half are exciting violin pieces. They fit the time period this movie's set in but don't bore most modern audiences (none of the people I saw in the theater looked very bored and most online reviews of the soundtrack are positive.)<br/><br/>When you think Sherlock Holmes a lot of people think of an uppity British guy who's way too smart solving mysteries. That's not Sherlock Holmes. This movie captures his other side: a bad-ass martial artist who's incredibly smart and knows that and rubs it in everyone's faces.<br/><br/>Omigosh I can't wait for the sequel to come out (12/16/11)! Now I'M the Holmes geek! :P"

","Just rented the movie from the Redbox, and I have to say it was far better than the trailers or clips shown on TV commercials. I was expecting a mindless romp with the Holmes name carrying it, but actually found a clever story and interesting characters.<br/><br/>The only negatives I would really point out is that there was a lot of action i would still not expect Holmes and Watson to be involved in, and I thought there was a lack of ""chemistry"" between Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.. It's not that I thought they did not work well together at all, it's more like when a TV show premieres and the characters aren't quite right during the pilot. Maybe they'll refine that for the sequel?"

","Literature's most famous detective returns to the silver screen in Guy Ritchie's adaptation. Robert Downey Jr. plays the title character, investigating the disappearance of a recently executed lord charged with practicing black magic. As always, Holmes collects the various evidence and carefully pieces it together to figure out what's going on.<br/><br/>The major significance of this adaptation is its focus on Holmes's personal life. The guy has more than a few problems with which he has to deal in the process of solving the case. Also, the Order seemed like a Skull & Bones kind of society. The depiction of London is about what one would expect: muddy streets full of wealth and poverty, the scuzziest environment imaginable (could there be any other portrayal?). The perfect setting for the contrast of the good work done by Holmes and the evil concocted by the Order.<br/><br/>So, even though I don't consider ""Sherlock Holmes"" a masterpiece, I really liked it. Downey, along with Jude Law and Rachel McAdams bring a lot of charm to this latter-day look at the character most associated with detective work.

"rahm02","10","0","2","20 June 2010"," Sherlock Holmes
","The famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, is best known by all for his genius, logical thinking that he uses to solve many of the cases from the short stories penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There have been plenty of movies and series created to display the eccentric, yet brilliant mind through the years, but Guy Ritchie, well-known director for movies like Snatch (2000) and RocknRolla (2007), decided to bring it to the ""big screen"" in 2009. While Ritchie's past credits are more gritty and harsh with charming, yet crooked mobster personalities, he delivers us with a time-honored film from the detective point-of-view. He brings action-packed scenes and even comedic wryness to this new thrilling adaptation of the famous mysteries which significantly changes the original theme of the detective from Mystery to Action/Adventure.<br/><br/>The movie is cast with veteran actor Robert Downey, Jr., who plays Sherlock Holmes and is joined by his trusty colleague, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) for yet another mystery involving a series of murders. Holmes and Watson's relationship is put to the test as Watson faces life changes that Holmes must inevitably face. Lord Blackwood, an oculist played by Mark Strong, is an unusual foe for Holmes because this plot holds more than the average thief or accidental murder of a jealous mistress. The question is ""Can Sherlock Holmes solve a supernatural mystery that is lies beyond his scientific logic?"" A fresh new face to the film is Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams, a master thief who seems to be the only one that Holmes cannot figure out, yet carries for her an everlasting yen. Irene mysteriously returns to Holmes for hire and finds herself twisted into the case and in evident danger.<br/><br/>In recent years, Robert Downey, Jr. has been successful in integrating his career into block-buster Action/Adventure theme hits like Tropic Thunder and Iron Man, but with the intellectual plot of Sherlock Holmes, he seems to flawlessly capture the eccentricity and truthfulness of the original detective. The fight scenes and explosions seem minimal to his acting, yet Ritchie accomplished an excellent feat of taking the original somber character and turning him into an animated, dare-devil of a detective. It is a thrilling ride that leaves the viewer unaware of the next clue or lead into the case, but maintains itself high on the entertainment factor. This type of movie and theme relates to the typical action-movies that have feuding partners dealing with each other's issues while going after the bad guys. For example, there are movies like Rush Hour, Bad Boys 1 & 2, and classics like 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon. These movies involve high-tech explosion effects, fleeting chase scenes, and brutal exchanges of punches.<br/><br/>In summary, Sherlock Holmes (2009) is a twist on typical Action/Adventure movies. It contains brawls and explosions, a vicious villain, and at some point-a beautiful woman in distress like many other action-movies. Although, this story contains much depth and detail that allows the viewer to enter the intrinsic mind of a brilliant, yet unstable detective while he attempts to solve this extraordinary case."

","I wanted to be entertained, and Guy Ritchie came through. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are cast brilliantly! Their lighter, comedic sides bounce smoothly off each other, adding smiles as the mystery is being solved. Some reviewers are unhappy that Sherlock Holmes wasn't portrayed more darkly; my opinion is that if I wanted to see his darker sides, I could go to the History Channel, or whoever might provide that kind of info. I desired, and received, wonderful entertainment -- exactly what the doctor ordered! LeStrade is played very well, and Clarkey is a delight to watch. There are a few flaws, but I seldom see a movie that seems 100% perfect to me, and the minor flaws do not detract enough to change my 'excellent' rating for the movie."
"honorhorror","9","0","2","7 June 2010"," Quite an interesting re-imagination of a classic novel.
","Before seeing Sherlock Holmes, I was warned by a senior friend that Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes went intolerably far from its source material. As a self-respected Holmes fan, I gave up seeing in theater. Luckily enough, I picked it up in HD format several months later, and it gave me a lot positive surprises.<br/><br/>That being said, I've seen quite a few Holmes movies before this blockbuster, and I wasn't too impressed by those poor adaptations just yet. None of them had a Holmes that lived up to the caliber of original novel's spirit. Still, I wasn't expecting a radical re-imagination of that meditatively brilliant role at all; I don't feel the desire to see him on the screen. Maybe that's because all these years the world has had too many super detectives jumping-examining-analyzing on and off the screen. Most recent greatest detective stories all stocked their firepower in the characters instead of the mystery(L.A.Confidential). Will this particular movie which had a bizarre feeling of Iron Man in 19th century (the trailer) do any different? To my surprise, Sherlock Holmes feels very fresh, comical, surreal, yet if there can ever be any performances that really is that inspiring, mind-bending as the title character, it would be Robert Downey Jr. Knowing that it's a Guy Ritchie production, I expected the same magnitude of mischief, mayhem and crude humor like Rock'n Rolla, Snatch, and Lock Stock. But thankfully the final product's efficiency in relating audiences' minds to their loved roles is far better than one can expect, as long as one's not a religious fanatic who believed in everything in Holmes books. So long as you care to know, the story opens with Holmes apprehending a shadowy serial killer whose high profile in the society shocked London, who later turned out to possess the capability to rise from grave, wield black magics and wreck havocs around London and terrorize the public. Holmes had limited time to figure out the opponent's master plan, which also involved far more people than one's imagination......<br/><br/>I guess you can't find a single case in Holmes books that either exactly matches this movie plot or feels totally different. That means the movie's a very brilliant adaptation that gains the strength from both the source material's roots and the screenwriter's originality. It's a story that keeps your brain processing the data just like Holmes himself while also convince you to sit back and enjoy the ride with your popcorn. With no presumption for the plot, fans can find many Eastern eggs and accept the director's goodwill in them. For example, all the scientific devices in the movie had their originality from the books, but the fast pacing hinders you from remembering their exact location in the novels. In terms of characters, although I am not too thrilled to see Holmes having such an obvious soft spot for Irene, all the characters play their parts in the story pretty smooth. Moriaty's involvement in the plot is too obvious to entertain the fans, but luckily the makers were aware of it. I was puzzled by the fact that Downey got a golden globe for the title role before I see this one. Now I've seen it, I can tell you the bottom-line is that no one had been so convincing as well as entertaining in this role. It's worth seeing for that if you don't have another reason.<br/><br/>While supremely sophisticated in Science knowledge and detective technique, Holmes was never so interested in ideology and politics. The makers are insightful enough to get this right in the adaptation, which leaves some key messages to be openly interpreted. After all, it's a story about the whole London in panic for black magics and Satanic villains who claim to be Satanic. It's a Holmes point-of-view to visually reveal the clash between spiritual assumptions and experimental science in the transition of 19th and 20th centuries, and the movie definitely takes Holmes side to criticize or mock universally at religions and spiritual beliefs. In this sense, it's acceptable to see churches having a mental breakdown in the storyline. It's also a remind to me that it's not reality, but Holmes, down to his fictional bone and love-it-or-hate-it roots and ideological notions. After all, Christianity is never really about anything indestructible human can possess or wield, but rather about right way to live your destructible life.

","When I watched that movie in cinema, I was very suspicious.

But then, I watched it and later bought a DVD and watched again, and then I must say - this is a tremendously well-done film! Robert Downey JR has done a great job and his Sherlock is young, vivid, often ferocious, funny and really witty. he embodies that spirit of adventure that he loves so much. And then, there is that old, dirty, smelly, muddy London with gas lamps and filthy streets... The spirit of the time, despite some minor goofs, is depicted here very well.

","Books should not be compared to movies. Movie versions should not be compared to each other. If you are a true artist, you always put your stamp on your production. The stories of Arthur Conan Doyle are masterpieces and they have had their time. If one is willing to come up with a new angle using the characters as perceived by the public, more power to him. There have been hundreds of pastiches done with the Holmes canon. Anyway, the film before us uses a preposterous plot that has angered the purists. It's probably some of the same people who died a little each day after Lord of the Rings and Spiderman came out. This film is a joyful mess in the tradition of Indian Jones. The two principles, Holmes and Watson grow on us and take us on a merry ride through London into some pretty weird stuff. It doesn't matter what has been done before, just enjoy the ride and look to the future. But don't forget the wonderful efforts of Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. They can, indeed, coexist."
"fwomp","9","0","2","16 May 2010"," Holmes As Doyle Wrote Him
","There aren't many movies around that dare to reinvent something both literary and cinematic that is beloved by readers and movie-goers alike, but action director Guy Ritchie has dared in a big way ...and succeeded beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes (A Study in Scarlet, 1887), he made Holmes a roughshod, drug-addled genius with keen deductive powers. This made him a person that lay-readers could identify with. A man with problems, but with unique abilities that were much in demand. Coming off the heels of the Victorian era, too, Holmes was ‚Äì in a very real way ‚Äì a person coming out of that stuffy time period and into the more loose and modern one. Again, something readers of the time could identify with.<br/><br/>Although the books live on in perpetuity, most of the population over the age of 40 are probably more familiar with director Roy Neill's television series starring the estimable Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson (if you're under 40 you're probably hooked on the hit TV series HOUSE M.D. which has more than just a passing familiarity with Doyle's character). Basil recreated the character of Holmes and also cleaned him up quite a bit. No drugs. Clean shaven. A real gentleman. In Doyle's literary works, however, this is far from the case ... which brings us to this new manifestation: the 2009 cinematic work starring Robert Downey Jr. (TROPIC THUNDER) as Holmes and Jude Law (REPO MEN) as Watson.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. is one of our great new actors. He is a chameleon in every sense of the word. Which is why I found his Holmes to be extremely well played. From his migraines to drugging Watson's beloved dog, Downey Jr. truly encompassed everything that Doyle wrote about. He's both brilliant and prone to folly; seeks a new case that's semi-interesting but is just as likely to seek out a new drug to make him feel more interested; and only has eyes for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, THE FAMILY STONE) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.<br/><br/>This film is, hopefully, a reawakening of the Sherlock Holmes mystique; but a reawakening with Doyle's truly flawed character and not some scrubbed clean version. The ending of this movie certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Let's hope that happens.<br/><br/>One final word of warning in case you didn't get what I was saying: this isn't your grandmas Sherlock Holmes. If you want Rathbone, go watch him. If you want Doyle's Holmes, check out Guy Ritchie's newest (and more accurate) interpretation."

"frootjoose","9","0","2","13 May 2010"," Doyle would be proud
","As a movie, Sherlock Holmes is solid; there is action, humor, and excitement to be found. I won't even dwell on that sort of thing, because I'm not qualified. I'll leave that to the movie experts.<br/><br/>But I absolutely must comment on how well this movie captured the essence of A.C. Doyle's masterpiece. I believe that this movie, this plot, is very close to what Doyle might have done if he had tried to create a similar sequel to Hound of the Baskervilles. This movie has all the appearance of a supernatural incident until we get Holmes's unveiling and everything is explained in perfectly ordinary terms. Just like Hound of the Baskervilles.<br/><br/>There were a couple of disappointments I had. I don't think Watson was done very well at all; I've read most of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and cannot recall Watson ever being reluctant to work with Holmes. Whereas in the movie he is so reluctant that Holmes uses his talents to 'trick' Watson into following him. I am also severely annoyed by Adler's portrayal; perhaps it was inevitable that she would be portrayed as a love interest, but I find Doyle's version of her far more compelling. In the canon, she is a fascination, and the fact that Holmes has no romantic interest in her adds to the enigma of his character. In the movie, she is his human weakness, which is infinitely more clich√©.<br/><br/>But these complaints are basically petty. After all, a director is entitled to some reinterpretations of his own. And he did add some very interesting things of his own invention; I absolutely loved the fight scenes where Holmes thought out the steps to victory ahead of time before employing them.<br/><br/>And the fact that you-know-who is involved¬Ö in such a subtle, brilliant, barely noticeable way¬Ö is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>All in all, it is not perfectly in keeping with the canon, but I think it captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes, the overall idea, perfectly.<br/><br/>And, most of all, it made me want to pick up my copy of the Sherlock Holmes anthology and read. And I think that ‚Äì the inspiring to check out further Holmes stories ‚Äì is wonderful.<br/><br/>Kudos."
"brando647","8","0","2","10 May 2010"," Guy Ritchie's Interpretation of a Classic Hero
","Guy Ritchie has reinvented the famed literary sleuth for a new generation, abandoning some of the played-out clich√©s (such as the oft-quoted ""Elementary, my dear Watson"") and amping up the energy with fast pacing and a handful of frenetic action sequences. I've seen a good amount of negativity on the web about this film (who knew there were so many Holmes fanboys out there...) but I really enjoyed it. I've been a fan of Ritchie since LOCK, STOCK, & TWO SMOKING BARRELS and while he's had a few weak projects, I thought this was one of his better. The story finds Watson preparing to move on from his sleuthing days and settle down for marriage, abandoning his partnership with the eccentric Holmes. Their final case together, in which the pair brought the mysterious Lord Blackwood to justice for practicing black magic and committing multiple murders, refuses to remain shut. After his hanging, Lord Blackwood was seen rising from the grave to torment London once again and it falls on Holmes and Watson to get to the bottom of Blackwood's scheme.<br/><br/>Ritchie admits to having been a fan of Holmes since his childhood so I'm sure the man knows more on the subject than myself. I've only ever read one or two of Doyle's stories so I don't have the extensive knowledge on the character. All I know is that I enjoyed the movie, regardless of how well it followed the character's source material. People had shown distaste at the fact that Holmes is portrayed as an action hero in some scenes, rather than the pipe-smoking intellectual most people envision him as, but the original novels did in fact note Holmes hand-to-hand skills. Ritchie has just put them to good use. Keep in mind, despite what the trailers insinuate, this movie isn't what I'd call action-heavy. It has a few key action scenes but it does focus on Holmes and Watson solving the mystery behind Blackwood's supposed magic. This leads to my favorite aspect of the film: Ritchie's depiction of Holmes deductive process. He uses quick jump cuts to lead the audience down Holmes' thought processes and allows us to follow him (including how he uses these skills to determine the best process of incapacitating opponents).<br/><br/>For the most part, the casting in this film was phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr is one of my favorite actors in recent years since his career revival and the man fails to disappoint me. I loved him in his role as the famed sleuth, giving him an amusing eccentric twist. He had great on-screen chemistry with Jude Law (as Watson) and the two gave the partners' relationship a modern bro-mantic vibe, as they squabbled like a couple of teenagers at times. Mark Strong gave an adequate performance as the villain Blackwood, though he really didn't have to do much outside brooding and speaking ominously. Still, despite his limited performance, he was still better than Rachel McAdams. McAdams plays Holmes old flame (and the only person to have outsmarted him...twice) Irene Adler, and she could not have stuck out any worse than she did. Her hammed performance yanked me right out of the movie whenever she was on-screen; what led Ritchie to cast her in the role is beyond me.<br/><br/>The film blasts by and left me more than satisfied at the end. It was a fun popcorn flick with sharp writing and some great action. Despite McAdams bogging it down, SHERLOCK HOLMES is one of the better movies of 2009. Let the fanboys hate on this film for whatever reason but, as long as you watch it with an open mind and understand that the film serves as Guy Ritchie's interpretation of the character and doesn't need to be seen as the ultimate portrayal, it's a fun film and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel."

His portrayal had a humorous side to it. This was refreshing and it worked very well. <br/><br/>Dr Watson, was not presented as he has in the past, he was Holmes' straight man, and not one to be under rated.

","As not a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I watched this movie, and I really entertained. First of all for a detective movie, Guy Ritchie is one of few directors that I can think of. Christopher Nolan (The Prestige) and Neil Burger (The Illusionist) could be the other director choices. Also the script is well written, at the end of the story there are no cracks and you really enjoy when Holmes explains everything at the end of the movie. Fight scenes are not the best but I laughed at some scenes. Robert Downey Jr. did a really good job as Sherlock Holmes. Also Jude Law is a good choice for Dr. Watson. Mark Strong is a charismatic villain and I think he fits this type of characters. Soundtracks are absorbing the fight scenes, and when there is a funny scene again the music changes and it really fits to that funny scene.<br/><br/>Overall, my vote is 8/10."

Maybe it came across as a bit too cartoonish, over the top.<br/><br/>Still, Robert Downey Jr. is good as the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Although I found that he tried a bit too hard to sound authentic British and some of his mumbling was difficult to understand.<br/><br/>Jude Law was his faithful assistant Dr. John Watson, and their partnership on screen worked well, I thought.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, thief and love interest of Holmes', was a nice addition.<br/><br/>Mark Strong is an actor that I am not particularly familiar with, although I now realize I have seen some movies he was in, but here he is excellent as Lord Blackwood, who it seems is using ancient magic to gain power. His ambition is high, to eventually re-take that colony, now known as the USA.<br/><br/>The story devolves into Holmes and Watson figuring out how to defeat Blackwood and to stem the tide of killings Blackwood is responsible for.<br/><br/>The film used an editing technique that really added something. Holmes was, among other things, an expert at fighting. So a couple of times when he was about to pull some fast-action fighting moves we saw in very slow motion what he was about to do, as it was described in his own voice, then we saw the actual moves in fast motion.

","Since I like Robert Downey Jr. so much (especially his post-recovery incarnation), I had to exercise a bit of self-control in keeping my rating to a more modest 7 stars rather than an immodest 8 stars.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has directed a solid film featuring a vision of Holmes that adheres to Arthur Conan Doyle's original vision: brilliant, eccentric, unkempt, and erratic. But unlike Billy Wilder with /The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes/(1970), Ritchie -- perhaps out of respect for Downey Jr's real-life recovery -- is reticent about one aspect of the famous detective's personality: his penchant for recreational drugs. <br/><br/>The movie has a pretty good -- if also pretty predictable -- story-line centered on exposing the occult, i.e., the revealing of things hidden. The appeal of the Holmes genre is not the surprise plot twist (after all, if one is constantly expecting a plot twist, then one can hardly call it a surprise when the next plot twist turns up). Instead, the appeal of the books and films lies in the satisfaction received from learning just how Sherlock deduces the truth behind each and every mystery. That Downey Jr.'s Holmes gets to the truth in elementary fashion is certainly part of the appeal of this film.<br/><br/>Still more appealing is the way in which Downey Jr. conveys the conflicting emotions that underlie Sherlock's stiff upper lip. Even though the film follows a narrative arc that requires no character depth or development, Downey Jr. provides both. The same cannot be said for Jude Law's Dr. Watson, but that's not Law's fault: the film (as with the entire genre) is not about Dr. Watson, after all. In fact, Law does a fine job in the supporting role.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Rachel McAdams is miscast in the role of femme fatale, unable to hold her own in matching Downey Jr.s considerable acting chops. As for the antagonists, none are compelling, with the main villain, Lord Blackwood -- a sort of watered-down Anton LaVey -- being the least compelling of all. Fortunately, Blackwood won't be a main character in the sequel; let's hope the same is true for McAdams.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most significant accomplishment of this latest addition to the Sherlock Holmes movie corpus is the way in which it captures London in the last decades of the 1800's. With the Tower Bridge (in the process of being built) serving as both backdrop and stage, the viewer's vicarious experience of Victorian-era England rivals that of any cinematized Jane Austen novel."

","Yet another quintessential character has been dispensed through the blockbuster factory, resulting as a cutting-edge bionic man. As he is always inclined to do, Guy Ritchie saturates his biggest movie to date with stylish visuals and exaggerated characters, and a death-defying scramble atop Tower Bridge, which is unfinished. It's great for today's action fans, as well as the same 12- and 13-year-old boys we were when we first saw Lock, Stock and Snatch. This hugely liberty-taking extravaganza achieves the exotic state-of-the-art tradition of full-energy action and preposterous CGI, and Holmes and Watson do their best to adjust. Holmes discards the hat and pipe, and Watson has resolved at long last to leave the ironic harmony of Holmes' digs for the perils of married life.<br/><br/>Holmes, way more than James Bond, Batman, Tom Ripley and the characters of Shakespeare, has endured innumerable portrayals. Robert Downey Jr., who is not the most insignificant of these. Downey's Holmes is both less restrained and in better physical shape than past personifications. Holmes' accepted fondness for cocaine is here increased by other drugs and lots of alcohol. However Holmes has the physique of a vigorous gymnast, the precision of an acrobat and the fisticuffs of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. He and Watson bounce effortlessly into action like Batman and Robin.<br/><br/>In the opening sequence, the two barge forth upon the diabolical satanist Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, a great actor, great at playing villains, who here is at his most awkward. They arrive as he is performing a despicable deed, and he is sent to the gallows and enclosed in his tomb, just to return evidently not dead. This mobilizes not as much of a line of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills as a succession of martial arts and mass destruction tableaux in the streets of London, which have never appeared more doomed, cloudy and foreboding. I had the feeling the Hughes brothers were filming From Hell on the other side of the block. Now I will concede that there is a particularly awesome classic-Ritchie moment that merges Holmes' masterful deduction and whiplash pugilism, super slo-mo and voice-over taking us through his logical steps of incapacitating a fight opponent, followed by a sudden blur of motion where all of that is executed. High point of the movie.<br/><br/>After the first capture of Blackwood, Holmes retires to his abode. In recognized Sherlock lore, this is usually described as ""a period of study,"" inferring cocaine and opium fantasies. In Ritchie's version, he ravages his rooms like an inebriated coed, merely just missing old pizza boxes. This will not do. Supposedly, Sherlock is chiefly meticulous. At any rate, Blackwood's revival is just the sort of mystifying black magic front one does expect from a Holmes story, and it gives him a new inducement of life.<br/><br/>There is also concern for two women: Rachel McAdams playing the Holmes character alleged to be the sole woman to ever reach Holmes' soft spot, and Kelly Reilly playing Watson's betrothed, who may be in for more than she realizes. The dawn of Mary on the scene throws Holmes into bitter outbursts: How dare the doctor favor a woman over his own scintillating companionship? Watson has invariably assumed proper domain elsewhere, but in this film, the intimate habitat of Holmes' place make his other rooms appear more than ever like a front.<br/><br/>The Conan Doyle stories are still read, and likely will be forever. Most readers get to one or two. But among moviegoers of the 09-10 winter season, not so many seem likely. But it seemed to me the majority of us were nonetheless amused for a couple of hours, including myself. Ritchie, his writers and Warner Bros. simply appear to be chiefly concerned with action. That, they unfortunately believe, is all that gets young audiences into theaters today. If that's all they give them, they're going to be correct in time anyway. However, the master of deduction, who has endured so much, can surely bear with some explosions and kung fu."

","The most famous sleuth in all of literature is back. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is the latest movie to feature the brilliant detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/><br/>At the opening of the picture, Sherlock and his assistant Dr. Watson are in pursuit of Lord Blackwood, a man who is involved in black magic. He has murdered five people, and is on the verge of claiming another victim before Holmes and Watson come to the rescue. Lord Blackwood is arrested and sent to jail.<br/><br/>A couple of months later, Watson is set to move out of 221B Baker Street and get married. Holmes is in a disheveled state, which is apparently normal for him in between cases. Lord Blackwood, who is sentenced to die, calls for Holmes. Reaching Blackwood's jail cell, Holmes listens as Blackwood tells him that he will return from the grave and kill again, and will change the existence of society, and Holmes will be powerless to do anything. Holmes departs, Blackwood is hanged later that day, and is pronounced dead by Watson.<br/><br/>Soon after, Irene Adler, who is both a criminal and woman that Sherlock has had an interest in for some time, comes to visit. She asks Holmes to find a man named Reordan. After she leaves, he follows her in disguise, and finds out that she is working for somebody, but does not know who it is.<br/><br/>Holmes and Watson are called to the graveyard, where Lord Blackwood's crypt has been destroyed. A man says he saw Blackwood rise from his tomb earlier that day. The police bring the casket out into the open, and when the lid is opened, they find that Reordan is inside. Holmes sets out to determine what is going on.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. has fun playing Sherlock, and it shows. Jude Law is also good as Watson, and Rachel McAdams gives a fine performance as Irene.<br/><br/>Something else I liked about this movie is that the screenwriters, Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg, made the film like one of Conan Doyle's stories. If any of you have ever read a Holmes mystery, you'll know what I mean. Visual effects fans will not be disappointed with this, either. The effects are good.<br/><br/>Whether you are a Holmes fan, or looking for a movie in the mystery genre, watch this one. It's good."

","This film is action-packed, fast paced and very well acted. The chemistry between Robert Downing Jr. and Jude Law was on point and their scenes just flowed effortlessly as a result of this. The visuals were awesome, especially during the fight sequences. Rachael McAdams was horribly miscast as the femme fatale but thankfully you would not pay too much attention to her struggling to keep up with the likes of exceptional actors within the film because they all cover for her inability to handle her scenes or accent properly. Hans Matheson is always a delight to watch (he does a supporting role in the film) and Guy Ritchie has proved yet again that nobody does action-drama (especially fight scenes) better than him."

","Before thiz newest version, there were about 200 movies that brought Sherlock into the wide screen and more than 70 Actors had ever played thiz famous character. Sherlock Holmes is a well-known detective on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels (Which first time is published in 1887). Sherlock on thiz movie is Robert ""Iron Man"" Downey Jr., accompanied by his fellow side-kick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). The other Cast members are Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong. At a glance, Downey Jr. doesn't seem to care how to perform Sherlock authentically. Otherwise, he just acts naturally with his own style and just has fun with his version of Sherlock. As we know, Sherlock is a calm, discreet and charismatic person. But in the end, I think viewers will also agree to put aside the original Sherlock for a while, because thiz version is surprisingly enjoyable. In overall, the movie is entertaining enough and hilarious at the same time. The Director is Guy Ritchie. Ritchie is previously known as indie Director, his best works are ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000). The storyline of thiz movie is kind of exciting at the beginning, a little lame in the middle, and it's closed by an appropriate twist of ending. After watching thiz movie, it comes to my mind, Downey Jr's version of Sherlock resembles with Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" (1999). But we have to admit that thiz movie is way more mature.

Heading into this, expecting to watch something similar to older Sherlock Holmes movies ... well, let's just say, the chances for you to get disappointed, are much higher! <br/><br/>While I'm not entirely aware of the complete Holmes universe, I can say that movies have branded an image of Mr. Holmes into my mind, that is quite different than the Robert Downey Jr. one ... Guy Ritchie points out, that he is truer to the source material (the books) by his depictions of Holmes and Watson. Watson being also quite different, from the simple ""side-kick"" that he was, into being Jude Law in this one!<br/><br/>Depending on how well you can cope with those changes and with the fact, that this is a thrill ride, it's up to you, how much you can and will enjoy this movie. Robert Downey is amazing as always and the chemistry between him and Jude Law is pitch-perfect.

I echo the London Evening Standard's review - Holmes has never been better. Kudos to Jude Law, I've never been a big fan of his but he excels as Watson the the chemistry between Watson and Holmes was worth the entrance fee alone.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly standard, and has been done before, but its the sheer joy of watching such excellent performances which makes this a winning film.

Dr. Watson is planning on moving and marrying lovely girl named Mary. Rachel McAdams plays a pivotal role in this story. There are a few funny scenes like Holmes waking up naked and cuffed by the scared maid and the bantering between Holmes and Watson whose relationship is never really explained. They say goodbye to notorious killer Lord Blackwood who is executed and promised to have three more dead. The script here needs some work and some of the stuff like Holmes' brilliance is hard to digest but it's an enjoyable adventure of a film.

"lediscipledessocrates","8","0","1","3 March 2010"," Presenting.......Sherlock Holmes by Guy Ritchie
","Sherlock Holmes is one fictional character which has been regularly portrayed on the wide screen . And though the current version may not rank among my favourites it is not by any means ordinary. Holmes has been given a new and refreshing look by the director . In fact all those who are acquainted with the novels would concur that what Ritchie has done is too simply bring to light the till now downplayed aspects of Holmes personality viz..his remarkable combat skills and other such muscular attributes.Almost everybody has this image of Holmes being a lean fellow with a magnifying glass in one hand and a smoking pipe in another. Ritchie has tries to expose the strength behind the lean body structure and does not shy away from including scenes where Holmes fighting skills are the sole object of attention.<br/><br/>Moving forward , it was nice to see Jude Law as Dr. Watson. <br/><br/>The screenplay is for me the most interesting part of this feature. For some the whole tone of the movie was divorced from the essence of Holmes. A bit too loud too violent too exuberant and fanciful some said. Many were expecting the movie to be an emulator of the TV series produced in the preceding decades. For me the movie was a welcome aberration and deviation from the type cast image of Holmes . OK, I agree that the director failed to study Holmes as far as some aspects were concerned and that some sequences bore a striking resemblance with the action flicks of today, but what is wrong in that? I believe a movie should represent the best of it's age and not be a second rate reproduction of the by-gone era.<br/><br/>It is true that the movie's brilliance sunk in as time progressed and almost a week after I had watched it did I fully understand the nature of Ritchie's accomplishment.<br/><br/>For the tight script, good performances and the unique Colour given to Holmes and his train by the director I rate it highly."

","Actually, I got two motivations for this movie: <br/><br/>First, RDJR : he got my vote since ""Iron Man"" and coming from his painful private life, I like his attitude of having seen the devil and not care! <br/><br/>Next: Victorian London: for ages, I am attracted by this city in that time and can't really explain the reason except that my family building has flavor of that. My Christmas experience with ""Scrooge"" has been terrible, so I expected much of this one.<br/><br/>Besides this, I knew nothing of this movie and for me, Holmes was essentially a boring Japanese cartoon depicted as a fox. <br/><br/>That's why I came really surprised by it. Right at the opening credits, I enjoyed it: music, cast, sets, wardrobe, screenplay, everything was amazing. It was great to see again the ""Notebook"" heroin and the bad guy is totally convincing with his Andy Garcia look-alike.<br/><br/>I haven't keep in mind how he was deductive. Here, his solving skills are a bit robotic but has a tremendous impact. As a detective, the plot he has to solve is really imaginative and Sir Conan Doyle would have approved. But I admit to be a bit dumb being unable to guess the mysterious boss behind all this. I really like the old London because you can see the most incredible wealth being close to tremendous poverty.<br/><br/>For the fun, I played Holmes leaving the theater. Near my place, I found a scarf. Remembering the couple sited besides me, I look for them and found them at the toilets. ""I think this belongs to you"" ""Sorry but No"". What a shame for Holmes Jr!"

","Much like Fantastic Mr. Fox bears its traits of Wes Anderson, Sherlock Holmes has its fair share of Guy Ritchie characteristics. Ritchie, who is known for British films such as Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, boldly constructs this film in a much more action-way than the readers of Sherlock Holmes books are probably familiar with. Ritchie feels right at home as he crafts out the story, which features top-notch performances from Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as Watson. The film has the right ingredients as it is the perfect blend of action, mystery and comedy. Nearly every aspect of Sherlock Holmes was put together properly and matched the feeling of the story. The dialogue, especially the back-and-fourths between Holmes and Watson are intelligent, witty, and well-written. The editing and style in which it was shot completely emphasize the action of the film, which draw in the audiences full attention. The film moves rather quickly, which can be attributed to many different things such as rapid dialogue, stealthy movements of the actors to the scene length. The movie also captures the England, mid-1860's feeling perfectly. As a final note, Rachel McAdams was most definitely out of place. Her sex appeal can only carry the role so far and while her physical acting is a plus (speaking of styles of acting...Downey reigns supreme in this film as his acting, from his quick retorts to his body language to the look on his face right after Watson saves him from being crushed by a mill-type object is flawless) she simply doesn't have the right voice for the role. By no means is it McAdams' fault, nor do I think she was miscast...I simply believe her voice just didn't do the character justice. All in all, Sherlock Holmes is a gritty, action-packed, wild ride that features some very strong performances and great directing from Ritchie."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","2","7 February 2010"," Where is the short cut between Westminster palace and Tower Bridge?
","Sherlock Holmes has been so standardized that this new film is absolutely thrilling and fascinating. Of course we can look at it as a ""touristic"" guide to 19th century London, with mud, crime, squalor, bleakness, and it is true little of the top class or upper society. This London has been shown very often from Oliver Twist to Dracula or Elephant Man. But that is definitely not the main interest of this film. Then there is the fight against crime. There are two types of criminals. Lord Blackwood who is trying with a secret society that believes in human sacrifice to frighten the populace to establish the fascist rule of the upper class who wants to reestablish a total and absolute centralized power that has never existed in England anyway. And then there is the scientific crime that tries to transform crime into a fine art, the eighth fine art of this world but whose objective is only stealing and getting all the most beautiful stones, gems and the biggest piles of money they can, but with the beauty of a wizard. Lord Blackwood is another Voldemort and in a way Irene Adler and her boss are criminalized Harry and Hermione Potter. But that is of little interest except that it creates a phenomenal action. What is most important here is the relation between Dr Watson and Sherlock Holmes, a full and absolute homo-friendship. They cannot live without each other. They cannot even survive without each other. They realize that homo-friendship in their action against crime. But the film is extremely clear and careful to show that this is only a friendship between two souls and that the only male element in that friendship in the male action, and by male I mean violent and disruptive, physical and muscular. And the film shows how these two men are obsessed each one by a particular woman. Dr Watson will be able to satisfy his sexual hunger by marrying his Mary, but she will have to become the go-between of the two men. She will have to bring her husband, soul and mind tied up, at the feet of Sherlock Holmes for one more batch or episode of adventure every so often. Dr Watson can love Mary only if he can love Sherlock Holmes and take part in his capers and adventures. On the other hand Sherlock Holmes can only survive in this life if he is chasing his own love in the person of Irene Adler and sexual contact can only be submissive on Sherlock Holmes' side. Irene will take advantage of him sexually when he has been reduced to passivity by some kind of soporific drug and Sherlock Holmes loves it and he will go on running after her and he will only get the satisfaction of holding her tight to prevent her from being cut in two lengthwise by a belt saw. That's only utilitarian physical contact whose sexual dimension has been evacuated by the danger. And the key to his liberation is under the cushion for sure but he is handcuffed to the bed and as nude as a new born baby with all his hairs standing up on their roots when the chamber maid arrives. This homo-friendship is exactly what Walt Whitman described so well in his poetry, particularly in his Calamus songs. The attraction between two men that makes them partners in life for some active and material objective with no sexual dimension and with two women around them who are making them dream of sex and run after their skirts but who have to bring them together regularly for their sexual energy to be reloaded by some adventure against some criminal, like Moriarty. Beautiful modern film that is talking to us of the emotional relations between people, man and man, woman and woman, man and woman, woman and man, in a very harsh world slowly edging towards fascism but always avoiding this deadly end. The most extreme advocate of eugenics and social Darwinism was H.G. Wells at the end of the 20th century: the only non Caucasian whites who were tolerated were the Jews provided their intermarried, and all alcoholics, mentally and physically handicapped people had to be gotten rid of. Hitler was only different from that objective as fort his position about the Jews. That's the society that is reflected in this film but from an iconoclastic point of view that is praising emotional relations between beings as founded on nothing rational, just love. And don't forget you can and must love your worst enemy.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr√É¬©teil, CEGID"

","Sherlock Holmes has been played more times by more different actors than almost any other role, and director Guy Ritchie has tackled the job of revitalizing and revisioning Conan Doyle's famous detective for the Harry Potter generation with this mostly successful and diverting entertainment. In the first five minutes of the movie, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson manage to capture an English Lord who has taken up the Black Arts as part of a sinister grab for supreme political power in Victorian England. And the arrest and even hanging of the sorcerer does nothing to slow down the timetable of his master scheme. Holmes himself, as conceived by the writers and portrayed by Downey Jr., is almost the anti-Basil Rathbone: slobbish, obsessed and substance abusing, barely able to contain let alone find outlet for his vast interests and towering intellect. Unlike the dapper, arch and self-assured Rathbone, Downey Jr. is perpetually down at heels and on the verge of emotional melt-down, whipsawing between scientific experimentation and chasing criminals, and finding occasional release in back-alley bare-knuckle brawling and jags of drunkenness. It is a daring and interesting re-conception of one of the most familiar figures in literature and this portrait of Holmes is odd enough alone to keep the audience diverted while the central criminal plot unfolds. Holmes' world is dirty, fog-bound and grim to the point of being near monochromatic, a far cry from the usually spotless, glamorized Hollywood image of gas-lit London. Unexpected and recommended viewing."

","One of the non-significant Guy Ritchie's movies. You'll have to do better than that.<br/><br/>Very far from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, far from Snatch. Better than Revolver, which means it's not a complete failure.<br/><br/>Plot? Not bad. Humor? Below average of his movies. Characters? Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. are very good. I am glad the director finally decided to be more creative than just spending a life being a husband to a trophy wife (what a waste of talent; no offense, Madonna, you never had any talent, just overblown gender-related impulsiveness).<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie will never be THE Sherlock Holmes movie, like Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of the Rings captivated fans of the books."

","The 2009 Sherlock Holmes has nothing in common with the Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This one is a an who likes women, liquor and street fights and uses his abilities for his own benefit. Directed by Guy Ritchie, his view of the movie is quite dark, full of action and adventure and with a bit of humor. It has a fast paced rhythm which makes the movie pretty enjoyable. The landscapes are very good, you really feel like watching a 1800's London and the costume design is also very convincing. The story located around the XIX century, shows us detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England, is interesting, with a little changes from the original Conan Doyle's novel but just for the benefit of the movie and the plot is very well developed. The cast is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes is brilliant, definitely this role was made for him. Jude Law is Dr. Watson, his performance is impeccable. Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler is quite good and Mark Strong in the role of Lord Blackwood was convincing enough. To conclude, Sherlock Holmes is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie, worthy in every aspect and fully recommendable."
"moviewizguy","8","0","1","23 January 2010"," Nothing Escapes Him
","In a dynamic new portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous characters, SHERLOCK HOLMES sends Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson on their latest challenge. Revealing fighting skills as lethal as his legendary intellect, Holmes will battle as never before to bring down a new nemesis and unravel a deadly plot that could destroy the country.<br/><br/>It embarrasses me to say that I have not read the original series of novels of Sherlock Holmes nor have I seen the most well known TV shows or movies. However, I did see a cartoon series on Holmes when I was a little kid, so I know the basic gist of the characters of Holmes and Watson.<br/><br/>This adaptation of one of the most well known characters in human history is quite good, I must say. Director Guy Ritchie reinvents Holmes as a more masculine character who knows how to do martial arts. While this may bother the die hard fans out there, I think it's quite fresh and appropriate to our 21st Century society. On top of that, it's obvious Warner Bros. was trying to appeal to the teenage audience as well as the fans. But overall, I think Ritchie's style gives the film a more hip and eccentric vibe.<br/><br/>However, what makes this movie successful at what it does is the actors. Robert Downey's Holmes is quite fantastic. The fact that Holmes pays attention to every detail and calculates almost every action that occurs and, at times, without the audiences even knowing it, is what made me love this character. It also helps that Robert Downey and Jude Law have great chemistry. They play off their dialogue so well that I just have to smile. Jude Law is the perfect sidekick. Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong are also great, although the latter is sorely underused.<br/><br/>The visual style of the film is very pretty to look at. From the visual effects to the production design to the wardrobe to the attention of certain colors used in scenes, SHERLOCK HOLMES arguably succeeds in every category. Han Zimmer's soundtrack is also very unique, the main theme diverting from your usual orchestral playing.<br/><br/>Maybe the one problem about the film is the script and plot. It needs a bit of work because the more you think about the story, the more plot inconsistencies you find. However, as a mindless fun film, it succeeds in doing just that. It's entertaining from beginning to end mainly because of the strong cast and director Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's not the greatest film of all time but it sure is wildly entertaining for what it is."

Sometimes the explanation of the ""puzzle and mysteries"" are complex, but reflect the style and character of Holmes.

"ackstasis","7","0","1","22 January 2010"," ""In another life, Mr Holmes, you would have made a great criminal""
","I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan; not quite enough to be a Baker Street Irregular, but I consider Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories to be among the best entertainment that literature has to offer, and Holmes to be one of the medium's most memorable creations. Upon hearing that Guy Ritchie would helm the latest Sherlock Holmes adaptation, my first reaction was that of trepidation. Though I did enjoy 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' I couldn't quite see Ritchie's style being suitable for the material. My concerns were well- grounded, but overstated. 'Sherlock Holmes (2009)' has extremely little to do with Conan Doyle's original prose, but, considered simply as an action movie set in the nineteenth century, the film manages to be a lot of fun. After all, Holmes has seen worse injustices bestowed upon him: let's not forget that Basil Rathbone's Universal films were set in the modern day, and recast Holmes as a Nazi-fighting spy!<br/><br/>The year is 1891, and London lives in fear. Aristocrat Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) has been murdering women in grotesque rituals of human sacrifice. Even following his capture by Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr Watson (Jude Law), the sinister Blackwood pledges to return, even after death, to continue his work. Uncharacteristically for a Sherlock Holmes story, Ritchie's film relies very strongly on a sense of the supernatural: its screenplay, to me, more closely resembled Agatha Christie's ""The Pale Horse,"" in which supernatural happenings are cunningly simulated by purely rational means. This clever device may be deliberately denouncing Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism, which, in his declining years, gained prominence in such novels as ""The Land of Mist (1926)."" Despite the protests of close friend Harry Houdini, Conan Doyle remained a vocal exponent of spiritualism for the remainder of his life. Perhaps the great author, as Holmes might have suggested, should have taken greater note of the details."

"pyrocitor","8","0","2","21 January 2010"," While it may not think (or detect) as hard as it thwacks, the cheeky sense of thrills and fun makes Ritchie's Holmes a delight nonetheless
","From the moment of its conception, Guy Ritchie's self-declared 'rough and tough' take on the world's most famous detective has been no stranger to controversy. Between its casting of an American as Arthur Conan Doyle's timeless character to the reimagining of the decidedly cerebral series as a vehicle for comedy action, sidelining the mystery and sleuthing facets, it has seemed that the film's publicity has been fated to devoting as much time to justifying itself as promoting. Nonetheless, while debates regarding the film's action slant remain largely a matter of personal taste, there can be little question that, if taken as is, Ritchie's film offers a tremendous concoction of qualities seldom before associated with a Holmes film: a fast paced, tastefully witty and exhilarating bundle of thrills and dashes of mystery, whose greatest strength (unlike most of its predecessors) is its refusal to take itself overly seriously, instead opting for a welcome, freewheeling sense of fun.<br/><br/>That the film is hardly as profound as it could be is unmistakable, and it is true that the oversimplified plot could easily have merited from an infusion of much more mystery and complexity, with most plot twists being largely predictable and the climactic wrap-up becoming a bit silly, lost in a mess of pseudo-scientific jargon and Deus-Ex-Machina (as well as a sequel-baiting teaser ending what somewhat oafishly apes Batman Begins' more tasteful finish). Nonetheless, it is hardly the case that the film has no brain to back up its brawn, as the screenplay, while offering the odd contrived patch, deftly winds the action together with skill and class, underpinning the central narrative with intriguing thematic veins involving the onset of industrialization and the 'new age' of London nearing the turn of the century. There is even a feasible justification for the inclusion of the gleefully vicious fight scenes and elaborate choreography through the ingenious touch of Holmes logically planning out each move in the ensuing fight through voice-over, making the gruesome mayhem which follows feel appropriate rather than superficial.<br/><br/>Of course any film directed by Guy Ritchie could hardly be found to be lacking on the style front, and despite Sherlock Holmes being easily his most mainstream effort to date, his characteristic flair is not lost in the transition. Ritchie's 19th century London is a gorgeously gloomy and murky creation, with each cobblestone street and seedy alley dripping with Gothic ambiance. Ritchie similarly shows a distinct skill in pacing, astutely abstaining from any clunky, unnecessary character introductions and instead plunging the audience straight into the action and keeping the pace brisk throughout while allowing for plenty of quieter (and often amusing) character moments in between pulsing action sequences. Capped by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer's plucky and energetic musical score which excellently compliments the overall tone, the quality components amassed make the film, simplistic or not, feel far more than a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is clear that the heart of the film lies with the incomparable Robert Downey Jr. as the titular detective and Jude Law as his stoic partner Watson. Apart from pitch perfect, charismatic characterizations (superbly counterbalancing Holmes' flamboyant eccentricities with Watson's icy sarcasm and composure), the two demonstrate the most hugely enjoyable interplay and 'buddy-banter' seen in ages, and their interplay alone makes the film worth a watch. Unfortunately Rachel McAdams falls below par, her disappointingly flat performance lacking the necessary venom or sultry spark to make her femme fatale Irene Adler function, let alone come across as convincing as an adversary for Holmes (especially considering Downey Jr.'s typically grandiose and nuanced work in comparison). In contrast, Mark Strong is effectively spectral as occult-dabbling aristocrat Lord Blackwood, and while his character may feel underused, Strong hisses and looms his way into a memorable presence nonetheless. Finally, Eddie Marsan glowers with typical class as perpetual foil Inspector Lestrade.<br/><br/>While the film may not do too much in the way of taxing the viewer's intellect nor offer much of a mystery akin to Conan Doyle's classics, there remains an elusive something about the sight of Downey Jr. whimsically plucking a violin, piecing together abstract elements into a cohesive narrative while greeted by Law's world-weary frown that nonetheless leaves the viewer with a firm sense of the essence of the classic detective tales remaining intact, albeit with a scrappy sense of humour, thrills and self-effacing fun. In fact, Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes feels somehow appropriately attuned to the concerns of the time of its release: somewhat under-thought but reflective nonetheless, all the while rapidly propelling itself along and shooting for enjoyment rather than long term resonance. But with enjoyment of such a high class, seasoned calibre, it is resoundingly hard to object, and Ritchie's film accomplishes its goal of unabashed entertainment with undeniable success.<br/><br/>-8/10"

"jantoniou","7","0","5","16 January 2010"," Fun, a tad escapist yet ultimately an entertaining reward
","Wherever you may fault Guy Ritchie's take on ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic portrayal of the title character, and Jude Law's sharp and funny portrayal of Holmes' partner Watson, this is, to be sure, a fine bit of movie-making.<br/><br/>Capturing, rather well I thought, 19th Century England, with all its dark corners and muddy streets and saucy personas and the bland, monochromatic nature of its buildings and spaces, Ritchie has, at the very least, shown he has a sure hand as a director. The action, the slow-motion replays (before they play, if that makes sense) of Holmes' lightning-quick thought process, and what I thought was a subtle take on Holmes' genius, ultimately makes ""Sherlock Holmes"" a highly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Those looking for the high-brow sophistication, the dry wit, the tweed coats, the deerstalker hats, the aquiline noses of the Basil Rathbones of yore best look elsewhere. Downey, out of necessity, is by no means an ""English"" Holmes, though he hacks an accent away as best he can and what he lacks for in pure Anglo splendor makes up for, as he often does, in raw charisma. Even Holmes' famous pipe is almost an afterthought here. Downey and Ritchie are clearly staking out new territory quite apart from the traditional portrayals of Sherlock Holmes, probably much to the chagrin of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's purists.<br/><br/>It's hard to talk much about the plot without giving too much away, but there is certainly some guessing up to the end. It's an involving story line, pretty fun, and Holmes and Watson (and Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler) get into their share of scraps, scrapes, and near-death experiences.<br/><br/>I am accustomed to seeing Jude Law as the leading man, but here he is at least a match to Downey as Dr. John Watson, a man quite unable to tear himself from his partner's adventures. He is funny, a little reckless, but trying to reign himself in for marriage's sake.<br/><br/>McAdams is substantially out of her depth - it would have been better had they chosen a spry English actress to take on the role of Irene Adler here - but perhaps she got the role because Adler is supposed to be an American (? - sorry I don't know the Holmes' canon that well) - or perhaps they didn't want Downey to get lonely on the set. In any case, her looks carry her certainly but her acting feels mostly one dimensional. She feels lost in the costume and setting and cannot come close to matching Downey's and Law's on-screen presence.<br/><br/>There are a host of great English actors taking to various roles, but Mark Strong's portrayal of the evil Lord Blackwood is probably the best. He has a highly tuned and carefully contrived persona, conditioned by his invention of himself as a character within a character. I found it almost entrancing at times.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes"" is true fun, an enjoyable movie treat, and more than likely to become yet another movie franchise for Downey to lead. Go see it."
"deacon_blues-3","10","0","2","15 January 2010"," No $hit, $herlock!
","Best Holmes I've seen, period. Finally, a version that isn't stuck touring the studies, libraries, and drawing rooms of Great Britain! And no silly hat or spyglass! Holmes was never meant to be some prim, cerebral stick-in-the-mud. He was always written as an edgy, obsessive, undisciplined genius with a tinge of a dark side. That is exactly how Downey captures him. I loved the martial art techniques, they seemed like just something as original as is worthy of the character. Let's not forget, Holmes is not a real person, and no actual human could ever be Sherlock Holmes. He's always just a little superhuman, in a very subtle way. Also remember that we are not yet in the mature range of Holmes' career. Moriarity is merely a shadow on the fringe of the story. I would expect at least 3-4 sequels to this film. If I've been forced to snore through umpteen Basil Rathbone and bumbling Nigel Bruce flicks over the years, surely this version deserves its set of sequels. (Actually, my favorite Holmes before this one was always Peter Cushing, who did not make enough films as Holmes, in my opinion.)"
"JimD73","6","0","4","13 January 2010"," Great setup, but unsatisfying
","To say Sherlock Holmes had high expectations is an understatement. Lets face it, Guy Ritche post-RocknRolla directing Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, along with his pet actor (and sole reason to watch Revolver) Mark Strong, not to mention Rachel McAdams. So when Holmes wound up being merely good, it was really easy to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Holmes takes on a more book-accurate version, which is great. Holmes is far from stable, an eccentric nutbag, although brilliant (its easy to see that House was based off this version of Sherlock). The biggest difference is Dr. Watson, who, by being played by Jude Law, is immediately obviously not the bumbling fatman following Holmes as one might expect. Instead, he's competent and possibly the only one able to save Holmes from himself.<br/><br/>The pair soon finds themselves in the middle of a mystery and Lord Blackwood (Strong), a villainous leader of a cult group, seemingly comes back from the dead and begins offing his cult elders, who all believe in some heebie-jeebie stuff the movies takes way to seriously and is only able to explain through outlandish means. Strong has proved himself a good actor, but fails as the villain, not using his screen presence as much as he could.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams also appears as Holmes' long-lost love interest and femme fatale, although she eventually must take on the damsel in distress role. She perhaps lacks some of the more direct sex appeal, but is nonetheless effective in the role.<br/><br/>As for the main pair, they are both played excellent. Robert Downey Jr is possibly the best possible actor to play an eccentric like Holmes, and Law complements him very well.<br/><br/>The movie has many more action setpieces than one might expect from the title, but alas, they are there. And they are quite good, especially when they invoke a certain monstorous mook. Ritchie directs them with plenty of kinetic energy without getting too Bourne-ish, but they do sometimes go too far over the top.<br/><br/>In all, Holmes is an entertaining but unsatisfying end-of-year action flick. It desperately wants a sequel, which I hope it gets simply because there is lots of potential. Here's hoping Ritchie utilises it more next time."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","0","4","14 January 2010"," Downey and Law hold this film together
","Robert Downey, Jr., if there was ever a story of comeback, this man has the ultimate life to tell anyone. 2008 was his year and now he's knocking everyone dead again in 2009. We end the year with his sure to be a hit movie, Sherlock Holmes. One of the world's most famous detectives and most beloved adventurous stories to hit the big screen. Which I still think that The Great Mouse Detective is my favorite Sherlock Holmes story(or homage if you will). See, Sherlock Holmes had an incredible amount of potential that could have either made it one of the funnest movies of the year or even an Oscar contender. Unfortunately, I wasn't as thrilled as I thought I would be. For one, it was a bit too long running at 130 minutes, it's a little slow paced at times and you just loose track of the story. Also while Robert and Jude have a great on screen chemistry to work this incredible friendship, along comes Rachel McAdams. Don't get me wrong, I like the girl, she's a decent actress, but I have no idea what she's doing in this film. Her character is essential, but I don't think this was her role. Guy Ritchie, this is definitely a step up from his previous films that he's directed, I wish this could've been a home run in movies for him because I think he does have a great talent, but Sherlock Holmes did turn into a disappointment.<br/><br/>In 1891 London, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson race to prevent a human sacrifice ritual conducted by Lord Blackwood. Holmes and Watson stop the sacrifice just in time and neutralize Lord Blackwood, after which the police arrive and arrest him. Blackwood's execution occurs three months later, during which Holmes has become bored without a new case. Holmes is re-acquainted with Irene Adler. She offers him a sum of money to pursue a case of a missing red-haired midget by the name of Reardon. Holmes disguises himself to find the identity of Adler's employer, but can only surmise him as a professor. Three days after Blackwood's execution, his tomb is found shattered, from the inside out, and an eyewitness reports seeing Blackwood walking away. Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade find Blackwood's coffin contains the body of the red-haired midget. As Holmes and Watson investigate, the two senior members are killed through apparent magical means by Blackwood, and he assumes control of the order, desiring to use the Order's power to push for England to retake the United States.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, it's by no means a bad movie and is definitely worth the watch, but I think I could have waited for the rental. Maybe I was expecting a bit too much from the film, but from the trailer I was pumped to see this movie. Personally I would've liked to see more of the friendship between Robert and Jude, they were really great on screen together and always come in with adventure and a good laugh. Mark Strong makes a good villain as Lord Blackwood, but once again, his character has no depth really and doesn't give me the chills like Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons would have in a film like this. But who knows, I'm not a casting director. I probably will watch this film once again as some of my friends wanted to see it and will probably rent it one night for us all to watch, I might like it a little better the next time, which will call for a re-write. But until then I wasn't really happy with the movie and just expected so much more.<br/><br/>7/10"

Man, I even have a newspaper that was in print at the same time that Holmes ""existed."" I have a framed collage hanging on my office wall that features pictures of the guarded doorway to 221B Baker Street in London, a wall painting and Holmes silhouette tiling in the subway, and a card that has the actor who plays Holmes onstage's signature (of course, he signed it ""Sherlock Holmes""). I also love the '80s film Young Sherlock Holmes. So when it was announced that Guy Ritchie was doing an adaptation of the famous character, I was very excited to say the least.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is everything a fan of the character could ever want in a new adaptation of the legend. It's adventurous, dark, mysterious, and humorous. It remains absolutely faithful to the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories while taking a chance and expanding on some aspects of the character such as physicality, the way his mind works, the curse of his mental ""gifts,"" and his drug use to obviously try to slow down his overactive and over stimulated psyche. It shows the back story of the character and delves into his personal world.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to say enough about how well Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law work together. The chemistry between the two is unbelievable and something that I would compare to catching lightning in a bottle. Robert Downey Jr's English accent is beyond unfaltering and you never once doubt that he is channeling the very character that Doyle would have approved of taking right off the page. Jude Law plays the straight-laced and grounded Dr. Watson the way you would expect him to be ‚Äì gentlemanly and calmly skeptical of the situations he finds himself in.<br/><br/>The story is pretty well put together and you really don't know what is going on until the very end. It has a kind of similar dark tone and subject matter like Young Sherlock Holmes, but isn't an exact replica or copy of the story. The pacing is a bit off and there are a few lulls in action here and there, but it's for the sake of the storytelling.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about the movie is the characterization of Irene Adler in the film. She really is tossed around and bossed around like some helpless and defensive woman, which is completely contrary to how you would think that Holmes' would act. It wasn't Rachel McAdams fault at all. She did what she could with what she was given to work with.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie really is on to something here. This movie could be the jump start to a whole new franchise. It would be a shame to see the Downey Jr. / Law chemistry put to rest with this first film. There is so much more story and ground that could be covered. We just have to hope that this doesn't end up getting lost in all the post ‚Äì Avatar hype and the holidays."

","Guy Ritchie brings a fresh look to the legendary sleuth and introduces a new generation of viewers to ""Sherlock Holmes."" Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories, not the clich√© Basil Rathbone film series of last century, this ""Holmes"" is gritty, eccentric, difficult, and compelling. <br/><br/>Who better then to cast in the title role than Robert Downey Jr? RDJ has been a favorite of mine since ""Chaplin,"" so it is indeed a treat to see him in leading roles (Holmes, & ""Iron Man""'s Tony Stark). Quick, smarmy, clever, or brooding, it's hard to take your eyes off RDJ on screen -- nothing he does goes to waste.<br/><br/>Similarly, nothing in the ""Holmes"" screenplay goes to waste -- every tiny action and bit of dialog ties together, beginning with the opening sequence. Much like Doyle's stories, there are hints and clues strewn throughout the film, making Holmes' deductions feasible and the story's conclusion logical and satisfying. Of course, Holmes' nemesis Professor Moriarty is introduced, and viewers know that we haven't seen the last of him.<br/><br/>Jude Law is a tense and frequently irritated Watson, not a hint of Nigel Bruce's bumbling but lovable counterpart to Rathbone's Holmes. The balance of the cast give similarly engaging performances, most notably Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler, and Mark Strong as the nefarious Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>Ritchie's direction is also one of the stars in this film. As he did in ""Snatch,"" Ritchie plays with the viewer's perception of time and the sequence of events. This keeps the pace fast and furious, but the careful observer will note seemingly random events throughout the story, and be able to weave them together at the end. All this is done without giving too much away. This is a pleasing experience for the film-goer, who ultimately feels that he or she has been in the know from the beginning.<br/><br/>An intelligent action/adventure romp, ""Sherlock Holmes"" left us hungry for a sequel."
"scooby246282","8","0","3","13 January 2010"," A Little Shallow But Very Entertaining
","Being a fan of previous Guy Ritchie directed films like Snatch and RocknRolla, my expectations were high for his first, in my opinion, mainstream film. He did not disappoint. His trademark frenetic style has been toned down a bit for a wider audience but it is still a delightful visual feast. The script is tight and quick paced, weaving a complex and ultimately satisfying mystery while still creating likable and three dimensional protagonists. The performances are excellent across the board with the exception of an underwhelming performance by Strong as Blackwood. To be fair though, he is a great actor in other projects but the character does not make for the best villain. It's much less his fault than it is the character's. Of special note is the Han Zimmer's score. I'm usually not one to notice original scores in films but his compositions always made me smile whenever they were featured. They were very spirited and whimsical and fit the tone perfectly. With an ending obviously open for a sequel, there is no doubt more to follow, and I plan to be there on opening night."

","Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant, action packed adventure that pushes the boundaries of action movies even further. With its quick cut and no hold barrelled action, Sherlock Holmes is truly something you will be thinking about for a while after you have left the cinema. Downey Jr adds an aura of witty , sharp bladed dialogue as the London detective. His side-kick Watson adds to this already revealing chemistry of the Newman and Redford combo that surely cannot be seen as a negative thing. Although different from that that old movie magic chemistry, Law and Downey Jr fit together very well. The direction is sheer class, and can only be compared to Ritchies other masterpiece-Snatch. The cinematography touches upon techniques used rarely today by worldly directors, but Ritchie pulls it off with fine brilliance."
"andrastea","8","0","4","10 January 2010"," The Life of Bohemian Genius
","Combining Guy Richie with Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes) and Jude Law (Dr Watson) in Sherlock Holmes movie sounded like mixing George Lukacs with Meryl Streep and Anthony Hopkins in Jane Austen story. But surprisingly the style, story and actors fit perfectly to depict this the end of 19th century mystery.<br/><br/>The movie concentrated a lot on Holmes' antisocial behaviour and eccentric habits, and on his troublesome relationship with Scotland Yard, perhaps more than was done in books. But then again the most of the books were narrated by Watson, the movie follows mostly Holmes. His regular cocaine use was replaced by experimenting drugs on his dog, bringing some humorous relaxation into otherwise intense story. No doubt the friends of canine are not happy about this twist. The genius part, how the deduction process in Holmes' head works, was achieved by a flash forward scenes narrated by Holmes, or similar kind of flashback scenes. The story it self is following now so trendy symbolism/supernatural/undead theme. <br/><br/>Jude Law was superb as Watson, having precisely a right amount of edginess, physical activeness, and frustration and loyalty toward Holmes. Robert Downey Jr played drug induced Holmes, well perhaps naturally. Character of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), The Woman for Holmes, even though acted well, felt like unnecessary stuffing for the story. But filmmakers just has to dumb some sexual/romantic whatever it is into movies even though it serves know one. Taken the amount of writers in this movie, it was surprise that storyline worked at all.<br/><br/>Overall, a very refreshing adaptation of old story.It would not be surprise if sequel shows up in a year or two."
"finn-palm","8","0","5","10 January 2010"," Possibly the most faithful adaption so far!
","Having read most (even if not all) of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and having winced through the years at all the different adaptations of the stories into a visual medium I was very sceptic at first, when I heard and read about this movie. But since I'm a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes I thought I'd give them at least one chance. And they surely deserved it. This movie is possibly the most faithful adaptation of Doyle's writing to film so far. Ironically the things that most people will go ""Hey, that's not how Doyle wrote it!"" is actually just as he wrote them. They've chosen to show sides of Holmes that have been ignored before. Doyle wrote Mr Holmes as an eccentric, drug abusing, violin playing, unpleasant fighter, and they've chosen to let him be that man. Another thing I was pleasantly surprised at was how, untypical of modern day movie-making, they did Dr Watson justice. Instead of, as so many earlier versions have, portray him as a stumbling, daft fool and comical sidekick (if it's not Watson who is incorrectly used as a comical sidekick it's Gimli or Ron Weasley) he is allowed to be smart and driven by curiosity and lust for adventure.<br/><br/>Finally they also manage to capture the dirty, early twentieth century London well. Costumes are well done, apart from the cleavage on the ladies which is a bit too modern, and Zimmer's music mixed with the occasional old folksong works fine too.<br/><br/>I warmly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and to everyone else too of course. I will myself return to the theatre to watch it again."
"scf","8","0","2","10 January 2010"," Really good new interpretation, but classicists may be turned-off
","Sherlock Holmes was the first of two ""big"" new releases we've seen in a while. We've loved Robert Downey, Jr. in many of his prior roles, and he did not disappoint in this one. His Holmes is not your great-grandfather's‚Äìno deerstalker hat, no Meerschaum pipe, but a wicked ability to assess how to take apart an opponent in an instant, and a much more wicked sense of humor. If you didn't like the latest James Bond flick, with the complaints about turning Bond into an action hero, you really won't like this Holmes. Downey's Holmes is far more physical than prior Holmes, whether it's going hand- to-hand with villains to rescue the damsel in distress, or in a boxing ring (no gloves, no Marquess of Queensbury rules). Jude Law (second time of the night) plays the youngest and most exuberant Dr. Watson in the franchise's history. Except for Inspector Lestrade, almost all the other main characters are new to this script.<br/><br/>This is the most athletic and physical Holmes in the long history of the character. He jumps, kicks, shoots, finds traps, and annoys and charms the female characters by turns. It's the fastest-paced Holmes as well; not a roller-coaster like National Treasure, but more evenly paced like Raiders of the Lost Ark. The period is a return to the late 1800s; the monarch is a queen, the period is after the U.S. Civil War (mentioned in the film), and the Tower Bridge is still visibly under construction. The Ripper murders may be part of the plot by implication, but are not directly mentioned in the script. London is dirty, noisy, and almost entirely populated by criminals and ne'er-do-wells of all stripes. It's a great setting for this plot.<br/><br/>There's a little too much invasion of modern pseudo-technology in this film for my taste, and most of it was unnecessary to the story. The story itself is only as strong as most of the others in the history of the character. There is a needless distracting side-plot which adds a character and appears to be there just to set up the opportunity for a sequel. Even so, this was a really entertaining film that probably should be seen on a big screen, although no harm in going to a matin√©e or using a discount pass."

","Guy Ritchie has conjured up some black magic, and given us an exciting, fun and mischievous Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) with Dr Watson (Jude Law) at his side forever getting him out of trouble. The two are great together, playing up to each other like old school room mates.<br/><br/>Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is a serial killing Satanist and London is in fear of his dark powers. Holmes and Watson are hired to find the truth behind the mystery, meeting up along the way with classic characters like Irene Dunn (Rachel McAdams) and Inspector Lestrade. In Guy Ritchie, lock stock and barrel style, the action is calculated and logical, and compliments Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' vision of Sherlock Holmes as the avid boxer and martial artist, along with his powers of observation, deductive skills and master of disguise.<br/><br/>The recreation of 19th Century London is amazing, especially with the attention to detail as Holmes walks around a busy, bustling and growing city landscape. New fans will take to him and old fans wont be disappointed as the movie keeps to the canon set by Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' novels and stories, although there is no mention of Holmes darker side of experimentation's with drugs, but maybe that comes later, along with newer foes to catch in the franchise to follow.<br/><br/>Being a big Sherlock Holmes fan I loved it, but I would say even new fans who know nothing of the famous character will like this fresh update on the old Holmes, and hopefully get some kids out there to pick up a book and delve deeper...

"johny_bravvo","8","0","4","9 January 2010"," Nothing escapes him ... !!
","Rob Downey Jr is back .... and how !! I knew I had to get my hands on those movie tickets as soon as soon as I first caught glimpse of the trailer. Being a huge fan of Doyle's work, I'm a big fan of Holmes. I own a lot of those BBC movies of Sherlock Holmes' different cases. Since I watched the making of the movie special on TV, I knew that this is not about any of Holmes' exploits penned by Doyle, rather this one is written by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson.<br/><br/>This movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as the world's greatest detective himself and Jude Law as the surgeon, war veteran and above all Holme's faithful companion Dr. John Watson. Rachael McAdams is Irene Adler and Mark Strong , Lord Blackwood.<br/><br/>Directed by Guy Ritchie, this movie dares to explore parts of Holmes' individuality where the earlier movies and serials failed to venture. Voracious Holmes readers would know from the books that in spite of having the best deduction abilities anyone could ever have, he was a total mess.<br/><br/>He would often need someone to shake him back in touch with the world or else, him and his legendary pipe, would have a field day, deep in his thoughts out of which he may not emerge back too soon. Besides that, readers would also know that Holmes was a great boxer, superb at martial arts ( read Jiu Jitsu , which he used to throw Proff. Moriearty off the waterfall in the return of Sherlock Holmes story ), had a thing for Irene Adler (A Scandal in Bohemia) and lived at 221B Baker Street, London.<br/><br/>This movie shows Holmes boxing, kicking butt, living in a mess and often requiring constant wake up calls from the good doctor. The Victorian London has been depicted impeccably with the dark environment, pebbled roads, the sound of hoofs a horse carriage would make, the rains, the puddles and the unfinished bridges.<br/><br/>Now those of us, who grew up watching those BBC specials of Sherlock Holmes (without much reading the unabridged stories), would have a hard time relating this movie to what BBC had fed us in the form of Sherlcok Holmes movies for years because they had neither the resources nor the conviction to portray that side of Holmes which made him more of a human. They would rather just stick to showing how extraordinarily well he was about almost everything.<br/><br/>Wel I do admit, the characters in the movie were not too much like what Sir Doyle etched in his books. Robert Downey Jr.'s Holmes was not the tall, thin pointy nosed excuse for an individual. Nor was Dr Watson, the bumbling fool which Nigel Bruce popularized in the 1930-40s films. Jude Law's Watson was fast, fierce, knowledgeable (no match for Holmes however) and quite the fighter which one would need to be if one were to get caught in the situations that following Holmes would lead you in.<br/><br/>So I believe, that most franchises were changing their look to suit today's audience, this movie , very cleverly utilized the uncharted territory of Holmes' character and used a different story altogether to prevent fans from knowing the end and in process bring in more people. Now this is a movie both of masses and the classes.<br/><br/>I seriously recommend this movie to about everyone."

The movie eases up after a while, and in the end, when all is clarified, you may be forgiven for having believed somewhere along the line that this was a bit too nouveau a reincarnation.

"tacmovies","7","0","2","7 January 2010"," Good Acting, Average Story
","Acting: Robert Downey Jr. is awesome at any role, and I'm glad that he's finally getting the recognition he deserves. He does a great job of making Holmes quirky and borderline unlikeable at times, but he just has this innocent sort of charm that makes us like him. Jude Law plays a great Dr. Watson. I have to agree with Moviebob in saying that it is nice to see a Watson that isn't played dumb or flat so that Sherlock looks more interesting by comparison. Rachel McAdams... was hot! She's an excellent femme fatale-ish sort of gal and seriously, she should be more famous than she is. Between Mean Girls, the Notebook, Wedding Crashers, and her best role (in my opinion) Red Eye, she really should be a household name by now. In many ways the actors were the main attraction in this movie and the banter between Jude Law and Downey made this movie. A <br/><br/>Visuals: This movie had a great steam punk look to it and was generally a feast for the eyes. The fight scenes where Holmes would plot out each of his moves and the anticipated counter move was an item of beauty. Now, since I deleted my direction category in favor of a sound category, I'll attack the director here: This movie needed to be shorter. At least by ten minutes, probably closer to twenty minutes shorter. B <br/><br/>Sound: The music was quite epic and, again, there were no foleys that kicked me out of the movie. The general sound of steam being released fit the whole steam punk atmosphere. B <br/><br/>Story: Eh... I really don't like mystery movies or books as a genre. There are exceptions, but as a general rule they just don't pull me in. To the masses, they're good for maybe two viewings, once to try and figure it out as it plays out and another to check and make sure the writer didn't pull a fast one on the audience. The goal, I suppose, is to make the audience try to solve the mystery with Sherlock Holmes. But, all movies are to a certain extent a fantasy instead of reality, so logic goes out the window when the writer uses lots of supernatural elements or applied phlebotnium to drive the plot, making any real world speculations on our part a general waste of time. Hence, I never even try to solve the mystery and never get pulled in because of it.<br/><br/>All right, enough about the genre, how's this particular mystery? Well, it's okay. I cared more about the banter between characters than solving the mystery, so I thought they could have cut a lot of the clues and speculations segments and gotten the running time down some. It would have made me happier. The villain's overall plan was good, but I think that a suspense thriller approach of letting the audience know his plan but not Holmes would have kept me interested when I tuned out, but I prefer thrillers over mysteries any day. C <br/><br/>Overall: It's not a bad movie, and it seems to be fairly faithful to the Holmes mythology (even if he is a bit more physical than he ever was before... but I only read The Hound of the Baskervilles, so my knowledge of Holmes is limited to what my roommate, Robert, who read every Sherlock Holmes story ever, tells me) and ultimately it doesn't matter. This movie creates its own continuity and seems to stay consistent. I recommend this movie to fans of the players involved (Downey, Law, McAdams) and say that it's probably worth sending between five and eight dollars to see, but anymore than that might leave you feeling ripped off. B<br/><br/>Tacmovies: We're not failed film students who bitterly criticize successful movies... really... sniffle... so, um... yeah, ahem: Follow our reviews on blogspot, flixter, IMDb, yahoo movies, and youtube."
"billyfish","6","0","3","6 January 2010"," Sherlock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
","First of all, let me say this was a very watchable and entertaining movie, full of action and enough noise to keep even the most sleep-deprived insomniac wide awake. I enjoyed it and would even like to see it again, this time with earplugs, in order to catch some of the nuances I no doubt missed in the first viewing.<br/><br/>That said, this movie, like most movies these days made from literary works, has little to do with the original story other than lifting the characters' names -- without adopting their original personalities or characteristics. Ritchie's Holmes, alas not surprisingly, has more of a ""Snatch"" hoodlum in him than anything Conan Doyle wrote. Although it's true that the literary Holmes was no cupcake, and dabbled in ""fisticuffs,"" this Holmes looked more like Jason Statham than the intellectual and quirky sleuth of Baker Street. The fight scenes (and there were many) were long, drawn-out (although full of action), and unbelievable.<br/><br/>I found myself wishing for these over-the-top action scenes to be over so Holmes could make some clever deductions from obscure clues. I was sadly disappointed that there was very little of the latter in this film. This is a Holmes on steroids (and not the occasional cocaine that the true literary Holmes was known to have sampled). It was the Holmes of ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" not the genius detective as played best by Jeremy Brett in the British Sherlock Holmes series.<br/><br/>In short, although this is a competent action film, full of explosions and clever fight scenes, it is NOT worthy to be attached to the name of the great Sherlock Holmes character. As long as you know that going in, and you don't care, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film. Sherlock Holmes purists -- get ready to hate!"

","My partner's favorite part of the movie was the relationship between Holmes and Watson, how they just knew what the other was thinking and how they worked together so well it was mostly tacit (even when fighting!). I also liked the cinematography of Holmes' mental thought, when he modeled out solutions or his course of action, but this is just a cinematic pleasure.<br/><br/>The more interesting questions have to do with Holmes' character, as I imagine is the case with the books. Despite the backlash from the book-fans of Holmes, one thing is certainly the same in book or movie: the scientific attitude of Holmes, the use of reason to demystify appearances in the investigation of a case (ah, the human sciences were tightly interwoven with forensics at their origins!). Everything 'magical' is explained away by Holmes by the end of the movie, except the second-order cinematic ironies...this is another point my partner made: why the repeated death by hanging scene of Lord Blackwood at the end? Is that not the magic of fictionality? It appears the scientific character of Holmes has an ironic structure at heart: after all, the story is not true!"

","I have never read the Sherlock Holmes novels (I never read the classics willingly). So, for all those who haven't read the books, like me, my opinion is that this movie was great and you should see it. I can't say how the movie compares to the book, so for those who have read the book, my opinion might not help. That aside, I'll now discuss why this movie is more worthwhile to see than junk like Avatar.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, Robert Downey Jr. being my favorite in the cast. I felt he captured who I imagined Sherlock Holmes to be like (again, I haven't read the books). Jude Law as Watson did a great job, too. The two had great chemistry and had the exact same relationship as Shawn and Gus from the TV show Psych. They are best friends who solve mysteries together. Holmes, like Shawn, is laid back, funny, and can cause a bit of trouble once in a while. Watson, like Gus, is more uptight and a stickler for the rules. He's neat and orderly, and seems to get pulled into the mayhem by Holmes. They work great together, but they also disagree on a lot of things. Watching them on the screen together was enjoyable. <br/><br/>The screenplay was very well done. The action scenes were thrilling and the clues Holmes found along the way kept me thinking the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat through most of the film, and the story was complex, but somehow easy to understand once Holmes solved the case at the end. The villain was mysterious and chilling; watching the things he did to people and his dark face was pretty exciting. <br/><br/>I was very impressed with the music in this movie. It seemed to capture the essence of where the story took place and the environment or setting of the story. If a blind person went to see the movie, I imagine they would be able to picture a setting similar to the one that actually exists just by listening to the music. The setting was also captured well by the lighting. The movie took place in a dark, dank little town in England. The lighting went along with the music to truly express what this time was like and to capture the darkness of the story.<br/><br/>The special effects, while not Avatar quality, were believable. What I mean by this is the special effects didn't make the movie, which in every case is a good thing. Avatar got millions of dollars and people won't shut up about it only because it's special effects are ''ground-breaking''. There is no actual story, which to me is a vital part of A truly incredible movie. Sherlock Holmes had a good story, great characters, and didn't overdo the special effects, and that is what makes it great. So, to sum it up, the characters were great, the story was exciting, the fighting and action scenes were thrilling, and the music and lighting were extremely fitting to the movie. Go see Sherlock Holmes and you won't regret it. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing and I can't wait to see him in Iron Man 2!"

Watched it with my 11 year old son who didn't flinch at the scenes when Holmes was displaying his fighting skills but he plays PS2 most days so he has seen it all, got the teeshirt! Great great simple dialogue between Holmes and Watson but I didn't appreciate even just two American actors noticeably appearing in the movie and allowing their presence. the first was the politician guy who died with the gun in his hand and the second was the woman (Mary) giving Holmes grief at the end. Amazing reconstructed scenes of victorian London, even great thought in detail to the street scenes, wow, great stuff! Definitely a movie to watch again on DVD because there is so much to absorb and wonder about the movie. Powerful entertainment! Jude Law for me was highly disguised as Watson and acted well though Downey excelled from his good support in 'Soloist' to surely claim an Oscar for best actor. Is this another British movie getting Oscar credit?"

","The legendary British sleuth gets the big screen treatment in this action-adventure. It's the 1890s and the ingenious Holmes and the fastidious Dr. Watson have just completed a case against a nemesis with a plan for world domination. However, that's only the beginning as he turns out to be a much more formidable foe than they originally anticipated. As the case escalates, the duo test the limits of their partnership, especially when a temptress and old flame suspiciously re-enters Holmes' life. Elaborate and entertaining, with Downey in perfect form as Holmes, Law a good sidekick as Watson, McAdams a strong and sexy heroine as Irene Adler, but it goes on too long and suffers from a convoluted plot. **¬Ω"

","Rachel Adams, Jude Law, & Robert Downey Jr. are the strengths of this film. The weakness is the complicated structure given to the film by Director Guy Richie. In this case the film might have been more effective telling the story more straight forward. While Richies film looks highly stylized, he gambles on losing members of his audience with the way he sequences it.<br/><br/>Richies idea is at times to drill into Sherlock Holmes head and reflect what Holmes plans are before he executes them, then have him execute them. He then has times where he has Holmes do something, then show how he did it afterwords. I was able to follow this.<br/><br/>The depiction of Holmes character is indeed an accurate one, and I give Richie credit for staying away from the Basil Rathbone styled Holmes. The performances of the cast and the atmosphere created for the film look very good on the screen which helps the film immensely.<br/><br/>Rachel Adams acts & looks great in this & it seems there are some decent sparks between her and Downey's Holmes. Think with more directing experience Richie might find he doesn't have to work as hard on style but do more with substance."

","Robert Downey Jr seems to keep surprising himself, first with Iron man(2008), and now with Sherlock Holmes. But I liked the idea that he brings his own to the character, without trying to come off like a silly version of the character. But when the humorous parts come in, he comes across like Cary Grant trying to do Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Jude Law and Rachel McAdams are also good in there supporting roles. It's perfectly well directed by Guy Ritchie. A perfect mystery movie that neither drags at any time. The wonderful dialog that Downey and Law as Watson, are entertaining, as they play off each other perfectly, and also with McAdams. So if you are trying to find an entertaining, please give Sherlock Holmes a look."

","Director Guy Richie (Snatch) breaks the gangster mold to bring Sherlock Holmes to the screen, and he achieves it well. In this film, Robert Downey Jr (in one of his best roles) and Jude Law are Sherlock Holmes and Watson. They learn of a man named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has risen from the dead, and is willing to destroy all of England. With the assistance of Irene Alder (Rachel McAdams), Sherlock and Watson go on an adventure to stop Blackwood from achieving his goal.<br/><br/>Robert and Jude are brilliant. Their chemistry together provides some great comedy and the action sequences are really well done. Most of the film I was really surprised at just how brilliant Sherlock really was: noticing the tiny details, re-telling a person's life, I was really amazed by it.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have (and this is a MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!) is what happened to Irene Alder at the end. That's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>Despite this, Sherlock Holmes is a film that entertains, and provides great comedy to keep the laughs coming! 9/10"

","""Sherlock Holmes"" is a terrific movie that, contrary to my expectation, captured the spirit and brilliance of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels. Although the trailers seemed to depict Holmes as morphing into an action hero, his detection work here is top-notch.<br/><br/>The story, involving the villainous Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and his scheme to blow up the Houses of Parliament, is actually very good and supremely involving. Just when you think they have left a giant plot-hole it is explained away in the next scene. It is a great story on it's own, but leaves an exciting set-up for a possible sequel. Holmes' nemesis Moriarty (added during reshoots) is woven into the plot without detracting from it. But anyone expecting Brad Pitt to make an appearance (even post-credits) will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Holmes - flamboyant, eccentric and coldly logical he fills the role sublimely. Jude Law is good fun as Watson, and Mark Strong makes a terrific villain. Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly are appealing as the love interests for Holmes and Watson, and Eddie Marsan makes a good fist of the bumbling Inspector Lestrade.<br/><br/>The sets and CGI backdrops are also skilfully crafted and deliver a real Victorian flavour. Some fantastic action scenes abound, with a thrilling finale atop Tower Bridge.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much, but watching this will certain whet your appetite or curiosity about the Sherlock Holmes books.<br/><br/>A joy to watch."

","I've long been a fan of the Doyle books, and the movie references countless things from the Doyle canon in a way that hardcore fans like me find delightful, but in an action movie context geared surprisingly well for the 21st century crowd, most of whom wouldn't know Sherlock Holmes from the Rolling Stones, or Sherlock's smarter brother Mycroft....<br/><br/>The flick uses a lot of flashy high tech supergraphics similar to the CSI TV shows (which, after all, begin and end as baldfaced Doyle/Holmes ripoffs-slash-tributes), without being SO modern as to feel like anachronisms. Coupled with almost relentless action scene after action scene, it was so engaging, and so filled with twists, both physical and philosophical, that I didn't want leave the room long enuff for a quick bathroom break. Every bit of the movie seemed too vital to miss ---<br/><br/>Lots of witty and intelligent stuff going on - I look forward to at least a couple of repeat viewings! For a VERY long time, the only TV or movie Holmes I've found acceptable are Basil Rathbone (by virtue of his radio incarnation more than the films), and Jeremy Brett from the PBS show (which are among the best direct-from-Doyle adaptations) - well, and maybe a couple of those weird shows with Matt Frewer/Max Headroom as Sherlock.<br/><br/>Now, and for some time to come, Robert Downey Jr. IS the personification of Mr. Holmes for me! Been digging his movie groove since his wonderful Chaplin biopic -- I doubt anybody would have bothered making this new movie without him. I hope the sequel they seemed to set up happens ---"

","Well, some might expect this to be nothing more than just an action movie with silly dialogues thrown around. Well, it's more than that. It's smart, beautiful and what's more, it stays true to the original source.<br/><br/>The good: The acting. It was top-notch. As seen from the cast list, you can expect nothing less. Robert Downey Jr was amazing playing a British detective. And Jude Law, a gentleman doctor. These two make a great team. There's chemistry between them. They leave us wanting more.<br/><br/>The visuals. Really did not expect this movie to be layered with CGI. But it was good and realistic. Very beautiful to say the least.<br/><br/>The storyline. It was very engaging. See, you already know who the bad guy is. What keeps you guessing is how he did the crimes...<br/><br/>The score and soundrack. Very fitting, to what's happening on screen as well as to what year it was.<br/><br/>The action sequence. Boldly done. Very eye-catching. And with Holmes' narration on what he'll be doing when he attacks the person makes the action scene more 'smart'.<br/><br/>The bad: Well, the mumbling doesn't help people to understand what is being said. And the whole mystery can be quite confusing.<br/><br/>Overall: A nice movie for those who are seeking adventure and just wants to have fun doing it!"
"FoxWolf87","7","0","3","30 December 2009"," It's Decent
","Just to give a little background, I have only general knowledge of Sherlock Holmes. I've read one story, I've seen references to it on movies and TV programs. So I really just have general knowledge of the mythology. That said, I though the film was decent. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad. It's just a solid decent film.<br/><br/>Basically what they did is turn Sherlock Holmes into an Action/Adventure/Mystery Film. Purists of the stories might be a little turned off, but for the casual movie-goer, it's a good movie.<br/><br/>GOOD STUFF The story is engaging and keeps you just curious enough to see what will happen next. There's a lot going on with the main murder-mystery plot, and several good character driven sub-plots.<br/><br/>I think Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as Sherlock Holmes. I liked his portrayal of the character as an extremely intelligent social misfit who is respected by all, but has a general attitude of distaste for those around him (with a few exceptions). The rest of the acting is decent, and succeeds in getting you interested enough in the characters to see what will happen next.<br/><br/>I really liked the creative uses of deductive logic, not just to solve mysteries, but in fight scenes and everyday situations. In this adaptation, Holmes is able to use deductive reasoning in hand-to-hand combat to create the best scenario for disabling an opponent. I thought this was an interesting twist and a cool addition to the character. I loved the way the deductive logic scenes were shot, too. It shows a slow motion explanation of everything Holmes is planning to do so that you can see the logic behind the actions. He calculates every move in advance based on his opponent's weaknesses, then he calculates recovery time and psychological impact on his opponent. After this slow-motion explanation, you get to see the whole thing in real time, and it's really f***ing cool to watch the logical explanation, and the process behind the fight before seeing the scene in real-time.<br/><br/>The resolution to the mystery is satisfying, and it's exactly how you would want to see a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery unravel. I won't go into detail, I'll just say it's not ridiculous, and that it's based in logic and deductive reasoning.<br/><br/>NOT SO GOOD STUFF While I liked most of the performances in the film, I had a hard time seeing Jude Law as Watson. I don't think its anything the actor did wrong, I just think it was a casting misstep. When I think Watson, the first thing that comes to mind is not ""ass-kicking bodyguard."" I was able to overlook it for the most part, but in the back of my head I was just going, ""That's not Watson."" It just doesn't seem natural to me.<br/><br/>There was also an issue with me where the clues are not really given much screen time or attention. Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it, and seeing how the pieces come together; but the way the film is edited, you really can't see the ending coming, and it's more just Holmes explaining rather than giving the audience actual clues to think about.<br/><br/>The ending also threw me a little with the final confrontation with the villain. I'll just say on this that it gets a little clich√©, and someone survives something without a scratch that that person really shouldn't just walk off without at least a bruise. However, it's not NEARLY as ridiculous as Indy's magical fridge of wonders.<br/><br/>For the most part, the CG is cool, except for a few scenes at the end where you can tell it's not real. This is relatively minor, though.<br/><br/>OVERALL The film is decent. It's worth a look if you just want to see a good, solid film that isn't too heavy or too deep. It's a decent Hollywood action-adventure comedy.<br/><br/>7/10 - A few stumbling points, but overall decent. Recommend for casual movie-goers. Hardcore fans of the books and stories might get p*ssed."

","Off all the Sherlock content I have seen this was the best for the big screen so far. I was a bit worried going in that it would feel like a long TV show or crime drama. Most of my Holmes experience is book or old TV shows and I love it but it does come off as built for the small screen. This is miles beyond a CSI action flick in all the right ways. I thought the casting was perfect, although going in I was uncertain, and the acting was a joy to watch. I saw this over Christmas with my Wife and my Mother and they both liked it but not as much as I did. This was the compromise between ""Avatar"" for me and some ""It's Complicated"" for them and I think we all came out happy with our choice. I still have other favorites for Sherlock Holmes actors but I think this crew will do well even if there are several more movies in this franchise before they move on."

","I must admit to being skeptical of the combination of Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes however, as a fan of the Snatch genre I thought I would give it a go. <br/><br/>I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jn plays a rogue Sherlock in cracking style with less than polished edges and a prim and proper Jude Law delivers Dr Watson is superb style. Their combination works surprisingly well and once you can get over the forced English accents, the film plays out in an engaging highly watchable way. The old London backdrops are particularly impressive too.<br/><br/>It has, of course, all the expected Ritchie elements including slow-mo boxing and a long drawn out blast scene....but neither is out of place in the context of the story. <br/><br/>On the down side, the 'black magic' elements of the film were a little overdone and at one point, I thought my other half was going to walk out. However, she stayed and enjoyed the concussion.<br/><br/>All in all, a good, well rounded Ritchie take on a classic story and well worth a viewing."

","For me there will only be one Sherlock Holmes, Basil Rathborne. He was the Holmes I grew up watching when I was a wee lad. But I must say, Downey Jr puts in a good turn as gifted detective. Holmes is charismatic, humorous and has better dress sense than Rathborne's Holmes. More or less Robert Downey Jr playing himself but with an English accent. He did a good job none the less. As for the rest of the film's performers, Jude Law was really good as Watson, probably one of his best performances in a long time. Not a big fan of Law but he did well to keep up will Downey Jr's Holmes and the chemistry between the two worked well. Mark Strong did well as Lord Blackwood and continues to deliver reliable performances with the roles he plays. I thought Rachel McAdams was passable at best. Would have been a much better film without here inclusion. Apart from being the eye candy...sorry...damsel in distress, she offered nothing else apart from looking gorgeous in her Victorian gladrags. She is a good actress, just not in this film. The film does well to mix the action and comedy, boasting some edge of seat set pieces and some good laughs, most of which come from the two leads, who have the best lines in the film. Guy Ritchie has outdone himself with Sherlock Holmes. For a director whose always been known for making gangster movies, he's done well here. And I hope builds from the success of this movie and makes a sequel. All in all, a enjoyable movie, with good performances, set pieces and impressive visual effects. Worth the price of admission."

","As the Christmas festivities come to a close, other opportunities open up in the world of theatrical entertainment, with the release of Sherlock Homes starring Robert Downy Jr., Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams. Yet with this installment of Holmes, after so many before have been a delightful and true immersion into the pages of creator Arthur Conan Doyle, has become like so many movies of this generation; an action thriller full of explosions and special effects.<br/><br/>The plot takes us out of the original stories, and into a time where Holmes (Downy) has become despondent from a lack of cases, after solving his latest one in the opening of the movie. Watson (Law) is preparing to move out of 221B Baker Street to consider marriage. Although this is obviously putting strain on the dynamic duo's relationship, they come back together for come more time to finish a case. It seems that there last assignment as risen from the grave and has promised death and a new regime for both Britain and the world.<br/><br/>While the plot has its moments in the terms of a Sherlock Holms adventure, it seems too stretched, mainly due to the undue amount of action. The eclectic Holmes, a man wrapped in intrigue, deduction and mental prowess, has been transformed into a fist fighting, running and gunning hero. Holmes has left behind what made him unique and has created this early 19th century Batman that everyone knows about. The only redeeming quality of this new installment of Holmes is how Downy was about to bring the right personality to the character. His quick and subtle reactions to any situation in combination with how Downey brings to the table an intellect that the movie can't contain.<br/><br/>Still, the biggest issues that come into play are all of the action sequences and explosions. Director Guy Ritchie, who has directed other movies like Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, doesn't create this world out of a malicious intent to ruin the view of Doyle, rather just make everything he touches fun. This is a holiday movie and with this type of cast, he makes it fun. Top his credit, he does in fact do that and well, once you forget the fact that this is supposed to be a man sleuthing and not breaking ribs and running through balls of fire.<br/><br/>I will have to give it to Ritchie, in his choice of actors for their respected parts. They fit into their characters exceptionally well and easily, though I will say that the constant undertone of homoeroticism between the characters was not needed in the least. Even bringing in McAdams, who is an amazing and beautiful actress in her part as Irene Adler (the only one to get away from Holmes and win his love) to bring in a female attraction, it still does not dampen it enough. We get it; there is something possibly between the duo. You don't need to make it blatantly obvious in every scene.<br/><br/>The movie overall is something you watch to have a nice little action movie, something of a smarter Die Hard, only with less grunge Americanism and a heightened sense of courtesy. Just keep in mind that if you are walking in for a true detective movie, you will be slightly disappointed by cavalcade of destruction that follows Holmes"

","The staid old world of the 19th century detective has been remastered by ""British Gangster movie"" director Guy Ritchie, and to my major surprise has done a terrific job. Sherlock Holmes is no longer the hunting cap doffed man with the cherub & wise side-back. Now he is something different yet still faithful to the crux of the character we already know.<br/><br/>The story entails our heroes Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr Watson (Jude Law) on the case to stop Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) succeed in his devious black magic plans. Somehow the fiend has resurrected himself from the dead and our heroes have to use their full ingenuity to stop him.<br/><br/>Lots of non-stop action in period setting combines and flows brilliantly with a great story that keeps you hooked & intrigued to the end. The humour is sharp and clever, and our leads are having fun all the way through. For those who live or have visited London comparing some of the sites with present day is wonderful.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and there is hardly a person miscast. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law sit perfectly in the lead roles to this reviewer's surprise, and you will have fun just watching their interaction alone. Mark Strong as the villain is wonderfully dastardly.<br/><br/>A film I'd recommend you sit back and enjoy, you will enjoy it."
"Troy_Campbell","7","0","2","26 December 2009"," The latest incarnation of Holmes is exciting and interesting.
","Guy Ritchie's latest is a little disappointing from time to time yet is still an overall success. When focussing on the problem-solving it is nothing less than enthralling. Holmes and Watson cleverly deduce their way through the clues with sharp dialogue and crackling banter, and on occasion, a fist fight that packs a wallop. Ritchie proves himself a worthy director when it comes to a more conventional film, his normal flashiness put aside for greater attention to detail and longer-lasting shots. However, where it tends to go wrong is in the large-scale sequences. The CGI-driven set pieces are generally seamless, but they just feel out of place. A duel atop London's Tower Bridge ‚Äì mid-construction ‚Äì is a major example of the unnecessary enormity given to the action scenes.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is clearly at the top of his game. The last few years has seen him become one of the finest actors in the industry, with roles in quality pictures like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Iron Man, Tropic Thunder and now Sherlock Holmes. Here he gives a modernised Holmes the perfect balance of intellect and wit, to keep the long-standing fans happy, and arrogance and brashness, to rope in a new horde of followers. Downey's take on one of Britain's most enduring detectives holds the entire movie in good stead, had he misfired it could have been an awkward affair.<br/><br/>It's not just Downey who is on show though. Jude Law does the beloved Dr Watson much justice; he provides a terrifically stable counterpart to the wise-cracking and insolent Holmes. Despite playing the straight character of the two, Law manages to wring out a fair few laughs with his perpetual annoyance towards Holmes' antics and he clearly has a natural chemistry with Downey. Elsewhere Rachel McAdams is a sufficiently seductive Irene Adler, it isn't hard to understand why Holmes is so infatuated with her, but her role could've have been a touch juicier. Unacceptably, Mark Strong is one-dimensional and even, at times, very bland as Lord Blackwood. He makes for a dull villain and you get the impression he was just a gap-filler until they unleash Holmes' more famous arch-nemesis, one of the Professor kind.<br/><br/>A couple of gripes aside, the latest incarnation of Holmes is exciting and interesting. With plenty of room to improve and a superb pairing of Downey and Law, the probable sequel should be a corker.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
