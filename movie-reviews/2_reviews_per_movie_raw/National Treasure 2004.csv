","**********SPOILER WARNING************<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of seeing this film twice at the theater. The only shows where I've seen the audience more into a movie were Spider-man 1 & 2, X-MEN 2, and Rocky. The movie is interesting from start to finish. <br/><br/>While all the actors (and actress) do a good job, Sean Bean steals the show. So many times, the villain can make or break the film. Sean Bean was the absolute best choice for this particular villain. The characters arrogance, intelligence, and relentless resolve shine through. <br/><br/>I feel the main drawback to the film was its PG rating. It would have been better as a PG-13. Some obvious violence was toned down. Even people that never use foul language, would have dropped the ""F"" bomb here and there. But as it stands with its PG rating, everyone can enjoy it."
"dgrooms72","7","235","269","4 January 2005"," Take ""National Treasure"" for what it is.
","This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it. The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow. Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure. To put it simply, ""National Treasure"" will remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy (minus the snakes) and ""Ocean's 11"" (minus the drinking and profanity). You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it. No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark, either. It's a fun, fantasy, what-if, kind of movie. Enjoy it."

","National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.<br/><br/>with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.<br/><br/>well done!"
"KCwordguy","8","25","28","3 April 2005"," Better than I had expected
","""National Treasure"" seemed the most innocuous of the offerings at the discount house, and one of the kids had been agitating to see it for a month or so. I gave in.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is a welcome throwback of a film. The hero's a little scuffed around the edges, but clearly one of the good guys. The reluctant (at first) heroine is spunky, smart and beautiful. The baddie is wealthy, charming and accented. And the sidekick's a scream.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage does well in that he doesn't try to play Benjamin Gates like Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones. There's a bit of the geek buried none too deep in Cage's performance, and the only time he gets rough with a bad guy, he hurts his hand.<br/><br/>Justin Bartha's overgrown-kid persona provides plenty of comic relief -- and it's a relief in itself that ""National Treasure"" doesn't fall back on the ""kill the sidekick"" formula. The film needs him, and it needs him all the way through.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger and Sean Bean do a fine job of portraying two sides of the same coin: Immigrants obsessively chasing the American Dream. The difference is in their interpretation of the dream.<br/><br/>There's one on screen death, not gory. There's little, if any, profanity. Brainpower, not firepower, carries the day. And there's a genuine regard for learning throughout the film (although, admittedly, a few of the facts are off).<br/><br/>And yes, there are moments when you realize that being an old-school film hero means leading a particularly charmed life. After all, given the seasonal changes in the sun's daily position, what are the odds of it making a shadow fall just so -- just when the good guys need it to? But that's the way it is in a good hidden-treasure epic: When truth and right are on your side, someone makes sure you get the breaks.<br/><br/>There's a moral buried in the ending, too, that can be taken either way. Sharing is good -- but is it sharing of physical wealth, or of a political ideal? Given the obvious reverence for the Founding Fathers and their philosophies in ""National Treasure,"" the answer might be ""and"" rather than ""or."" All in all, far better than I had expected. Not earth-shatteringly significant, but family-friendly, well-paced and a whole lot of escapist fun."

","""National Treasure"" is a thriller that was obviously targeted for young audiences. John Turtletaub, its director, has created a film that will resonate with those audiences because of the great ride and the adventure it depicts. On the other hand, heaven help us, should anyone feel inspired to emulate the hero of the film and attempts to do something similar, which in a way, doesn't say much about the security in guarding the real ""natural treasures"" of the country.<br/><br/>If we can believe Ben Gates can pull the caper, then there's no problem in enjoying this film, which offers an action packed couple of hours that could have been trimmed a little bit to make it even better.<br/><br/>Not being a Nicolas Cage fan, one was prepared for the worst, but this is one of the films in which Mr. Cage is at his mellowest intensity and it's easy to tolerate his antics. Diane Kreuger is a beautiful addition to the film that pays well. Justin Bartha does what he can being a computer nerd and pulling fantastic stuff to help his friend. Sean Bean, Christopher Plummer and Jon Voight, are seen in supporting roles.<br/><br/>This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand."
"MLDinTN","7","186","249","12 December 2004"," fun adventure
","This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.<br/><br/>So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.<br/><br/>And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones."
"tabuno","8","8","8","24 January 2019"," The American Movie For Just The Right Audience
","20 November 2004. National Treasure is the all-American movie about good vs. evil which is just what the American audience needs at this time in the face of America's war in Iraq. With a great dose of Lara Croft's lofty beginning theme along with Raiders of the Lost Ark sort of comedy and action adventure, throw in some nice high-tech, Enemy of the State themes and this movie is a gang-buster of a movie for the American public. It starts out with such action that it has difficulty keeping up the pace and the editing become a problem through its length and slower pace that it seems too long until the exciting climax that avoids the unbelievable ending of most movies. The romance and the nice contrast of bad guy-blow'em approach vs. the more subtle good guy approach makes this movie enjoyable. This is a great movie of the moment, for its time and audience, though not a classic by any means, it's great entertainment of the moment. Eight out of Ten Stars."
"grahamsj3","7","95","130","30 November 2004"," Fairly entertaining
","I am NOT, repeat, NOT, a Nicolas Cage fan, mainly because he relies too much on action to carry his films (instead of his acting), but this is a pretty decent flick. There is enough action and suspense to keep the viewer's interest and also to maintain the pace of the film. There's actually not very much actual violence (strange for a Cage film!), but the story is so well-written that even Cage can pull it off without any gore. The basic story has been reviewed several times, but it's the continuation of a 200 year old treasure hunt. Cage must solve riddle after riddle to find the ultimate clue to the treasure's whereabouts. The clue is finally determined to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. How Cage figures the clue that leads him there is pretty far-fetched but its the key to the story. If you buy into that, the rest of the riddles are acceptable. There's also a double cross plot headed by the great Sean Bean that provides a lot of the action. The lovely Diane Kruger portrays the poor lady who gets caught up in the middle of all this intrigue. Overall, except for the figuring out of the clue found in the ship (the viewer just has to assume that he's that far above the rest of us in intelligence), a pretty exciting film with a little something for everyone."

"iguth","8","6","6","19 June 2019"," CLASSIC Cage
","Here we have a classical Nicholas Cage film that will carry into the future. It is the peak of 'follow the clues' type of adventure film. The premise is just obscene enough to create this funny air over the movie and has enough twists and turns that keep the audience engaged. The villain is a very standard villain but it is nice that they nearly mirror our heroes in treasure hunting prowess. It is simple and not necessarily the most impressive but overall I would have to consider it one of the quintessential Nick Cage films."
"michaelRokeefe","7","6","6","4 June 2005"," Hide and seek begins with our Founding Fathers.
","Director Jon Turtelaub and the usually entertaining Nicolas Cage make a good combination and a darn good movie. Cage plays Ben Gates, an archaeologist-historian on a present-day quest for an ancient treasure of the Knights Templar. This treasure has been kept secret for what seems forever by a long line of Freemasons dating back to the Declaration of Independence. According to generations of folklore, there is a clue on the back of the Declaration that will sustain the procession of clues leading to the treasure. Thus the Icon of all historical documents, the Declaration of Independence , must be borrowed/stolen. Now Gates must out race his former employer Ian Howe(Sean Bean)to the mythical treasure. Gates has the aid of one of his believers Riley Poole(Justin Bartha)and new convert Dr. Abigail Chase(Diane Kruger), who happens to be an employee of the Smithsonian Museum.<br/><br/>This contrived tale is infectious as Cage's determination to be a hero among mortal men. This caper is held together with shards of comedy and a healthy helping of adventure. Bean seems flawless as the crafty villain. Rounding out the cast are: Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Mark Pellegrino and Christopher Plummer. This poor man's Indiana Jones romp proves harmless fun for all ages."

","This one gets my vote for the most enjoyable flick of 2004 (together with The Indredibles). You'd think it's just for kiddies, but any adult capable of just going to the cinema to enjoy themselves should be able to sit back, gobble the popcorn, suck the straw, nibble on the ice- cream and just have a couple of hours of unproblematic maniaÂ—with good and bad guys, daring thefts, lost treasures, romance, chases, near escapes, disasters and rescues and everything you'd expect in this kind of Bruckheimer production. <br/><br/>The whole thing is paced just right, the villains are just bad enough, and the goodies are nobles with a roguish streak. The cheesy bits are mellowed with a dash of wry humor, and those that aren't: well, just take them, don't cringe and, again, have fun!<br/><br/>I came out of this movie smiling, as did my wife and elder daughter (that would make all of us into definite 'adults').

","A descendant (Nicolas Cage) of a family of fortune hunters looks for a treasure chest that was hidden by the Founding Fathers of the new United States after the Revolutionary War. After being double-crossed by European Sean Bean and his men while obtaining another clue in the Arctic, Cage and sidekick Justin Bertha (who nearly steals the show with his quick-witted one-liners) travel to D.C. to obtain the Declaration of Independence. It is believed that there is an invisible map on the back of that historic document. A daring cat and mouse game continues between Cage and Bean as the ultra-hot Diane Kruger (who made almost no impression in the disappointing ""Troy"") gets involved as well. Jon Voight (Cage's skeptical father) also gets thrown in the mix as the movie progresses and he does some of the best work of his career in an endearing and quietly comical role. A brilliant scavenger hunt for clues along the major cities of the East Coast will leave you on the edge of your seat. ""National Treasure"" is a fun trip to the movies. The setup (told by Cage's grandfather, Christopher Plummer) is a bit uneven and I was worried that this was going to be a disaster, but I am glad it was not. The characters are all smart and intelligent and the pace is fast and furious. Wonderful entertainment for the entire family. Surprisingly one of the finer pictures of 2004. 4 stars out of 5."

","NATIONAL TREASURE (3 outta 5 stars) After hearing some of the initial reviews I was expecting something of a train wreck here. Actually, the movie is not bad at all... in a cheesy kind of Saturday afternoon time-killing way. Some of the actions of the characters strain credibility at times... but if you just sit back and let the plot play out it's all quite entertaining. A pair of eccentric treasure hunters pick up a female ally along the way as they try to beat a rich bad man at finding the greatest cache of treasure of all time. Nicolas Cage gives an effortlessly engaging lead performance. His male and female sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) play off him quite well. The main villain (Sean Bean) is a more low-key bad guy than we tend to see in movies these days... he doesn't go on and on ranting and raving and screaming to prove how bad he is... he just proves it quite matter-of-factly through his actions. Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel do alright in a couple of minor roles that don't do much for their acting cred but probably gave their bank accounts a boost. It didn't even strike me until the very end that this was indeed a Disney MOVIE... one very much like the adventure movies they used to put out in the 50s. I was also pleasantly surprised that there were less dumb action stunts than I expected. The two major stunt scenes in the film (a car chase and a stairway cave-in) were pretty un-inspired... the movie wisely concentrates more on plot and dialogue."

Certainly the cast has thrown reality to the wind and appears to be having a grand time.<br/><br/>My only complaint, and its what keeps me from saying you you should see this in a theater instead of renting it, is that the pacing is off. It needs a zipper pace to get us from A to B. Certainly it moves well, but there were times when I just wanted to to move a bit faster.

"Brent_P","7","4","4","14 May 2005"," Nearly impossible to swallow, but very entertaining.
","National Treasure is an underrated, implausible, yet very entertaining action/adventure flick that really relies on the plot and intrigue rather than explosion filled action sequences.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage stars as Ben Gates, a historian enthusiast in search for a mythical treasure dating back to the Crusades which has alleged switch locations overtime leaving several extensive clues to follow. The movie starts you off in the middle of Gate's quest in the Artic Circle, where he is double-crossed by one of his companions, Ian Howe (predictably played by Sean Bean who usually plays these shady, back-stabbing characters in ""Goldeneye"", ""Troy"", ""Ronin"" and ""Don't Say a Word""), which ensues a race across America looking for the treasure and preserving history.<br/><br/>This movie has been deemed another ""Indiana Jones"" without the whip, leather hat and stereotypical Nazis. Instead, the movie really focuses on the implausible, puzzling clues that were left by our forefathers to guide future hunters to a hidden treasure map. The map itself is only half of the problems, as if/when it's discovered still needs to be deciphered. As implausible and unrealistic as the story, plot and Da Vince Code-like clues are, they are still pretty interesting and creative and keep the story going, leaving very few dry spots. As mentioned before it's more of a ""Goonie"" race between Gates and Bean, in which Gates is really trying to protect the certain historical landmarks, but both are actually gunning for the treasure with Bean using more ""aggressive"" tactics.<br/><br/>Cage, who usually get a little excited when he muddles through his cue cards, actually toned it downed a little bit making the film much more enjoyable. The writing is also pretty good that scarcely emits one-liners, but still adds a few comedic moments without distracting from the plot. The ending is also chewable that should alleviate any possible sequels and wraps everything up nicely.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is practically inaccurate historically and contains more outrageous clues then ""Tomb Raider"" and ""The Mummy"" series combined, but take that with a grain of salt and just sit back an enjoy the film for it's creativity and overall satisfaction."

","Well, what can I say. I'm amazed. This isn't my type of film at all and I had serious doubts about even going along with my friends and watch the film. I'm glad I did. Nicholas Cage earns all credit he can get and the director must have known that it would turn out to a success after talking him into doing the movie. They jump into action already in the first minute. There are some sequences when it's challenging not to get goose bumps. The fact that the second clue is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is hair rising. Aside of all spectacular happenings, they manage to squeeze in a love story. The cooperation of Cage and his friend is also brilliantly done. In conclusion, the audio sounds real good and there are also many natural sceneries.

I walked out of there quite entertained. I wasn't really concerned with it's similarities to The DaVinci Code or whether or not some of the historical information was accurate... I just had a good time watching the story unravel on screen. The performances were pretty decent. Nicolas Cage, as usual, does a pretty good job with the lead role, Diane Kruger looks great and Justin Bartha was very likable... the guy has perfect comic timing. Sean Bean, of course, in my humble opinion, was brilliant as the greedy, deceitful villain. A great thing about him is that he never overplays his characters.

","""National Treasure"" is a suspenseful, gripping, action packed, fast moving treasure hunt that holds your attention from beginning to end. That is, if you are ten years old. My ten year old nephew was leaning forward making the odd comment of awe throughout the film. I can say ""National Treasure"" is a fine family film for older children to enjoy with their parents. But from an adults point of view, much of this movie is plain silly. I won't provide spoilers, but within 15 minutes into ""National Treasure"" you will know what I mean. I agree with other viewers that this movie is an Indiana Jones wanna be. It is not ""Raiders"". Nicolas Cage, for whatever reason, provides a rather flat performance falling well short of Harrison Ford. The clues are also really far-reaching and formulaic. Connect the dots. Yet, ""National Treasure"" has redeeming value. It is family friendly, moves along at a brisk pace and has some excellent visuals. for kids: 8/10 for adults: 6/10"
"zardoz-13","8","8","10","18 March 2005"," Cage's best white-knuckled actioneer since ""Con-Air""
","The only characters missing from director John Turteltaub's ""National Treasure"" (*** out of ****) are Scooby Doo and Casper, the Friendly Ghost. Otherwise, this lightweight but entertaining 'live-action' Walt Disney-produced adventure opus about an invisible treasure map on the flip-side of the Declaration of Independence lands somewhere between an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger and an bloodless ""A-Team"" TV episode. The people who made ""National Treasure"" have recycled every cliché in the 'quest-for-buried-treasure genre' and borrowed ideas from bestsellers ranging from ""Raise The Titanic"" to ""The Da Vinci Code"" to make this harmless hokum about the exploits of the Knights Templar and the Free Masons. After suffering through a string of box office losers, including ""Windtalkers,"" ""Matchstick Men,"" and ""Adaptation,"" actor Nicolas Cage finally has another hit under his belt, thanks largely to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer. ""National Treasure"" amounts to an anthology of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew stories with grown-up go-getters. ""National Treasure"" ranks as Cage's best white-knuckled actioneer since ""Con-Air."" Anybody looking for ideal Thanksgiving Day fare will find few faults with the kid-friendly, PG-rated ""National Treasure,"" unless you think about what you watch while you watch it. Sure, ""National Treasure"" is hopelessly unrealistic, overwhelmingly unconvincing, and predictable from start to finish, but the chemistry conjured up between cast members, especially Cage and leading lady Diane Kruger as well as Jon Voight as his quarrelsome father, make this tongue-in-cheek tale downright fun to watch. At times, ""National Treasure"" acts like a 1930's screwball comedy masquerading as a sophisticated heist caper. Best of all, director John Turteltaub of ""Instinct"" and ""Phenomenon"" keeps this 100-minute melodrama moving at a whiplash pace with hyperbolic heroics occurring in every other scene. Okay, its credibility strained to the breaking point, ""National Treasure"" huffs and puffs through its last quarter hour to deliver its inevitable happy ending, with a chance for a sequel.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays good guy Benjamin Franklin Gates, a discredited historian as well as ex-Navy diver, who believes that America's Founding Fathers concealed a cache of loot amassed from other countries that constitutes our version of the Holy Grail. This high-concept premise would have been perfect for a Depression-era romantic comedy back in the 193Os. Anyway, Turteltaub and writers Jim Kouf of ""Rush Hour"" & ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" and Cormac & Marianne Wibberley of ""I Spy,"" ""The 6th Day,"" and ""Bad Boys 2"" lay out all the necessary exposition that audiences need to know in the first 15 minutes. Exposition is the information that the characters already know, but they have to discuss openly among themselves, so that audiences will understand what's happening. Once they've established their improbable premise, Turteltaub and company never look back. ""National Treasure"" barrels along like an old-fashioned Republic serial with its heroes and adversaries lunging intrepidly through one flaming hoop after another. As it turns out, our stalwart hero's crusade to uncover the hoard behind the Declaration of Independence has been something of an obsession to the Gates Clan. In the beginning, an adolescent Benjamin learns about the fabulous fortune from his grandfather (Christopher Plummer of ""Dracula 2000"") while his father Patrick (Jon Voight of ""Ali"") stands by and scoffs at the fable. Patrick Gates belittles the family quest as a pointless hunt that turns up nothing more than a trail of clues. Initially, the story takes Cage to the Arctic. Fellow treasure hunter Ian Howe (Sean Bean of ""GoldenEye"") and he discover an ancient ornate meerschaum pipe in a frozen-over, 19th century wooden sailing vessel. At this point, Howe double-crosses Gates and leaves our protagonist to perish in the icy, inhospitable wasteland. Naturally, our hero and his wise-cracking computer-whiz kid sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha of ""Gigli"") escape death just by the hair of their chins. When our heroes learn that the Declaration of Independence contains a treasure map, Gates realizes that Howe, an unscrupulously wealthy Brit, will inevitably steal the document. (The anti-British sentiment in ""National Treasure"" may be the film's only lapse in political correctness.) Meanwhile, Riley and he alert the FBI and Washington conservator Dr. Abigail Chase (sexy Diane Kruger of ""Troy""), but neither believe them anymore than anybody believed the old man when he cried 'wolf!' At this point, Gates decides to purloin the Declaration to protect it from Howe. The message here clearly is that the ends sometimes justify the means.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" ought to have been called ""National Treasures."" The adrenaline-laced action transpires at the National Archives, the Lincoln Memorial, Philadelphia's Independence Hall, New York's Wall Street Trinity Church, and the Old North Church in Boston. No sooner does our hero swipe the Declaration than he contends with not only the greedy Howe and his gun-toting minions, but also the National Archives conservator who refuses to let the document out of her sight. Gates, Chase, and Riley manage to stay one breathless step ahead of Howe's henchmen and the FBI headed up by Sadusky (Harvey Keitel of ""Reservoir Dogs"") until the last half of the movie when Howe gains the upper hand. Harvey Keitel appears to be channeling his Winston Wolfe character from ""Pulp Fiction,"" with make-up designed to recall Johnny Depp from ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Overall, Turteltaub confines violence to the absolute minimum, dispenses almost entirely with profanity, and shows nothing of an overtly sexual nature, typically the bread-and-butter of this type of pulse-pounding potboiler.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" doesn't hold up well to close scrutiny, but the characters are so charismatic and the storytelling so snappy that this popcorn thriller will have you cheering from the edge of your seat even though you know there's a happy ending in sight."

","Not realistic, in thinking that the Declaration of Independence can be accessed (in 2 ways in 5 minutes which is unbelievable); but in how the action parts are plausible, disregarding that a shotup van in Washington would have a relatively easy getaway. No sickening KillBill or ruthless Gladiator. This movie had a great plot, wonderful casting and amazing research. The directing got 100% from its actors, and even though the fiction rates up their with Indiana Jones, it matches those epics with glory. Give credit to it as did its cast and producer. Also refreshing is the subject of history with a bit of romance. Maybe Men are from Mars and Woman from Venus. History brings romance with substance. Although Maid in Manhattan is a fine Chick Flick with character, I now have another gem that rates up their with Kate and Leopold; National Treasure. 9 popcorns out of 10."

","This review might contain some spoilers, so please be wary if you don't want anything spoiled. I tried hard to be as discrete as possible. This movie is one of my favorites and is a post Christmas and pre-New Year's annual tradition in our house.<br/><br/>It is not necessarily a winter or end of December themed movie, but this movie feels right for us to watch around the same time each year. Just our fun family tradition!<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie itself! Great overall cast! Nicholas Cage is awesome! Fits the lead role well! The guy who plays Riley is a good one too! Plays a smart, likeable, and useful techie well! Diane Kruger impresses me too and still does to this day! She's a great deal of talent! The guy who plays Agent Sadusky from Pulp Fiction, which I never saw but heard he was also in, is also a show stealer as well along with Jon Voight and Sean Bean! Phenomenal cast overall! The other lesser known bad guy characters in the film are great Fast and the Furious-action movie type of actors as well! Definitely cool feel, especially the action scenes. A great mix of action and techie references and geographical references and a great overall cast of actors! Also great and non-corny one liners as well! Jon Voight has the best one-liners here! They all make me laugh every time!<br/><br/>Let's get to the great geographical/historical aspects! Being from around Philly, and having been somewhere in each main city in the film before, it was fun to see notable places I know in real life, especially in Philly, and this includes some non-historical places used in the film as well. Don't wanna spoil anything, but one of the most known food places in the Philly metro area was a cool scene, and I was at that place when I was in the city at the end of this past January, and I thought about the logistics of that scene and how it may have been filmed, and it was nifty.<br/><br/>All in all, very fun and entertaining movie! The perfect mix of fiction, real-life geographic and historical references, and just a fun ""treasure hunt!""<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch over and over rather than a once and done watch!"

"Moonhawk1975","10","8","11","10 April 2005"," My favorite movie of 2004
","I loved this movie. It may be far-fetched, but the characters have such conviction in what they are doing and director Jon Turteltaub has filmed it in such an exciting fashion that it succeeds in being a fanciful entertainment and my favorite film of 2004.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage stars as Ben Gates, the latest in a long line of treasure hunters, who believes in a mythical treasure hidden by the founders of our country. Despite everyone believing him to be a joke, he continues his quest for the gold and is even able to secure financial backing to do so. In the movie's least convincing sequence (I can only suspend disbelief so far), he finds a clue in a Revolution-era war shiplocated in the middle of the Arctic! And only buried a few feet from the surface!! The screenplay explains that the ice sometimes pushes objects to the surface, but come on! That said, he discovers the map to the treasure is hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence and his former financiers (led by Sean Bean) are out to steal it for themselves. This sets up the rest of the movie, full of action scenes that may not be original but are imaginative and well-executed. It's been a long while since a movie entertained me in such a way that I was not concerned about how long until it was over. I was actually disappointed to see this one end.<br/><br/>The acting is about what one would expect from a film of this kind. Cage is passable as the hero of the movie; he tends to reflect how good a movie is. He's good in good movies, fair in OK movies and horrible in bad movies. I liked his performance here; he lends a quiet shyness to the character that is entirely fitting. When he is thrust into action, he seems to do so only for the sake of preserving history. Bean makes for a perfect villain; deceptively friendly when he needs to be and perfectly menacing when the script demands it.<br/><br/>The action pieces are highly entertaining; I was surprised given that previously Turteltaub was better known for lightweight comedies or mid-level dramas. It looks as though he has found his calling. The stealing of the historic document that is the center of the movie is thrilling. But, the most fun sequences are the race to find a clue hidden in the buildings of Philadelphia that can only be found at a certain time of day due to the position of the sun; and the deep, hidden catacombs that hold the treasure.<br/><br/>The central mystery is purely fiction, but I am unsure of the facts that are used to propel the story. I imagine they are as well. The movie made me want to pop open a history book and find out."

"kpetnews","1","40","83","11 December 2006"," Truly a lame movie from beginning to end
","Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me... treasure ""protector"", whatever that means) who is descended from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our Founding Fathers, most if not all Freemasons, had decided to hide because they just didn't want to finance their Independence all that badly.<br/><br/>The first clue turns out to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal ""Gigli"") and a couple of faceless lackeys, enter the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor, not that this is significant in any way. At last they find the clue (a skeleton is hovering over it) and it turns out to be a pipe with writing... on it. Sort of. Don't ask me to explain.<br/><br/>It's a riddle, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure, Gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle, in this frozen cargo hold, while the crew just stands around slack-jawed. I mean, come on. Someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking Arctic and not finding anything interesting, but they just stand there as Gates enters his own world, solving the riddle.<br/><br/>The next clue turns out to be on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is appalled. Various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition (get used to it). All this leads to Ian's lackey pulling a gun on Gates, and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion. (oh, that's why they spilled all the gunpowder! Huh!!) Ian and his henchmen make their escape, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an Inuit village in order to stop them.<br/><br/>To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley must steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the Declaration, because it's so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there's an opportunity to steal it from the Preservation Room. Does Riley know what the Preservation Room is, Gates asks? ""A place where they make jams and jellies?"" I am not kidding; that's the actual line. Bartha doesn't deliver it like a joke, either. So Riley does all this research about the Library of Congress and the Archives and water and sewage, fercryinoutloud, but doesn't know what the Preservation Room is. This pretty much indicates what level this script is on.<br/><br/>To make the rest of this short, Gates does in fact make off with the D of I, in a ridiculous break-in that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies -- full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends up tagging along for convenience's sake, and as an obvious ""love interest"" angle. At one point, the three of them, on the run from the law, discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store, surrounded by people.<br/><br/>A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father, played by a dyspeptic Jon Voight, leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge Indiana Jones fun-house located underneath New York City. Odd that the subway builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian off on a wild goose chase. Ian believes they're trapped in a cul-de-sac and leaves them there. However, after they're gone, Riley asks how they're going to get out. Gates...<br/><br/>... oh boy ...<br/><br/>... presses a button and a door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, like they might have on a vacu-flush lavatory in an office building. Good thing he knew where that was. Anyway, after some more knob-twiddling, they find this immense treasure room (remember, this is all underneath Manhattan!) full of all sorts of historyish golden things. Riley gets to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean, and allows the two chemistry-less leads to get married.<br/><br/>For any viewer, I think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition, the leaps of logic, and the stereotyped characters for very long. Though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments. I'd like more conversations like that in my life."

","After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it.

","National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero, and this film is no ""Indiana Jones"". People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.<br/><br/>I can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for. Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous. I also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film. Simply put: it's just OK at best.<br/><br/>National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what it does have from ""The Da Vinci Code"". I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense.<br/><br/>The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting the ""bad guys"" and experiencing what is supposed to be ""non-stop action"" is absurd. I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it. Oh brother! <br/><br/>Reminded me of that episode of the ""Brady Bunch"" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except, that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film! <br/><br/>The idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the US is outlandish. Literally, there are thousand of undiscovered ""priceless"" items in this treasure trove. Yeah right!! Ridiculous!! <br/><br/>Even worse, the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be ""tough"" clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous!!! Oh.. the humanity! <br/><br/>The performances by Cage, Voight, and the other actors in ""National Treasure"" are as stiff ,wooden, and flat as they come. However, when you're working with such lousy dialogue, it's hard to fault the actor's 100% for that.<br/><br/>National Treasure is an OK film to see once. I can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT purchase this over the top, outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess.<br/><br/>Rent it if you must see it first......."

","Well it looked good on paper,Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again, this time on a mix of heist movie, Da Vinci Code,American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a puerile script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.)I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense, no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour."

","National Treasure is not a documentary, it's a story, and as long as you realise that before you go in to watch it you should be very pleased with what you find.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage has been on a quest his whole life to find something (the eponymous National Treasure) and we follow him as he goes after it. Simple as that. The story holds together very well and the action moves forwards in a very slick, polished kind of a way.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from this because I'd heard some very lukewarm reviews, but people really need to stop saying that every movie that comes out is trying to be something else and assess them on their own merits. Nicholas Cage is as good as ever, the plot works just as it should, it grabs your attention early on and - if you let it - will sweep you happily along as things steadily unfold.<br/><br/>Although the ending wasn't great, overall this movie works very well.

Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase, Justin Bartha as Riley Poole and Sean Bean as Ian Howe do take care of their parts sufficiently.

","National Treasure is a fun movie to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. The story is that hundreds of years ago, the country's Founding Fathers hid the world's greatest treasure somewhere in the world. Centuries later, a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) tries to put together the clues in order to find and protect the treasure from his adversary (Sean Bean) while staying ahead of the FBI. Just getting the map, printed on the back of the Declaration of Independence, might prove to be his biggest challenge. The plot sounds ridiculous but once you learn who's behind it then it makes sense. Nicholas Cage stars as Ben and he is pretty good. Diane Kruger is very beautiful and she does a very good job in this film. Jerry Bruckheimer, for the most part, always makes entertaining films and this one is pretty good. The action is solid and the direction is pretty good. The dialogue has some lame lines but that has to be expected in this type of film. The film is 131 minutes long so there some boring scenes and the film is pretty predictable as there's nothing new. It has a PG rating so its a fun movie for the entire family.

(for example the unequal wondering about that wooden construction under the church, old supernatural glasses..... ) But why would makers of this commercial do a all proper movie for wide audience ?

"Sparrowmaniac","9","2","2","12 February 2005"," 'Jack Of All Trades, Master Of None'
","Last week I went to see National Treasure with 2 things on my mind. First, I was a Cage fanatic, I love his movies packed with unbelievable action and second, this movie was given thumbs down by practically all critics. After seeing the movie I can understand why the critics disliked the film. <br/><br/>All the incidents happens at such a tremendous pace that it is hard to believe that just 2 mere guys happen to steal the Declaration Of Independence which must surely be the most protected document existing on the face of this earth. Although the entire concept of the movie is excellent and it has a lot of historical references, (I dunno if they are incorrect, since I'm not a history prof). The plot of the movie is somewhat similar to 'The DaVinci Code'. <br/><br/>But the entire movie would be highly underestimated if you are judging by the fast pace of the movie. At the beginning young Gates finds out that his family holds a secret, a secret that leads to a treasure, a treasure so big and so huge that it is not for one person to handle. Then he gets the first clue to the treasure, and the next scene he is at some polar ice caps searching for a ship. I mean where do we know the clue is a ship.........<br/><br/>Also, the entire affair, if indeed there was an affair, between Cage and Kruger is extremely patchy, to say the least. Jon Voight is marvelous as Cage's father, he plays an unforgettable role. Also, Riley Cage's assistant adds comic relief to the movie. I must say that the director tried to create a classic but extremely patchy screenplay, plays down his attempt to create a 'Jack of all trades'. He wanted a mixture of all recent Cage movies in one. We can clearly see a touch of 'Gone In 60 Seconds', 'Con Air' and 'Windtalkers'. <br/><br/>Apart from these minute omissions of detailing, mainly to reduce the length of the movie, it is thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a Nicholas Cage fanatic, I'm sure you'd love this movie. As for others go and have a glimpse of it. Don't listen to the critics, it ain't that bad. And if you love watching movies about high priority steals, then also there is a scope of liking to your plate.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10."

It may have been because it was so much better than my expectations or it may have been that the plot slowly reels you in and you have to know more within the first 30 minutes. Though a little bit slow it kinda goes with the story line of the movie. The ending is good for it is unrealistic like the rest of the movie. It was a great family movie and night out.

","The rating (6.1 as of this writing) doesn't do this film justice. I've looked forward to this film ever since I heard it went into justice, and having just seen it I can say that the wait has been worth it. While it lacks any great depth in terms of soul-searching or otherwise meaningful issues, it IS an extremely entertaining film. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, has you laughing frequently, has a REALLY hot woman... it's just a ton of fun. Even my wife who thought it looked stupid really enjoyed it. It was about as good as an Action/Adventure gets. I personally liked it A lot better than the Indiana Jones movies, which I've never really understood why those particular films are so idolized. This film puts them to shame in terms of pacing, the thrill of the ride, the eye candy, everything. Great film. In my book a film that deserves a 6.1 is Tomb Raider (either of them), this film deserves far better. Most of the theater seemed to be enjoying it as much as I (and my wife and brother) were. See it, you'll definitely be entertained."
"Nightscream","7","2","2","21 October 2004"," Implausibly silly but lots of fun
","As Jerry Bruckheimer films go, this is not going to have the wide mass appeal of 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but it's not offensive like 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor', and quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage comes off as quite sympathetic as Benjamin Franklin Gates, the seventh in a line of archivists, treasure hunters and history buffs stretching back to a confidant of President Andrew Jackson. As a child, Ben was imbued by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer) with not only a love of American history, but a love of stories of knight quests, secreted treasures, maps, and clues hidden deep within the grooves of American History trivia.<br/><br/>Ben's father (Jon Voight) does not approve of his father encouraging such nonsense in his son, and his dialogue strangely reads like a non-Bruckheimer fan in the audience voicing his skepticism of the absurd plot to follow, but Ben nonetheless comes to believe his grandpa's story about how the treasure discovered by the Knights Templar within the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt during the Crusades was hidden in America to keep it out of the hands of Britain.<br/><br/>30 years later, Ben and his partner Ian Howe ('The Lord of the Rings's Sean Bean) and comedic foil Riley (Justin Bartha) come to conclude that there may be an invisible map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence leading to the treasure, and when Ben refuses to go along with Ian's plan to steal it, and the authorities refuse to listen to him, Ben is forced to foil Ian's crime, and ends up with the stolen document himself, with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger from 'Troy'), the beautiful archivist in charge of the National Archives (because naturally, archivists working at the National Archives tend to be such lookers) dragged into the chase against her will. With FBI agent Harvey Keitel on their trail, Ben and his partner Riley (Justin Bartha), along with Abigail, race to find the treasure before Ian.<br/><br/>What follows is a series of chase scenes as the treasure hunters find and search for clues leading them from one historic place to another across three different states, clues that are steeped in the minutiae of American history lore (I have no idea of any of these points is based in historical fact, but in a movie like this, it hardly matters), with Jon Voight again providing the sole voice of reason as he questions whether these clues are just an endless series of arrows pointing to other clues rather than to any real destination.<br/><br/>The action isn't too implausible, the characters are likable, and the movie is just plain fun. The planning and machinations that the film supposes on the part of the Founding Fathers seems wildly implausible, but it doesn't matter. This is a Jerry Bruckheimer film, and one of the better ones. It's take on history may be fluff, but at least it endeavors an interest in it as a prerequisite for the plot, and a medium through which the audience may think to themselves, 'Ooh, I didn't know that about Benjamin Franklin.' If you're an expert in history bothered by the mistakes or flaws about Liberty Bell, or the Masons, or the hidden secrets on our currency, or who just plain doesn't buy the technological sophistication required for some of the artifacts uncovered by the characters, then perhaps you're watching it for the wrong reasons. If you don't know one way or the other, then it doesn't really matter. This is a popcorn film, and if you know anything about Jerry Bruckheimer, you should know going in what you're getting.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer was in attendance last night, and gave the brief speech before the movie began (which not usually the case outside of premieres-this was just a press screening), and right before leaving when the closing credits started, I complimented him, saying it was very entertaining.<br/><br/>If you like to sit back and have fun, I recommend it."
"mainecoon50","2","17","34","19 June 2005"," Clearly meant for the kids.
","I watched this movie last night on one of the pay-per-view channels, and while watching it I quickly wondered why I bothered. In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of 'Conspiracy Theory'. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now I'm wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a là 'The Goonies', which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps it's because 'The Goonies' was clearly targeted toward the pre-teen and teen audiences. Whereas 'National Treasure', judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is one thing. It's how one can enjoy sci-fi and horror. But I found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy-laden tripe being shoved at the audience. Oh, the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment. ""Wow! The Masons. The Knights Templars. You know, this could really be true!"" I think the writer really lost me when Gates said the Founding Fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British! And just were did the Knights Templar come from? New Jersey? Oh, I forget. From France! Which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in Philadelphia during the Revolution. It was brought there by agents of Napoleon! Anyway, you see what I'm getting at. The premise of the movie is interesting. And I really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama. But it just comes off as another kid flick in grown-up clothing. In the end I think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree.<br/><br/>I've just finished watching several items by Werner Herzog and Istvan Szabo. It's a shock to switch from fine dining to Hollywood Big Mac and fries.<br/><br/>Okay, okay. If you pant over chases, explosions, and 'gee-whiz' gimmickry you'll enjoy 'National Treasure'. But it's the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out? And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like, ""Wow! Did you see how that thing blew up? That was so cool!"" 'National Treasure' is that kind of movie."
"film-critic","1","24","51","25 May 2005"," Are we there yet? I'm hungry. This car smells weird.
","National Treasure was a failure as a film. While the monetary figures will not support this comment, I will say that upon viewing this film, it is nothing but accurate. From the clichéd story, to the cheap acting, to even the simplistic ""clues"" National Treasure proved that if you have a big named actor in the lead, some pre-high school history, and a powerhouse producer (and the big Pirates of the Caribbean passion) that you could literally sell a screen door on a submarine. What was the excitement behind this film? Why is there still a waiting list at my video store for this title? There was nothing of value from the beginning to end of this film that would ever cause the hysteria that I have seen so far. Nicolas Cage proves to the world that he is the male version of Marisa Tomei (questioning his choices after his deserved Oscar win), and that he has the ability to run, jump, and reason with the greatest of speed. Acting wasn't necessarily needed, just the ability to look smarter than one truly is.<br/><br/>With my questions posed as to how the success of this film became a part of American cinema, I thought back to this film. The acting was atrocious. Nic Cage looked and acted just like a mannequin throughout this entire film. There was no range of emotion or excitement in anyway. His romantic involvement with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) was like watching two complete strangers try to build a passionate relationship in ten minutes. It was awkward, cheesy, and embarrassing for all those involved. Even the acting from the ""comic relief"" of the film, Cage's sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) seemed forced. His jokes didn't make me laugh once, but instead made me feel uneasy and cheated out of some hard earned cash plopped down for this film. To have a successful ""action-adventure"" film, you must have it firmly stapled with some decent acting. If big stars are only going to water down your film (as in the case of National Treasure), then you must find smaller stars and build upon the story. These are simple rules, which nobody in this production followed.<br/><br/>With no acting in place, I was forced to watch the story unfold before my eyes. Actually, the story felt like a crumpled piece of paper thrown at me. There was no direction, no points for me to follow, but instead haphazard movement by our actors and director to keep the flow of the film in motion instead of becoming stale. Sadly, they were unable to do this. From the opening ""clue"" to the final one, there was little to no explanation as to why nobody else had found this treasure, or how local historians had never found the hidden artifacts scattered around hugely populated areas. I would understand if we were searching cornfields, but we were in metropolises and nobody discovered these clues until today. It was just rather unbelievable to me. I felt like this story was yelling at me. Violently forcing me to follow each clue without explanation, but out of sheer hope that something bigger would happen. I work better when there is some moment of ""why"" thrown into the mix. A moment that allows the viewers to think for themselves instead of being treated like children. After viewing this film, that was how I felt. I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions, but instead the power of Bruckheimer was forcing me to think in one way, and one way only. It hurt this film and upset me until the final credits arrived.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say (because I am sure that most are upset with my dislike of this film) that another point that hurt this film was the lack of action. This movie is labeled as the next Indiana Jones, but if you grew up with the stories of Lucas and Spielberg, you will remember that they were action based. There were moments of realization, but there was much more action involved. I think more action incorporated into the National Treasure story would have helped it survive a bit longer than what it did. I wanted to see some traps set forth by our founding fathers, some ancient guards, or anything that would have lifted the lifeless plot that surrounded this film. My mother said that it just needed better bad guys, and I couldn't agree more. There wasn't that fire in Bean's eyes that you were accustomed to seeing in the Indy films. Nobody was tied up, nobody had a whip, and nobody was trying. Bruckheimer, you literally need to stop.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't impressed with this Hollywood ""hit"". While most will argue that they thought it was the most impressive film they have seen in a long time (words that I have heard time and time again), I just thought that it never went to the next level. The cliché acting hurt this film dearly, while the story just never reached up and grabbed me. I never felt like Turtletaub (ummmmmm....Turtletaub) quite knew what he was getting himself into. He needed a stronger balance between action and adventure, and needed to allow us to make our own decisions instead of forcing his thoughts into our face. This film was a complete disrespect to our history, and I denounce it forever! <br/><br/>Grade: * out of *****"

","The cookie cutter script itself has become so clichéd that you'd think most studios would avoid it. But alas, it supposedly will sell tickets. Studios assume the general public is stupid, so movies like this get made. The lead female who is in a very important position of authority, is also super hot and could be a model if she wanted, of course, unlike real life. There's the miscast side kick who utters terribly forced lines that are not funny, nor original and of course Nic Cage, who's here only for a paycheck.<br/><br/>Big name studios simply pull out the big budget template, change the names and locations and fill in little details here and there have a ""new"" movie. This movie was so amazingly unbelievable (so many things conveniently occur or are allowed to happen) and poorly written (the forefathers somehow were able to create images on the back of the Constitution with material that was probably only available in the last 20 years), I'm saddened that it made money. Maybe the general public isn't that bright..."
"savagesteve13","1","10","18","20 May 2007"," Incredibly silly movie
","It would be best suited for children if not for the murders, accidental deaths by falling, and un-necessary car chases. I watched this and want my 2 hours back. I'm no fan of Nick Cage and this movie reminds me of why I'm no fan of Nick Cage. If you want to see the declaration of independence get folded, spindled, mutilated, rolled up like a Van Halen poster, doused with lemons, and hit with a hairdryer then this is the movie for you. I cringed as bad as when Mr. Bean ruined the painting of Whistler's Mother. Did I mention it was an incredibly silly movie? And the chemistry between Cage and the blonde chick was about zero. He just grabbed her and kissed her out of the blue, the man has no timing. This is nothing but masonic propaganda. Propaganda films never work their subject well. Look at other examples as ""The Postman"" (USPS), or ""The Omega Code"" (Christian Fundies). The only real actor in this flick is Sean Bean, who plays the generic evil dude with guns who chases Nicholas Cage throughout the flick.<br/><br/>My only question is this: If the masons hid all this stuff, why didn't they give it all back later if its destined for humanity? Lots of that stuff didn't belong to them and I'm sure lots of foreign nations would be angry that the founding fathers hoarded it. Zahi Hawas, head of the Egyptian antiquities museum would be none too pleased."

","This movie is like the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable ""unlikely"" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and ""National Treasure"" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie."

It reminded me slightly of The Mummy which at least did not try to be anything other then a horror/comedy kid flick.<br/><br/>I went with friends at their request. I wish I had not. It struck me as little more then American propaganda. Why should the treasure be hidden from just the English, surely it was necessary to hide it from anyone who would try to benefit from it, I mean we have Hitler who was known for stealing art works, Mussolini was hardly a nice character either? How did it come to be in the hands of a bunch of Americans anyway when the Freemasons and the Knights Templar were of European origin? That was really implausible, if it were in the keeping of the Knights Templar and then the Freemasons it would of been hidden somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>When sconces which are generally oil or tar based (ie resin from pine trees) fired up at the slightest touch of a flame I groaned. After 200 odd years the oils would have evaporated not to mention the wood rotting away. I am generally pretty good at suspending belief but that really annoyed me. Not to mention that boats trapped in ice tend to be crushed and sink when the ice melts.

No, the problem with this movie is Nicholas Cage, who has all the charisma, sex appeal, and sly wit of a stuffed eagle. Even so it might have worked, except that the other problem is the detailed, repetitive plot exposition, which is laborious at best and tedious at worst. It's fun watching the characters work their way up the East Coast from one famous landmark to the next, but after a very few minutes it starts to feel like a children's scavenger hunt. It doesn't help that instead of emotional sparks between the characters we get lots of explosions and some really awful dialogue.

He's a star-struck, or rather, treasure-struck youngster ever since his dear old grandpap first let him in on the secret of the treasure that, apparently, a long line of forebears have searching for for generations. Yet, he seems to have a streak of patriotic altruism entirely out of keeping with the drive necessary to unravel the mystery and find the treasure. And, of course, in the end he graciously and generously gives the treasure that his family has searched for, lo, these many years, to various governmental and historical agencies the world round.<br/><br/>What else is wrong? Well, I just saw it for the first time, just now. It's four AM and I admit to being a tad past mildly buzzed, but even so I kept finding myself unable to maintain the necessary suspension of disbelief required to keep from shaking my head and thinking, ""No way."" Despite the fact that he seems to have no visible means of support, he has a van tricked out with an array of electronic equipment that would put the intelligence services to shame (and did, as a matter of fact) during the theft of the Declaration of Independence, not to mention that his bosom buddy (no background whatsoever on that relationship; where did he come from?) is an expert at running covert operations at the level of stealing said DofI. Once they get it, and figure out where they have to go, how the hell does his arch-nemesis know to go to Phillie, too? And how the hell does this same nemesis know about the friggin' glasses (OK, oculars, what the hell), which NO ONE in his crew was around to see Cage find? Then they descend into the crypt and chambers beneath Trinity Church and find that both the torches and the entirely improbable channeled lighting system (oil/kerosene remaining stationary on inclined channels??) fire right up. I suppose one is obligated to imagine that volatiles put in place centuries earlier have not evaporated or turned to sludge.<br/><br/>I wish I could recall more of the things that I found completely unbelievable about this movie, especially since I just saw it. But, hey, I already said that I am a bit impaired at the moment. GOK what I might have remembered otherwise. Cage gives another Cage performance. He doesn't seem to be able to get past playing himself. Ms Kruger was, is, lovely indeed, but unfortunately they included a clothes-changing scene where her feet were shown for a few minutes. Her ballet background, unfortunately, showed itself in this scene. Ever known a ballerina? I have; went to college with several. Her poor feet were destroyed by the training in and practice of her art. I happen to be a ""leg man,"" and find a well-turned, trim ankle and dainty feet quite attractive. After seeing that scene where her devastated feet were the focus of attention, I could not thenceforward look upon her with the same undiluted (though ultimately vicarious) desire that I had felt before.<br/><br/>The shame is, with a little more work on the logical inconsistencies, and a little more background on the principals (where the hell did his sidekick get his surveillance equipment and skills?), and a few less clichés, this might have made a pretty good action flick. As it is, I'm stretching to give it a five. 'Nuff said. P.S. Re: Jon Voight. Hey, Jon. I know you probably pulled down some nice coin on this.

In fact, they presumably were/are responsible for some of the most terrible crimes in history, right there with Stalin and Hitler. The crusades were unjustified attacks on the East, just like Vietnam and Iraq today (yes, I agree with those IMDb commentators that wrote about this parallel).<br/><br/>2. ""The Declaration of Independence is not a bargaining tool. Not for me"", or something like that. Not only that it is propaganda, but it is active and brutal propaganda.

I am not saying that America is not be praised for its obvious qualities, but believe me, extremism is the same, regardless of political beliefs.<br/><br/>5. Museums that were not shown in the movie: ""How we stole the land from the Indians Museum"" ""How we promoted slavery Museum"" ""How we kill our Presidents if they become undesirable Museum"" Don't get me wrong, I appreciate America for its qualities, but it does have the tendency to be pretty defensive about the negative aspects.<br/><br/>6. My 1/10 has nothing to do with the actors or the work that went in this movie, just with its sheer stupidity."

","Hee, for a family adventure film that made a profit of over $247 million at the worldwide box office, you would think there would be more people standing up for the film and its subsequent sequel. Yet admitting to enjoying National Treasure is frowned upon, like it was some fluke of a hit and anyone bold enough to stick up for it clearly has taken leave of their respective senses.<br/><br/>National Treasure is what it is in simplistic terms, a rollicking good adventure yarn, one that is ripe with outlandish writing and implausibilities a go go, in other words fun fun FUN! Detractors can call it an Indiana Jones rip off all they like, but really what is wrong with that formula being followed anyway? Is it not allowed to be copied? Bizarre given that the Indy films owe their very being to a handful of action adventure films of old. While comparisons to The Da Vinci Code are fair if out of context given the target audience for the Tom Hanks starrer.<br/><br/>Plot basically finds Nick Cage as Benjamin Gates, a historian and cryptologist who is searching for some lost treasure once protected by the Knights Templar. Hired by Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Gates finds an important clue but is betrayed by Howe and his cronies and has to continue his search with Howe hot on his tail. Along for the ride with Gates are National Archives expert Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and computer whizz kid Riley Poole (Justin Bartha). Story lurches from one clue to another, with much crash banging and escapades aplenty, while Harvey Keitel's cop enters the fray when the film's MacGuffin is stolen.<br/><br/>National Treasure is streamlined for the family audience, yes some of the cryptic wafflings will go over youngsters heads, and for sure it helps to have a modicum of American history knowledge, yet this is still a picture the whole family can enjoy whilst sitting in the same room together. It obviously lacks an end of the world peril, or the breakdown of religious society, but the action does flow and drama is not in short supply (the Declaration of Independence scenes are expertly constructed). The cast, with the exception of the bland Kruger, attack the material with the requisite tongue in cheek gusto, particularly Cage who make geeks cool and Bartha with astute comic ability, and viewing it in High Definition reveals some beautiful colour photography by Caleb Deschanael.<br/><br/>Credulity is stretched, it goes over the top and malarkey often reigns supreme, but the makers aren't making a cerebral thriller. They achieve exactly what they set out to do, to make a fun action mystery adventure film that doffs its cap to films of previous years. Roll on to the sequel, I hope it's equally as fun and outlandish... 7.5/10"

","I saw this for the first time recently when it was on television. I quickly realized that this movie is for kids. I could see having an interest in this movie if I was 8 years old. It reminds me of a game on the back of a cereal carton. I think this movie was rushed to be made while the DaVinci Code hype was still buzzing to fill the void in the market that the DaVinci code's adult ratings could not retrieve. <br/><br/>I once ordered a Pizza Hut personal pizza for delivery, and when the pizza finally arrived, it was the size of my palm; I could not help but to laugh; this movie gave me the same feeling, the feeling of embarrassment. The joke was on me.<br/><br/>In sum, I used to like that movie Cloak & Dagger with Dabney Coleman, but if I were to enjoy it at 33 years old without children, I would consider my mental growth stunted."

He's not too hard on the eyes either.<br/><br/>As a gal who is quite interested in history, this was not only a fun film, but leads you to wonder.

"darkangel-5","6","3","4","23 January 2005"," Great and entertaining movie, but...
","First off: don't read my comment if you haven't yet watched this movie.<br/><br/>It's a great and entertaining movie with a great and gripping story, and next to perfect casting. Nicolas Cage was a perfect choice for the role of our modern day crusader, he is just believably enthusiastic throughout the whole movie. Sean Bean plays a perfect villain, not the first time around during his career. He already made a great villain in 'Don't Say A Word'. Harvey Keitel is great in the role of the FBI agent and Diane Krüger seems to become a mature actress in Hollywood.<br/><br/>My only biggest problem with this movie is that Jerry Bruckhemer and co. not just haven't read Da Vinci Code, but haven't even heard of it?? While the book has been on the bestsellers list for months and even a movie is being made of it, National Treasure has a way too similar plot to the book (except for the usual Dan Brown start-up scenes with a mysterious murder). So while the movie is entertaining and highly enjoyable, it's just still like Da Vinci Code placed in the United States. Looks like if Bush, Cheney and the Republican campaign advisors wanted to re-write Dan Brown's book: the story is relocated to the USA and has been filled up with greed, national pride, a huge load of patriotism, all kinds of clandestine organizations and hunting/searching for things whose existence is questioned by everyone except for the hunters. With the only exception that this time around they hunt for treasures of great historical value and not for mass destruction weapons. And of course there comes the unmissable happy ending with the actual finding of the treasure, I didn't expect. I guess I won't get any answers to my question about the similarity between the movie and Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>Besides all this it's a good movie, even a good history lesson, so you won't waste your money and time if you watch it. Highly recommended for those who liked Da Vinci Code and for those who like action scenes that may seem more humorous than believable (e.g. when Cage's assistant hacks into the security system of the National Archives through a laptop computer sitting in a van parked just outside the building)."
"bjones","9","3","4","1 December 2004"," Pleasant Surprise
","I have to be honest and confess that I went to see this movie because I had already seen everything else I was interested in. There was nothing in the trailers that really made me want to see it. My reaction to them was ""rip-off of the Indiana Jones Series, it might stink"". I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Well, semi wrong. It was in the Indy Jones genre of action-mystery swathed in a liberal dose of historic background. I think filmmakers hit a chord with audiences when they use a historical base because it makes it easier for the moviegoer to buy into the film's concept because they can relate to it from outside the world of Hollywood. In this case, the film is liberally sprinkled with historic factoids, some of which are even true (Well, it's still Hollywood after all.). All-in-all this is a movie made just for fun with the same sort of 1940's-50's Saturday afternoon moviehouse serial kind of thrills to it. So I guess Jon Turteltaub gets a big thank you from me for giving me this fun and entertaining film to pass away a snowy Sunday afternoon. But my highest praise goes to some possibly accidental additions, the actual presentation of an education as a good and desirable thing and for making the subject of history something other than the dry, boring exercise so many school kids think it is. For those, bless you guys one and all.<br/><br/>Let's continue with the cast. I have to say I haven't enjoyed Nicholas Cage as much in a movie since Moonstruck. He fit the part here for me. I don't think I could buy him as a serious academic, but as this screw up version of one he seems perfect.... sorry Mr. Cage. His nemesis here is his former partner played by Sean Bean, who made an excellent bad guy with just the right emphasis and not too much. I hate over-the-top characters usually (The one possible exception being Alan Rickman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). The striking and enjoyable Diane Kruger played the late entry love-interest for Cage. I liked her even if her character is entirely too beautiful for the dull administrator part. I hope to see more of her in films too. Hollywood again. But the real pleasant treasure in this film for me was the performance of Justin Bartha. I think this is the first thing I've seen him in and he made the overall cast far more enjoyable to me for the counterpoint he made with just the right touch of wit. He was so good I will now look for his name in film credits again hoping to see more of the very good things he seems to be very capable of. Bravo to casting for his selection here. The rest of the supporting cast was quite excellent too and doubtless responsible for the consistently overall excellence of the film. Jon Voight as Cage's Dad, Harvey Keitel as the G-Man and Christopher Plummer as the elder Gates were all very enjoyable to watch here.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was up to the standards set for it with the ambitious and excellent script. Costumes, music, art direction, sets, second unit work, everything was great and blended seamlessly into great, old-fashioned entertainment. I'd recommend this for the whole family."

","It's hard to make a PG rated movie that the entire family can enjoy. Harder than that, it's even worse for Disney to make a movie that can entertain children and keep their parents interested as well. National Treasure has just enough history and drama to keep the adults watching. Also, the movie has enough explosions, action sequences and thrills to keep any young adult and most children happy. Not your typical Nicholas Cage role, here we see Nicholas the serious and not the ""over the top"" performance that we have seen him, like in Con-Air and the Rock. Cage's character is less defensive and more real. An overall good cast and story, the movie has held a large audience unlike most of the films that have gone to the box office in 2004."
"movieman-200","3","10","20","12 June 2005"," Hopeless, hapless and convoluted thriller that goes no where - FAST!
","""National Treasure"" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br/><br/>The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble  if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah  brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, ""is that the Hope Diamond?"" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, ""National Treasure"" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br/><br/>The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted  just the thick-headed."

Time after time I've seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off.

Everything was painfully predictable and sadly overblown. The only bright spot was Diane Kruger - she was at least a refreshing different face.

We have no idea why any of the characters other than Cage's do what they do. And Cage himself, well, it looks like he's forgotten how to make a decent film and make a character believable. I'm sure he got paid lots for appearing in this over-hyped money-grab. Let's hope he used it to buy something nice. This is profit-driven movie-making taken to it's worst possible outcome.

","Viewing this as an English girl is most likely a completely different viewing experience to any American watching this film. starting with the typecasting of the English villain (sean bean), and continuing with the nauseatingly patriotic tone and general anti-englishness throughout (sorry, ""britishness"") (i.e. the fact that the enemy is actually designated throughout as the British, and at the end they don't even consider the British museum as a possible site for the treasure), I found this film terrible. The historical inaccuracies are laughable throughout and I felt like hitting Nicholas Cage every time he said the ""declaration of independence"", which, whilst I respect the declaration as an important historical document, its NOT the most important document in the whole world (how about the magna carta? Rosetta stone? dead sea scrolls???), I found myself almost hoping that they would lose it. The dialog is heavy handed throughout, and Cage's leaps of logic are quite astounding, especially considering the the Knights Templar aren't really related in any way to the Freemasons, who are throughout the world, including in england, so why would the treasure be hidden from the British if there were British Freemasons? Overall, as a movie to laugh at, and a pleasant way to spend a mindless few hours, if you can ignore the numerous inaccuracies, I would recommend this film.

","This film is hard to sum up with a single rating. I really wish I could give it three scores: One for how much I personally liked it, how good the film is historically and how entertaining the film is.<br/><br/>For me, the film was a 3 or 4--mostly because I just don't like this type of film. Action films often bore me because I like characters with depth and the characters in NATIONAL TREASURE are cartoon-like and one-dimensional with little to make me connect with them. Now this isn't to say that I dislike all action films, but this one just seemed like a long string of plot devices and gimmicks strung together. The logical leaps they used to solve each riddle were just silly. And, again and again, I found myself guessing correctly what was coming next--the script was amazingly predictable and poor given that so much money was spent on special effects and high-priced actors.<br/><br/>As far as the historical value, I'm going to need to bite my tongue a bit. I am an American History teacher and need to keep reminding myself that I must suspend disbelief--after all, Disney did not intend this as a real history lesson. Sadly, however, when I talked to my students about the film, it was amazing how many thought the film DID have an actual historical basis!! Well, I can't blame Disney for the fact that kids don't know their history (well, I guess I could launch into an attack on the historical errors in POCAHONTAS but I need to keep on topic). At least the film gets people thinking about history, so that's something, so I'll give it a 5--though all the mumbo-jumbo about the Masons, secret codes, etc. was all a lot of hooey.<br/><br/>As far as entertainment for the masses go, the film is fun, slick and well-crafted (aside from the writing, that is). The film looks great and has a bigger than life feel that is at times reminiscent of INDIANA JONES and other action films. For an undemanding audience, it's going to keep their attention. In this regard, it deserves a 7 or 8. It looks pretty and is nice escapism.<br/><br/>So overall, I'd say the film deserves a 5. While I hated much of the film and would rather eat glass than see it again because of the style of film and clichéd writing, I also realize I am a very picky person and there's nothing wrong with some mindless entertainment now and again. For kids and anyone who tends to not look for plot problems, this could be a very entertaining film. For smug guys like me, you would probably do better with an independent or foreign film, documentary or silent film--you know, the kinds of film NORMAL people don't like."

","I enjoyed this movie for a while. It was a full of adventure and clue seeking. Then one clue lead to another, that clue lead to another, which lead to another, and another, and another (I'm not joking here) and another, oh look another clue, and another, and another. The clues were cool at first and the adventure was neat. But it just goes on and on, the same ""I got a clue"" formula again and again.<br/><br/>I wanted to blow my brains out. How could anyone think this a good movie? It's one clue after another and another in search of a treasure. That's ALL it is. The clues aren't even developed in an interesting way like the Da Vinci code. It's usually something you can't make out, until the supremely gifted clue decoder (Nicholas Cage) figures it out and explains it to us.<br/><br/>It was cool at first, but by the end of the movie it drives you crazy, and it really becomes laughable by the time they find their 26th clue that leads to another clue. This movie was akin to Chinese water torture. Boring, and agitating ... to say the least."

","I was terribly disappointed in this film. I watched this movie and then view CATWOMAN and in comparison, this film is much worse. It is quite easy to point out why.<br/><br/>The plot in this film has so many holes in it that you could confuse the script with a piece of Swiss Cheese. The history is not accurate, the action makes no sense, the founding fathers of the US are not even presented accurately. I could go on for a 1000 words just on the holes in this but suffice it to say the holes in the plot on this film are so big that the writers should be put on a strict diet.<br/><br/>The computerized action sequences in this are elaborate, but look too fake. I especially do not like the nearly 300 year old wood planks in a damp building basement that can still support weight and are not infested with roaches, termites, or carpenter ants. How could the pest control industry possibly buy that? <br/><br/>Cage has a capable performance, and that is the only thing that gets this film to 2 on my ratings. Take away Cage, and this film is a zero, a big zero. In fact, this film makes Cage's HONEYMOON IN VEGAS look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The support in this film gets a zero too. I can hardly remember their names. They should take that strong 200 to 300 year rope that the old elevator is on and hang this movie out to dry. I hope Cage will get some better material his next time out. If he can't get better stuff than this, he should go to TV & do a sitcom. He is wasting his talent in tripe such as this film."

I can't believe the waves of people who have come to see this movie. It never aspires to be anything more than temporary. And no one cares!!

","NATIONAL TREASURE is anything but, believe me. i came into this movie with poor expectations but a heart full of hope. i'd been in the mood to watch a good explorers/adventurers flick and finding the recent movie well a bit dry i caved in to the first one that came around. i should tell any one who considers to watch this movie that nicholas cage (who i believe to be the most useless and overrated actor of our day) fails to inspire, yet again, marvelously. apparently he was paid to be be a model for hair plugs and bad highlights because i didn't see much acting in this movie at all. some of the worst ""acting"" scenes are shared with fellow Oscar winner jon voight. someone should notify the academy and have their awards taken from them.<br/><br/>this movie hosts such an abundant array of misguided and utterly terrible choices that it is difficult to place the blame of failure on any one aspect. is it the terrible script and story? the sub-par acting? the shoddy and cliché directing? the poor choreographed and conceived over-long action sequences? maybe it's the combination of it all. <br/><br/>benjamin franklin gates, our movie's protagonist, is probably the most pedantic and boring jeopardy contestant wannabe that the silver screen has ever seen. not to mention that nicholas cage brings absolutely no life or depth to this singularly annoying and insufferable know-it-all. the makers of the movie were trying to sell us on the idea that ben is a morally constant genius with a love of history and adventure. thing is, he's really a humorless sap who is entirely socially inept. this part could have been better managed by a better, younger, and good looking actor, but i doubt it would have made up for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>the ""national treasure"" of this movie isn't so much a treasure as it is pirate's booty from centuries of yore. it's not to have one amazing treasure with singular mythological and inherent value, it has to be bigger, better. according to the logic of the film, America's forefathers--in all their freemasonry glory--stored invaluable treasures that were plundered by the romans from the egyptians and kept hidden by a secret society of knights in order to keep it out of British hands. but wait, they left a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence which takes half of the movie to steal. the rest of the movie revolves around ben's cleverness and social ineptitude getting the hottest archivist to fall in love with him and keeping his hip, young computer genius sidekick at bay. there's also something about a generational conflict with his dad. oh, and there are bad guys trying to steal the treasure for their own profit. i mean ben doesn't want the money, he wants to lay claim to helping solve a great mystery of American history. right. <br/><br/>wait for the last minute twist. so last minute and so cliché that you might just hate harvey keitel for the rest of your life for making this movie.<br/><br/>this movie is what's wrong with Hollywood today. that this movie is top box office material is what's wrong with movie audiences today. it panders to the worst part of the American pop consciousness and, despite its attempts to be clever and intelligent, aides in the dumbing down of every one who watches it--including myself. NATIONAL TREASURE succeeds at being the fluffiest, worst, and most embarrassing movie of my generation. i'm sorry to see that so many people liked it. but then again, i'm not surprised.<br/><br/>* out of 4*"

","**could be spoilers**<br/><br/>National Treasure is like an even more pathetic version of The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>To start with, the movie is totally unoriginal. Ripping off a book like the Da Vinci Code was a poor choice, since the book was terrible. This movie is worse. The plot twists don't make much sense. As many other people have attested to there are ""aha!"" moments that seem to come out of no where. Deus Ex Machina is the only way Nicholas Cage and his band of misfits (including the enemy - guy willing to kill people over history) could figure out totally inane clues that make no sense. I don't think even the smartest history buff in the world could figure half of them out, and a few of them were ridiculously easy. Why would the founding fathers try to hide this treasure? This is a question that runs back and forth in your mind the whole time. The movie says ""so the British wouldn't get it"" but that makes little to no sense. The treasure wouldn't have helped the Brits win the war, so it was pretty confusing.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible, especially for Nicholas Cage who I've enjoyed in the past. Riley (wierd computer hacker guy) was entertaining and broke away from the monotony of the hackneyed, over played, subparr acting of the other characters. Jon Voight was also relatively entertaining, but that's because he's Jon Voight.<br/><br/>I will deter and admit that the movie was mildly entertaining. It's a waste of two hours, but if you have the time to kill and don't mind spending the cash you might consider seeing it, after seeing everything else out. Maybe wait to rent it, but for the price of a rental you could see it in the theater as a matinée. I'll give it 7/10 stars for entertainment, but 1/10 for quality, intelligence, worthwhileness, originality, acting, and everything else."

Well, at least none of them had a ""Cor Blimey"" accent.<br/><br/>Justin Bartha plays the only character whose name I remember: Riley, a computer nerd, who has to explain to Cage how the Declaration of Independence is impossible to steal in full technical detail...gee, if only you mentioned that at the time Sean Bean was pointing a gun you! You could have avoided making Cage look like a hypocrite!<br/><br/>Diane Kruger plays a woman who (we are told) has a slightly non-American accent because she was born in Germany, but we're almost immediately assured that she IS American so therefore she qualifies as a goodie. <br/><br/>This film is so smug in it's pathetic attempts at being witty or smart and profoundly racist in the sense that anyone who isn't American (especially, if they're British) is probably evil. If you're one of those people who likes films that involve treasure hunting through ancient ruins, stick to Indiana Jones, which is more exciting, more witty, less phoney and above all less racist. Keep your hard-earned money away from this crap, it would be better spent on purchasing pornography.<br/><br/>Some people have tried to defend this film by saying that it's aimed at kids and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously.

","""National Treasure"" was a surprise hit for Disney and seemed to make quite a splash at the box office, which I didn't expect when I saw ads for it. Out of pure interest - and a few good things I had heard from friends - I figured I might as well check it out, since I'm a bit of a Nicolas Cage fan to begin with.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Cage's character and his pursuit to find the Masons' treasure, which he believes has been hidden and leads to a map somewhere. Eventually after an ice dig he finds the next clue - which indicates the map is printed on the back of the Constitution.<br/><br/>After the bad guy (Sean Bean) sabotages his expedition and leaves to nab the Constutition for himself, Cage teams up with his Neurotic Comic Relief Character to take the Constitution, protect it, find the treasure, and so on and so forth. Conveniently, he teams up with a sexy woman (Diane Kruger) who just so happens to work in Washington, D.C. for a museum. How convenient.<br/><br/>The movie isn't nearly as good as ""Indiana Jones"" and I didn't like the beginning at all. For example the whole process where they plan how to steal the Constitution was poorly executed. I felt like I was watching a TV commercial. The entire bit with the computer and everything was just way too TV-style to be in a feature film.<br/><br/>Cage is good, Kruger is out of place, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer are all given very little to do. The movie ends quite typically. Spoilers are ahead, so do not read any further -- -- I don't usually give out spoilers but I felt this one should be addressed. At the end, Cage is given a lecture by Keitel on how sharing the treasure with the world is the right thing to do, and so on and so forth. It's a very contrived, silly, unrealistic conclusion because we all know that, in reality, America would hog the treasure for itself. (And one might say they have a right to, as the founding fathers supposedly buried it.) A few things like this rubbed me the wrong way. They seemed too preachy and unrealistic, and because of the PG rating and the Disney marketing it comes across as a very mild version of something that could be given a harder treatment in the future.<br/><br/>But as far as family films go, this one is better than a lot of others.

Bean, Kruger, Keitel and Voigt really add some substance to this otherwise childish affair.<br/><br/>This is definitely a guilty pleasure for me. I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is, but the pacing and 'intrigue-around-every-corner' make this infinitely watchable despite all it's short-comings.<br/><br/>This is surely an audience divider, but if you like 'popcorn-fare' you should enjoy it.

","An old-fashioned treasure hunt, amped with modern technological idiocy, salted with a snide dig at the political laziness of the American people coupled with a sly *j'accuse* at their insuperably asinine government.<br/><br/>Treasure hunter Ben Gates (a characteristically mourning-faced Nicolas Cage) must steal the original Declaration of Independence before an unethical colleague (Sean Bean, whose Bad Guy coterie all wear black for convenience) steals it first. Both are after a hidden map on its back, leading to a treasure unimaginable, involving the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, and Harvey Keitel as some kind of ""cleaner"" (oh, like *that's* believable!).<br/><br/>Insipid Diane Kruger (with a very fake blond job) and ineffectual Justin Bartha are along for the joyless ride, with Jon Voight trying not so hard to convince us he didn't do this for the pay.<br/><br/>Director Jon Turteltaub, old hand at vapid cinema (*Phenomenon* (1996), *While You Were Sleeping* (1995)), finds a moment of crystallization - when Gates quotes what he describes as the defining tenet of the Declaration: ""But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such government, and provide new guards for their future security."" Considering this movie was released in 2004, when W was busy rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, it seems obvious this message was addressed to the American populace, who somehow still couldn't throw off that despot's yoke.<br/><br/>But Gates fails to take into account the twisted methodology written into the American Constitution that makes it almost impossible to actually perform what was so idealistically envisioned by this country's founders.<br/><br/>Firstly, ideological tenets cannot stand against a tyrannical government that refuses to acknowledge them; that is, how do you overthrow a government intent on staying in power by any means possible, legal or otherwise? Paraphrasing Lord Acton, John Roche warns: ""It is not so much power that corrupts, as the prospect of losing power."" (*Our Undemocratic Constitution*, Sanford Levinson.)<br/><br/>""Indeed more than one representative and senator has accompanied retirement from Congress with comments about their own frustration at the difficulty of actually getting anything done with regard to the issues that motivated them to run for public office in the first place."" (ibid.) <br/><br/>It is simultaneously at this point in the film that it loses all integrity  for after Gates recites this King's English (not one word lifted from anything other than the dictionary we all subscribe to, but admittedly phrased in a vernacular lost on this inbred iPod generation of gameslayers), Riley (Bartha) responds with ""I have no idea what you just said."" Gates even meditates after the recitation, ""People don't talk like that anymore."" Why? Because ""people"" are Riley. They need the OBVIOUS spelled out, which Gates proceeds to do  in lay-moron terms for the audience's benefit  the audience being made up of more Rileys.<br/><br/>Immediately, this supposed dunderhead Riley, goes into a detailed description of the security measures that surround the Declaration, complete with the smash-cutting visuals that this short attention span audience seems to need in order to comprehend words with over two syllables. Riley knows all the angles  except the weakest link in the security chain  the Preservation Room  because we need The Hero, Gates, to do that transparent 'splaining for the benefit of the audience once again.<br/><br/>The movie quickly degenerates to car chases, foot chases, unbelievably tenuous clues and arbitrary shooting. Factoring for inflation, all this trouble was probably for a treasure that was worth  oh, about $2.67.<br/><br/>During the heist, to rationalize his ""honest theft"" of the document, Cage toasts, ""Here's to the men who did what was considered wrong in order to do what they knew was right."" <br/><br/>It's scary what George W. Bush and Dick Cheney might make of that statement."

","Maybe I expected too much. I was all set for a thrilling adventure movie. About halfway through, I was waiting for it to get thrilling. After awhile, I was just anxiously waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>There's a lot of ""let's go here, let's go there"" stuff as the good guys try to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. But where Indiana Jones had vast expanses of interesting territories in which to chase and be chased, Nicholas Cage and friends are essentially limited to Washington DC and downtown Philadelphia. Sort of an urban Indiana Jones semi-adventure.<br/><br/>The movie kept delivering about 50 percent of what I expected. Finally, I just didn't care about the resolution of the plot; I just wanted the movie to be over. If you go into it expecting nothing, you may be pleased that it's ""just okay."" But if you expect anything more than that, you may be disappointed."

I watched it with an open mind,well up for some escapist fun but apart from a couple of goodish jokes and the actors giving it their best,not much to commend this.

","""National Treasure"" (2004), when I first watched this film, I went into the theater with low expectations. Sometimes that's a good thing, and sometimes that's a bad thing. But in the case of ""National Treasure"", I'm ecstatic I did. I went in there to see it, and I loved every second of it! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and a perfect soundtrack. At first glance, the story sounds like your every day treasure hunt. But, this movie takes that concept and turns it up to 11! This is one of those movie storylines where I was invested, excited, and there were a few occasional laughs along the way. It hit all the right notes, and it was one of the fastest two hours of my life! That's when you know you have a great movie, when it goes by fast. The cast is fantastic! Nicolas Cage, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, and more. They all perform their roles flawlessly. Of course, Nicolas Cage steals the show! Now overall, Nicolas Cage is one of those hit or miss actors. He has had both good and bad roles throughout his movie career. However, his role in ""National Treasure"" as Benjamin Gates is perfect for him. Had some other actor played the role, it may not have worked. This, in my opinion, is Nicolas Cage's best role and performance! As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all perform their roles perfectly and all of the actors have great chemistry. Sean Bean is a brilliant as Ian, the villain. One thing to point out, Sean Bean's character doesn't die in this film, that's a first! Isn't it? Justin Bartha is hilarious as Riley, Diane Kruger is great as Abigail, Jon Voight is funny as Patrick (Ben's father), Harvey Keitel as Agent Sadusky is stellar, etc. The special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really set the tone for the movie. Finally, the film soundtrack, composed by Trevor Rabin, is fantastic! It also helps set the tone, and really helps bring the movie to life. ""National Treasure"" is a great movie watching experience. Sometimes, you can actually forget that it's a Disney film! Director Jon Turteltaub, you definitely did an outstanding job with this movie! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I obviously give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""National Treasure"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it today! This movie is truly a national treasure."
"dawnrstevens","9","1","1","8 August 2018"," Comments
","Great movie. Am watching with my children and am truly disappointed that Disney would approve the Nickolas Cage/Diane Krueger romantic pairing given the 12 year age difference. Justin Bartha would have been more appropriate, yet still not necessary . So tired of seeing this dynamic, especially when there is no chemistry whatsoever. Nothing wrong with an age gap, true love can be found irrespective of age difference, but this movie holds its own with the historical context and caper dynamic. The romance adder is wrote."

","National Treasure really is a cute family movie. The action isn't too rough and the violence isn't bloody at all, so it's suitable. The movie is all about these two men who are searching down in an old abandoned ship under a big frozen lake, while they're searching they find these clues to a big treasure, and one of them is to steal the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage and his friend Riley try to convince Sean Bean's character to not do it but of course he and his men decide to anyways. And that begins the endless chase and race that drives the film. I liked all the actors. Cage is good here, and so is Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, and Jon Voight (Cage's father in the movie). The script is pretty average for a film like this. It's not to a great level, but it's not bad, really it gives you enough you need and then that's it, it doesn't try to dazzle you or anything, but it also won't let you down. The ending is well done, I enjoyed it very much. And the visuals are nicely done. All in all, it's an entertaining live action Disney treasure hunt movie that's mild enough for family viewing. 8/10."

","I want to give this film a 10 for my pure love of Nic Cage but I know it's not perfect but to me it's pretty darn close! Many out there point out some minute details but to me unless you are a historian you won't notice and it's a movie meant to entertain and it does, especially if you love adventure and especially adventure with a treasure hunt! It's like the Indiana movies but with a more down to earth approach. It may still be out there in some minds but it's not as much fantasy, more of government conspiracy which I love, it's fantasy based on possible realities, and no one does that better than Nicolas Cage! I know he has made some bad choices in some of his films but when he's in the right role he's the best in my opinion. I only hope to see him do more roles like National Treasure and ""Knowing"" and ""Left Behind""(not my favorite ) but when he does real, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Joe"" he is at his best!

"ivo-cobra8","10","1","1","29 September 2016"," Nicolas Cage's best solid bad ass action adventure flick!
","National Treasure (2004) is Nicolas Cage's best solid performance for an outstanding role of his character Benjamin Franklin Gates! This movie become very popular in 2004 and it got a sequel. I am still waiting for third sequel but I doubt there will National Treasure 3. This is also the best one of the two films in the franchise. The adventure and action in this movie is perfect executed. This film is about a treasure hunt that whole life Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) was hunting, now a team of mercenary's who betrayed Gates are trying to steal Declaration of Independence from museum which is the lead and final clue to a treasure hidden somewhere in the country. I love how Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is trying to convince and warning the authorities about Ian's plans but they don't listen to him. So Benjamin and his only loyal friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) has to steal the Declaration of Independence so they can protect it from Ian (Sean Bean). What I love about this film is the plot, the acting, the cast, well decent character development and a good fun action. This is my third favorite Nicolas Cage film and I love it to death!<br/><br/>Plot: Benjamin Franklin Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt.<br/><br/>That is the basic plot, it also does involves FBI chasing Benjamin and Riley beside Ian. Beautiful gorgeous sexy German actress Diane Kruger who was playing Dr. Abigail Chase did a perfect job playing her character, I haven't even noticed that she has an accent in this film. I love the music theme from Trevor Rabin for this film. This movie is awesome, It's the most thrilling treasure movie I ever seen. It keeps you excited there's humor and action. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie with a few laughs and adventure around it. It isn't Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark, but a great movie along those lines none the less. I love all 4 Indiana Jones movies with Harrison Ford but I still think National Treasure is original and it is not violent or scary movie. You also have a likable cast with humor and surrounded with history around you. <br/><br/>Jon Voight as Ben's estrange father also did a good job portraying his character Patrick Gates. Harvey Keitel was great as FBI Agent Peter Sadusky chasing Gates on his trip. The last actor I really had fun watching him was Sean Bean as the bad guy in his role as Ian Howe. I love Nicolas Cage and some of his films, but my favorite films are Con Air, The Rock and this one and National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007). I really did enjoy this film Nicolas Cage does a wonderful acting job, it is his decent acting performance. Today Nicolas Cage wastes his talent on junk movies, just like Steven Seagal and Eddie Murphy and they don't care about there fans. I love this movie and for my self I like history, this is one movie I really did enjoy watching because this movie is about history. The facts: I don't think there is really a map on the Declaration of Independence, I think they just made that up for the entertainment. But still this is intense film, still I love that you can see a lot of history museums in this movie. I reminds me when I was last year in high school I went on class tour 2007 to visit Museums in Munich, Germany (Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum), it was an awesome class trip and It was the same year National Treasure 2 come out. I really miss those times. <br/><br/>Overall: Special effects are great and thoroughly entertaining movie. This is a bad ass action adventure flick with great original story, interesting intense plot with lots of action that are all well done! This was a blind buy on Blu-ray for me and I have watched the film three times already! It is a decent solid Nicolas Cage flick MILES way better than Face/Off (1997) and other trash movies Cage is doing today!

","National Treasure (2004) starring Nicolas Cage, is one of his biggest films to date. Released back in November 2004, the film was considered a surprise hit, which eventually lead its way to a sequel. The enjoyment of this film isn't in its suspense, there's surprisingly little of it. The clues come too easily but are made cleverly for audiences to grasp at. The two lead actors don't seem much interested in each other, and the writers don't seem much interested in them. Though what engages in the film is the clever script that does work and is entertaining. National Treasure has received mixed reviews, all some are justified but for a film such as this (aimed towards a younger audience) many critics can be as harsh.<br/><br/>Within what we see, including the prized document, the fascinating tours of the historical halls and passageways and ventilation shafts and catacombs we get as the good guys try to outrun the bad, gives the movie a sometimes irresistible ambiance. Although quite over the top in some scenes, it makes it an entertaining and fun thrill ride."
"sanfranhello","8","1","1","6 June 2016"," One of the funnest adventure movies ever made
","Ridiculous conspiracy theories of the Knights Templar gathering the largest treasure in history for apparently no reason and then hiding it away from the British because it was in America.<br/><br/>OK, so the plot is bannanas, but so is the plot of most movies if you look at them closely enough. The difference here is that National Treasure admits it's own silliness with pride and gusto, wearing it out and proudly. Much of the movie's charm comes from the writer's own obvious love of both geeky historical facts and silly conspiracy theories, and their unabashed attempt to get you to love them too. Odd historical facts combine into silly conspiracies fast and often herein, but rather than trying too hard to get you to actually buy into them the movie expects you to meet it halfway. ""Yes, I'm silly"" it says ""but just accept that for a moment and come have an adventure.""<br/><br/>And a great adventure it is to be had! The good guys and bad guys go back and forth, not over punching each other in the face but in this movie it's brawn versus brains. Who knew the silliest of movies could be more witty than politically ""charged"" thrillers (or even ""hardcore"" sci-fi movie) that never the less are resolved by people punching each other in the face? Well National Treasure did, and watching Nick Cage and crew outwit their dumb and violent adversaries is just as fun as the best gun battle laden fight scenes other adventure movies throw at you, and more original to boot.<br/><br/>And speaking of Cage and the rest of the cast. Well, they all feel type cast, but in the exact right roles. Oh sure Sean Bean does his usual solid job (hey a British villain!). But otherwise everyone feels like a character actor, but in the exact right sort of role for them. Diane Kruger looks stunning, Nick Cage goes hilariously over the top in most scenes, Justin Bartha's nerdy loser comic relief does exactly that, and Jon Voight's wise old man routine is spot on. And because the movie doesn't expect much more of itself than having fun you can happily play along with all of them.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie 7 times, and regretted it not once. Bored or feeling down, you just pop this in and enjoy Nicholas Cage looking dramatically serious towards (but not at) a camera and saying in a serious voice ""I'm going to steal the Declaration of Independence"". And you can't help but smile and even laugh."

","I like Nicolas cage in moderation. I really like this film. I know the premise is kind of far fetched but so what? It is fast paced, entertaining, has a sense of humor and you snippets of history through out the film. I remember when it was reviewed. It got harsh reviews. I go to see certain films to be entertained:James bond, Jurassic park, etc. . I know they are out there but who cares, they are fun. This one was better than the follow-up. It is a film to watch with popcorn, twizzlers and something to drink. I have always liked Walt Disney films, (from when he was still alive). I wish they would make more of these type films. They are entertaining without being offensive."

","Many people wonder if there are secrets that the figures of history left us to twist our brains into thinking what was true, really isn't. National Treasure gave us that idea if we truly search, we could find out what really happened a long long time ago. This movie is about a group of people fighting to protect the Declaration of Independence and following a map that leads to the ""National Treasure."" Although the plot isn't all that believable, this movie provides us an interesting look at history which makes us forget the impossibility. The visuals are completely astounding and believable. There are always these moments where I thought the good guys were actually going to lose. The only problems that I had with the movie is that some of the characters are quite forgettable."
"classicalsteve","8","1","1","31 May 2015"," A 21st-Century Indiana Jones in an Ocean's 11-Style Heist for Treasure:
","In the wake of ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""National Treasure"" really is a very entertaining and fun fantasy-adventure film. While not perfect, it's better than most of the other treasure hunting of ancient artifact movies of this type, particularly the dismally disappointing ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". The one compromise is that the viewer has to ""buy' into some episodes which are almost laughably implausible. However, if you can get past some of the ""are you kidding me"" moments, it's still an engaging trek through some of early American history, enjoyable for family viewing.<br/><br/>Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is the next generation in the Gates family of treasure hunters who believe in secret societies, conspiracies and cults. They are obsessed with a vast treasure they believe contain ancient relics such as sarcophagi, monuments, and artifacts from Antiquity, worth the equivalent of the entire collection residing in the Louvre. Although displaced from the Eastern Mediterranean, the treasure was hidden somewhere by Freemasons in the United States, or so they believe. According to family lore, the treasure was discovered by the Knights Templar during the Crusades of the 12th century in the ground beneath the place where the Israelite Great Temple of Jerusalem once stood, which was destroyed in 66 C.E. by the Romans. The later heirs of the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, moved the treasure to a secret location in North America. Some of the early American Freemasons and maybe an American Founding Father or three, placed secret clues hidden in obvious but concealed places to aid in its discovery by someone ""pure"", who adheres to the code of the Freemasons and the earlier Templar Knights. An early 19th century member of the Gates family was offered one of the clues. For several generations, the legend has been passed down, and now it has fallen to Ben Gates, although his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), no longer believes in the existence of the treasure, having wasted several decades with his father John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer) trying to find the ""treasure"".<br/><br/>The first clue, revealed early in the first scene of the film, so I'm really not giving anything away, is ""The Secret Lies with Charlotte"". Benjamin Gates grandfather, John Adams, explains to the young Ben Gates the clue was given to his grandfather's grandfather from Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence and supposedly a Freemason. (Carroll is a real historical figure, although probably this story was made up for the film.) The family has been unable to find the meaning of the phrase.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 30 years. Benjamin Gates is now in middle-age, and he is seeking Charlotte. He finds ""Charlotte"" and another clue. The deciphering of the clue points to another clue residing on the underside of the original Declaration of Independence, the hand-written document which formally declared the North American Colonies' desire to secede from British rule. Simultaneously, Ian Howe (Sean Bean), once a trusted partner of Gates in the quest at the beginning of the film, has turned into an enemy rival who also wants the Declaration of Independence to find the next clue, and hopefully, the treasure. The film becomes a series of chases and clues, somewhat similar to the Da Vinci Code. At one point, the FBI enters into the picture, literally.<br/><br/>To stop the baddie Ian and his entourage of nameless henchmen from stealing the Declaration first, Gates and Co. resolve to steal it first, in ""Ocean's 11"" style. A fun, sort of madcap adventure fantasy, somewhat similar to the Disney films of the 1970's, like ""Candleshoe"" in which a treasure lies hidden within an old mansion. (Interestingly, ""National Treasure"" was also produced by the Disney Company.) A few of the scenes are a bit implausible, especially a few moments where the Declaration of Independence seems in dire jeopardy. However, the acting is good enough and the ideas behind the hunt compelling enough, that overall it still works well. Just don't take it too seriously. And think twice if the film has led you to believe stealing such a document from a national archive is easy as it seems in ""National Treasure"". I guarantee you, it isn't."
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","14 March 2014"," Modern ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in America
","If you can imagine a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type story taking place in modern America, you'd have a fairly good idea of what ""National Treasure"" is like. Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type treasure hunter, Benjamin Franklin Gates, accompanied by his partner (Justin Bartha) and romantic interest (Diane Kruger), the latter a historical document scholar who gets dragged into the wild proceedings.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: Gates feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis (Sean Bean). The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Gates successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously ""get the babe"" as well? <br/><br/>""National Treasure"" put a big grin on my face throughout its entire 2-hour run time. Like 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Nevertheless, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad by-product, no? <br/><br/>A handful of miscellaneous items: <br/><br/>Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in 2004's ""Troy,"" is super sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.<br/><br/>The score is modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.<br/><br/>The protagonists are all likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.<br/><br/>The chases are thrilling.<br/><br/>The film was shot on location in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.<br/><br/>Jon Voight plays Gate's father.<br/><br/>Like ""Raiders"" this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.<br/><br/>CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- ""National Treasure"" was a huge hit with audiences in 2004. This proves that critics like Roeper see WAY too many movies. They can't even lighten-up enough to enjoy a fun, thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick. Implausible? Yes (at times, anyway). Bad? No.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining quasi-believable adventure film. It's got the mojo.<br/><br/>The movie runs 131 minutes. <br/><br/>GRADE: B+ or A- (7.5/10 Stars)"

","A man sets out to steal a lost fortune in order to save it in this adventure drama entitled,National Treasure.<br/><br/>It is adventure heist film was written by Jim Kouf, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by Jon Turteltaub. It stars Nicolas Cage,who plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptologist searching for a lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork and other artifacts that was accumulated into a single massive stockpile by looters and warriors over many millennium starting in Ancient Egypt, later rediscovered by warriors who form themselves into the Knights Templar to protect the treasure, eventually hidden by American Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War.Diane Kruger,Jon Voight,Harvey Keitel,Sean Bean,Justin Bartha and Christopher Plummer co- star to play key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Benjamin Franklin Gates is an archaeologist who is from the eighth generation of a family who has shared an unusual quest. As Gates-family legend has it, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin hid a massive cache of gold during the waning days of the Revolutionary War and left clues as to its whereabouts in the original drafts of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. With no firm proof that it actually exists, Gates sets out to crack the code that will lead him to the fortune, which, as a member of the Gates clan, he is sworn to protect from wrongdoers. <br/><br/>National Treasure is no treasure, but it's a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.But nevertheless,it gets more entertaining as the more preposterous it gets and as its implausibility rises.Overall,it is more like a triple-cross between The DaVinci Code, CSI, and The Amazing Race than Raiders of the Lost Ark."

","I think I've heard of this underrated flick from the Jerry Bruckheimer company (who made later films including The Prince of Persia and The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and I think I actually liked it. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it's a lot of fun when it comes to mystery/action/adventure films.<br/><br/>Yes, the story's predictable despite it's great mixture of mystery, thriller, action, and adventure, the dialog can sometimes be corny and the pacing is uneven and sluggish for itself.<br/><br/>With that said, it has some nice cinematography along with some beautiful imagery I've ever seen and the history throughout the story got me very interested to wanna know what seems to be going on. The music from Trevor Rabin is pretty darn good and the action is very enjoyable to watch, but the strongest aspect goes to the cast. Nicolas Cage shines in his role and Diane Kruger did great as the love interest for Nicolas, but I think Sean Bean steals the show for portraying the villain very perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, Nation Treasure isn't a masterpiece and would've had a much better story, but with a great cast, some nice visuals and great music, this is an underrated film in my opinion."

","A treasure hunter is in hot pursuit of a mythical treasure that has been passed down for centuries, while his employer turned enemy is onto the same path that he's on.<br/><br/>Plagued by bad reviews, hated by the critics, but looked totally awesome? I've now experienced this, with National Treasure. I love those treasure hunting movies, where they are going from clue to clue to get somewhere. National Treasure, I believe, perfects this and modernizes what could've been a bad experience... The acting in this film is probably it's lowest point. We all know how Nicholas Cage is going to do, but everybody else seemed like they weren't into it. Disney isn't the best at this isle anyways, so I didn't worry about it that much. The plot was pretty cool. People criticize the movie because of the clues and how ""stupid"" they were. Well, maybe you didn't know this, but this movie was made by Disney. They aren't the best at creating intellectual plots, but they can do it enough to entertain you. I was actually enjoying how the characters lead their selves up to the final clue, it was an enjoyable experience. I also liked the soundtrack. I thought, for once, Disney invested some of their time to create a fun soundtrack that fits the film. Times, the movie was an modern action-adventure, but at others, the movie resembled Indiana Jones; and that's always great. Also, in a while polluted by violent films, the parents would find this a nice surprise. It's good for the whole entire family, but occasionally Disney slips in a few subtle nods as always. So if you want a film that's mixed with Indiana Jones (adventure, clue-solving) and then even a little mixture of heist films; this is for you! Ignore Disney's way of doing things and take it for what it is. I give it an 7/10 for being something I thoroughly enjoyed. 7/10."

","I hereby proclaim Nicolas Cage to be the new Indian Jones; especially after that ""Crystal Skulls"" debut. In this film we are seeing Nic in top form, the all-around star we knew he always was. After some movingly memorable independent works, and some hilariously funny comedies and thrilling popcorn flicks, it is through National Treasure that we see the coalescence of so much burgeoning talent come to fruition.<br/><br/>The years spent previously honing his skills have finally been delivered to the masses in the form of a charismatic hero, one that seems vaguely familiar, and warm. It is a joy to watch this film, not only on the basis of it being an incredibly intelligent and entertaining film, but from the feeling of watching an actor assume the role he was always meant to play, to become the person who was just a few layers deep; the hero.<br/><br/>If for some reason you live on this planet and haven't seen this movie, correct this mistake as soon as possible. And for a bit of extra credit, I advise you to check out the trailer to Nic's next film ""Trespass"", it looks equally amazing and this is your chance to stay ahead of the curve http://on.fb.me/pchomT . Show your kids, girlfriend, or treat yourself, it's all good when it comes to Cage."

","I decided to go to IMDb and check out some of the reviews people have written here. On the first page most people seemed to like it, so I decided to check number two. And beside from a few smart people who understands the movie, all I found was reviews telling me what crap this is. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. I thought National Treasure was a great movie. It was smart, exciting, and funny. Nicholas Cage played his role great, and so did Justin Bartha. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time, but I still loved it. And yes, maybe this movie was meant for a little younger audience, but what is the harm in that? Did someone tell everyone that it was going to be for adults only? I don't know how it was in other countries, but in Sweden it was rated 7+. If that's not a pretty safe clue that it ain't meant only for adults, but for family and kids, then I don't know what the hell is. I thought it was a smart movie. Granted, I'm not the type of person who usually sits through mystery movies, or other stuff that requires some thinking, but I think a lot of people would enjoy this movie, even if they don't all think exactly like me. Still, I mean, if you didn't like the movie, you must have your reasons. Maybe I'm just some weird dude who likes bad films. I loved 2012, even though it had a lot of bad reviews. Still, this movie was very entertaining. It's probably not meant for some 30-year-old single guy sitting in his apartment with a bear, expecting some kind of awesome action movie, but for younger audiences and family movie nights, this is totally awesome, and deserves so much more good reviews than it's got."

","Another film that involves a treasure, some guys who want it, and the FBI. How great is that? Sure the plot was obviously fake when it came to historical accuracy, and sure some of the ways the guys broke into rooms and buildings to find clues or objects were obviously not done properly, and as my dad said, the only character with good convincing acting was the main bad guy. But I disagree in the fact that it's tough to be convincingly real when acting, since you know that it's just actors anyway.<br/><br/>But I enjoyed the race to find the treasure without getting stopped by the bad guys and the FBI. This movie reminded me of the Indiana Jones fourth movie, where after trying to escape from the bad guys, Indiana ends up working with them and that cooperation of having the higher power with more resources be good to you only because you are their tool to finding the treasure was obvious.

"MartianOctocretr5","6","1","1","15 September 2008"," Massive suspension of disbelief required
","To view this movie, you better suspend your disbelief at the door. Better yet, bury it. Otherwise, the premise involving intricate codes sprinkled everywhere to reveal an immense treasure will look downright ridiculous and comical.<br/><br/>Everybody from the ancient Egyptians, to the Romans, to the Knights of Templar to the Free Masons to Ben Franklin to George Washington are behind this scheme. Half of the people who ever lived were apparently involved in some conspiracy to gather gold stuff and then hide it somewhere. With clues everywhere to find it. And more clues. I'm surprised DaVinci and his ""codes"" weren't mentioned as being involved. Or the second shooter from the grassy knoll. Or O.J. Simpson. Or Oliver Stone. Or the Aflac Duck.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage finds cleverly hidden artifacts with clues, and then solves them faster than Batman and Robin unravelling the Riddler's rhymes on the old TV show. Some girl who works for the government and whose acting looks like a schoolgirl in Drama 101 helps him. Some guy tries to croak him in every scene but always goofs it up. Although Jon Voight's work in the film is good, his character is written inconsistently. Like the whole script.<br/><br/>My favorite, however, is the depiction of the systems ""protecting"" the Declaration of Independence. In this movie, one of those bozos on ""World's Dumbest Criminals"" could heist this priceless document, and nobody would be the wiser. Then a bunch of Keystone Cop FBI guys run around accomplishing nothing except more comedy.<br/><br/>Far beyond the limits of plausible if you take it at face value. But if you give the flick about of ton of poetic license, it can be good for a laugh or two."

Especially with a comedic sidekick like the one on display here. He's worth the ticket/renting price alone. Maybe you think his jokes are so good, that you have to buy the DVD. Whatever the case is, this movie is just plain good ol' fun. And while the female lead does not entirely convince here (maybe playing the most beautiful girl in the world - Troy - was already her peak? The question comes to mind, because how could you possibly top that role, right?), the movie has a feel good vibe to it. While Mr. Harvey Keitel is more a bystander, he does add to the flavor of the movie. Far from his ""Bad Lieutenant"" days, but that wouldn't really suit the movie now would it? <br/><br/>Just don't try to think to much and/or compare it to the Indiana Jones franchise and you'll enjoy it! :o)"

","For a movie that's pretty much just a cheap combination of Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed National Treasure. Oh, it's dumb, but it's dumb fun. Nicolas Cage stars as the latest descendant of the Gates family, whose members have spent their existence following the treasure of the Knights Templar. The Freemasons, descended from the Knights Templar, have supposedly left a series of clues leading to this treasure. Cage, in his hammy mode, carries the movie. His sidekicks, Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha, are mostly boring, as are the villains (led by Sean Bean). Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight pop up in supporting roles, but neither of them adds too much. It really is the Nicolas Cage show. It moves quick and doesn't allow you to overthink any of the extremely simple story. I'd definitely place this in the ""guilty pleasure"" column, but a pleasure it is."
"vip_ebriega","6","1","1","29 May 2008"," Cheesy, silly but enjoyable 'Raiders' knock-off.
","My Take: As over-the-top as it may be, this summer movie is enjoyable and actually not as idiotic as it might have been. <br/><br/>There's no doubt the plot of NATIONAL TREASURE is ludicrous and just plain silly, but who said it can't be fun? Although it's incredibly silly and the plot is mostly lifted from Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE, it's still quite fun, and it really doesn't take itself way too seriously, so why should you? NATIONAL TREASURE probably knows it's dumb, if not, why shouldn't it? This is not the material that one should apply logic to. It is what it is, a silly dumb summer blockbuster. Check your brains at the door, grab a tub of popcorn and have a ball.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage probably wanted to take a rest from the Oscars and plays a pedestrian role as obsessed explorer Ben Gates, who has spent much of his life in search of a treasure long been searched by his family legacy, as we were told by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer, in a cameo) at flashback during the beginning of the movie. For his whole life, Gates has not thought about anything else but to look for this treasure. Uh... hasn't anyone recommended this guy to get a job? Anyway, Gates search leads him to a series of mind-bending clues which, due to his expertise (or shall I say obsession) on history, he gets by them really quickly. His configurations are impressively clever, but when it comes to his solutions at the start, but the gets pretty overblown as it goes.<br/><br/>In fact, NATIONAL TREASURE isn't just full of these overblown plot twists, it's also filled with clichés and plot holes that almost built around the entire film. Whether it's clichés from recent action films, or clichés that date back to the old times where they eventually came from in the first place. This is, actually, an outmoded piece of old-fashioned escapism. But who said it can't be fun being that way? This is a mildly engaging, silly adventure film. It's old-fashioned to the extremes, and it doesn't have the same touches of greatness that fills the nostalgia of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film which this one obviously wanted to be, but it has it's neat touches and it is quite an efficient little action thriller. Silly, but silly fun just the same.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."
"AlanSmythee","6","1","1","21 January 2007"," Family Friendly Adventure
","I rented this film on a friend's recommendation, not realizing it was a Disney movie at the time. It had it's moments, but I found it a little light for an adventure film. Indiana Jones without the creepy parts. Nicholas Cage and Justin Bartha played well off of each other. I did find the slight romantic angle a little annoying and didn't really add anything to the film. If it had been a bit more mature, they really could have built up the Masonic angle. They also took a lot of liberty with the historical aspect of Freemasonry too. Probably because the average person seeing it wouldn't know better. All in all, it was enjoyable and a good, clean family film. On the order of ""Second Hand Lions"", though I personally found that far superior."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","1","1","12 January 2007"," Formalaic, though entertaining.
","Of course this movie is a simple version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" but at least it's more entertaining to watch. It has just as many vague and unlikely clues at some unlikely historical places and on historical items, that lead to even more clues about the location of a large treasure. <br/><br/>The whole concept of treasure hunting is of course one that really speaks to the imagination and this movie greatly takes advantage of this, by putting in the movie every formulaic element you would expect from a movie like this one.<br/><br/>It's not that the movie is bad but it just isn't anything fresh or renewing either. It's an Indiana Jones and ""The Da Vinci Code"" wannabe that doesn't add enough on its own to the genre. Nothing wrong with a little bit 'borrowing' from other movies, as long as it works good for the movie and its story. ""National Treasure"" is a movie that entertains but that's basically all there really can be said about the movie.<br/><br/>The story is fun and adventurous and the movie features some good actors that are being played by some surprising big names. The movie has some good moments and action sequences, that aren't too big (the movie most certainly does not look like an $100,000,000 movie) but are entertaining nevertheless.<br/><br/>The movie is good looking with a good visual style and a nice suiting action score from specialist Trevor Rabin.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a shame that the movie is just so formulaic. Nothing in the movie comes as a surprise and it features all of the typical elements you would expect from a movie like this one. At times the movie could had really used some more originality to make it more entertaining-, or at least less predictable to watch. Like I said before, the movie is still good and fun enough to watch but it could had really been so much better with a tiny bit more of originality of its own.<br/><br/>The characters are also quite formulaic, though it fits the genre well I guess; a friend turns villain, a love interest and a comical sidekick. Why do movies always think they should have comical sidekicks? It's starting to get really annoying, especially if the characters aren't even funny, like in this movie is the case. It sort of helps though that all of the characters are being played by some well known names. I like Nicolas Cage and he shows that he can also play a convincing main 'heroic' character. Sean Bean plays the villain and like expected he does this in a great way, like only he can play a villain. The movie further more also features Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer in some smaller roles.<br/><br/>All good fun, as long as you don't expect something original- or to be blown away by it all.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Please don't take this movie seriously. If you do so it will prove impossible to enjoy it. The whole thing is implausible, impossible, utterly ridiculous. But having said that, it's not all that bad actually. No, you cannot steal the Declaration of Independence. And if you somehow do, you certainly can't constantly be rolling and unrolling it like some old Farrah Fawcett poster you used to have on your wall as you take it out of its handy carrying tube. Squirting lemon juice on it and blowing on it with a hair dryer would probably not be good ideas either. But try not to think about these things. Thinking is not recommended as you watch this movie. Just turn off your brain, enjoy it as best you can, and when it's over you can look back and say, ""well that was all rather silly wasn't it?""<br/><br/>Anyhow our rather silly yet reasonably engrossing plot follows treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates, as played by Nicolas Cage. Gates comes to believe that clues to the location of a treasure of unimaginable wealth are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Well that makes perfect sense now doesn't it? Gates decides he must steal the Declaration before the bad guys get to it. Oy, there's always gotta be bad guys. Anyhow, with the help of National Archivist (and requisite love interest because we must have a love interest...its a rule or something) Abigail Chase, played by Diane Kruger, Gates stays one step ahead of the requisite bad guys and deciphers clue after clue which inevitably lead to...more clues. The movie starts to drag and you get the sense a good half hour or so could have been cut out and nobody would have missed it.<br/><br/>In the two lead roles Cage and Kruger do pretty well with the material they have to work with. So much of the movie is impossibly silly but they more or less make it work. Playing the role of the requisite comic sidekick Justin Bartha unfortunately fails to be the least bit funny. In fact you'll find that when the movie tries to be funny it is desperately unfunny but in what are meant to be serious moments you may find yourself trying to stifle a giggle. That's not good. Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight float in and out but don't make much of an impression. But I'm sure they collected nice paychecks.<br/><br/>The whole thing is so formulaic...you have seen this movie before and you have seen it done a lot better. Indiana Jones anyone? But it is what it is and it's not all bad. You'll probably wish it was shorter. You'll probably wish it was funnier. You'll probably wish it was at least remotely plausible. But all things considered, despite all its flaws, it's reasonably fun. You could do a lot worse."

I just wish that more effort was made to explain how a bunch of buffoons are guarding this national treasure, where a guy with a phony copy can exchange it. I don't dislike the movie; I just want the writers to make it more complex. Cage, whom I really like as an actor, and his cohorts dance around, trying to find this deep dark secret. Where did they get so much expertise? I know about the original document that leads to their efforts, but there are things like secret compartments, anti theft devices, armed guards who know what they are doing. Then there are the bad guys. Why are they there? How did they just happen to show up? It's because you need someone other than the federal government to be the adversary. Someone with motives like yours, trying to get at the stash, before you.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the theater experience because I was in the mood for a big adventure movie.

Replace Benjamin Franklin with Leonardo Da Vinci and moderately correct American History with moderately correct Relegious History in the movie, and Dan Brown could have made another bundle by suing Disney.<br/><br/>It is incredulous at most times, when Ben Gates solves 200 year old puzzles by thinking aloud for 200 seconds or less. And of course, unlike Dan Brown's novel, it does not really claim to be based on solid historical facts. It is a clear fiction, and a well delivered one at that. Too simplistic at times, perhaps, but I wasn't looking for an intellectual thriller. And you shouldn't either.<br/><br/>But within its own genre, it delivers quite a package. You have history unraveled to reveal an elaborate scheme of hiding a treasure. A treasure so vast that it cannot be shown in all its glory. You have codes; clues leading to clues leading to an inviting adventure, to a promise of unimaginable richness that seem to elude the hero every time. Almost like leading a donkey by dangling a carrot in front of it. You have a villain hell bent on reaching the carrot before Ben does. You have car chases, a high profile theft, explosions, and riddles to solve. Everything the doctor recommended. But don't bother trying out the riddles. They don't really make much sense, and in any case, the hero will solve them before you can fully read it.<br/><br/>Another objection is that the plot moves a TAD bit too easily, in my opinion. Just a little bit, but on the whole, the movie fares pretty well.<br/><br/>Irrespective of whether the codes made sense or not, the codes were interesting. And as far as the hero's ridiculously uncanny ability to solve riddles are concerned, you may argue along the same lines about the Da Vinci Code as well.

I also learnt a bit about the American history so it is educational to some extend to those who don't know that much about American history . The acting was great , especially the father son relationship between Cage and Voight and lets not forget about Sean Bean after all he was 006 !!!. The only let down would be that this would be one of those movies that appeal to fans of Nicolas Cage and people who enjoyed the Tomb Raider flicks and to those fans who also enjoyed movies like Ocean's 11 as it did try and incorporate these high-tech heist scenes which were enjoyable having said that .

Ben and three other companions start their journey in a tomb of some sort. When a disagreement comes upon them, two of the members betray Ben, and leave him stranded with Riley. Ben and Riley challenge the two traitors to see who can get to the treasure first.<br/><br/>Heart-pounding action scenes and mystery elements make up the movie. The characters find clues which lead to more clues, which eventually lead to the treasure. Though a bit boring at time, the movie still holds up as an entertaining popcorn movie, which was underrated by the critics.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Globe trotting adventurer Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is inspired in his youth by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer) to seek out the final location of a fabulous treasure hidden somewhere in the Philidelphia. With an enormous fortune at stake and a family honor to restore, Gates sets out to decipher a nearly endless progression and certainly complex set of clues bequeathed to him by the early Masons. The search takes him to the frozen Arctic and then back through the winding cobblestone streets of Boston. Each cryptic secret unraveled, leads him to another and then another and so on. Along the way, he must compete with an equally competent and certainly ruthless team of fellow treasure hunters. Further, they must stay clear of the Federal police, and try not to disappoint his father. What is discovered is that whoever designed the map's instructions did not wish to make the treasure easy to find. As a result, three generations of Gates are involved in the hide-and-go seek game of a lifetime. A unique film for Cage as we tend to view him as the epitome of bad guys. Good story too.****"

Eventually the father becomes involved too, initially not by his own will, but in the end he is very proud of his son, even though they enter an empty space instead of finding the treasure there. For a moment you are left thinking that's it. I really liked the surprise when they find another exit to the real treasure room.

","I just saw this movie on cable the other night and I actually liked it. I know it received bad reviews when it was released. It reminded me of Dan Brown's books 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' which I loved. If you like those books you will probably like this movie. As far as being historically correct, well I think you just have to put that aside when watching this kind of movie. I think people get too hung up on historical accuracy and whether this or that is plausible. If I want to watch something historically accurate I'll watch a documentary. Personally, I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan but he did OK in this. And the character of Riley was great. He had some great dry humor and one-liners. Really cracked me up. I also liked John Voight as Cage's father. They way he was peeking around the corner and giving them tips was really cute. He tries to have an adult sensibility that this quest is silly but he also has a boyish nature that wants to believe that buried treasure really can exist."

And that's a good point, because this way the audience doesn't have to do the thinking. Not that anyone successfully could do this thinking...<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is absurd, it's ridiculous and the story doesn't make any sense at all.

That made me skeptical. Although I still believe that was the intent, they actually pulled it off! While the ancient Secret Society, buried treasure, and Intellectual treasure hunt theme was preserved, it was executed with surprising freshness and watch-ability. Nick Cage has been hit an miss in many of his movies, but I think he did a very good job in this one, pulling off the Partly Nerdish, yet secretly Swashbuckling adventurer to a tee. I would watch this one again. I would even look forward to some sort of equally well done sequel, but based on the outcome of this one, don't really see how they could script that without making it seem really forced."

This film soars high with action, suspense, a healthy dose of history (though sometimes inaccurate) and Harvey Keital.

","This movie, though very entertaining (hence my 7 out of 10) looks as if it a pre-release of ""The Da Vinci Code"". So many elements have been taken from Dan Brown's bestseller, that most of the plot felt familiar to me, having read (as we all have) the Dan Brown book. The main difference is that not ancient documents from biblical times are the basis for all the action, but the a more recent document. Furthermore there are so many parallels (the running from one clue to another, the Freemasons, the vaults beneath churches etc.) that it looks as if Disney wanted to pick some of the credit of Dan Brown, while he still could, before the movie of the Da Vinci Code is among us."

","I guess I should start out by saying I was a little wary about watching this movie. After all...Nicolas Cage as a treasure hunter? The only movies I could remember seeing him in were Windtalkers, The Family Man, and Adaptation. If you have seen them, you know they're about the farthest thing from treasure hunting.<br/><br/>I believe this was a failed attempt at some sort of ""New-Age"" Indiana Jones movie. Come on people, nothing will ever measure up to Indiana Jones. Besides...Harrison Ford was just so much better looking than Nicolas Cage. This movie was pretty much non-stop action/clue deciphering, which does have Indiana Jones beat. Jones always had to have at least 5 minutes of romance in there, compared to this movie, with about a 15 second kiss, and the (maybe) 2 minute ending. I really liked how they threw in some comedy here and there too, which was something I don't recall happening in Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an action movie with history clues in it, I would definitely recommend that you give this movie a try."

","There is some earnest history lesson and real reverence for American history in this spirited treasure hunt for all ages. There might be a scary moment here and there for young kids, but overall, National Treasure is benign.<br/><br/>I've often wondered about Free Masonry, their old history and secret rituals that some Christian groups claim as Satanic. All the better to build a screenplay full of historical side notes about the Founding Fathers; eight including Ben Franklin and George Washington were Masons. Add some historical hocus pocus having to do with Knights Templers, Egyptian Pyramids, and American landmarks; our modern Treasure hunters search through America's most famous documents and historic sites in their quest. This is fine entertainment."

","Typically I try to avoid anything that has to do with Jerry Bruckheimer (how does his last name pass spell check?) at all cost considering I'm not a big fan of watching things blow up surrounded by a lousy plot. Black Hawk Down is one of the few movies I've seen that he was attached to that didn't suck massively. Seriously, how can you possibly mess up a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well by poorly ripping off Titanic I guess. So I broke down this weekend and picked up National Treasure and hoped Bruckheimer actually devised a plot for the movie.<br/><br/>National Treasure follows a family in search of a long lost treasure that was supposedly hidden by our founding founders. Nick Cage plays the son who is still searching for it while Jon Voight is the skeptical dad whose life was ruined by unsuccessfully looking. With the son being the treasure hunter (or as Cage's Ben Gates says, ""Treasure protectors"") and dad being skeptical, parallels are easily drawn with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They even throw in a hot German chick just for fun. But the German chick in this movie has been nationalized and has access to the Declaration of Independence. That, of course, comes in handy when Gates needs to steal it.<br/><br/>Gates need to steal the Declaration of Independence because his former partner, evil English dude, plans to steal it to use it to find the treasure for his own personal collection. Rounding out the cast is Gates' sidekick, Riley (think Short Round from Temple of Doom but older and less Asian), and Harvey Keitel in a rare good guy turn as the FBI agent who is looking for Gates.<br/><br/>The plot is surprisingly decent. They is a good balance between historically accuracy and aspects that were made up to go with the storyline. You can really tell that some did their homework to make sure what could be accurate is and what is made up could be plausible. As for the action, Bruckheimer kept the big explosions to only one, which has to be a record low for him. The biggest disappointment I had with the action was, if you remember back to the trailer (which is missing from the DVD release, I hate when that happens), Gates is holding on to the hot German chick and asks her; ""Do you trust me?"" And she say, ""yes"" than Gates drops her. Everybody and their mothers were like ""Whoa"" when they first saw it but when you see it in the context of the film, it is obvious that she really isn't in any danger.<br/><br/>As for the extras on the DVD, I mentioned earlier that it lack the theatrical trailer yet it had the Verizon commercial that when along with the film for some reason. It also had a nice documentary about present day treasure hunters and another one about the making of the movie. It also had the prerequisite deleted scenes, neither of which were that interesting. It also had an alternate ending, and to honest they went with the better ending in the movie. The cool thing about the extras is they give you clues that will help you unlock some more extra materials."
"The_Void","8","1","1","21 June 2005"," Decent high concept movie
","Jerry Bruckheimer and his 'high concept' movies never push any cinematic boundaries and don't exactly give your brain a workout, but they can be respected in their own right as they often provide two hours of entertainment, and that's what you get for your money with this film; National Treasure. The film stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who goes on the trail of some rumoured treasure that has been hidden in the United States of America for centuries. To find the treasure, he must decipher a series of clues, each one leading to another clue, which in turn leads to another. This theory of the buried treasure has been in Cage's family for decades and our hero hopes to be the one to finally find it! As you might expect, the movie isn't entirely serious but, to my surprise at least, it does attempt some form of intelligence. The film plays out like something of a history lesson, and the central theme of both the British and the Americans hunting for the treasure echoes the war of independence. That, coupled with a tour of the USA's landmarks, makes this one very pro-American movie! <br/><br/>The way that the plot plays out is very silly, and the backbone of this silliness comes from the idea of the characters stealing the declaration of independence. The idea of this is stupid, but the way that it transpires is even more so. However, it would appear that the film knows that it's ridiculous, and so it just has fun with itself. Unlike many films of this type, the jokes entwined in the plot are actually funny, and certain moments in the movie will no doubt make you laugh out loud. The action is generally well staged, with a car chase taking the central stage where that is concerned. Nicholas Cage has proved his ability to lead a film on numerous occasions, and he shows us why he's a good choice again in this film. While his performance in the movie isn't great, you've got to remember that he hasn't been given great material to work with; and he does make the best of what he's got. The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, with the exception of a nice little turn from Harvey Kietel. On the whole, National Treasure won't be making cinema history; but as no brains, big budget action movies go - this isn't a bad one."

","With critics hanging crepe weeks before, I didn't expect much from the opening weekend for NATIONAL TREASURE. But when one walks into a theater on a sunny Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis in winter and sees the place packed with kids and gray hairs, you know something good is up. Nestled in my comfy stadium lounger, I leaned back next to three dads and four sons behind a couple older than whatever. And for the next 130 minutes, I didn't sleep a wink. In fact, while I'd heard the script had been re-sculpted many times, my only conclusion is ""who cares."" The action, the innuendo, the fantastical story line were all in keeping with the action-adventure genre and a jolly good time was had by all. One critic on CNBC had said that the action was good, the story was good though fantastic, and the acting was good, but it just wasn't a good film. Just goes to show you how becoming a professional critic addles the brain, numbs the senses, and results in bad reviews."

","When I first saw the DVD case, my immediate thought was Nick Cage as Indy? Weird. However, being today, I saw no other interesting movies so I took this one. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of Indiana Jones which is what originally attracted me to this movie. <br/><br/>Cage does an outstanding job as the genius historian treasure hunter. It lacks the full on action and mysticism of Indiana Jones, but is a lot more realistic (apart from the Declaration of Independence) <br/><br/>Justin Bartha is wonderful as Riley Poole, the funny, stereotypical somewhat stupid sidekick, who is nevertheless so adorable and hilarious that you love him despite the fact that he is not original. <br/><br/>Diane Kruger does a wonderful job as Abigail Chase, as we finally see an intelligent Indiana Jones girl. However, she and Justin Bartha have quite small parts next to Cage's character, which is a pity since both characters could have been developed more.<br/><br/>A good introduction to Indiana Jones, and an excellent stand-alone movie.

","Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) in the next in line in a family who have been searching for a mythical treasure map for generations. When he eventually uncovers evidence that the fabled map was hidden in no other place than the back of the Declaration of Independence, he decides that there is clearly no alternative than to steal the Declaration. (it's in the name of science, after all...)<br/><br/>The thing to keep in mind most before watching National Treasure is that it's all in good fun. It isn't meant to be particularly realistic or probable - just suspenseful, exciting and, above all, entertaining. And National Treasure succeeds in being entertaining, if nothing else. Think of it as a modern Indiana Jones, albeit one which blatantly rips off Dan Brown's novel 'The Da Vinci Code' with the main plot line involving cryptic clues found on pieces of ancient architecture. However, another thing to keep in mind is that the entire story takes place in the good old United States of America, so get ready for some not so subtle patriotic messages (which may lead up to some potential propaganda interpretations) and a particularly cheesy ending, which seems to anticipate us letting out a loud sigh of patriotic pride... but is more likely to produce a pained groan.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage returns to the thriller genre, but doesn't give anything spectacular here in terms of performance, which is fine, since the script doesn't really call for much character development on his part - the highlight remains the adventure. Justin Bartha plays Gate's annoying sidekick Riley, meant to serve as the comic relief, but in the end, only raises the occasional laugh. Diane Kruger plays a cardboard cutout 'token female' character, who is given absolutely nothing in terms of development or necessity to appear in the story at all, except to finally (and highly predictably) fall in love with Gates. Sean Bean steals the movie as the cold-blooded ex-colleague of Gate's who is racing against him to claim the treasure first. And finally, while it's nice to see classy actors such as John Voight (playing Gate's father, who seems to act as the voice of the audience, expressing doubt that it would be physically possible to continue finding the outlandish trail of clues) Harvey Keitel (as a burnt out federal agent searching for the robbers of the Declaration of Independence) and Christopher Plummer (as Gate's grandfather, who instilled his thirst for knowledge and adventure) taking supporting roles, none of them are given much to do due to their extremely thin characterizations, and seem uncomfortable lurking in the sidelines while Nick, Diane and Justin track down the treasure.<br/><br/>So there isn't much accomplished in terms of script or character development, acting is decent at best and the plot remains outlandish throughout, National Treasure remains a good, old fashioned, fun for the whole family movie (rated PG with no profanity or sex, and violence is virtually nonexistent) much in the mold of Indiana Jones. It's not very believable, but who needs it to be? Just sit back, and cherish the adventure.<br/><br/>-6/10"

All I needed to know, I rented it at first opportunity.<br/><br/>And I was not at all disappointed.<br/><br/>Actually, my only disappointment regarding this film has to do with the 6.6 out of 10 that IMDb members have given it. I give it an 8. It's not Indiana Jones, but it's a good bit of fun - with a bit of history mixed in besides."

","All this 'Templar Knights' stuff is becoming a little 'long-in-the-tooth'. No disrespect to the historical truth of the Knights of the Templar, nor Masons, nor anyone, but good heavens, enough already! I think that the only movie formula left undone, would be a Mel Brooks comedy on this subject.<br/><br/>On the good side, I'll tell you that the cast is great with fun performances by Cage, Kruger, Bartha and Bean, and then 'stacked' with nice work by Christopher Plummer, John Voight and Harvey Keitel, to boot.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a fun movie; a big long solve run chase twist and solve, some tense moments, with hardly any violence, nor ear curling language, nor eye popping 'romance', hence, a good family movie that everyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>If I had to say anything negative, well, if you want more violence, language and 'romance', this can get a little long and boring and tedious with a seemingly endless 'sequence' of clues.<br/><br/>But one way or the other, it's still worth seeing.<br/><br/>I guess that all these Templar Knight mysteries are, well, ""the, uh, stuff that dreams are made of""."

","I have to admit, I found ""National Treasure"" was a very pleasant surprise given how lousy I thought it was going to be. The trailers looked somewhat promising, but so far I hadn't been all that impressed with most Nicholas Cage movies with ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"" being the only two exceptions. Add ""National Treasure"" to that list.<br/><br/>The subject matter is one that I've always been interested in, and I thought it was handled fairly well. I was disappointed they didn't go into some of the ""darker"" rumors about the Templar Knights and the Freemasons (ala some of Dan Brown's works like Di Vinici Code and Angels & Demons), and I kept waiting for an ""Illuminati"" reference or two to pop up somewhere but it never happened. Still, delving into the masonic background of the ""founding fathers"" of the United States was quite enjoyable and really a switch from most Hollywood efforts.<br/><br/>Cage handled the role of Ben Gates very well... enough of the ""Stanley Goodspeed"" (""The Rock"") style without going overboard, and just the right subtle touch of a little ""Indiana Jones"" (any more would have made the movie unbearable). This is one of the few movies that I think his role meshed better with the other roles in the movie (particuarly the characters of Riley Poole and Abigail Chase).<br/><br/>Justin Bartha as Riley Poole was absolutely perfect, and while I wish they went more into the background of how he and Gates got together, Riley was the perfect comic foil/side-kick. Somehow, while watching him, I could easily see Bartha playing one either Merry or Pippin in LOTR. In fact, a movie based on Riley as the main character would have some great potential, providing Bartha remained in the role.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger is very lovely and a fine actress, and did quite well as Abigail Chase, but it wasn't until the end when I really thought her character finally stood enough on it's own.<br/><br/>Overall, quite enjoyable and one that I have already added to my DVD collection..."

","This I feel is a good solid movie. The best thing about it (besides the actual storyline)is the dialog/character interactions. It was pretty well casted, too.<br/><br/>The dialog (to me) is what makes this movie enjoyable. I love the way Cage, Bean, Voigt, and Bartha interact. I'm not usually a fan of Nicolas Cage, but he was good in this movie. Bean in National Treasure, just plays his typical roles you see him in. This supposedly good guy, helping out the good Cage, but he turns towards the wrong path. Bean is not necessarily a ""total villain,"" in his movies, he more represents the human nature. A man where power, wealth, and fame are more important than doing the right thing. (I am obviously not referring to the Sean Bean we see in Equilibrium). I love when Cage or Bean would be speaking, since they knew each other so well, the knew what they were thinking and would actually finish each others thoughts. Voigt plays this grumbling, you're wasting your time father. Bartha adds in the comedy.<br/><br/>This movie also brings out, that you don't have to make a mass killing/heads falling off gory war movie to be entertaining. There are a few fight scenes, a few action scenes that catch your attention, but for the most part, the story, and the suspense will keep you interested throughout.<br/><br/>I don't see how critics did not like this movie, but I guess we are all into different things."

I was disappointed to tell you the truth I figured it would be better than it was. The plot was fairly well conceived but didn't pay off like it should have I guess it reeked of too much Disney. Bruckheimer films don't impress me that much either as Jerry seems to go for mindless explosions and action with not a lot of substance. Too bad too because it could have been more than just decent.

","Another in a long list of Jerry Bruckheimer produced films, this film centers around the possibility of hidden treasure at the hands of our Founding Fathers and the Order of Masons.<br/><br/>The film stars, Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Gates; one of a long list of Gates who have spent most of their lives searching for this mysterious and elusive bounty. Benjamin, however, possesses the ability to unravel the encrypted clues set before him.<br/><br/>Ben's father, Patrick Gates (played by veteran actor Jon Voight) believes that the treasure is actually an elaborate hoax set in place to baffle the British during the time of the American Revolution at the exact timing as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This, as it so happens, plays a pivotal role and significant key piece to the long list of clues needed to decipher the puzzle of the treasure.<br/><br/>Done in typical Bruckheimer fashion, the film is grand in nature even if highly unbelievable; although it's quite the roller-coaster ride you've come to expect in a film of this magnitude. Running the gamut from Arctic Circle to burial tombs of Trinity Church, this film provides all the entertainment value required for an enjoyable night out.

"superscal23","Null","1","1","5 December 2004"," Yet another 2.5 star thriller
","Spoilers included<br/><br/>National Treasure is no different than hundreds of movies that have come out of Hollywood in the last few years. Big star gets thrown into a situation and has to find a way out with the help of a goofy sidekick, an aging actor in a supporting role, and a hot girl who works in a job a girl who looks like that would never have. All the while avoiding the bad guy, played, as always, by Sean Bean. And, like so many of those movies, NT has it's entertaining moments, but it the end, it falls just short of being a good movie.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage (Big Star) plays a man who has spent his life, or at least most of it, searching for a lost treasure. Where this treasure came from and why he is looking for it is so pointless and silly that it doesn't serve any purpose other than to kick the plot into motion. Early in the film, Cage is exploring the ruins of an ancient ship that has been frozen in the Arctic. His expedition includes Justin Bartha (Goofy Sidekick), who is best known as the retard in Gigli, Sean Bean (Sean Bean), and a couple of other guys who will only be killed later on, so we don't even need to know their names. <br/><br/>Once they find the clue they were looking for on the ship that will lead them to their next clue....dramatic music here....Sean Bean wants the treasure all to himself. So, he pulls a gun on Big Star and leaves him and Goofy Sidekick to die in the ship. I know you can't believe it either, but it turns out that Sean Bean is the bad guy. What a stunning and innovative casting choice. <br/><br/>Where the movie started to grab my attention is after this point. The next clue, they have discovered, is located on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Cage knows that Sean Bean is going to try and steal it, so he tries to stop that from happening. Wait a minute, I forgot to mention that Cage escapes the frozen ship and actually doesn't die 10 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>Anway, Cage goes to the national archives and tries to explain to Diane Kruger (Hot Girl) that the Declartion of Independence may be in danger. When she won't listen, Cage decides he will have to steal it himself. What I liked about the film is that the action and all the clues take place in Washington D.C., in Philadelphia, and in New York City. I was expecting an Indiana Jones style film about digging through the ruins, but most of National Treasure takes place in broad daylight, in well populated areas.<br/><br/>The scene where Cage is trying to steal the Declaration is the movies' best.<br/><br/>It's a well crafted and well acted scene, only made better by the fact that Bean and his crew show up at the same time. Amazing that they both try to steal it during a party for hundreds of people, but it's an entertaining enough scene to overlook that. This scene kind of reminded me of Woody Allen's ""Take the Money and Run"" in which two different sets of people show up to rob a bank at the same time, and the people have to vote on who they'd rather be held up by.<br/><br/>I digress. Anyway, the heist doesn't go well, oddly enough, and Cage is forced to turn to his father, Jon Voight (Aging Actor) for help. He doesn't want to help since he is the family outcast, because ""he has a job, a house, and health insurance."" Again, a nice moment.<br/><br/>What follows up to and including the climax of the movie are a series of chases, dramatic music, and gun pointing. There are only so many times that Big Star and Hot Girl can be holding on by just one finger while the no name actors around them plummet to their deaths. There is just way too much of that in National Treasure. There's too much disbelief that we are asked to suspend for the sake of convenience. <br/><br/>Some may find this movie to be educational, with teaching about the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, and the Liberty Bell. The problem is, pretty much every historical tidbit mentioned in this movie is stuff that anybody with half a brain learned in middle school. Anything we didn't already know, was made up for the movie.<br/><br/>If you're over the age of 3 months, you know how the movie ends, so I don't need to tell you. I also went through my whole review without mentioning Harvey Keitel, so that will tell you what little purpose his character serves in the film. So, the bottom line is, save your money, and just turn your TV on tonight, and you'll find exactly the same movie on 10 different channels."

","There is nothing like a great action film that leaves you high as a kite when you leave the theatre. You want to let go of reality for a couple hours and just enjoy an adventure. National Treasure is a movie with an incredibly unfortunate name!! Upon first seeing the trailer for this movie I was gripped to my seat until I saw the title...YUCK!! But fortunately for this title laden movie it kicks some serious butt!!<br/><br/>National Treasure is the story of Ben Franklin Gates, the ancestor of a long line of Gates family men who have hunting for the world's greatest treasure.<br/><br/>Ben's Grandfather revealed to him as a young boy the only clue they have in their possession and it begins an obsession for Ben to find this treasure that his grandfather and his father spent decades searching for. Only Ben has figured out how to decipher the clue that his Grandfather gave him and it leads his crew into the depths of the Artic Circle. Unfortunately Ben's team and friends turn on him leaving him for dead when they discover the map to the treasure is on none other than the back of the declaration of Independence. Now in order to protect the declaration Ben Gates and his last friend from the crew must steal it away from the bad guys to protect it and find the treasure first. Along for the ride, unwillingly at first is the beautiful Dr. Chase and eventually Ben's father who had long given up on the treasure.<br/><br/>I always say I'm not a Nick Cage fan but the truth is I love most films he does. Maybe it's just the way he picks his scripts but his action movies are some of the best movies...Con Air, The Rock, Face-Off and many more. He is one of those actors who acting ability doesn't stretch too far from character to character. At least in his action movies he's basically the same character but that's enough to have a great time watching. <br/><br/>National Treasure is an Indiana Jones type adventure but set in the United States which is very different for an adventure film. Most adventure films if not all need to go to some foreign, exotic location to make it believable but National Treasure happens right on our front door step. The film takes us from the Arctic Circle to Washington DC, to Boston, to Philladelphia, to New York, all around North America and it's fun and feels like you're treasure hunting with them. Add in some crazy chase scenes, a killer thieving caper scene with the Declaration and some amazing spots in the US.<br/><br/>The storyline is interesting, original, and very captivating. They use real life things to change it into clues for the treasure ie. 1 dollar bills, and the liberty bell and things on the Declaration. <br/><br/>The cast is awesome. Sean Bean is as always an excellent bad guy reminiscent of his role on Don't Say A Word, another amazing movie. Diane Kruger as Dr. Chase is wonderful first not believing Ben's plot and then becoming an unwilling participant to becoming a full blown co-hort and the leading lady to Nick's leading man of course. Appearances by Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer add some great class to the movie. Voight plays a very different character from his others. He's soft spoken, elderly, and shy and unsure of himself. A far cry of some his other rather loud roles he has played. Plummer's brief appearance is a nice cameo as well.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, one of the best of the year I think as far as action films go. Definitely don't hesitate to check this one because you will not be disappointed. I don't see them doing any future Ben Gate's films but it wouldn't be difficult to do another as he is a swashbuckling hero and rich too :)<br/><br/>9/10"

","Going into this movie, I didn't think too much of it since I'm not really a Nicolas Cage fan. The plot also sounded a bit far-fetched-an invisible treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence-but it turned out that that is what made it a good plot. The irony was also clever-to protect the Declaration of Independence from being stolen by his teammates turned rivals, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) had to steal it himself. I also enjoyed how the focus did not shift to the romance between Ben Gates and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). There was enough to make the movie interesting, but not so much as to steal the focus away from the plot. There were also interesting twists and a little comedy that kept me interested through the end of the movie. The cleanness of the language and action makes this movie enjoyable for all ranges of audiences."

","Over Thanksgiving weekend our group of 7 adults ranging from 21 to 55 chose National Treasure at the movies. Not one of us left the theater disappointed. <br/><br/>The gripping plot, the historical value and context, the romantic vibes, the action and adventure, and the cerebral-twisiting elements created a remarkably unique film in our time. It was clean to where parents didn't worry about an inappropriate scene for their kids; educational in that every ten minutes young and old gleaned a new tidbit about American history; and poignant for our day with the stark contrast between good and evil. The protagonist epitomized integrity and honesty - pertinent values for our time - and didn't succumb to pressure from the villains or his Father for that matter. He lived by what he knew was right at the core - he was intense, principled and believable. His sidekick, Riley, was hilarious and provided the comic relief. The girl, a new actress from Germany, added chemistry and poise to her part. And the villain played his role without a hitch in sophisticated slime, as Sean Bean always does. :O)<br/><br/>All in all, a fabulous film symbolizing more of the conviction, awareness, and principles we need in our time.....equally enjoyable for young and old!"

","Coleridge once said that anyone going to the theater must engage in the suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy a performance. National Treasure is an excellent family movie for all to see as it is suspenseful, beautifully shot, and with a plot similar to the DaVinci Code. Indeed, certain weak plot elements do call for the suspension of disbelief, but while this film may not rise to the level set by the Indiana Jones trilogy ,it is nice to take children to a movie which is not gratuitously laced with video- game violence or prurient -interest sex. Nicolas Cage, as well as the others in the cast, comport themselves very well and as said earlier this movie was beautifully filmed. The early promotions for this movie, especially the trailers done months before the release date, made me want to see this movie desperately and I was not disappointed and neither were my sons. Again, while there may be flaws, the fact that it is number #1 at the box office this week may be an indication that Americans love to see movies that are entertaining, well-acted, and capable of allowing all in the family to tag along with mom and dad."

","First off, I'll give you my rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>National Treasure, in brief, is about Ben Gates' [Nicholas Cage] quest to find a legendary treasure that has been protected for generations by the Freemasons. He, along with his comical techy sidekick Riley [Justin Bartha] and government worker Abigail Chase [Diane Kruger], follows clues [often found in historic locations] hoping to find the treasure. Gates' rival is Ian Howe [Sean Bean], who is also attempting to locate the treasure.<br/><br/>Well, for what National Treasure, it seems, desired to be, it did very well.<br/><br/>National Treasure is a pure entertaining film. It's got action, humor, history [actually made enjoyable!], and about a ¼ teaspoon of romance. Several one-liners, mostly from Riley, made me laugh out loud. There's action in car chase scenes, running scenes, and some Indiana Jones-reminiscent sequences towards the end.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a high-intellectual film, nor is it compelling drama or mystery. It's fun and enjoyable and takes you along for the ride. If you like Pirates of the Caribbean, well, the experience reminded me somewhat of that.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>--"

","I saw National Treasure with my kids (9 yrs. & 12 yrs.) and we had a GREAT time. There are few movies that I can make that statement about about with confidence, apart from most PIXAR offerings. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I take movie ratings seriously. I don't take my kids to PG-13 movies, yet, which seriously limits one's options. I found National Treasure to be a fun ride, with likable characters, plenty of suspense, good effects and well-placed humor.<br/><br/>I will grant you that this is not Raider's of the Lost Ark, but the cool thing about it is that it used a great deal of actual historical information in the story-building process (unlike most adventure films that rely on fictional myths and legends). My kids (and yes, I too) were more interested in all of the objects and places we saw in the movie AFTER it was over. Does it make you contemplate the meaning of life? No. But does it make you want to go to the National Archives? Absolutely - and I think that is a pretty worthy legacy."

","OK, when the main character's name is Benjamin Franklin Gates, you know this is not a movie to be taken too seriously. And yes, this one has obviously gotten a LOT of inspiration from ""The Davinci Code"" (as well as just about every treasure hunt/heist movie ever made), but it still is fun and enjoyable on its own. In fact, I thought this was a great movie--it's interesting, exciting, and suspenseful from start to finish. It also had some pretty funny lines, and to top it off, Diane Kruger is one amazingly beautiful woman!<br/><br/>Just a few things bugged me. For instance, I can't imagine the Declaration of Independence can be tossed around like that. When Nick Cage started rolling it up like a cheap poster, I wanted to shout at the screen, ""CAREFUL, you idiot!"" I really don't know how durable the thing is, but still. Plus, the grease and oil from all those people touching it with their bare hands can't be too good.<br/><br/>Also, how come, right when they need to drop lemon juice on it to read the invisible map, Jon Voight's character just happens to have about a dozen lemons on hand? This REALLY bugged me. No sane person would have that many lemons in their house. Barring some kind of lemon fetish, I would guess the average person goes through about two a year.<br/><br/>Small details aside though, this is a very enjoyable flick that is worth seeing in theaters.

","I'm just gonna go straight to the point. The story is this movie's biggest fault. If you're an American, you'll probably find it entertaining and maybe even good. But as a European you can only laugh. Not only are the British painted out as the big, evil 'entity' with world-domination on its agenda, but the story steals perhaps one of France's most legendary figures too. That's really what this is: a movie trying to connect the thousands of years of history of Europe to the young United States of America. It doesn't hold up.<br/><br/>If you have read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, you'll recognize the story as well. Kinda of a rip-off actually. Same treasure, a lot of clues at famous places, mean guys wants it for themselves, etc. And that's another weak point of National Treasure's story, the treasure is boring. It's just a big pile of money! Big deal. Had it been the Holy Grail or some world-changing information that someone didn't want to get out, or keep for themselves, that could've made a captivating motive. National Treasure is just a tour of historic places and objects in USA, with even more (although stolen) history added to it. Boring and most of all ridiculous."

Basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. Firstly, why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages character figure out that 'Charlotte' was in fact a ship? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of Hollywood action gone wrong. Cage has been in some great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this? Is he getting too old?! His character is pretty annoying really - Somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the Declaration of Independancd, outruns thieves with guns, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible.

See this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good film. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like it more. For instance, the scene where Cage is fleeing from armed gunmen, and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape.

"tedg","Null","4","10","4 December 2004"," Culture Wars
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Sad to say, finally Bruckheimer had the makings of a pretty good movie and blew it by engaging a non-director director. These things can be successful on their own terms - even with most of the flaws this one has - if only a few necessities are satisfied. The thing has to have coherence - not story coherence, but a consistent being. The art direction, writing, acting, editing, framing of shots and such all have to come from the same spot on whatever spectra are acknowledged. Usually that means a position on the ""are we taking this seriously or not"" spectrum, plus a few others.<br/><br/>The key one has to do with the pulse of the thing. Every film has a rhythm, every living film at least. But all the components of the thing have to key into that pulse. It cannot be decided toward the end in editing. Here, every component goes its own way, even the score which seems to have been borrowed from other projects.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that a decent director could have made something worth watching out of this. Of course a decent director would have changed a few procedural things that weren't working. But the important thing is he would have made the thing have a coherent pulse.<br/><br/>Its too bad, because the mythology behind this has gas, more even as a first instance of a genre than original mummy and Frankenstein movies and as much as the western. There's a huge literature relating to mystical traditions of the US Founding Fathers, much more than the ready fiction that they founded the country on 'Christian' principles. It is all bogus, of course but has a the patina of reality that films like to puff up.<br/><br/>Could have made a strong film out of this. You can see that the producers at least had a glint of this culture wars play in mind, because Diane Kruger is made to present that sort of vacant cowgirl persona invented by country music.<br/><br/>And that business about 'giving' to the world (without mentioning that it was taken from the world).<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","There is a line in The 51st State (Formula 51 to Americans) where one character says to the other about a certain meal: ""Fish and chips mate, national dish"" to which someone else replies ""More like a national disaster"" before tossing it out of the window. This is the sort of line you might copy when talking to someone about this film: 'Entertainment, fun and CGI = National Treasure' to which anyone else might reply 'More like a national disaster'. ""It's not like Pirates, is it?"" says Ian Howe, played by Sean Bean in a 'nod' to Disney's other overblown, underdone live action romp Pirates of the Caribbean. Well actually, yes it's a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean and that link should be enough to deter anybody over the age (or should that be IQ?) of eighteen as far away from this film as possible.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is; if you crammed in any more formula, clichés or nasty representations into National Treasure then it would probably explode in a bright display of British villains, hard bodied blondes and one-liners. But that's exactly what we get here and at a time when the big budgeted action adventure film is wracking in more money than you might earn for Internet shares that rose throughout the 1980s. There was a time when these films did not exist; there was a time when you did not need to go into a film with that nasty sensation at the back of your mind: 'Oh, I do hope this won't be another crap entry in the genre'. Sometimes you get lucky but the sway is overwhelming and National Treasure is one of those that catches you out.<br/><br/>The film plays out more like an scenario closely resembling 'The Da Vinci Code for kids' than it does an all round, children and adults orientated action adventure film. There are no thrills, there are no spills; there is no horror or jumps or violence and there are no interesting characters; merely names and appearances written down on paper with the actors/actresses' names accompanying them on the document. National Treasure is a passage  it's a passage of scenes with no real logic nor fun, just complicated and uninteresting scenarios that exist so that 'bums-on-seats' specialist Nicolas Cage can come along and solve them.<br/><br/>In fact the film is so bad when I think about it that it comes close to parodying itself. Nearer the end, one character states ""A jump like that could kill a man"" as Ben Gates (Played by Cage) leaps off a boat or a marina (I forget) and into the water from a great height. No, a jump like that will not kill a man  not in this genre. This reference in alerting the audience that, in the real world the jump would kill a man, is second perhaps only to Jaws: The Revenge when it comes to conflicting the film's actual loyalties. The Jaws sequel scene in question is when a character states 'sharks cannot kill humans in the goal for revenge' thus contradicting the film's entire premise so for National Treasure to be on par with this sort of logic only backs up my idea that the film is really poor.<br/><br/>But National Treasure is not just stupid, it is offensive. Nicholas Cage is a name and a face and one that will bring in the audiences which means more money for Disney. German pretty-girl Diane Kurger plays Abigail Chase who is, believe it or not, a doctor. There is a hilariously bad scene early on when Gates and his sidekick walk into her office and exclaim their surprise at the doctor being a woman  no surprises from me. As an educated doctor who collects coins, Abigail Chase exists only in this film as a watered down love interest; a love interest that is only made apparent for the very last scene when a dumb joke is cracked to do with lovemaking. Although there is another reason the good doctor is a woman in this film and it is so that the character's cleavage is given a few instances of screen time. I have identified this as a tactic so that when the main characters are talking and going over the next plot points, the teenagers in the audience can ignore these particular 'boring' scenes full of dialogue and focus on the some necessary distractions  how sad. And they call this a film.<br/><br/>The bad guys exist in this film's world to merely spread menace and act all tough in an attempt to try and make an atmosphere. They fail because, guess what; they're European  how original. Sean Bean plays the bad guy, a British villain and what about his cronies? They're Russian  hilarious. It makes you beg for another Cold War so that these stupid ideas of the 'evil' British and Russians working against the innocent, fun, 'all for a good cause' Americans would go away. The same thing happened in Cage's 2007 film 'Next' in which the villains were German and French. Then there is Riley Poole (Bartha) who exists only to inspire dumb laughs at dumb times (which is practically every frame of the film) and to crack one-liners with Cage every now and again. How sad. And so, National Treasure soon falls into its rut of cause and effect scenes about something that affects Americans more than it does me; relying on the fact we must trust these caricatures and what they say is correct to carry us through. Watch out for my favourite part of the film: the gang have just escaped the museum and randomly, Cage grabs Kruger; shakes her vigorously and yells: ""Are you hungry!?""  Hilarious."
"funkyfry","5","2","4","5 September 2007"," mediocre adventure film
","""National Treasure"" is not a movie I have a lot to say about so I'll try and keep my comments brief. It's a decent family film I assume, but not that much fun for me. I love the old-school adventure movies and even a lot of the nostalgic films that ""throwback"" to this time, i.e. ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"". ""National Treasure"" on the other hand is a modern-day story and not a period story, but the style is somewhat similar in its lack of pretense and focus on adventure styled action that's less violent than what we see in most ""action movies"" these days.<br/><br/>I was amused to read through some of the comments and see that a lot of people hated the film because it was ""stupid"" or variations on that theme. Probably they don't realize that pretty much everyone over the age of 12 who actually enjoyed the film knew that it was a stupid movie but were mature enough to enjoy it anyway. Nobody should expect a history lesson from the film, although it is somewhat amusing to draw such an adventure out of America's founding fathers' Masonic legacy. In the end though the film's reverence for Ben Franklin et al felt a bit too heavy-handed, as if they were some kind of wizards of antiquity.<br/><br/>So I was ready to drop all intellectual pretense, but still the movie was only mildly entertaining. The comic relief offered by Justin Bartha was distracting; they should either have labored to make him a good straight sidekick or a goofy humorous one, but instead tried for both and failed at each. I guess he was supposed to be relatively ""normal"" and someone who the average ""Gen X"" or ""Gen Y"" or whatever it's called now could identify with. To me he was just a lame character played by a virtual non-actor. Not much more from leading lady Diane Kruger. Lovely to look at, but she's been given a horrible role here in which her only purpose is to make love to Nicholas Cage and be the butt of bad humiliating jokes. Cage is all right but that's about it, not even as much fun in this one as he was in the much cheesier ""Ghost Rider."" The idea of him being from a family of treasure hunters who are discredited by the academic community is a good one. Casting professional estranged father Jon Voight as his daddy wasn't. Even more embarrassing was Harvey Keitel in a thankless role as a federal agent. I'm sure this film paid for a few interesting independent films for Keitel but that doesn't mean I have to like seeing him in such a dull role far beneath his capabilities.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the film for me was the music. It was just the most generic pounding theme, alternating big symphonic bombast with grating electronic drumbeats. This music is a perfect metaphor describing the film itself  loud, empty, not as much fun as it should be.<br/><br/>It wasn't a total disaster though, just not something I can really embrace because all the fun parts are diluted by the things that annoyed me. I did think it was an attractive film, and the pace was pretty good. I probably would have enjoyed it slightly more in the theater. Sean Bean was a pretty good villain, more restrained than most movie bad guys. I really enjoy the idea of the treasure, it excites me more as a student of history than for its value in money, so I sympathized with the main character's ethical standard regarding disposing of the treasure. Of course in reality the founding fathers put America deeply in debt with the expense of the Revolutionary War against Imperial England, causing a tax on distillation which in turn led to the famous ""Whiskey Rebellion"" in Pennsylvania, and if they had access to any kind of treasure whatsoever they would have used it for the nation's benefit instead of hiding it away where it would do no good to anyone. But whatever.. it's still a fun idea. I just wish they had done more with it."

","Kids deserve somewhat better, I think.<br/><br/>The well-known cast still does not counterbalance the lack of a plot, especially, as they receive no chance to act. The characters are both undefined and unrealistic. I can't possibly imagine why Diane Kruger would be nominated for a best supporting role for the job she does here at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films and why supporting, anyway? I thought she is the main guys love interest, and she has quite a decent amount of screen time. <br/><br/>The good points are references to the Freemasons (this usually works, here even this is creaking), and the spectacular inside shots in the museum. Walt Disney can always be relied upon when it comes to good looks. <br/><br/>Hidden chambers in the subway, involved parents and the Declaration of Independence with the lack of real action are just too much, especially without a link between them, but following upon each other. <br/><br/>I think this movie might work after all, in case you watch it as a genre parody, and do not expect too much. Parents should explain to their children afterwards that these sort of films can also be done properly, this one is not to be considered as standard. <br/><br/>And my personal question: if good guys use Google and bad guys use Yahoo, where would I qualify as user of MSN?

","One of the enjoyable things about the whole series of Potter movies (aside from superb casts) is that they are pure fantasy and no one would ever get confused and think they were anything but that. And then come along things like the Da Vinci Code and National Treasure which blur the line between facts and fiction so badly that many people may get confused. No, I'm not talking about the back of the Declaration of Independence... the thought that there is a secret map on the back was so silly that surely few would believe it was true. But the idea that the Knights Templar formed into the Free Masons is not true. The Templars were disbanded in the 13th century. Free Masonry did not come about until the 1700s. But this confusion was used for plot simplicity, allowing the signers of the Dec. of Ind., many of whom were Masons, suddenly be transformed into Knights Templar. Then they could hide the Templars' Treasure. The problem of this nonsense for me is since so many people don't read (or think) they may actually believe this is true. It's not! The Masonic Order is non-denominational. It avows belief in a Supreme Being, but no particular one. The Knights Templar were catholic monks who became warriors. The two groups couldn't be further from each other. So that turns the entire plot into utter drivel. And that matches the dialog, the acting, the car chases...etc. Another Bruckheimer crowd pleaser which has the depth of a puddle. In the past, crowd pleasers could have some body, even a message about life. The message in this one is, save your money.

","It is one of these blockbusters made to be efficient and earn money. Cage has his typical blockbusters-noemotionnormoving-face and acting. Sean Bean is in it (I should hae be warned, I do not know any good movie with Bean in it), as well as Jon Voight,who is not really acting but only appearing from ""MI 1"" (as he had reluctantly shot movies that did not deserved his talent). On the other side,Christopher Plummer and Harvey Keitel (as good as usual) do waste their talents while playing supporting roles. Diane Kruger is delightful, and the young hero's best friend is doing his best (which is not so bad). The story is funny, but above all, the way it is screen-played is pathetic: Dear studios, please fire your popcorn-writers and hire real ones! The result is a pale copy of ""Indiana Jones"" movies. What makes the movie watchable when you want to empty your mind, is the slight humor in it (and Diane Kruger's beautiful...eyes and...smile).<br/><br/>However, the underlying references are interesting, enlightening the free masons' role in the building of the free US and their values (together with the pilgrim fathers and protestants), from the declaration of independence to the mason symbol on USD bills."
"Rich B","3","2","4","8 December 2005"," A contrived, hand holding movie that demeans the audience placed in a very strong DVD offering.
","I never really thought much of this movie from the moment I saw the opening ten minutes that the Studio posted on the Internet, the conclusions of the main character to work through the puzzles were completely wild and speculative, grasping at straws the audience had even conceived, and it just made the writing seem extremely dumb.<br/><br/>When I saw the whole movie I wasn't far wrong, the person I watched it with actually fell asleep during the movie. So why the score you might ask, well that's down to the DVD itself. It's a superbly interactive DVD that can keep you amused for sometime, encouraging you to work through all the additional materials to figure out the clues contained within.<br/><br/>As for the movie...well...<br/><br/>Movie The opening speaks for itself. Once past the short sequence to set the scene for who the main character is and what they are searching for, you're propelled into the middle of the frozen wastes where the team finds a ship buried over two hundred years ago in snow and ice within inches of the surface of the current snowfall. Plus, the identification clue happens to be on the very part of the boat that is sticking so close to the surface, just where the character digs. Already you know this is going to be one dumb movie.<br/><br/>It goes on with the ease in which the character deciphers clues and his ludicrous recitement of how they are worked out. Just like reciting a script rather than fathoming out a problem, he speeds through it and the audience is left wondering what just happened and how.<br/><br/>Every solved problem from here is over explained and the audience hand held through the finding. The series of events is so over explained that there's no real feeling of involvement in the discoveries, apart from the attempt to reveal the map on the back of the declaration. This leaves the audience just to watch the events pass by them one by one.<br/><br/>What this then means is that there's no big surprise when we come to the revealing of the treasure room, or the twist just prior. There's no sense of urgency and discovery, this is nothing like an Indy treasure hunt, this is like following a satellite photo treasure map using GPS trackers. You just head there via various points and there you go.<br/><br/>There's a big action sequence in the middle of the film, and this is (as is always the case in Hollywood nowadays) comprised of close-ups and fast cuts, making it hard to follow.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is thoroughly disappointing, and the reworked ending very poor.<br/><br/>Picture Presented: 2.35:1 Anamorphic The picture is good throughout, and copes well with some very realistic lighting conditions, particularly with torches as the source light.<br/><br/>Audio Presented: Dolby Digital 5.1 The audio is really good on this movie. It's big with some good LFE mix. A good use of the directional sound offered with 5.1, as the sound moves around you a fair bit and then really pounds you at crucial moments, filling the room.<br/><br/>Extras Presented: Deleted Scenes, Various Making of Featurettes, Opening Scene Animatic, Alternate Ending, Additional information on Treasure Hunters, the Knights Templar and a Trivia Viewing of the movie. The extras are within multiple hidden areas, watching the content from one will give you the codes for the other, it takes a little while to get through, but at least this gives you the feeling of being involved if the movie didn't. Deleted Scenes - These are okay, nothing special and just two in all. Featurettes - As standard, mostly the made for TV promotions you see. Animatic Opening - This is quite interesting, seeing the computer rendered version of the opening sequence used early on in the production as a placeholder for when the final effects were completed. Alternate Ending - What's interesting is that this ending is much stronger and less Hollywood than the one actually used, and they should have used this one. However maybe that would have not held with the outlook of the rest of the film. Treasure Hunters, Knights Templar - Both these extras are very informative and educational, and are well worth a watch. These two extras are two of the best items on the DVD. Trivia Viewing - This allows you to watch the whole movie again but this time with little popups telling you some interesting and educational facts about what is actually going on in the film. Some are wildly off topic, but they are very interesting and made me watch the movie again.<br/><br/>Overall This movie is pretty poor. It's nice to look at, and some of the scenes are good, but overall it's hand holding and treating the audience as idiots. I'm sure it's wholesome young family fun, but definitely not for those who like something a bit more engaging in their movie experience.<br/><br/>What does make this package though is the DVD offering and the way it is put together. Decoding sections of the DVD in order to find the hidden content really does make you want to delve in and solve it, and therefore go through the content. For the most part it's average, but two of the featurettes and the Trivia viewing are educational, informative and actually really quite interesting. It's here that the DVD makes up some serious ground for me."

"David_Frames","5","2","4","14 May 2005"," If there's treasure here it's very well hidden.
","Yet more from the rather dung encrusted stable of Jerry Bruckheimer; a slight vehicle for Nicolas Cage who plays a modern day Indiana Jones, albeit one who's smoked a lot more dope and isn't overtly physical. He's the latest in along line of treasure hunters who are convinced that somewhere in America there's a hoard of priceless artifacts which have alluded the common man for the better part of 200 years. The opener establishes that this trove is signposted in invisible ink on the back of that treasonous document, the so-called Declaration of Independence. The rest of the movie is one long chase as all concerned rush to steal said map and acquire the spoils. National Treasure isn't much of anything; light on action, thin on plot and about as subtle as pair of testicles in a vegetarian salad. It's supposed to be light and entertaining family fare and in this respect its partially successful, after all it moves along at a fair old pace and never gets too violent or taxing for younger viewers. That's not really enough to sustain the rest of us over the course of two hours though and its hard to escape the conclusion that its a decidedly poor effort given the potential of the premise. No-one's expecting Citizen Kane here but would a bit more attention to character and some descent set-pieces have killed anyone? Incidentally, a word to the Hollywood elite: NEVER cast Sean Bean as a villain again under any circumstances - I mean it, the next time I go on a bloody killing spree."
"BrandtSponseller","10","2","4","14 May 2005"," Weaving intricate fictions
","With conspiracy theory being as widespread as it is in the real world, you'd expect there to be a film like National Treasure long before now. While this isn't the first film to utilize the ideas of our culture's members prone to constructing and propagating elaborate paranoid-delusional fantasies--Conspiracy Theory (1997) is an obvious past example, and another was the Skulls (2000) series--this is the first film to build conspiracy theory into this kind of tasty adventure/mystery/action/thriller mix that's part Indiana Jones, part Douglas Adams' marvelous Dirk Gently books (yes, it's _that_ literate), and part heist films like The Score (2001).<br/><br/>Benjamin ""Ben"" Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is the latest member in a family long concerned with what others would call conspiracy theory, especially the portion of it about Freemasons (although in the real world, one portion tends to be so elaborately connected to other portions that it would be difficult to siphon just a section of it off). Because of something that Gates' great, great, great . . . . grandfather was told, it had been passed down through Gates' family lore that the Freemasons were responsible for sheltering some remarkable treasure--the only hard piece of ""evidence"" that the first Gates possessed was that the treasure had something to do with ""Charlotte"". Eventually, the Gates family, because of their interest in conspiracy theories, earned a reputation among scholars for being kooks.<br/><br/>National Treasure begins with a brief bit of historical/background exposition about the relevant bits of conspiracy theory (which of course are so enmeshed with almost mundane historical facts that it becomes difficult to separate the two--that's part of why conspiracy theory is so easily propagated), then moves to Gates as a boy, when he first learns the family legend. We then move to Gates as a 30-something year old explorer and fringe scholar, who of course is now deeply ensconced in a far-reaching search for clues leading to the treasure, despite the protests of his father, Patrick Henry Gates (Jon Voight). Ben has both majored in history and undergone specialized military training to give him a better background for his quest. We join Ben in the Arctic, searching for a long lost ship beneath the ice. He ends up with an enemy who is pursuing the same goals, and the film becomes a race for Gates to find clues and solve puzzles leading to the treasure--which just might turn out to be a myth, after all--before his enemy can, all while avoiding law enforcement for the various crimes he must commit to reach his goal.<br/><br/>On a script/story level, National Treasure succeeds as well as it does because of two reasons. One, the story and characters are intelligent. There is a wonderful parallel between National Treasure as a fiction and conspiracy theory in the real world. They both weave clever although sometimes verging-on-the-ridiculous fantasies that are well rooted in facts--often relatively obscure and arcane facts. Two, as a series of increasingly intricate clues and puzzles, all built upon previous clues and solutions to puzzles, the film is very intellectually stimulating in its resemblance to interactive fiction/role playing computer games. Just as a gamer can get easily wrapped up in those games as they vicariously become some fantastical, fictional character, a viewer can become enmeshed in National Treasure.<br/><br/>But on top of that, director John Turtletaub and his team of scriptwriters have layered well-executed action and thriller material as well as an Indiana Jones-ish location-hopping adventure story. National Treasure is frequently suspenseful, with the nail-biting threats coming from three angles--villains, authority figures, and the environment. Of course, there's also a bit of a romance subplot in the film, as well as some well-placed comic relief. National Treasure isn't about breaking new ground or bucking trends as much as excelling at proved ground and trends.<br/><br/>On that end, the technical aspects are superb, even if they're not groundbreaking. Superb technical elements--such as cinematography, lighting, editing, production design, score, and of course directing--are to be expected at this budgetary level ($100 million plus) of film-making. While I wouldn't give significant extra points at this level for just doing the job right, I certainly won't subtract any just for not doing something unprecedented, either. As if National Treasure needed bonus points, anyway.<br/><br/>The cast is also excellent, although if you hate Nicolas Cage, you may still dislike him here. He does his typical ""schtick"", which means, among other things, that he's a bit wry and occasionally spastic. I like his typical schtick a lot. Diane Kruger, in addition to playing her role well, is beautiful, of course, which doesn't hurt the visual attraction of the film. The big stars who take smaller parts--Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer--are well utilized. They're skilled enough to quickly establish depth for their characters, but Turtletaub doesn't put them in the film so much that it becomes unfocused.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that National Treasure is a ""popcorn"" or ""leave your brain at the door"" film. That's not really true, but neither is it true that you have to be a conspiracy theorist or historian to enjoy the film. National Treasure is both intellectually and emotionally stimulating as well as suspenseful and vicariously fantastical for the better part of two hours. You can't ask much more of a film than that."

","Wake up! This is a kid's movie made with an adult budget and at least four A-list actors. On that level it's fine; my 10 year old daughter has seen it twice and loves it, but then she's at an age when something like this seems complex and clever, like Nancy Drew on steroids. Grownups should look elsewhere...but apparently many of them like it just fine here. That just flat out amazes me.<br/><br/>Why, why, why so many raves on IMDb for this overlong, incredibly derivative and mind-numbingly mediocre movie? I especially like all the comments by people who say ""I'm not a Nicholas Cage fan but I really liked him in this."" Well, I AM a Nicholas Cage fan and he isn't even trying here (which means he's still better than most living actors). See him in ""Matchstick Men"" to get an idea of what he's capable of, circa 2004. Similarly amusing are all the ""Best since Raiders of the Lost Ark"" notes. Believe me, this doesn't belong on the same planet with that classic. The Brendan Frasier ""The Mummy"" is vastly better than this and great fun for Indy fans, while somehow not ripping him off, at least not egregiously. Too scary for most kiddies, though.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just fun to watch top flight actors like Harvey K. and Jon V. go slumming like this. Maybe that's it. But I was ready for some fresh air after the first 40 minutes - and there were another 91 to go. Yawn.<br/><br/>Oh yeah: Diane Kruger is very, very pretty and can act to boot. Generally I tend to side with Marianne Faithful, one of the world's famous blonds herself, who once said that ""All blonds are the same."" Diane is a powerful exception; it would be nice to see her in something worth my time. If not my car."

The character development is great and Nicholas Cage does a superb job of portraying the outcast treasure hunter. With no doubt this is my favorite movie of the year.

","After the release of Pirates of the Caribbean, my trust was renewed in the production talents of Jerry Bruckheimer. This movie was no different. Bruckheimer and Turteltaub have taken a well-written script and turned it into an action-packed adventure well worth a 10. As a history major, I found the connection to the past quite fun, as well as a nice change from the pointless plots of many other action films. One of the things I appreciated most about this movie was its cleanliness. Not only did it have minimal swearing (if it had any at all), but the sexual themes that are prevalent in many action movies were not there this time around. For that, I am grateful."

","This is a Saturday afternoon popcorn flick at best. Another one of the mediocre movies of 2004. An unimaginative version of the last Indiana Jones movie without a single memorable character. There were a few good lines but so many cheesy ones that the poor good ones are easily forgotten. A movie filled with plot wholes, inept villains and FBI agents. A really predictable and unsatisfying ending. In fact (my spoiler is next) I think it would have been so much better if they hadn't found any gold or monetary treasure just more history like in the Indiana Jones movies. What's treasure to an historian is information about the past, not fast car and big houses. Even the Mummy movies knew that."

And we LOVE movies! We couldn't believe anything could be this bad and still make it to the box office. Showgirls is the only other movie I can think of that would top this stinker. <br/><br/>The female side-kick is completely unbelievable, unlikeable and there is ZERO chemistry between her and Cage. The movie would have been so much better without her at all - she was completely unneeded and her performance showed that. It is almost like all the actors are sleepwalking through the whole film. The plot is so convoluted and so outrageous that to compare it to the brilliance of The DaVinci Code is like comparing a GED to a Master's degree at MIT.<br/><br/>I can't believe I hated it as much as I did.

"dilipbts","8","0","0","30 June 2020"," National treasure
","This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.<br/><br/>So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.<br/><br/>And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones."

","National treasure is not a good movie but it is a guilty pleasure of mine. Starting with the positives the cinematography was fine, it had its moments and I like the concept despite it being done on many occasions. There is one sequence that I genuinely thought was great during the second act of the film but it was definitely not enough to save it. Now, the acting was bad, sometimes laughable. The Casting is also terrible, especially for Nicolas Cage he does not suit this role well. Technically National Treasure is bad, some of the editing chooses are just stupid, the sound design is just dumb and some of the sound effects used are extremely annoying, the music is also annoying and played loudly in the worst possible moments, it's not even a good score. However my biggest problem with the film is Nicolas cage's sidekick character Riley, played by Justin Bartha, he is so annoying and unfunny and ruins the pacing of the film during the 1st and 2nd act. The people making the film decided its absolutely nessasary to have him react to literally everything that happens, this can take up to a minute and completely take you out of whatever is happening to our main characters.<br/><br/>Even though I know National Treasure is not good by any means I still enjoy it enough each time I see it. I would not recommend it to a critical film viewer like myself but if your looking for a enjoyable experience that you don't need to think about its decent."

","Here is a movie about a fabled ancient treasure from the Middle East, protected through the ages by the Knights Templar and the Masons, and hidden for centuries until a modern investigator follows a series of baffling clues that lead him first to a priceless work in a national gallery, and then to a hiding place beneath an ancient church.<br/><br/>If you are one of the millions, like me, who plowed through The Da Vinci Code, you can be forgiven for thinking they've made it into a movie. And in a way, they have, but the movie is titled ""National Treasure."" This new Jerry Bruckheimer production is so similar in so many ways to the plot of the Dan Brown best seller that either (a) the filmmakers are the only citizens of the entertainment industry who have never heard of The Da Vinci Code, no, not even while countless people on the set must have been reading the book, or (b) they have ripped it off. My attorneys advise me that (a) is the prudent answer.<br/><br/>That I have read the book is not a cause for celebration. It is inelegant, pedestrian writing in service of a plot that sets up cliff-hangers like clockwork, resolves them with improbable escapes and leads us breathlessly to a disappointing anticlimax. I should read a potboiler like The Da Vinci Code every once in a while, just to remind myself that life is too short to read books like The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci movie, set for 2005, will be directed by Ron Howard, who should study this one for clues about what to avoid. The central weakness of the story is the absurdity of the clues, which are so difficult that no sane forefather could have conceivably believed that anyone could actually follow them. That the movie's hero, named Benjamin Franklin Gates and played by Nicolas Cage, is able to intuitively sense the occult meanings of ancient riddles and puzzles is less a tribute to his intelligence than to the screenplay supplying him with half a dozen bonus A-ha! Moments. An A-Ha! Moment, you will recall, is that moment at which a movie character suddenly understands something which, if he did not understand it, would bring the entire enterprise to a halt.<br/><br/>Benjamin Franklin Gates is named, of course, after the famous software millionaire. His family of historians has been scorned for generations because of its belief that a vast treasure was brought back from the Crusades by the Knights Templar and has been hidden by the Masons -- in this case, Masons who were the Founding Fathers of America. Benjamin's father, Patrick Henry Gates (played by Jon Voight and named after O. Henry), scoffs at the family legend, but his grandfather John Adams Gates (played by Christopher Plummer and named after the inventor of the toilet) gives Benjamin a clue handed down through the generations from Charles Carroll, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence.<br/><br/>This clue, which involves the word ""Charlotte,"" seems baffling until Benjamin has an A-Ha! and leads an expedition north of the Arctic Circle in search of a 19th century sailing ship which, he calculates, must have frozen in the ice and then been shifted miles inland by the gradual movement of the floes. To say the expedition finds the ship without much trouble is putting it mildly; Benjamin digs about a foot down into the permafrost, and then bends over and wipes clean a brass nameplate that helpfully says ""Charlotte.""<br/><br/>Clues on the ship lead him to believe the map to the treasure may be written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence -- a safe place for it, because such a document would be guarded down through the ages. Of course there is the problem of convincing the National Archives to allow you to remove the Declaration from its vacuum-sealed vault and molest it with lemon juice and a hair dryer. Luckily the National Archivist, Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), named after her scenes in the movie, is convinced by Benjamin, and together they team up to steal the Declaration before the villain (Sean Bean) can steal it first.<br/><br/>After many chases and close calls and quick thinking and fast footwork and hanging from swinging doors and leaping chasms, etc., the heroes find themselves in a collapsing mine shaft beneath a church tomb -- a shaft that must have been created secretly, although it seems roughly the size of Boston's Big Dig. Whether they're on a wild goose chase or find the fortune of the ages, I will leave for you to discover. I understand why it is necessary, in The Da Vinci Code, to conceal information associated with the Holy Grail, but I am less convinced, in ""National Treasure,"" that the treasure had to be hidden because it was so vast that if all that wealth came suddenly into the world it would, I dunno, capsize the economy or cause the brains of accountants to explode.<br/><br/>Cage, one of my favorite actors, is ideal for this caper because he has the ability to seem uncontrollably enthusiastic about almost anything. Harvey Keitel, who plays FBI agent Sadusky, falls back on his ability to seem grim about almost anything. Jon Voight calls on his skill at seeming sincere at the drop of a pin. Diane Kruger has a foreign accent even though she is the National Archivist, so that our eyes can mist at the thought that in the land of opportunity, even a person with a foreign accent can become the National Archivist. ""National Treasure"" is so silly that the Monty Python version could use the same screenplay, line for line.<br/><br/>S."

At first they find this ship with his partner in artic full with barrels and bo treasure of course the barrels were full of gun powder they start searching for the treasure but they found nothing and here is the first foul why nobody complain about it everyone is cool an nobody asking about why or how is empty then cage find a clue with a riddle that he resolved it in a minute and then his associate betrayed him with the a fire from the gun powder that they threw before (whatever) then they try to steal scroll of independence and they came up with the most Hollywood way of course then the run away but the woman that she has no character develop run after them to team up at the very end (whatever). Anyway after many clues that they found very easy of course they found the treasure under the subway in New York . Hold on. UNDER THE SUBWAY IN NEW YORK....like nobody found it with digging from the subway workers only Cage. And the treasure is many statues from Egypt mostly and around the world but the most important that made me laugh was the line: ""Scroll from the library of Alexandria"" That burned during Cesar's civil war in Egypt in 48 bc, well yeah it's a treasure after all (whatever)and after they found the treasure everyone was so ""ok what's next"" like they don't care at all"

","I have perpetually been a sucker for the hunting legends of treasure. It has to be the feeling of adventure present in these sorts of movies. This movie isn't based on fact and you can nitpick 90 percent of the plot points if you like, however, you can turn your brain off and enjoy the film much more.<br/><br/>You're much better off with this mentality, as this film sustains a good deal of fun. Nicholas Cage performs typically goofy and the guy can't help but entertain me. The fact that the writers took something that would otherwise be considered boring and made it very interesting, even when almost completely fictitious, is the element that makes this movie so pleasant to me.<br/><br/>Some of the lines are cringe-worthy and certain plot points are difficult to get through, but that is to be anticipated for such a ludicrous story.

","Disney hit the right spot with this live-action adventure yarn. This film has everything. An imaginative and well-structured story. Fully fleshed-out characters that are both believable and relatable. Great direction, which takes you on an enthralling and entertaining rollercoaster ride of thrills, action, and history. In fact, there is very little wrong with this picture.<br/><br/>Okay, so history isn't the most exciting of subjects when you're at school... and to be honest a lot of it still bores me. So when I heard the concept of the story I did groan a little. However, great news for me, and the rest of the audience, is that the team of writers keep this story very far away from Driesville. So thanks to Jim Kouf, Oren Aviv, Charles Segars, and Cormac & Marianne Wibberley for giving us such a great story and cast of characters. Down to this story and film alone, I prefer Benjamin Franklin Gates over Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon. Not only does Gates have something to prove it's personal. This gives him an added depth the others don't possess.<br/><br/>But a movie is a visual beast. Thank God that Jon Turtletaub had a good and firm grip on the directorial reins. For one thing, he has a great eye. There wasn't a single instance where my eyes strayed from the screen. He has great composition and detail manipulation. Without this, the revelation of the ""treasure"" clues would have lost a lot of their power, which would be a shame. Here he makes them a substantial part of the story. Though it's the action sequences that pack a considerable punch. I especially liked the chase scene after the declaration theft. This is fast, frantic, and furious fun. Turtletaub also directs his cast perfectly.<br/><br/>This is practically the perfect cast. Granted the writers created a great ensemble but without the right actors and actresses to give them voice and emotions the film could have sunk. However, all the players portray their characters perfectly. Even the interactions between them are excellent. I particularly like the banter and connection that Gates and Ian Howe, Sean Bean, have. Once, partners in treasure hunting they are forced to become competitors. Though it gets deadly between them they keep the chatter light and friendly. It's also nice that in the frenetic storyline we are allowed to see the budding romance between Gates and Abigail Chase, Diane Kruger.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a lighthearted, treasure-hunting, action-adventure film then this should be one of the first films you look to. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Come on over and check out my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero and Guilty Pleasures lists to see where I've charted this film. You may even find something new to tickle your viewing fancy."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","0","30 January 2020"," National Treasure cryptically explores Freemasonry, occasionally striking treasured gold.
","Adventurous mysteries. From 'Indiana Jones' to 'The Da Vinci Code'. Archaeologists, symbologists, cryptologists and all-round treasure hunters. Journeying with these characters through flawed history never ceases to enthral me. Succumbing to the comfort of my sofa as our protagonists uncover the next clue on their prolonged quest. National Treasure is no different, which sees an amateur cryptologist search for a hidden stockpile of artefacts accumulated by American Freemasons. ""How?"" You must be wondering. Well, by stealing the Declaration of Independence which is concealing an invisible coded map leading to the forgotten treasure. But he is not alone in his quest. A rival also seeks ""the secret"" that ""lies with Charlotte"". And so begins the race against time, with two opponents attempting to outwit each other by solving each clue before the other.<br/><br/>The iridescent beauty of adventurous mysteries is the sheer velocity to which the narrative pace flows, an aspect Turteltaub clearly succeeded in implementing. The repetitious nature of its structure, which sees characters search for clues until their destination is reached, instantly maintains a light buoyancy throughout. Gates and his two protégés never spend more than twenty minutes on each clue, before either being interrupted or rapidly solving it. This therefore results in no stagnation, crucial for family-friendly flicks that Disney infamously produce. Whilst the overall theme of the plot is underdeveloped (Freemasonry is an absurdly heavy subject to tackle), it does not require prior knowledge to fully comprehend each clue. The screenplay explains each cryptic puzzle with humour, thanks to the character of Riley, and an urgent sense of mystery (especially the Ottendorf cipher). It organically captivates.<br/><br/>Cage, Kruger and Bartha worked well together and provided natural chemistry, even if the romance was somewhat forced and embryonic. Two adjectives I cannot utilise to describe the production design however, which was absolutely incredible. Showcasing US history through the locales of the National Archives, Independence Hall and Trinity Church's catacombs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, suspension of disbelief is required to fully enjoy National Treasure. The sheer amount of implausibilities within its plot does plague the legitimacy of the mystery. The Declaration of Independence surely has to be one of the most guarded artefacts in America, right? Cage comes along and steals it within twenty minutes. The likelihood of a tall building being erected in between the Sun and Independence Hall? High. Meaning Gates would not have found that brick. Then there are the plot conveniences, such as a bus providing insight for Riley to finish his riddle just before the antagonistic Sean Bean finds him, that induce several eye-rolling moments. Speaking of beans, Sean's luscious locks in this were distracting. Really distracting. And Voight's as well!<br/><br/>Alas, National Treasure knows what it is. A straightforward yet fun family adventure, with hints of historic mystery to fascinate audiences. Highly improbable? Absolutely. Does it hinder the overall enjoyment? Well, that's for you to decide. Personally, it's a hidden gem that the Freemasons forgot to bury."

"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","4 July 2017"," Despite some flaws, this movie is worth hunting for. What a treasure!
","With 4th of July celebrations, just around the corner, as of this writing. I thought, that this would be, the best time, to dig deep into, one of my favorite films, to watch on Independence Day; ""National Treasure'. Directed by Jon Turteltaub & Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. This Disney movie tells the story of treasure hunter, Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) on his quest to find the hidden Templar treasure of American Freemason, whom he believe, hid cryptography clues on the back of the Declaration of Independence. To prove this conspiracy theory to be true, he must hatch a plan to steal the document, and pull off the heist of the century to find the treasure. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film can be best described as 2006's 'The Da Vinci Code', 2001's 'Ocean 11"" & 1981 ""Raiders of the Lost Ark', all roll over into one. While, the treasure hunting plot is bit ridiculousness in the reasons, why Gates must steal the document first, in order to protect it, from being stolen. I do have to say, the treasure hunt is still entertaining. This movie truly surprised me in how smart & fun, the problem-solving is, even in how much artistic liberties, it takes with real-life history like locations and historic people. I did not expect it, to be so good, seeing how the last family friendly treasure hunting movie, 2004's TV movie, 'The Librarian: Quest for the Spear', I saw before this, had a dumb down 'call of adventure'. Perhaps the most exciting thing about this movie is the idea that family films can be sophisticated, and still be appropriate for a general audience. This movie is prove that smart, live action, adventure PG films, are still possible. Still, it is necessary to suspend your disbelief, when it comes to idea of the young nation having a secret Templar treasure. The idea of the Founding Fathers hoarding money is truly unrealistic implausible, even for fantasy sakes; seeing how in real-life, the main masonic lodge was in Britain, and the young nation of USA was bankrupted, during the American Revolution and stay poverty-stricken, even long after it, due to trade restricted and war debts. Nevertheless, nobody should take this movie as a legit American History lecture. After all, it is an action adventure. However, the movie does fail in, delivered the action, in the adventure part. While, the treasure hunting and heist parts is fine and dandy, the action involving on foot and high speed car chases through the streets of Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, falls to be memorable. I hardly remember, any of it. While, those parts, wouldn't be, a 'National Treasure', the good production value and star power does work for the film. Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates, has the right amount of craziness and believability to make, the audience take his character, somewhat serious. The film could had, quickly fallen apart, if he over acted, a little bit more. Thank God, he took this role, very seriously. Nice to see him, take some control. This is pretty rare. Also, the chemistry between his character and sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Batha) was somewhat believable, as well. While, some of the jokes between them, fall flat, I really don't mind, hearing each other, argue, how crazy, their ideas, are. Even, the vocal fights with Jon Voight's character, Patrick Gages was fine for the most part. I just wish, Voight didn't chew up all the scenery, as much. That's Cage's job. Cages parrying with Diane Kruger's sexy-intellectual portrayal of Dr. Abigail Chase was also pretty good. However, I doubt, they would be, lovely dovely, so quick, after only a few days, together. Nevertheless, surprisingly, it was the villains that didn't stand out for me. I totally forgot that actor, Sean Bean was in his film as Ian Howe. Maybe, because it's one of the rare films, in which, the character that Bean plays, doesn't die. Fortunately, the cat-and-mouse game between Nicolas Cage and Sean Bean was not even close in suspense, as I couldn't buy into Howe catching up to Gates. In the end, Gates was just in, a league of his own. Nevertheless, while, the movie lacks suspense. The pacing does work, quickly. Even if, the flow seem a little too structure. Despite that, I do have to say, the music that goes with the film, by composer, Trevor Rabin was rather good. It really gets you, into the sense of looking for buried treasure. Overall: National Treasure is an exciting, engrossing adventure flick that needs to be watch. One worthy of watching on Independence Day!"

","It's a fun movie to watch with your family, and is also rather memorable, but isn't the best. It has an interesting take on American history, which may not be quite as appealing to some people, and it's likely that kids won't understand parts of it. While not historically accurate, it's easy to follow. Another issue with the movie would be how quickly the characters solve puzzles and find clues. Of course it's not a realistic movie, but really it should have taken them at least a few months to find the treasure, even a few years. As long as you don't take the movie very seriously, it's not bad and is a fun movie to watch with friends and family."

And yes, even Nicolas Cage, with his one and single facial expression, managed to impress in this 2004 adventure movie.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is about the Gates family who has been chasing after the fabled Knights Templar treasure for generations, but the entire scientific and historical society see the family as dreamers and don't take them too seriously. And when Benjamin Franklin Gates (played by Nicolas Cage) finds the first and all-important clue aboard a ship thought to be lost, then a wild adventure across America takes place. Gates is chasing one clue after another, while his former colleague Ian (played by Sean Bean) is hot on his tail.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining and does take the audience along on a wild ride in search for the clues that lead to the Knights Templar's fabled treasure. And director Jon Turteltaub managed to put it together quite nicely, and the end result is a very entertaining and fulfilling movie.<br/><br/>There was some nice names on the cast list, which includes Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, Sean Bean, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer.<br/><br/>The action scenes in the movie were nicely filmed and executed and it feels like the audience is right there alongside Gates as he chases after the treasure.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is actually one of the better and brighter moments in Nicolas Cage's track history of movie performances."
"byson5186","7","0","0","9 January 2016"," Fun, But Not Entirely Realistic
","Whenever I see this movie, it takes me back to the time this movie came out in late 2004. I seriously can't believe that was 11-years ago. This movie still works to watch today, and won't seem so old. They already came up with a National Treasure 2 and it sounds like a National Treasure 3 is in the works. Nicholas Cage doesn't seem like that big or favored of an actor anymore, and this movie seems like one of the most popular and memorable films he was in.<br/><br/>This movie might seem like a cool idea, as it's an action movie but it's an action movie in a different direction, dealing with history and the Founding Fathers. While watching it, we might ask ourselves if there really is a hidden National Treasure, and if there really are clues like depicted in the movie? The movie will make the treasure and clues come to life, even though there probably isn't anything like it in either the first or second movie, and it just is a plot for entertaining purposes. <br/><br/>Though while this movie might be a fun one to watch, complaints I see from this movie are its predictability and improbability. Watching this movie, while a lot of movies don't seem like they'd happen in real life, but might still seem realistic, for some reason this movie doesn't seem realistic. The action in the movie which makes this movie an entertaining action movie seems like action we've already seen before which I noticed while watching this the first time. You might be able to predict the plot. The enemies in these movies also don't seem realistic. We can wonder if this movie really is an educational movie, or if it's mostly giving fictional story lines from the Founding Fathers and taking us to various interesting landmarks.<br/><br/>Another complaint I'd have about the movie which you might have too, is the characters. I mean if there's a National Treasure movie, we'd want these same characters to be in it. But, I feel like we don't get to know the characters well outside of their interest in history and the Founding Fathers, alongside with their main objective finding the treasure. It also goes that way with the love interest with the couples in this movie. I mean the movie didn't really show chemistry between those two, only added it because they were characters in the plot.<br/><br/>Some years later, Nicholas Cage would be in another movie with a plot somewhat similar, but not about the Finding Fathers called Knowing. His interest in that movie is determinism, and he also has we can say a piece of paper from that movie that also leads to cracking out codes with big meanings. I feel like Knowing seems like a more realistic film than National Treasure and has a deeper mood. I actually prefer Knowing over National Treasure.<br/><br/>The technology and gadgets in this movie are also cool. It reminds me of the technology from my favorite movie an Independent Canadian Film called Junior High Spy. While Junior High Spy had bad acting, I feel like that movie seems more realistic, and it has a more sneaky mood. My favorite movie scene, is a scene from that movie which is a simple scene where Ricky Lazio wanders around the mansion property with that sneaky music playing. It just adds a real mood to it, which I feel like we don't see in National Treasure.<br/><br/>The clues in this movie remind me of recent movies like Earth To Echo, and Paper Towns. Two movies I consider underrated. I feel like those movies seem more realistic.<br/><br/>So, in all this movie is an entertainer and fun movie to watch. But, it probably won't seem so realistic, especially the chemistry between the couple. I give this movie an 7/10. Sorry for mostly talking about the cons, but they're things that just stand out to me."

These flashbacks aren't just two weirdos in Halloweens costumes running around in a smog-ridden set piece.<br/><br/>Oh, right, the actual movie. Nicolas Cage makes good use of his smoky voice to convincingly portray the treasure hunter working his way through a series of complicated clues & Tommy Lee Jones is lovable as always in a slightly less hard-edged portrayal of his Sam Gerard signature role (The Fugitive, US Marshalls), but that about does it for memorable performances. The Fraulein & the computer nerd were sometimes funny, but still.<br/><br/>The story itself ...I don't know, really. It takes some inspiration to set it up but whether it's believable & executable outside the Hollywood universe... ,I don't know. I just went with the ride & hugged a faraoic statue. This movie's infamous boredom does show after the examination of the Declaration of Independence takes place (I bet its theft inspires the comparisons with Ocean's Eleven, sigh) but the pace picks up slightly once we get to the staircase.<br/><br/>Clearly this movie is worth a watch with a good drink, but nothing memorable...what I recall wouldn't even fit my Gogd-Bad-Ugly frame."

I used to have no problem with Disney, but their past efforts have been rather lame. When it was first released, people in my school were saying how good it was. I decided to go see it. When I saw it, I was amazed at how good it was. In some ways it's like The Da Vinci Code. There are plenty of historical messages on everyday items that we use. The cast is excellent. The stars include Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, and Jon Voit. The cast really helps the movie move along. For all of you teens out there who think this will be lame because it's only rated PG and is made by Disney, it isn't that way at all. It is family friendly, but there is enough action to make it seem like a PG-13 movie. This is also similar to Indiana Jones with the narrow escapes and car chases. Jerry Bruckheimer proves that even after some bad movies he has done, he can still do good movies like he once did. National Treasure is a solid effort and is definitely worth seeing."

","This film works. It's a fun action adventure/thriller/mystery with a dash of fascinating American history.<br/><br/>I loved the movie yet agree that neither hero nor villain had very much characterization. The real ""characters"" were Jon Voight as Cage's dad and Riley as the sidekick.<br/><br/>Both of them worked very well to provide emotional balance. As did one of the villain's sidekicks who exclaimed, after watching Cage kiss the babe while in dire danger : ""Why doesn't that ever happen to me?"" Made the evil guys seem more real too.<br/><br/>Also, both Cage and Sean Bean are so good to watch that we somehow believed they had character even tho the script didn't include much. I felt Ben was never in any real danger. There was no real or else factor or any type of consequence if he Didn't find the treasure. Sure he would've proved his father right, been a miserable disappointment, but thats not really strong enough of a consequence, and going to prison was just silly.<br/><br/>I compare this to Goonies because that film is also a treasure hunt and has a better emotional consequence I think. The kids set out to find the pirate ship treasure, if they fail the consequence is that their parents will loose their houses to some corporate monster, thus shattering the kids childhoods.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and while I enjoyed it, I felt easy : They plan and execute a robbery that should be difficult, but they pull it off in two days? Not enough conflict or risk in the heist (understandable, they didn't have scads of time, but... eh...) The ticking clock was there, but the stakes didn't seem very high, even when they were - I never believed the danger. I couldn't get wrapped up in it (part of it, I'm sure, was two teenage idiots behind me talking through the whole thing, just begging for someone to say something so they could blow up on that person).<br/><br/>Finally, with all the dust and spider webs down there, when the flame raced through the channels, I expected an explosion and a mess of melted gold, or at least charred documents from Alexander's library.....<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","This is a good film to kill a few hours during the holiday season. It grips you from the start with interesting and likable characters (even the villain wasn't too bad) and a fast paced story-line that is a type of treaure hunt (a la Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci Code) where clues are followed to get from one place to the next. If you can overlook the obvious flaws (such as walking 7 miles in the Arctic circle with no problem and guards at National monuments that never seem to be around) then you will love this film.<br/><br/>I am not normally a Nicolas Cage fan but he is excellent in this one and Jon Voigt gives a performance as Cage's father reminiscent of Sean Connery in the Indiana Jones movies."

","""National Treasure"" was a film that I never got around to see when it was first released in theaters back on November 19, 2004 however it actually hung around for quite a long time and I was actually still able to see it tonight January 24, 2005 at the local multiplex. This is one of those movies like ""Saw"", which I watched last night for the first time that I could really kick myself for not running out and seeing. So continue reading to find out more about my opinion of ""National Treasure"".<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is a movie about a man named Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) who comes from a family of treasure seekers that have been hunting for most of their lives to find this hidden treasure. Ben finds leads to the treasure that no one else has or can figure out but this is when the trouble starts because the group of treasure seekers he's with try to kill him. It then turns to a battle of who's smarter and who can find their way to the treasure first, Ben, Riley (Justin Bartha), and Abigail (Diane Kruger) or the other team who backstabbed Ben. Lots of action and interesting questions ensue ""National Treasure"" stars Nicolas Cage. Nicolas Cage has two types of roles in his career award winning roles like ""Adaptation"" and ""Matchstick Men"" or action style roles like in ""The Rock"", ""Con-Air"", ""Face-off"", and this film ""National Treasure"", both of which he is terrific at. His performance in this film was fun, energetic, and smart. Nicolas Cage played the role very nicely. Also in the film is Cage's co-star Diana Kruger (Abigail) who was pretty much the only female in the entire movie and was the perfect match for Cage's character Ben as the smart and knowledgeable love interest (which I say very lightly because this story did not feature a love story. Thank God!). Also Justin Bartha (Riley) was the perfect sidekick who brought some chuckles into the story. Sean Bean played the bad guy Ian Howe and was very good at playing the bad guy role because I didn't like him from the moment he first came on the screen. Harvey Keitel was also involved as Police Detective Sadusky who was on the case and he played the cop role just fine but normally that's all we ever see Harvey in so I guess it's good he sticks to a role that he can play well. And finally Jon Voight also stars as Patrick Gates, Ben's father. He plays the concerning father role very well and I enjoyed seeing Mr. Voight in the film.<br/><br/>Four writers wrote this film, which normally scares me because most films that have more then two writers usually suck but I guess this one proves me wrong. Without going into details about their less than average careers so far, writers Oren Aviv, Charles Segars, Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley, and Jim Kouf all had writing credits for this film. What I liked about the movie most was its script. I liked how the movie was rated PG and was still good for both adults and children a like. This movie has been compared to ""Indiana Jones"" in the sense of the story. I would have to agree to some extent. It was nice to know someone could throw together a screenplay, which was pretty intelligent but still managed to have lots of action and a few laughs. It was a breath of fresh air seeing a family film, which wasn't animated that we could all enjoy. All meaning adults and children a like. It was like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Back to the Future"" in that sense. A film that didn't contain any sexual content, cursing, or any disturbing violence but still managed to make the audience stay glued to their seats and munch on their big bag of popcorn. I would also like to point out that the love story between Ben and Abigail was never developed which I really must say was a terrific move because it was like you knew they liked each other from the moment they first met each other but they didn't elaborate on it which was very nice to see.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" was directed by Jon Turtletaub who like the writers on this film has a less than average directing career, with movies on his resume including ""The Kid"", ""While You Were Sleeping"", and ""3 Ninjas"" which to me were all very lame. However he really out did himself with ""National Treasure"" because I must admit I was impressed with his directing on this film and his choice of locations and sets. It had a very ""Indiana Jones"" feel to it. Some shots where excellently shot like the scene underneath the church. I know the critics gave ""National Treasure"" average reviews Mr. Turtletaub but the American audience loved it. Keep the classic 80's adventure films alive and make more films like ""National Treasure"" So In Conclusion, I can't say anything really bad about ""National Treasure."" It was the perfect Popcorn movie, which was both good for adults and children. It had a good story and good characters. The film's acting or story doesn't feature anything that the Academy will be looking for that's why we have movies like ""Sideways"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". We have movies like ""National Treasure"" so we can sit back, relax, and have a good time. My advice is to just buy the biggest popcorn at the theater and sit back and enjoy the ride that's all I can say about this one. Enjoy it! MovieManMenzel's rating for ""National Treasure"" is an 8/10."

","The whole family went to see ""National Treasure"" last night -- mom and dad in early 40s, 14-year-old son, 10-year-old son. Everyone enjoyed it thoroughly -- even the younger one, who may well have missed some of the significant clues, and Dad, who thought he was just being nice to the kids. Muddled up history, improbable plot twists, cartoonish good guys and bad guys -- and still good, fast-moving fun that inspired lots of discussion in the car on the way home. It isn't great art and it is never going to be a classic, but it's much more fun than the critics gave it credit for. We might even buy the DVD for the boys when that comes out."

","First, I'd like to say that it is a very entertaining movie. Watch it! Like I read on one of the comments, I felt it was just like Dan Brown stuff. Too much like 'Da Vinci Code'. Instead of PS, you have Masons here. Instead of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Newton, you have Sir Washington, Benjamin Franklin here. Initially (for first two minutes) I actually thought it was the movie based on Da Vinci code.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is cool in the movie. No antics like Face Off here. Just normal cool dude. The character Riley was funny and endearing. Diane Kruger was also good looking in the movie.<br/><br/>One way to describe the story is - Trasure Hunt. I could never guess where they got all the money for the hunt.<br/><br/>The ending was fine. Seen lot of movies where there are no treasures in the end or Treasure is destroyed in the end (McKenna's Gold, Congo and many more). A red Ferrari is always a good ending. (Just a digression: did any one read 'The Monk who sold his Ferrari'?) Nice movie, but you'll never buy its DVD :-) <br/><br/>SVIyer"
"Thyme176","7","0","0","21 January 2005"," Decent film, bad lead actor
","I liked this film well enough. Sure, it's no masterpiece, but I doubt that's what the film makers wanted anyway. I have heard some people call it a Da Vinci code rip-off, but I disagree. It's more like an Indiana Jones film, but sadly enough without the sense of humour. Which brings us to the choice of lead actor. Yes, I know that Harrison Ford has gotten older, but 20 years ago he would have been the perfect choice for this film. I have nothing against Nicholas Cage, but in this particular role he's just not right. Back to the sense of humour, or lack thereof. I feel that a lighter approach to the subject would have been beneficial for this film. (Once again, think Indiana Jones...) There are some funny moments though, especially where the character Riley is involved. I had never heard of Justin Bartha before, but he, as opposed to Cage, is perfect for his role. I think this film works well enough as a couple of hours of entertainment, but it could have been even better. It's a good story, but it isn't perfectly told. I give it a 7/10. One last thing however - maybe it's because I'm not American, but I think there was waaaaaay too much patriotic blah blah."

The reviews were not good, I'm not a big Nicholas Cage fan, and the trailers were not great, but we went to the movie anyways, not expecting much. By the end of the movie we were both surprised to find that we had been very nicely entertained. There are a number of plot twists, some amusing dialogue, and unlike Indiana Jones, few snakes or bugs. :-) I enjoyed the clues, and while I didn't understand all of the historical references, I think that is the point - most people would NOT be able to figure out the clues - that is why the treasure is still hidden! Yes, as in MOST movies, a willing suspension of disbelief is required. This is NOT a documentary, so don't expect it to be realistic -- it's a MOVIE!!

I liked all there casting choices, Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha I was also surprised to see Sean Bean and Jon Voight. The plot is very simple but with a lot of complex turns, but at the same time is some how easy to fallow. Ben Gates is searching for a treasure left by his ancestors, the founding fathers. They (the founding fathers) did a good job in hiding this treasure so it's not an easy job for Ben. Making it even harder is Ian Howe a treasure hunter as well; who also has his heart set on the treasure. A pretty excellent movie 8/10.

","i've expected this movie to be some Cage classic, but after i watched it, i found that i was thinking wrong. Cause, the whole story is just another da vinci code. Cage becomes Langdon, and Abigail Chase is Cage's Sophie. Set aside the character, the puzzle solving process is quite a clone of the da vinci code. So, here came the National treasure, what should we expect from the real Da vinci code the movie. Despite of the plot, i thought the Cage once again gave a fabulous performance, and other actors or actresses did a quite good job too, so, if you haven't read the Da vinci code, it's a fascinating movie for you(cause Da vinci code is a fascinating book), and if you have read the book, then go and see Langdon and Sophie in action."

","This film is entertaining and fun to see, but the idea is far from original. Indiana Jones hunted for treasures in temples and caves, this one goes for treasure hidden in American Buildings. Acting is so-so.<br/><br/>But my main complaint is that I feel that the pace in the film is wrong. When they discover the boat, they find the pipe with a riddle. They solve the riddle in 5 seconds. I clearly feel that they wanted to do something dramatic with the location (his colleague becomes his enemy, they decide to steal the declaration of independence, the boat explodes). This part is really rushed and not convincing.<br/><br/>Second part of the film: stealing the declaration of independence. Mission Impossible style stealing the important document. The rhythm is good, and the best part of the film. Good suspense, good dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Third part: solving the riddles: acceptable, fun to see. History and fiction get mixed. But they are all solved way to easily. Those guys must be extremely intelligent... Acting, environment, violence, is feeling very natural.<br/><br/>Last part: finding the treasure: This part is really rushed. They wanted to end the film and it really feels like this. This part is only broken by a very dark, dramatic scene when the staircase falls in. The enemy is mislead way too easily the treasure finally found. This is really the worst part of the film. I also find the location off the treasure very unacceptable..."
"krazykidz","8","0","0","15 January 2005"," National Treasure
","This film, in my opinion, is a mixture of many different but oddly related things. Tomb Raidor, Indiana Jones, The Da Vinci Code, Ocean's Eleven... you could go on forever. It's got the adventure of Indiana Jones, the over-exaggerations of Tomb Raidor, the riddles and cryptology of The Da Vinci Code and the criminal techniques of Ocean's Eleven. In my opinion, a rather odd combination of elements provides the viewer with an adventure, offering suspense, adrenaline, awesome scenes, gone-back-in-time-feeling and obviously, the romantic part has its say inevitably! Although the story is quite exciting and attention-grabbing, it is really quite predictable and the characters are stereotypes. There's the do-all-good hero/victim, the beautiful woman he has, at first managed to make her loathe him and then, after wowed her with his noble act, the funny adorable friend, the unapproving affectionate father and of course the bad guy, who is as usual filthy rich and reckless in what he does to win the fast-pacing race. In spite of these stereotypes, it is a rather enjoyable film. I would say that it is a film in which you need not think very much but sit back and relax while the story moves on. The ending is predictable, but rather amusing. Although it's nothing new, it's a fun film, which riddle-loving, adventurous person would love."

","Jerry Bruckheimer. The undisputed king of the lavish Hollywood explosion. Chances are, if you find yourself sitting in a darkened room with a stupid smile on your face, having spent the last two hours watching things being blown up, your'e watching a Bruckheimer film ( or in jail. ) With National Treasure, I got the distinct feeling there was a concerted effort to mess with the formula. There are still explosive action scenes, pulsating chase sequences, and there is still a British bad guy, but there is also a semblance of a plot, and of due care taken in validating the historical aspects of the story. It is of course, mainly fantastical hokum, but crucially it never becomes farcical. This is down due to the actors investing a good deal of conviction into screenplay that lesser performers would have exposed as the creaky, unfocused mêlée of slapped together genre staples and cliché it is. Nicolas Cage for example, has proved himself as both a highly talented actor and a capable action hero, and is therefore well suited for this Indiana Jones meets Adam Hart-Davies role. While it seems that both the girl ( Diane Kruger ) and the techno-geek sidekick ( ? ) are both conjured directly from the stereotype store, there is guilty glee to be had in watching Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel slumming it so magnificently. Sean Bean is given far too little to do, and is in danger of reverting to the stock British villain that he spent his career playing until Boromir saved him. Ultimately, it's a formula action picture that tries bravely to restructure the formula and inject a little intelligence into the vein of mainstream cinema. The fact that it ultimately fails due to a weak script and a poor climax is a shame, and hopefully will not deter film-makers from attempting the same in the future."

","""National Treasure"" is like one of those Saturday matinees of my youth, involved enough to keep one interested, but with a plot too fragile to endure much analysis. In that measure, it is worth a jaunt to the theater (though maybe not more than the matinée discounted price). But since I'm unable to allow plot holes to go unchallenged, here goes: 1. Knowing they need Gates alive and healthy for them to have any chance of deciphering all the clues, why were the bad guys continually trying to kill him? 2. After the document heist, several gunshots and a car chase that involved dozens of vehicles and pedestrians, how is it that the bad guys were never caught? 3. How could the villain possibly expect Gates and the others to be at a certain location in Philadelphia to intercept them, even though they weren't aware a clue led them there? And why did a young boy attract so much suspicion that they followed him outside to interview him? 4. And last but not least, why would an aging widower living alone happen to have a basket full of fresh lemons in his house? OK, I'm done.

","I can't remember the last time I saw such a squeaky clean Hollywood flick. Sex in NT is reduced to two kisses, neither very passionate, and a mild innuendo at the very end. For violence, the only gore is the blood drawn by the hero from his own thumb, to be used as ink to print a clue. As to obscenity.what obscenity?<br/><br/>The treasure hunt is more of a mental than a physical challenge. On the other hand, don't expect a proliferation of elaborated clues such as those in Da Vinci Code, and there are some running and chasing, not to mention shooting (although you know darn well that the good guys are not going to be hit). Along with some funny lines well spaced throughout, the movie comes across like an airy fairy tale. Forgettable, but enjoyable while you're at it.<br/><br/>Not much complaint about the cast  who THEY ARE, more than what they actually do in the movie. As a matter of fact, not much complaint about what they do in the movie either, because they aren't required to do very much in the first place! Anyway, we have Nick Cage, who can act in a film that requires acting and look lovable in a movie that requires him to look lovable (such as this one), Diane Kruger who has got to have some looks if she could play ""the face that launched a thousand ships"", Sean Bean who has been nothing short of magnificent as Boromir, Jon Voight who really needs no introduction, Harvey Keitel the excellent character actor and also Tarantino's favorite, and even a cameo from Christopher Plummer who is synonymous with Captain von Trapp.<br/><br/>So much about National Treasure itself. Ron Howard (director) and Tom Hanks (hero) of Da Vinci Code should be watching this one closely, on how successfully or otherwise it has presented the series of clues in the movie. Compared with Da Vinci Code, the clues here are kid stuff and not difficult to make visually interesting. The insanely large number of maddeningly literary clues in Da Vinci Code, on the other hand, could drive an audience mad, if not handled carefully."

","Fun and fast paced adventure that lets you, the viewer, figure out the riddles.<br/><br/>I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie. There did not appear to be a second of wasted film, nor did it leave you with the feeling that half the movie (the good half, even) was left on the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Honestly, Nicholas Cage has never been a favorite of mine. His movies were always good, but the content he chooses tends to bounce between comedy and dark drama. I do not like him as a comedic actor, and I am not into any kind of drama. I prefer horror itself over the imitation that is dark drama; good comedy, adventure, or action. In this attempt, he delivers a quick and quirky sense of humor which he uses to great effect in this role as a hereditary ""treasure-protector."" <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>This vehicle begins in ancient Egypt (briefly), then quickly whisks you forward to the American Revolution (again touching briefly) before bringing you to Cage's character's childhood where he first hears the family legend. <br/><br/>We are transported once more to the here and now to find Cage's character Gates following the clues, solving the riddles, and utilizing that superior intellect. But there is treachery afoot, and Gates's partner decides he could do better on his own. The only problem with that is that the partner is the one with the money, and Gates has all the answers. <br/><br/>This premise is based heavily on the mythology of the Freemasons and the Knights Templar. In ancient times, the Knights Templar grew so wealthy that the Catholic church became fearful of being usurped as the heaviest influence over the principal lawmakers and ordered the Templar's wealth to be distributed (of course, the Roman Catholic church took a goodly sum, themselves, to administer this distribution) among other such organizations.<br/><br/>In modern times, the Knights Templar sit at the top of the Freemason ladder. They are the sole members who are aware of the underlying agendas of the Masons. <br/><br/>This work touches on this knowledge but throws a seriously pro-Mason slant on the entire work. Politically speaking, this movie was more a 100-minute political plug for anyone who is in the Skull and Bones Society than it was a movie for simple entertainment. <br/><br/>That having been said, however, this was a very fun movie. Not only was it fun, it was fast and it was VERY funny. We thoroughly enjoyed our viewing of this work. Everyone in the theater was having a blast. Here in Redneck/hillbilly Eastern Tennessee, there is not a lot of laughing or booing going on in the small home town theater. Everyone is too uptight to just relax and enjoy themselves here, for some reason. We do not have that problem, being transplants rather than ""locals,"" but of course that means we have to endure the strange stares which subsequently come when Phreaks venture out into the ""str8"" world during the daylight hours.<br/><br/>Now, it is a given that this is no Indiana Jones contender, and there were not even half the elaborate sets featured in the Laura Croft movies. But as is the way of good old-fashioned mysteries, this was great fun to puzzle out. Except for that first riddle, we stayed about 30 seconds ahead of Gates in solving everything else.<br/><br/>This was, as I said, fun, fast, witty, and extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>It rates a 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

After all, recent Disney attempts at live action (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean, Hidalgo, Freaky Friday) I've generally enjoyed quite a bit, King Arthur being the exception. But after I saw it, I have to say that it's joined KA. It's generally entertaining and the acting is sound, but the characters are wooden and I didn't like the fact that the main characters were every bit of thieves and liars as Sean Bean and his crew. So, I was disappointed this this film. The special effects aren't even that good. Do yourself a favor and don't shell out 7 bucks for it, just wait till it comes out on DVD if you still want to see it."

"Okonh0wp","8","0","0","20 December 2004"," a new kind of film
","National Treasure gives a new meaning to the phrase ""living history"", and it really is something thoroughly amazing for a work of historical fiction. It is entwined in a gripping mystery which uses as reference points, things you can find in your pocket, like a dollar bill, places you've probably been to like the national archives, the mall in D.C. etc, making for a truly interactive experience.<br/><br/>Complaints about lack of character depth in National Treasure should be made keeping in mind the context in which Bruckenheimer (did i spell that right?) made the film. If you're Jerry Bruckheimer, you went from being a very hot commodity after making a $285 million-grossing film, Pirates of the Caribbean, to making King Arthur, a flop, and you want to preserve your reputation as a commercial success. Therefore, you're #1 goal is to get people into the theater and what's gonna get them there is the plot. The movie is all plot-centered and even though Nicholas Cage might have won an Oscar way back when the truth is that most of his movies ""gone in 60 seconds"", ""snake eyes"", ""8 mm"", etc, are not films you go to expecting character development.<br/><br/>I don't think they were aiming for character depth: No one was going into this film thinking they'd snag an Oscar or golden globe nomination, Not that you shouldn't want to have a challenging part to want to act in, but I was pretty fine with the limit on character development because the plot was cool enough. The one thing I can say was, at the very least the characters were self-conscious, for example, the Abby Chase/Ben Gates hook up we could all see coming from miles away, but evidently so could the screenwriter so he gave Ian the line ""well, you got the girl at the end"" cause it's so blatantly obvious.<br/><br/>Also, the plot is absurd in itself, stealing the declaration of independence? And it's actually quite a wonder in itself that the movie presented a historically accurate, seemingly plausible and thoroughly engaging plot out of the circumstances that in no way dumbs down to the audience. Making the plot work in itself, deserves credit.<br/><br/>The film played to its strengths well."

If you already read the Da Vinci Code and watch this movie you'll have a sense strong of familiarity. Good prequel for The DA Vinci Code. I wonder whether the Dan Brown's Mickey Mouse Watch Trademark was related to this Disney's movie, some kind of nice trade between them. The cast is okay, although I think someone else is more suitable to be Ben rather than Nicolas Cage. Like other Disney's, no sex available, but surely it has a unnecessary kissing scene.

","I give this 6 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>It was good movie. I have to admit, I thought the premise was stupid but I was wrong. <br/><br/>The story is about the Founding Fathers of America and their ties with a secretive society called Freemasons which is somehow tied with the Knights of Templar of Medieval Europe. It seems that riches beyond belief was hoarded by these people throughout the ages and one of the keys to this treasure lies with the document, Declaration of Independence.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Cage but he did a good job in this movie. He plays the smart but obsessed person named Mr. Gates, who is on a mission to find the mother-of-all treasures. In his way is a dangerous man who once funded the endeavors of Mr. Gates, but are now rivals in this dangerous pursuit.<br/><br/>I like the whole conspiracy and the tie in with the Knights of Templars.

"chanvat","8","0","0","11 December 2004"," Edge-of-the-seat thriller that beats the pants off ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""
","If you see this one, be sure to stock up on snacks and visit the restroom BEFORE you enter the theater. For you won't be able to leave your seat once this fabulous thriller starts. The plot concerns an historian/engineer/Navy diver's (Nicholas Gage) obsession with finding a treasure supposedly hidden by the Founding Fathers during or shortly after the Revolution. The treasure had its roots in ancient times, having been protected first by the Knights Templar (of the Crusades), then by the Freemasons (a secret society whose members included Washington, Franklin, and others). Through luck and brilliant deduction, Gage learns that the back side of the original of the Declaration of Independence contains key clues to the treasure's location. Aided by a Natural Archives archivist (Diane Kruger) and his comic foil sidekick (Justin Bartha), Gage travels from D.C. to Philadelphia to New York in pursuit of the treasure. Problem is, they're pursued themselves, by a gang of treasure hunters who would stop at nothing (including murder) to get their hands on this multi-billion dollar find.<br/><br/>OK, that's the plot in a nutshell. On the plus side, the film features many superb special effects (e.g., the explosion of the Arctic ship) and breakneck pacing. While prevalent, the violence is not gratuitous or graphic. And except for a brother-sister smooch or two between Gage and Kruger, the sex is non-existent.<br/><br/>On the minus side, the writers should have done a little better job at their historical research. For example, early in the film we learn that the first clue in the treasure hunt was provided by Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, whom (we are told) was a Freemason. That's an impossibility, as Carroll, a devout Roman Catholic, was prohibited from joining the Masons under penalty of excommunication! But such ""peccadilloes"" do little to dull the brilliance of this rousing mystery-thriller, against which ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""The Temple of Doom,"" etc., can't hold a torch."

","In the John Sayles book ""Thinking in Pictures, the Making of Matewan"" he has a segment when he's talking about the executives at the studios being afraid of long periods of no dialog, he then uses an example. ""The Indians are waiting in an open plane, cut to a close up of the Indians brandishing there spears and lances, cut to the buffalo thundering towards them, cut back to the Indians. 'At this point somebody will inevitably say can't one of the indians say here come the buffalo? 'Good observation yellow deer your really on you toes today.""<br/><br/>That was my main problem with this film, there were too many ""here come the buffalo's"" people just saying obvious thing after obvious thing. It was filled up with dialouge that you didn't need, I don't know maybe they feel that they need to spoon feed us everything so that we'll understand stuff that is right in front of us.<br/><br/>This film did have it entertaining elements although there were too many moments that we have seen in every other movie in the genre. And I still find it baffling that they could figure out all these clues that were supposed to have eluded people for hundreds of years by guessing and taking stabs in the dark.<br/><br/>Also, the whole idea that our founding father's had all of that treasure during the coarse of the revolutionary war and decided to hide it rather then try to use some of it to pay for the war and then hiding it.<br/><br/>And, of course two scientists and a woman that works for the national archives all of the sudden turn into stunt men when they need to.<br/><br/>Overall, not one of Jerry Brukheimer's better investment's.

","Nick Cage is back in this fast paced, glossy-actioned Bruckenheimer tale of mythical lost treasure and a centuries old freemason plan to hide it.. yet also leave clues for Nick and his family to track down. Sean Bean is the baddie as all hell breaks loose when Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) realises he has to steal the American Declaration of independence.<br/><br/>For some reason Cage has decided to do a PG movie that is really one for the whole family as opposed to some of the more cerebral (adaptation) stuff he's been doing lately. At least it's better than gone in 60 seconds. The basic plot is that for several generations, Ben Gates' family have been looking for a lost treasure in order to protect it. The treasure is an immeasurably valuable horde secreted away by the Freemasons in the 18th century to hide it from the British.<br/><br/>In the course of his search he has teamed up (for reasons unknown) with a wealthy treasure hunter in Ian Howe (Sean Bean). When clues lead them to the possibility that the map is behind the Declaration of Independence, Ian decides to steal it. Gates, been an all-American type tells him it's not on, so Ian goes ballistic. Literally.<br/><br/>Ben Gates fails miserably at warning the FBI and others about the plot so decides to do the only thing left to protect the treasure. Steal the declaration of independence himself. Getting roped in along the way is the obligatory cardboard cut-out an academic archives administrator - the gorgeous Diane Kruger and Gates dad, Jon Voight.<br/><br/>Bean is pretty good as the baddie but to be fair it's not the most challenging role he'll ever have. The main attraction of this movie is really the Indiane Kruger.. I mean Indiana Jones element involving old puzzles and secret caverns behind famous landmarks.<br/><br/>Of course this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film so it's all popcorn, fun and excitement. Don't expect subtext or high brow deep-thinking. It's a fun adventure and deserves to be treated as such. 3/5 and a thumbs up from IV."

This movie also a bit bias to the American view of history, but by living in Canada, I am used to it.<br/><br/>The movie borrows elements from Raiders of the Lost Ark, however it is more human oriented, and their is no diabolical plot, which is all too common in treasure movies of the last twenty years. The cast and crew was very well suited for the jobs they were assigned. I applaud the director and production team for their effort to display just how important history is.

","It's been a long time since we last saw a Bruckheimer-Cage vehicle, and this one is as enjoyable as their past collaborations.<br/><br/>For starters, it will appeal to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code fans, as the narrative is similar - myths and legends, symbols, Freemasons, Knights Templar, etc form the basis of the story. And instead of Robert Langdon, we have Cage's character solving riddles and clues that promisingly and hopefully would lead to treasure (The Sacred Feminine anyone?)<br/><br/>The first half of the movie dwells on the plot to steal the Declaration of Independence. Quite nicely done I must say, before launching into Dan Brown's style of cut action scenes, ""Chapter cliffhangers"", diving into explanations of clues left behind in the American greenback, the all seeing eye, the unfinished pyramid and the like.<br/><br/>Not as exotic a location setting as it's based in US cities (New York, Philadelphia, Boston got a mention, but hey, it's Hollywood!), as compared to Brown's Langdon novels set in Paris, England, The Vatican, Rome.<br/><br/>This should wet your appetite while waiting for Tom Hanks and perhaps Julie Delphy to emulate something similar.<br/><br/>Not to be missed by Cage fans, Dan Brown fans, and fans of the face that launched a thousand ships, Diane Kruger"

As he ran, dodged, and deduced his way through the plot, I found myself distracted by his flyaway hairpiece. Oh, and don't get me started on the eyebrow action.<br/><br/>While I think the premise of the plot - regarding the evolution of the Knights Templar into the Free Masons, and the possibility that Ben Franklin was a key player in manufacturing an intricate web of clues to an amazing treasure - was essentially fascinating, the cheese-factor unfortunately found its way in (thank you, Mr. Bruckheimer). The humor that did occur frequently in the dialogue couldn't make up for the incredibly unrealistic and over-the-top moment when Nick Cage pulls the oddly-beautiful archivist in for a smooch as they're descending into the earth with the evil doers all around them, and yet they have a moment for a stupid kiss to which she looks all goofy afterwards.<br/><br/>It was entertaining, but couldn't come close to Bruckheimer's last success of Pirates of the Caribbean.

","National Treasure seemed pretty good, but the minute I saw the preview, and later confirmed by watching the film, I felt the filmmakers rushed it into production to beat The DaVinci Code, which is coming in 2005. Two very similar plots. TDC, to be brief, is a best-selling novel from 2003 about a somewhat flustered art professor and a beautiful girl battling opposing forces. They each follow a set of intricate clues, starting with The Mona Lisa, to find the Holy Grail. It's a puzzle, just like National Treasure, filled with historical and religious references. Nevertheless, there have been more than one good movie about the Mafia, more than one good movie about serial killers, so perhaps it's just a coincidence but I doubt it."
"LeslieLLKing","Null","0","0","23 November 2004"," National Treasure - many of song has sung - themes on finding home.
","Some spoiler material. National Treasure is really a socially driven film, documenting Nic Cage's quest as Ben Franklin Gates, to reclaim the family name and declare independence, by tracking down the legacy of long lost treasure, associated with his family heritage, and with some of the proceeds, buys an estate of his own, in the company of a most lovely lady, Abigail Chase, (Diane Kruger). This film is really about Nic and not Ben, but I am o.k. with that, as long as I accept it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. The title National Treasure peaked my interest, since I wanted to know what Disney's interpretation as to what the National Treasure actually was. I was telling my pretend children that National Treasure is not gold or material possessions, but that National Treasure is your spirit and the love in your heart. I told them that each and every one of us make up the total of National Treasure. Nevertheless, I still wanted to see the movie, so on a Monday morning, after numerous transfers and holds, with Microsoft's Technical Support helpline, I was hoping that National Treasure would be just as productive as an afternoon, at a slow moving, but informative teacher/business seminar. Seminars are great for those people on the payroll who can spend the time with it. Likewise, I recommend this movie to only people who can and want to spend the time.<br/><br/>The film begins in Washington D.C., in 1974, with John Adam Gates(Christopher Plummer), as Ben's grandfather, telling little Ben (Hunter Gomez) about the family legacy, of hidden treasure that was smuggled from Europe to America. It was sacred to the Masons and Knights Templar. When you see the size of the alleged treasures, you think, who could have possibly stored them, where they were, without anyone getting word of it. That part is funny. But if we can continue on with the legend, a key element was that the treasure had to be protected from British invaders. But then I am thinking. Why just the British? Don't segment a possible threat. Protect the treasure from any and all possible dangers, one's that might be worse than just a British invasion.<br/><br/>Jerry Bruckheimer, as most known producer, can start checking off his list, 'created enough action, suspense, near death experience, including explosions, with A-list star, Nic Cage. High class, black tie social event  done. Retail shopping experience, with woman  completed.' All of Nic's action stuff, moves at a snappy, groovin' and cycloptic pace, with his goal of not only wanting to be the hero, but the realization that he is the hero, as he moves with stealth, to capture the physical treasure, to compliment, that which already resides in his heart. Ben's assistant Riley, (Justin Bartha) is an intellectual easy go with the flow admirer, to the action hero. Together, they approach Abigail Chase, a pretty, hold her own, seeming unattended to, maybe even a little dusty, Washington D.C. archivist.<br/><br/>Ben introduces himself to Abigail, as Paul Brown. He tells her that there is an invisible treasure map, on the back of the Declaration of Independence. She is in disbelief and he walks away deciding that he must steal the map, with Riley's help, in order to find the buried treasure, reclaiming the Gates family name and satisfying his curious needs.<br/><br/>Of course, one of Ben's partners, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) turns 'bad guy'on him, fighting to claim the treasure for himself. So the chase plays out between good guys, bad guys, and the damsel in distress, Abigail, who is tossed in the mix, for good measure and of course, romance. ' Check  romance completed, including, unexpected hero/heroine kiss.'<br/><br/>John Voight, as Patrick Gates, Ben's Dad, plays the treasure hunter retiree very well. As a widower, we only wish that he had a lady friend, as to not make him look so dour. Harvey Keital, (Sadusky) equally, does a nice job playing out the cop role, reminding Ben, a little too often that 'Someone has got to go to jail for stealing the Declaration of Independence.' Certainly not Ben/Nic, but Sadusky needles him, nevertheless.<br/><br/>I am actually disappointed that there actually is a tomb, 'Beneath Parksville Lane,' in Boston, what looks to be a collection of international proportion, of historical treasures from Rome to Egypt. It looks like Disney's old prop and stage storage closet. From the audience's view, it all appears a little too fake, corn ball, and odd ball. I was hoping for a more symbolic treasure, like that of Dan Brown's in, The Da Vinci Code. Maybe Ben, named himself Brown, after Dan, pretending to be his brother. I do not have the answers. I just like to make-up stuff. With some of the proceeds from the treasure sale, Ben buys his country estate for Abigail and him, and Riley, with the prospect of more action work in front of him, settles on the red sports car, what looks to be something like a Dodge viper. I think some of the bruised British egos would have laughed if the film shot Ben's and Abigail's country estate wedding. Then, the movie really would have come full circle and Jerry could have checked off his list, 'touch of British charm and modesty  completed.'<br/><br/>The clues for the treasure hunt are well established, like those I recall from my childhood Birthdays, and in the end, Ben, Riley, and Abigail are awarded prizes. Yeah! That is nice. Maybe the film should have been called Ben Gate's Birthday Party  everyone's invited, even the mean kids. As you can see, I have mixed emotions on the male driven process, to which Nic feels he has to or wants to act out, in order to achieve the underlying theme of love, peace, and capturing the girl's heart, or being captured in the heart, by the girl. Really, Disney could have saved loads of money by making a deal with HG t.v.  Hollywood Stars Go House Hunting. Nic could be the guest star and the show could insert clips of Valley Girl, probably my all-time favorite teen movie, (even then, I was more like the guy, punk guy that is, rather than the cream lacy bloused girl, who had totally cool parents, and was adored by the boys, including the lead star. I had the short hair cut, style, and family gone wrong. I guess that is why I identified with his awkwardness and out of place, as so charming.) and a few other retro-feel Cage films, to personalize the segment. The Star House Hunting program would be a less timely and a more accessible form of programming, for those people who do not have the time to do the seminar format, like myself. <br/><br/>At the film's conclusion, I was sentimentally sad, since Jerry seemed to be like an overworked Jewish man, turned Santa, checking off all the tasks to accomplish on his list. I guess that was the only way to ensure all presents were sent and received. Cormac and and Marianne Wibberley were like Santa's elves, assembling just the right Christmas gifts. Yeah! Maybe Jerry, crew and cast should read John Grisham's Skipping Christmas book. I have not read it, but I am sure that it must hold some relevancy to the feeling of Christmas burn-out. In my mind, I make up my own imaginary ending, with Jerry and cast, in front of the estate, waving and saying, 'Merry Christmas to All, and to all a good night,' with winks and sparkles in their eyes."

The real joys in this movie are the set design ***SPOILER WARNING*** such as the vault beneath the church where the treasure is kept, and the acting of Justin Bartha as Riley.<br/><br/>His one liners, especially when he says ""Why can't they just put ""Treasure located here, spend it wisely?"""" are a great counterpoint to the seriousness with which the other characters take this bizarre plot. My least favorite assertion by critics, though, is the idea that the whole plot HAD to be lifted from The DaVinci Code, as if Dan Brown invented A) riddles or B) wild goose chases with fabulous endings. Nevertheless, it's worth your money and time because it's a pretty good adventure flick with, surprisingly, no murders or sex involved (i.e. family friendly.)<br/><br/>Entertainment score: 7/10 Film score: 2/10 (one for the sets, one for Bartha)"

","*** SOME SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>This movie lacked the traditional Jerry Bruckheimer style. No 360degree camera pans, no explosions at every corner, and no crazy story that involved guns in everyone hands. The story develops quite well and if you pay attention, all the questions are answered. If you but some thought into it, it is a believable story. It almost makes you want to travel to Washington and try some of these clues. I liked the ending, a little too much CGI enhancements in the HUGE treasure room, but the Ferrari was very cool at the end with the added gear grinning really added that needed humor touch. I think the audience laughed in about 3 to 4 parts. Some humor. If you have a sense of adventure, this move is for you. Over all a good movie ***1/2 out of 5"

","Not really, just a little Monheitisme. Wow! This is a bad movie. Really quite stupid but for some reason I have to admit I'm not offended by it. By a movie which actually, truly, and literally desecrated the graves of my ancestors. By a movie which excreted a combination or urine and feces from its unholy cloaca onto my chosen profession (history). By a movie so obviously repeatedly and with malice aforethought script-doctored that it is forced into the corner of commenting on its own poor writing. This is a terrible and stupid movie. Yet somehow not as offensive as most Bruckheimer movies. If you like seeing Nicolas Cage, Christopher Plummer, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voigt, and some hot German chick disgrace themselves, well, this is the movie for you. Let me just say these two specific things, the freezing and thawing of the oceans would rip a ship apart in 200 hours nonetheless 200 years. Why the hell would the Masons try and hide treasure from the British? They're third only to the US and Switzerland in being Masonically entwined."

","This movie has an implausible premise.<br/><br/>That having been said, it's a lot of fun to watch. It is non-stop action as our heroes race against time and the bad guys to solve one riddle after another to find a fabulous treasure hidden somewhere in America by the founding fathers. The riddles are all related to the United States as it existed shortly after the Revolution. The following is a minor spoiler, but it is referred to in the trailer. Some of the clues are written on the back of The Declaration of Independence, so a big part of the plot is obtaining that document.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger work well together, and while the plot is not primarily about romance, their developing relationship is very believable.<br/><br/>If this appeals to you, go see it.

","It's safe to say that National Treasure is a box office success. It's not that hard to understand why. Here's the breakdown. You've got your...<br/><br/>Reckless yet calm guy driven by some lifelong pursuit (Cage), and his funny tech-guy groupie (Bartha.) Soon enough the lovely lady (Kruger) whom was introduced earlier unwillingly gets involved in reckless yet calm guy's lifelong pursuit.<br/><br/>But alas, reckless calm guy's enemy, the Machiavellian shyster (Bean) and his buddies with foreign accents are out to ruin reckless calm guy's day.<br/><br/>That pretty much sums up the base of National Treasure. Needless to say the casting and story were fairly well done, but you couldn't ask for something more typical when it comes to mildly-rated action films. It's a mix of James Bond, The Mummy, and The Italian Job. Nicolas Cage didn't bore me to death, I laughed a few times and there was the occasional biting of the lip. Nothing incredible, but surely a good time at the theater. 7/10."

","Ah, you always have a clearer picture once the movie has been viewed twice, and with National Treasure, there is no pain involved in going back to the theatre a second time. Despite a couple of minor gripes (which I shall attend to in a moment), I thought the movie was very good. The characters were fun (especially Riley, I've love him and I can't help it; I'm a sucker for the comic relief. And if that comic relief just happens to be proficient with computers, all the sweeter.) Nicolas Cage did quite a good job as Ben Gates, despite the silly name of his character. Kruger did a nice job as Abigail Chase (though did we really need to see so much of her breasts in the beginning? Yes, she has them, thank you for sharing), and I found myself rather liking Ian, the main baddie, despite, you know, his evil baddie-ness. I mean, he just wanted money. He is the heart and soul of capitalism. All hail!<br/><br/>The plot was fun and interesting, very action-adventure, complete with mandatory Blowing (Beep) Up scenes, which in this case was quite unfortunate, since I rather liked the thing that got blown up. Imagine what I could have done with that gun powder...My Grandpa, with whom I viewed this movie for the second time, said it had a strikingly similar plot to The DaVinci Code, a book he recently read. I haven't the foggiest if it was coincidence or piracy or what, but if the DaVinci Code is anything like National Treasure, I look forward to reading it.<br/><br/>Now, to the plot-holes. In my AP US History class we didn't cover the Freemasons, so I won't comment on whatever historical bloopers were made, but I shall endeavor to speak of the practical ones...like WHY THE BLEEDING (Beep!) WAS BEN GATES NOT WEARING GLOVES *IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE*? I mean, is this guy flirting with frostbite or what? And it can't be much warmer inside Charlotte than out, look at the snow. It was downright silly. My second and final annoyance was that Ben Gates figured out the clues with truly remarkable speed...But then, he's a very obsessed history major, so I suppose if anyone could figure out the clues with supernatural quickness, it would be him.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate it 9/10. A very fun movie, if you can turn a blind eye to a couple of goofs.<br/><br/>(I ((heart)) Riley!)"

","I went to this movie with fairly low expectations--I just didn't think the previews looked that great. And I was pleasantly surprised. The ""puzzles"" are not completely obvious, the pace is good, and the ending pays off nicely. <br/><br/>I got impatient once, at a car chase (but I admit to a very low tolerance for car chase scenes). <br/><br/>While the dialogue is ""clean,"" it's ""clean"" in the same way an ""R"" movie is clean when it's overdubbed to air on network TV--they ""swear"" but they say ""Holy Lord"" or things of that nature, so I thought that made the dialogue seem awkward at times.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about ""mysterious"" Freemasons, enjoy the mysterious references to the mysterious order. If you do know a bit, try to forget that you know it's basically just one of those last-bastion boy's clubs in the 21st century. That's the only part I found a bit hard to swallow, the dead-earnest seriousness of Nick Cage as he describes how a bunch of Shriners hid a fortune in gold under their mini-motorbike seats or whatever. Hey, Nicholas Cage sure owes a lot to them there Freemasons--didn't the Masons get Peggy Sue back into the future for him in ""Peggy Sue Got Married""?<br/><br/>Other than that, it is a very fun movie; don't expect any uniquely amazing cinema and you will be surprised at how much you enjoy it!"

","I saw the film after reading the negative reviews of people that are obviously more grouchy and pessimistic than myself. I liked it. Now I don't think being grouchy and pessimistic is necessarily bad.<br/><br/>The film doesn't explore any deep moral questions; you know who are the good guys and who the bad guys are right off, and stealing the Declaration of Independence is OK if you're doing it for good reason :)<br/><br/>What the film does do is impart mysticism on our country's history and makes you take new interest in it. The film is action packed and doesn't really get boring. And I was giggling intermittently at the 'Bad' jokes!<br/><br/>Yep, it's not exactly believable, but then we'd end up with films about our daily lives; Some overweight jerk going to work and gossiping about his coworkers for eight hours before driving home in his pedestrian SUV to a thoroughly pedestrian homelife, only to finally die after re-telling Al Bundy like stories about his exploits on the High School football team at some puke suburbanite chain bar-restaurant.

","National Treasure could have been a quasi-Indiana Jones film, but the story had more holes than a prairie dog metropolis, the dialog was lame, the acting was wooden (n-1 dimensional), and basically the flaws could only be compensated by lots of noise and plenty of boinks. This film reminds me a little of Disney's ""Black Hole"". Great concept, horrific execution. Where is the production supervision? How can a Jerry Buckheimer film get re-edited down to 100 minutes and come out so vanilla? If you're wondering why it finished ahead of Sponge Bob Square Pants I can think of two reasons.

","Let me start of this review by saying that before I attended the screening of National Treasure I really had no expectations or any real wanting to see this film. Nicholas Cage isn't one of my favorite actors, Jon Tutletaub is not one of my favorite directors, This Adventure treasure hunting genre isn't on the top of my list and the trailer just made it seem a little boring.Diane Krueger of the wonderfully underrated Wicker park and Mediocre but entertaining Troy was the only exception. However, I'm ready to eat my words. Everyone associated with the film seems to do more than an admirable job of making the film highly entertaining and laced with thinking man's clues. Nicholas Cage stars as the descendant of of the Gates family notorious to the historical community for pursuing a make believe treasure that doesn't exist. He finds a clue leading himt o the declaration of independence which he steals so that he can read an invisible treasure map on the back. The film tours many other historical locations. Setting up countless, breathtaking and exciting action sequences. Now don't get me wrong the stunts aren't so incredible but their all underplayed so that they hit home and seem more respectable. I must say it's not the best film out there but it's a pretty darn entertaining movie. The story and the clues to unwrap the plot are very interesting and the film is populated by many likable performances making it one of Bruckheimer's more likable efforts. Cage also make s a welcome come back to the action genre. So people if your thinking about going to see it. Do it this Treasure is actually worth the hunt! 7/10"

","This is a fast-moving adventure film, but two errors at the beginning of the film, make it clear that this is strictly for fun. <br/><br/>The film makes reference to the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence. Actually there were 56. <br/><br/>The biggest blooper of all is about Charles Carroll. Charles Carroll was the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence. He signed as ""Charles Carroll of Carrolltown"" He was also the only signer brave enough to put down his hometown, so that if the British came looking for him, they wouldn't accidentally nab some other Charles Carroll by mistake. Here's the blooper. Charles Carroll was NOT a Freemason. The Freemasons were started in Europe in the 1700's by intellectuals who were disgusted with organized religion in general, and Catholicism in particular. The feeling was mutual. There's no way a Catholic would ever have joined the Freemasons. Even today, the two groups don't mix. In fact, the Knights of Columbus were started as a Catholic substitute for Freemasonry.<br/><br/>There were Freemasons among the signers, but Carroll wasn't one of them."
"cobbler88","7","0","0","22 November 2004"," A nice little ride
","""National Treasure"" was a very nice time, and I recommend it to anyone wondering if it's worth the money. It's not really a roller-coaster ride, nor is it a psychological or suspenseful thriller. Instead, I think it is a nice combination of ingredients.<br/><br/>There is enough action in the form of chase scenes and some occasional gunfire to satisfy the action-obsessed, but also presents enough of a puzzle to keep others interested, and vice versa. There is a the usual blooming relationship thing going on, as one would expect, but it never gets in the way of the movie's thread.<br/><br/>I know that some of the conspiracy-minded will think that the treatment to subjects like the Freemasons and Knights Templar is superficial and simplistic, but who really cares, other than the nutbars who set their clocks by ""The Da Vinci Code""? It never attempts to spin an incredibly tangled web and claim it is actual fact. It touches on some historical truths and weaves them into the story without taking them or anything else too seriously.<br/><br/>I would also say this is the perfect example of a movie where suspension of disbelief is required. Obviously, it is a little difficult to believe that, assuming you could steal the Declaration of Independence, that you could store and treat it in the manner they did and expect it to stay in one piece. Again, who cares? That doesn't really have anything to do with the story.<br/><br/>There is also enough comedy an light-hearted moments typical of Nicolas Cage action films, but I believe they are a bit better in this film.<br/><br/>In summary, I think that while this isn't exactly the greatest action film ever made, it's a nice combination of action, adventure, puzzle and comedy that will satisfy most people who watch it, and it's definitely a good time."

","I must admit, I was cautious about this movie after not being impressed by recent Disney live-action presentations, some initial poor reviews, very low-profile trailers and a single-screen opening at the local multiplex. Above all though, my main concern was Jerry Bruckheimer. Surely this was going to be yet another intriguing plot dumbed down to mediocre action flick for mainstream audiences?<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say I was wrong. National Treasure is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a while - yet is a typical Bruckheimer action-adventure at the same time! Here's a movie that's good clean action fun for the kids yet the adults will get a kick out of too. This is pure escapism - make sure you suspend all disbelief before entering the theater - yet there's a few political and social comments slipped in. Before you even start to think how the scriptwriters managed to combine all these to get a movie that appeals to all, you'll have spent a very enjoyable 100 minutes in the theater.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage seems to have found an ideal niche in this movie that should suit him as he ages. His character is socially awkward and not in any great physique for action sequences - in many ways he reminded me very much of Cary Grant in ""regular guy in unusual situations"" roles, such as North By Northwest. I hope Cage gets more roles like this, his performance here is yet another of the movie's pleasant surprises. The rest of the roles are as expected, Justin Bartha as the stereotype goofy sidekick, likewise Diane Kruger as the eye candy - both do their tasks admirably without making you think this is a ""formula"" movie. Sean Bean is suitably menacing as the villain, although as ever is considerably under-utilized, as is Jon Voight as Cage's despairing father. Both could have done with more screen time, but the pace of the script and Turteltaub's direction doesn't allow that luxury. There's some very sharp camera work too giving a familiar look to the crucial sequences - look for homages to ""Mission Impossible"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and even Hitchcock thrillers.<br/><br/>The ensemble comes together to become one of the most appealing action adventures in recent years, with something in here for everyone. I hope scriptwriters look carefully at this movie to see exactly how this is possible, and learn exactly how to produce a movie that can appeal to all demographics. Its top box office on opening weekend is well deserved, something I hope it can keep up over the holiday season and in a DVD release. This is one of the few movies in recent years that has kept me smiling all the way to the car.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten. I'd love to give it more, but I have one small gripe about the movie. There's a few instances of product placement in there that became somewhat distracting - the first couple of instances didn't impact on me too terribly, but one in particular stands out as it occurs in the same scene as some of the movie's best dialog. If you manage not to notice what laptop computer the heroes use, what car they drive, or what brand of bottled water they ""randomly"" pick up, then more power to you. Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie for everyone. Go out there and enjoy it the way movies are meant to be enjoyed."

Other stars include Jon Voight (Varsity Blues, Holes), Sean Bean (Lord Of The Rings, Don't Say A Word) and Diane Kruger (Wicker Park, Troy).<br/><br/>One definite eye-catcher of this film is the matchless cinematography. The camera work during multiple scenes keeps you engaged by every passing second. It powerfully adds to the thrill of the movie.<br/><br/>If nothing else proves it wonderful, the box office just might. With its first weekend out, National Treasure takes in $35.3 million. Coming up close, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie gains $33.5 million in its initial weekend; leaving The Incredibles to spot number three after two weekends out. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Johnny Depp) or Paycheck (Ben Affleck), this movie would please you.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed this movie the way Turtletaub intended.

","Can Hollywood make a movie that lacks graphic violence or sex, is void of sexual innuendo and swear words, and does not prey on societal vices--and be successful? Disney's National Treasure is one that I believe makes a case that Hollywood could indeed produce entertaining and financially successful movies minus these typical tag lines. While I don't believe National Treasure will be reigned in with such classics in the Adventure genre as Raiders of the Lost Ark, I did enjoy taking my kids to see the movie without feeling squeamish about the prerequisite dialogue or risqué moments that most movies, even 'family' flicks seem to include. National Treasure follows a most inventive theme that feeds thoughtful action and light, comic dialogue. Nicholas Cage and his sidekick are a great team that is enhanced by the addition of the beautiful 'Dr. Chase'. While a the bud of romance is certainly felt between the two leads, the constant thrill of discovery and intrigue keeps the audience focused on where the clues might lead the 'good guys'. <br/><br/>I felt this movie was as visually exciting to watch as the conceptual mystery was great fun to experience. <br/><br/>I am encouraged by this movie to believe that more studios will not look to make movies that exist on cheap thrills (and sophomoric humor or sexual themes) but invest in writers and producers who bring a creative wit, mystery, and story to the big screen. <br/><br/>National Treasure does just that."

It was fast-paced, so I never had time to dwell on such silliness as Nicholas Cage digging for 30 seconds into the snow near the north pole and finding--not just the lost ship he was hunting, but the ship's name plate so he didn't have to wonder for one second what he'd found!

I found it smoothly edited and so event-filled that I just got carried along. Diane Kruger (Helen in ""Troy"") once more is an ice queen who can't act, but every time she was on screen there was a closeup of her gorgeous model's face, so I DIDN'T CARE! Sean Bean, playing the villain, who was the only actor present, performed in proper evil fashion, and I liked Cage's sorta comic-relief sidekick.

","In these post-X-Files days in which we live, where the government is run largely by greedy idiots, it can be a sore temptation to imbue our founding fathers with even greater intelligence and insight than they had (or as Bono once said, 'You glorify the past/ when the future dries up'). Now, granted, we had an uncommonly selfless and outstanding group of men working together to start America, but I don't know that they were all shifty Freemasons who hid the greatest treasure ever assembled in the history of mankind and then left painstakingly obscure clues as to where they had done so.<br/><br/>But that's entirely the premise of National Treasure, the new Bruckheimer opus that opened this weekend. Treasure centers around one Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nick Cage) as he tries to track down said treasure, a family obsession dating back to the early nineteenth century. Abetting him on this madman's quest is requisite computer geek Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and equally requisite skeptical eye candy Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger, who started the Greatest War Story Ever Told in this summer's Troy). Of course we know that Gates must be on to something, not only because no one believes him (not even his dad Patrick, played by Jon Voight) except the villain Ian Howe (Sean Bean), but because, well, you wouldn't have much of a story without the treasure now, would you?<br/><br/>Treasure is not only an above-average sleuth/treasure hunt movie, it's also a history lesson. You get to learn all sorts of historical facts (like Ben Franklin arguing for the inception of daylight savings time) along with the light action, which for me, anyway, doubled the fun. Someone obviously loved their history; the tidbits are scattered throughout, often interspersed with plot points, and look at the names of the principles: the evil Englishman is named Howe, Ben's dad is named after Patrick Henry, etc. It's kind of a history geek thing, but I thought it was fun.<br/><br/>What I most liked about the movie, though, was that the heroes are all smart. Cage's Gates is a historical encyclopedia, but he's also sharp-witted (if a bit absent minded). It's nice to see a geek hero, and Cage fits the role very well (Poole and Chase are much the same, her sleek good looks notwithstanding). Cage gives his hero a passion for both history and the hunt, and his earnestness helps give the movie an added bit of believability and seriousness that playing it tongue-in-cheek would have ruined. Bartha treads the same line with Poole, though he gets most of the best comedy lines. Kruger, who will probably never be mistaken for a great actress, is fine here, even if her Abigail does shuck a lifetime's worth of law abidance to the wind in just under an hour to aid the man who steals the Declaration of Independence. But once Abby's on his side, she, like the boys, uses her considerable wits to help figure it all out.<br/><br/>The plot and the clues are a little needlessly complex, but they are woven into the dialogue with some skill. We never feel like we're getting a history lesson (or at least I didn't, but then I'm partial to history as a subject), but we're given all the information we need to solve the riddle along with Gates. Yeah, some of the plot twists are a tad outlandish; Ben Franklin made a special pair of eyeglasses that still work two hundred years later after being sealed inside a hollow brick on an external wall? And so on. But Treasure isn't trying to be a serious brain flick, it's trying to be a slightly updated version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. And for my money, it succeeds.<br/><br/>National Treasure is a great deal of fun. Cage, who's been doing deeper films of late, has never been more fun or likable than he is here, and he was perfect for the role. It's not the most solid film of its ilk this year  that would have to be Bourne Supremacy-but Treasure can hold its own and entertain you while doing it. Well worth the price of admission to watch Cage and Co. traipse around the east coast acting one part Mission Impossible and two parts History's Detectives."

","sure, it's a weak history lesson, but it's a boy's patriotic view of history. it's a boy scout's view, and a dying view in today's amoral America. National Treasure is basically a boy's treasure hunt movie, The Goonies with adults solving clues to claim an impossible prize. It never stoops to cheap laughs and only slaps on one car chase and one overblown explosion. It's a love story and an adventure and anyone who longs to feel the vicarious passion of an adventurer can do much worse than this. Nicolas Cage might not be the best actor to convey this passion, his boyish charm fading years ago, but he's sincere in his love for his country's rich history. The real stars here are the locations with Cage following ancient clues that lead him to Independence Hall and the Library of Congress. Americans have their own national treasure in their history and in the stories of the founding fathers, and National Treasure is the only movie in recent years that attempts to remind us of this."

So, if we accept that going in, the only remaining question is does it deliver sufficient entertainment value?<br/><br/>I vote yes.<br/><br/>The far-fetched plot owes a large debt to ""The DaVinci Code"", which itself owes a large debt to a time-honored history of conspiracy theories. Long before ""The DaVinci Code"" was published, I'd heard all sorts of whispered tales about the Knights Templar and the Freemasons - usually involving the Holy Grail, though.<br/><br/>But none of that matters. This is a yarn, pure and simple. As such, it's well told with a good mix of likable and villainous characters, plus at least one you're not too sure about. Should you expect a tall tale to stand up under intense scrutiny? Not bloody likely! To keep you from thinking about the incongruities, it has lots of well-paced action.<br/><br/>This is also a family film.

","National treasure is what it is. It's to remind us of the treasures we already have and remind us all of our history and of our forefathers. I think the story was great, the only weak point are the characters who were a bit shallow with little background. Sure it's in the same genre as Goonies and Indiana Jones, but all adventure movies share some of the same qualities, to group them together or call one movie the same as another movie is to be shortsighted. I think that most people who actually paid attention in history class will find the movie enjoyable. The movie is meant to play on our imagination, and say 'wouldn't that be cool if it were true' and I'd bet money that the number of searches for the pyramid, liberty bell, freemasons, Silence Dogood letters and many other film related items will be way up. The Movie helps us to remember that the founders of our country were real and not just characters in stories, one of the best examples of this is when Gates says that the last time the Declaration of Independent was in Independents hall was when it was signed, (which would be a great theme for our Tricentennial celebration in 2076).<br/><br/>All in all I would give the Movie 3 1/2 maybe 4 stars out of 5<br/><br/>in regards to the pyramid, The most accurate explanation of a pyramid on the Great Seal is that it symbolizes strength and durability. The unfinished pyramid means that the United States will always grow, improve and build.

I do think families will enjoy this film, but only because it's a family approved Disney picture. The plot line is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the whole story leads you to believe they were on a quest to make a film with an 'Oh, I'm so proud to be an American' theme.

","I honestly thought this movie was going to be terrible and luckily enough I came out pleasantly surprised. To start off I must state the plot was incredibly flawed in not just the concept alone. But the fact that Nick Cage can put together these impossible riddles out of the blue was ridiculous. Or that Sean Bean could figure them out as well even when he didn't have the clues was even more so. Add some crappy dialog and you end up with an unappetizing combo. However despite all these negative remarks I still thought it accomplished more good than bad. It did this through the sense of amazing adventure sequences and well thought out action scenes that weren't overdone. While it's not as good as ""Raider of the Lost Ark"" I did think it was one of the closest attempts since then with the exception of maybe the two ""Mummy"" movies...but they were a whole different ball game themselves. Diane Kruger didn't look as good in this as she did in ""Troy"" but her acting was slightly better even though she's still not that great at it. There's a model for you.

","I wondered if I was the only one to notice the glaring historical inaccuracy in the film National Treasure. The references to the Masonic Order seem to be accurate, but the movie identified Charles Carroll as a Mason. The last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence was Charles Carroll of Carrollton. He was a Roman Catholic and was not among the 9 members of the Masons who signed the Declaration. Very few people at that time would have been members of both the Masonic Order and the Roman Catholic Church. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, whose cousin John Carroll was the first Roman Catholic Archbishop in the United States, was not overtly a Mason and it is very unlikely that he was one secretly. Other than this, I found the move entertaining and enjoyable."

I would not want to make an unfair comparison but the action scenes, particularly at the end, invite it. I felt for Harvey Keitel whose entrance in the middle of the film elicited a fair number of chuckles from members of the audience. And Jon Voight is too good an actor to be playing such thankless roles. I hope he got paid well. All in all, for kids up to the age of 13 or 14, this one is probably worth an afternoon with popcorn.

At least a dozen books have been inspired by this fraternity and the recent success of the Da Vinci Code has played on this long standing tradition. Tales of treasure and untold fortune, wealth and secrets of the universe thrill our imaginations and appeal to our sense of the fantastic. The fact too that our own western history lends itself to grail quests, ancient truths and hidden clues adds to the boiling pot. So, why not have a big Masonic plot to hide a vast treasure right under the noses of the population and have the clues hidden on the back of our most famous document. The fact that Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and several members of the 2nd continental congress were Freemasons ups the ante even more.

One of my favorite scenes is when Ben and Riley are trying to explain to Diane Kruger's character that they think there's an invisible map on the back of the Declaration.<br/><br/>The scene works perfectly because Ben gives as little information as possible and is reluctant when Kruger pushes for more info. He knows just how silly she's gonna think this is. It feels as if he's trying to explain himself to skeptical members of the movie audience.

Come on, Nick, you at least owe me that!<br/><br/>National Treasure serves as a reminder of why I used to be a big Nicolas Cage fan. A reminder of why Face/Off, Con Air, and The Rock adorn my DVD shelf. Cage is at his sarcastic and charismatic best. And Bartha does a great job as Cage's sidekick. Not only is he funny, but he also makes himself an honest and believable character by questioning Cage and some of his outlandish theories and ideas. I'm just sad there wasn't a scene where he questioned him about the whole Lisa Marie Presley fiasco. Perhaps the clues can be found in the Jungle Room? *Johnny pats himself on the back for this clever reference to Graceland while readers not familiar with Elvis just shake their heads*<br/><br/>This is the mix of humor and action that Joe Moviegoer has come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer/Cage collaboration. But don't discount the story. Obviously it doesn't stack up with the likes of Memento, but for a movie that's bound to be labeled a ""dumb action flick"" it's actually pretty good, providing just enough mystery and twists to keep my interest. There are also little bits of history trivia dropped here and there (such as the clue that dealt with the history of Daylight Savings Time) that add a nice touch.<br/><br/>I've always liked movies that have clues that need to be pieced together, so I enjoyed following along with Cage and Co. as they chased the clues - clues on dollar bills, the clues on the back of the Declaration, etc. In fact, I wish the movie had focused more on the treasure hunt.

No. My cousin said he fell asleep during the first 20 minutes. He tried to redeem himself and said he really enjoyed the second half of the movie, but everybody around him (who all seemed to enjoy the movie) started to beat on him because of his comments. So yeah, there'll be plenty of people who don't like National Treasure. Big surprise. I can already hear them accusing me of being a studio shill for writing a positive review. Ah well. You'll have to forgive me for enjoying a movie whose main purpose is entertainment, not intellectual enlightenment.<br/><br/>Oscar can keep Leaving Las Vegas, and I'll take National Treasure. Congratulations Nick, I now forgive you for Captain Corelli's Mandolin.<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>The formula is pretty simple. Have you enjoyed the previous Bruckheimer/Cage collaborations? If you answer ""yes,"" then you'll probably enjoy National Treasure. If you answer ""no,"" then either don't go see the movie or don't cry about it afterwards. I know that's asking a lot. But in general, if you're looking for a November movie that has a ""summer movie"" feel, and you like Nicolas Cage's brand of sarcastic wit, then National Treasure will entertain.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)"
"Scorching","7","0","0","19 November 2004"," Not much of a treasure of a film
","There have been many movies about treasure hunters and there is not much that you can work on in terms of the story. This movie certainly fits this description. Even though they added some elements to enhance it, I found the story mediocre. Once the premise was set at the start it's pretty much downhill from there. The ending also was too cheesy and was rather disappointing. <br/><br/>What I found quite laughable were the names of the leading characters. Names like Benjamin Franklin Gates and the supposedly German name Abigail Chase. Surely they could have thought of better and more original names than these.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting I think most of the cast did a good enough job. There were times that Kruger's acting was poor. Perhaps her relative inexperience is to blame. Also her accent was evident on some of the scenes which I thought didn't fit her character even thought the filmmakers tried to mask that with a thin excuse.<br/><br/>Didn't really think too much of them adding some humor in the form of Riley. There were times that his one liners were very amusing and at times a little annoying.<br/><br/>Not one of the best movies by a long shot but a good enough film if you want something light and perhaps something to relax you after a long week."

I liked it so much I think I'm going to go see it again with my boyfriend when the movie comes out in theaters! If you enjoyed Pirates then you should definitely see this movie. It has the same adventurous feel and is also family-friendly. I wouldn't say it's better than Pirates but I would say it's on the same level. I'm not a huge fan of Nicholas Cage but I really enjoyed him in this movie. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone."

","Ever since he was a little boy, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) has had one major life goal: to find the 'treasure beyond imagining' that his grandfather told him about 30 years ago. Many of his ancestors have also sought it; all of them came up empty-handed. It's easy to see why, since the cryptic messages that might reveal its location turn out to be hidden in the Arctic Circle, on the wall of Philadelphia's Independence Hall and even on the back of the Declaration of Independence.<br/><br/>Just try convincing the staff at the National Archives to let you examine that item up close.<br/><br/>How Gates unravels the tangled web of clues  while dodging a band of thieves who are also on the trail of the treasure  makes for an enjoyable adventure in 'National Treasure,' a lightweight caper comedy-thriller that benefits enormously from a strong cast and the breezy touch of director Jon Turteltaub ('While You Were Sleeping,' 'Phenomenon'). The 'North by Northwest' of a new generation it is not, but 'Treasure' provides two hours of easy escapism, several good laughs and a few 'how are they going to get out of this one?' thrills.<br/><br/>After a patch of overwrought performances in some fairly awful films  such as '8mm' and 'Snake Eyes'  it's a pleasure to see Cage unwinding a bit and giving his audience a chance to smile instead of cringe. He's obviously having a high old time as Ben, who frequently seems like Indiana Jones without the whip, and his carefree attitude proves to be infectious.<br/><br/>Cage is delightfully teamed with Justin Bartha, who all but steals the show as Riley Poole, a tech geek who's coerced into helping Ben on his mission. While Ben is patient and unflappable, Riley tends to be anxious and easily irritated. Faced with yet another in a lengthy chain of mini-mysteries, Riley becomes crabby: 'Why can't they just say, 'Go to this place and here's the treasure. Spend it wisely'?'<br/><br/>Later, when someone asks how a secret hideout could possibly have been constructed, they're told it was built in the same way as the pyramids and the Great Wall of China. 'Yeah, the aliens helped them,' Riley adds.<br/><br/>Also at Ben's side is curator Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), who waffles between guarding the priceless artifacts in the National Archives and helping Ben and Riley outwit their ex-partner Ian (Sean Bean), who is now racing them to the hiding place of the long-lost cache of riches.<br/><br/>As he's in the process of stealing the Declaration of Independence to keep it out of Ian's reach, Ben reminds Abigail he's merely following in the defiant footsteps of the founding fathers who signed their names on that precious document. 'Had we lost the war, they would have been hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered and  my personal favorite  had their entrails cut out and burned,' Ben notes. He's not so much a fortune seeker as he is a 'treasure protector.'<br/><br/>Jon Voight adds a note of gravity as Ben's disapproving dad and Harvey Keitel turns up late in the game as a cop who keeps insisting 'somebody's gotta go to jail' as a result of all this. The screenplay also includes an irreverent little poke at the real-life problems within the government's intelligence agencies in a scene in which agents are forced to admit that they had received a tip that the Declaration was going to be stolen, but they didn't act on it  because they didn't consider the information credible.<br/><br/>'National Treasure' isn't particularly credible either, but its bubbly mix of action, humor and suspense makes it a gem of a guilty pleasure."

","GOOGLE will be seeing LOTS of hits from this one, from ""Freemasons"" and 'Knights Templar' to ""Pass and Stow."" And it's wicked clever how Benjamin Franklin plays such a central role in this film, from Nic Cage's character's name (Benjamin Franklin ""Ben"" Gates) to inventions, code, letters under pen names, daylight savings time, and more. It is all done so cleverly that many people will wonder how much is fact and how much is fiction, before it reaches its full Indiana Jones level of frantic. <br/><br/>Our obsessed protagonist, Ben, has spent his entire life pursuing a Holy Grail of American Colonial mythology that is complete with Knights Templar instead of the Knights of the Round Table. His Grandfather so anointed him as a child, and this boy's been taking it seriously for decades. His father, portrayed by Jon Voight, is the disillusioned realist Ben is determined he will never become. Ben follows clues as a bloodhound follows scent, oblivious to anything that would take him off task, and with the funding of the ever-creepy Sean Bean as unscrupulous treasure hunter Ian Howe, he digs up the pivotal piece of proof that his quest is more than a myth. The hunt then moves into fast forward, with clues tumbling like dominoes. A presumption that there is an 'invisible' treasure map on the back of the original Declaration of Independence is just the FIRST step to the ensuing mayhem.<br/><br/>The audience loved this movie, and my only objections were slight: why are so many doors unlocked, allowing our heroes such easy access to everything from fiber optic cables and conduits to historical landmarks?<br/><br/>Beyond that, I had a rollicking good time at this flick, enjoying Nicolas Cage at his oddly quirky best, admiring Jon Voight's robust willingness to be a lumpy and crotchety old character actor, finding the buddy-sidekick role of Riley Poole played by Justin Bartha a delight that's just right in tone and texture, all the while being caught up in the how-will-they-get-out-of-this-mess excitement of each moment. <br/><br/>The casting of Diane Kruger as female foil Abigail Chase seemed a bit too young for her character's power position in the historical archives, but she pulled it off with spunk and spine, which got me past her peculiar accent. There's a very clever bit with a gift from Ben to Abigail. In fact there are many, many clever bits and pieces that stay with you long after the movie is over. It was wise, too, for Ben to address Abigail's dialect, which defused some of its distraction. I have to assume Ms. Kruger talks like this in real life, as it was too extraneous to have been added as a layer of her character.<br/><br/>What I actually loved about this movie were the definitively American locations -- from the Lincoln Memorial to Independence Hall, from the overviews of Washington D.C. to great long shots of the Washington Monument.<br/><br/>The Liberty Bell, the Declaration of Independence, the historical trivia peppered throughout -- it was all just delicious in the sumptuous buffet of this movie. How refreshing to see a few true USA locations NOT being faked in Canada, Mexico or elsewhere!<br/><br/>Getting back to the Indiana Jones comparison, down to Indie's prickly relationship with his father, this is a Red-White-and-Blue version set in modern day Mom-and-apple-pie-America. And it all works, ably woven together under Jon Turtletaub's slick direction, and branded with the Jerry Bruckheimer sizzle of humor, romance, irreverence laced with underlying respect, and pace, pace, pace. What fun! And best of all, you can take the kids, take the folks, take the sweetheart, and -- although hearts will race and nails will be bitten -- no one will be embarrassed or scandalized or assaulted by gratuitous anything. Bravo!"

","Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, the seventh generation of treasure hunters searching for the world's greatest treasure. The treasure is too great for any one person or country to own. The treasure was accumulated by many armies over hundreds of years and ended up inside the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt. During the Crusades, the Knights of Templar (Masons) took the treasure back to Europe, and then smuggled it a little at a time to America. The Founding Fathers, who were Masons, hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British. The last remaining Mason who signed the Declaration of Independence tried to see President Jackson before he died. Instead, he was forced to give the clue to where the treasure was hidden to his coach driver, the first Gates. The Masons left clues in obvious places such as on the back of our currency, in historic buildings, and even on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin has been following clues to the treasure for 30-years, and now the last clue pointed to a map on the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin's partner, Ian Howe (Sean Bean), wants Benjamin to help him steal the highest protected document in the world and go after the treasure. Benjamin refuses to be part of Ian's crime, and to protect the document, Benjamin is forced in stealing it before Ian does. The treasure hunters follow a series of historical clues and visit many historic places. They must elude the FBI and stay one-step ahead of Ian. There are great action scenes throughout the whole movie that will keep your attention. It was a fun historical adventure movie, and it is a good thing that Gates explains the answers to the historical clues, because the audience won't figure them out.

","Nick Cage has hit a home run in this one. He has created a character that is interesting, a bit puzzling, and a joy to watch. The cast that surrounds him is also impeccably in place...from Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger to Sean Bean and Jon Voight, they are all perfect in their respective roles. <br/><br/>Though the plot line centers around the mysterious nature of the Free Masons and our founding fathers relationships within that organization, this is definitely a movie for serious history buffs...but don't fret if your recollection of Paul Revere and Sam Adams is sketchy, it doesn't go over the heads of the lay-person in the audience (the film uses Riley's character to explain and set up some of the history lessons that it uses to move the plot line along).<br/><br/>The action is non-stop, so I seriously recommend going to the bathroom and getting your popcorn before the movie starts because once you see the opening scene set in the Arctic, it's a roller-coaster ride from there to the end credits. And a fun ride it is at that!"

","History buff Nicolas Cage, who as a young child was enraptured by his grandfather's story of hidden treasure left behind by a secret sect of our founding fathers, defies generations of failed attempts and hopes to locate the fortune which would be worth about ten billion dollars. Treasure map movies are usually a lot of fun if the clues are tasty enough and the characters engaging, and here (rather surprisingly) both are. Cage doesn't have much of a character to play (we get very little exposition about the man behind the obsession), yet his hangdog determination and dry delivery serves this frantic scenario well. The story isn't worked out fluidly, with holes and gaps of logic (and a point mid-way through involving an FBI helicopter where the plot almost capsizes). Still, Jon Turteltaub's direction is focused and exciting, helped immeasurably by fast editing and a handsome production, all of which pick up the slack--to the point where even the script holes are just about irrelevant. *** from ****"
"bkoganbing","7","2","5","24 July 2007"," The Loot Of Our Founding Fathers
","National Treasure is one fanciful tale of Sean Bean and Nicholas Cage each seeking what is the treasure of the Knights Templar which got handed down to our Founding Fathers and hidden away for over 200 years. Of course Bean is quite a bit less scrupulous than Cage, but guess who triumphs in the end?<br/><br/>Our story takes us from the Arctic, to the Smithsonian in Washington, to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and finally to New York City near the site of George Washington's Inaugural. Once the action gets going it doesn't pause for too many minutes. National Treasure borrows a great deal in plot and pace from the Indiana Jones films.<br/><br/>Of course this plot has enough bullet holes in it that one with a reasonable knowledge of American history can find, but it's still a rather enjoyable film. Harvey Keitel is fine as the FBI agent pursuing Cage who's looking for the treasure and pursuing and avoiding Bean at the same time. Why is the FBI after Cage? Well he stole something rather irreplaceable.<br/><br/>Of course the part that I find a bit preposterous is the fact of where the location was. I can't believe that with the amount of excavation for construction done around there, the treasure wasn't located a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>Best in the film is Justin Bartha as Cage's sidekick.

","I enjoyed this movie a lot as it stars Nicolas Cage with not well-known actors/actresses. It is suspenseful with non-stop action and invokes U.S. History of one the most important documents of history--Declaration of the Independence and the origins of the U.S. founding fathers. The riddles, clues created by the Freemasons and Knights Templar are actually very clever to prevent the British from finding the treasure. The writers of this film are very clever to instill U.S. history with riddles and a endless series of clues leading to a treasure. Silence Dogood letters written by Benjamin Franklin kept at the Franklin Institute is also a clever method for a clue which leads to the antique spectacles. Yes, Benjamin Franklin was really a freemason. Nicolas Cage referenced famous quotes from ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" ― Thomas A. Edison and ...""when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.- Declaration of Independence. In truth there are 56 signers of the Declaration, NOT 55 signers as Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) stated. This movie appeals for all ages and will retain audiences' attention throughout the entire film. There is no excessive foul language used, some violence.<br/><br/>For any avid history buff, this movie will enrich your mind-- especially U.S. History.

I always get confused between National Treasure and National Treasure 2, as I can never remember what happens in which one. They kind of blend together, but that's okay.<br/><br/>This movie is about Benjamin Gates, and his quest to the truth to a long-asked question.

","This movie is in the vein of unbelievable, campy, hokey, adventure films, along the lines of the Indiana Jones films.

Acting, story and dialogue are all decidedly mediocre.<br/><br/>But it's not a waste, really, because it doesn't aspire to be more than what it is: A mildly entertaining pair of hours. The set pieces, the action direction, and the general production value leave the film with the ability to be swallowed without too much disgust. Although part of me felt like this film would've been better as a B-grade television series (one clue to the next, lots of room for moments of suspense--very good fodder for the next series executively produced by Sam Raimi and possibly starring Bruce Campbell or another excellently campy B-grade actor), it passes as a film okay.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it? No. It doesn't add any value to anyone's life, nor is it really a film you have to see in any way. But, if you're tired of dealing with commercials while you turn your brain off, you can catch this film instead. All the mind-numbing mild entertainment of television and none of the commercials. 6/10."

","If your head is still spinning from all the murky codes being deciphered in THE DA VINCI CODE, you can sit back and relax with all the clues NICHOLAS CAGE has to unravel in order to go on his treasure hunt in NATIONAL TREASURE. He has lots of help from his dad (JON VOIGT), a very savvy female assistant (DIANE KRUGER), his mentor (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER), and his goofy but handsome side-kick (JUSTIN BARTHA). The heist scenes involving a stolen Declaration of Indpendence are a highlight of the film, all filmed on actual locales in and around Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, handsomely photographed.<br/><br/>Cage gets some stiff resistance from HARVEY KEITEL as a no-nonsense FBI man, and some villainous competition from greedy SEAN BEAN and his henchmen, who want the treasure for monetary purposes only and will stop at nothing, even murder, to lay their greedy hands on it.<br/><br/>It's all Saturday matinée stuff, the plot strictly a mixture of Indiana Jones and other cliffhanger stories where the hero has to pursue his quest while all sorts of obstacles are thrust in his way--and then the final, climactic shoot-out and wild chase before he can walk off with the girl at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>All the standard clichés are firmly in place, but it's still a lot of fun to watch NICHOLAS CAGE interact with a fun loving cast. SEAN BEAN lends some British dignity to his role as the charming villain, not quite as dark a villain as is usual in these sort of capers.<br/><br/>There's a light touch throughout all the heist sequences and chases and explorations of the underground caverns holding the treasure, as well as some well staged moments of suspense with collapsing stairways and termite-ridden wooden structures making the search perilous. JUSTIN BARTHA contributes a lot of the lighter jibes as a computer wiz who is clearly having a good time and knows the whole thing is a lark as he works on his computer graphics.<br/><br/>Nothing too original here, but it's purely an escapist adventure yarn."

","...with a big wholesome PG staple right on its forehead. While none of this sound promising, National Treasure is still a fun ride and well-made considering the audience it was directed at. I am always delighted to find a family adventure film so devoid of bad one-liners, cheap jokes and pratfalls that I am ready to give National Treasure a great deal of unmerited praise. It is not cheesy; its plot is not altogether unbelievable and the acting performances are surprisingly low-key and enjoyable and decidedly unDisney-like.<br/><br/>We follow Nicholas Cage as Ben Gates, a treasure hunter on a mission to unlock the secret location of a great, ancient treasure that the founding fathers of America once buried. On his way, he accidentally teams up with a curator of the National Archives--Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). We also see supporting roles starring Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight and Sean Bean. Nicholas Cage is rather charmless in his part, and this is where he severely lacks an Indiana Jones edge and humour that could have brought so much to an adventure film like this. Sure, he acts with conviction - but with very safe and mild conviction. In the end, National Treasure is very standard and very safe in all aspects. It lacks edge, but it satisfies."

","National Treasure tells the story of a man who has grown up believing he has descended from the Knights Templar, and he must find and protect an ancient treasure. When a member of his team goes bad and sets out to steal the treasure, the man must steal the map, which happens to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence, follow the clues, and find the treasure. This is a very fun popcorn movie with great action and a very interesting premise.<br/><br/>I love movies where there is some sort of mystery that needs to be solved. I loved the plot to this movie, where it is explained that clues as to where the treasure is buried are hidden in things we see every day, such as the one dollar bill. Every time a character discovers a clue, a smile is brought to my face because of how clever the plot is. The characters are interesting and watchable, mix that with the plot and there you have a fun movie. The Da Vinci Code has a similar premise (a man finds clues in something we see all the time), but don't kid yourself...This movie is far more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code. This isn't a perfect film, but it doesn't advertise itself to be. You know as soon as it starts that it's just going to be a fun action flick.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. I'm usually not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, but he's good in this movie. The other actors that pop up are what make this really exciting, such as Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, and Christopher Plummer, and they all do great jobs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun action movie for a night in, and it's better than The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>7/10"

I can always identify with Nic Cage's character, even when the rest of the film is a snorer (Gone in 60 Seconds). Diane Kruger is so smooth that it's hard to believe that National Treasure was only her third English-language film. Jon Voight has a tension in all of his performance that is similar to Cage's, which made him the ideal choice to play the role of his father. I'd love to see this pairing in future films. Harvey Keitel and Sean Bean were excellent as always in supporting roles (I can't picture either as carrying a film by himself). The film offers possibilities for sequels that could be very different from the original picture. My family and I saw ""National Treasure"" in the theater, then bought the DVD as soon as it came out. Is it possible to wear out a DVD from too much use? If so, ""National Treasure"" will be the one.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" received no Academy Award nominations.

One mere hint, ""The Secret Lies With Charlotte"" would lead to a series of clues and long sought after treasure.<br/><br/>Directed by John Turtletaub (The Kid, Phenomenon), National Treasure definitely proves the talent of this magnificent director.<br/><br/>Not only was there brilliance from the director and the plot line, but also the acting was tremendous. Nicolas Cage definitely reached his all-time high alongside newcomer Justin Bartha (Gigli). Other stars include Jon Voight (Varsity Blues, Holes), Sean Bean (Lord Of The Rings, Don't Say A Word) and Diane Kruger (Wicker Park, Troy).<br/><br/>One definite eye-catcher of this film is the matchless cinematography. The camera work during multiple scenes keeps you engaged by every passing second. It powerfully adds to the thrill of the movie.<br/><br/>If nothing else proves it wonderful, the box office just might. With its first weekend out, National Treasure takes in $35.3 million. Coming up close, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie gains $33.5 million in its initial weekend; leaving The Incredibles to spot number three after two weekends out.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Johnny Depp) or Paycheck (Ben Affleck), this movie would please you.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed this movie the way Turtletaub intended. I know others did as well, catching the looks on the audience's faces as they immediately turned to their guests with satisfied smiles and content faces.<br/><br/>Judging that it would have been an afternoon with a talking sponge or a date with Mr. Cage for seven bucks, I am fulfilled with the use of my money."

Jerry Bruckheimer is a well known Movie producer, with films like Black Hawk Down, Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl and Kangaroo Jack, there was no doubt that this would be a massive hit.

Of course, everyone calls him and his family crazy for believing that it's real, but they go right on searching. A clue leads Ben and his friend Riley to believe that there is a map to the treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence so of course, they decide to steal it. Naturally there are the bad guys who want the treasure for themselves; resulting in a few nice chase scenes and several ingenious clues that end with a scene that screams a soon to be Disneyland ride.<br/><br/>I was totally surprised when I found out that Nicholas Cage was going to be in a kids movie. I mean, its Nicholas Cage! But he actually does quite well. He has nothing on Harrison Ford in ""Indiana Jones"" but he doesn't really try to be like him. Well, at least he doesn't try to hard. The bad guy is Sean Bean from ""Lord of the Rings"", who has a distinct Aussie accent but is pretty low-key. Of course you have the girl (Diane Kruger) who actually does quite well in an okay role. My personal favorite character is Justin Bartha, a new comer, who plays Riley Poole. He gets the punchlines that are designed to bring comic relief and he delivers them with a perfect dose of sarcasm.<br/><br/>The most promising thing about this movie is the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") produced the movie which gives it a pretty good life span. Also, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (writers for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") are connected to the script which can almost ensure that there is good dialogue.<br/><br/>Go ahead and see this movie if you really aren't looking for something that is super deep or is saturated in love.

"dfranzen70","6","1","2","12 June 2005"," Good action, illogical plot
","National Treasure won't surprise you, but thanks to a rather appealing performance by Nicholas Cage and some choice location shooting, you forget that the plot is nonsensical and illogical, and all is well with the world.<br/><br/>The appropriately named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) comes from a long line of wacky theorists who believe that the Founding Fathers of the United States buried a ton of treasure somewhere, and that a clue to its whereabouts is on the back of the fabled Declaration of Independence. So, with his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and a reluctant expert, Abigail (Diane Kruger), he sets out to steal the treasured document and discover the cache of loot for which he and his own forefathers have been searching for decades.<br/><br/>Cage makes like Indiana Jones here, and while he's no Harrison Ford (even a younger Harrison Ford), he's a spot better than you might expect. He's never quite believable as an action hero in this movie, but he seems authentic as a man of letters, a clever conniver, a sly sleuth. Good thing, because he's pretty much the entire show here, save for the awesome footage of Genuine American Historical Monuments. Anytime you can sneak in recognizable landmarks, your film will stand apart from the others in the genre; it'll be more memorable. Check out a minor Hitchcock film, Saboteur, and you'll see excellent use of the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>The movie is apparently based quite loosely on the Dan Brown novel The DaVinci Code. I haven't read the book yet, mostly because I'm too cheap to go buy it and it's always, always out on loan from my library. But I've heard from very reputable sources that National Treasure is basically a ripoff of the DaVinci Code story, albeit supercharged as an action thriller extravaganza. I bet the book didn't things blowing up all the time, but that's what you have to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film. I'd advise you to read the book instead, for I hear it's clever and entertaining; the movie gets it only half right.<br/><br/>,Although the logical train Gates follows from clue to clue seems somewhat implausible at times, don't let that distract you from a fun time. Don't let the clichés of a hot-but-smart female sidekick; a smooth, superrich Eurotrash villain; and a wisecracking computer-whiz male sidekick deter you, either. But wait, don't shut your brain off entirely. You want to see how many of the clues you'll understand before Gates does. In fact, make a drinking game of it. Every time he says, ""I'm working on it!"" or looks exasperated, do a shot. I guarantee you'll be snockered in no time.<br/><br/>One other minor debit is that there really isn't much chemistry between Cage and Kruger. I mean, every hero has to have The Girl, and they just don't seem to click. Maybe they didn't like each other. Maybe Cage tried to put the moves on Kruger and she slapped him silly. Whatever the reason, they just don't seem too into each other, as they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>In all, it's not too bad, and probably best seen on a big screen, the better to see Stuff Get Blown Up."

","Despite a wildly far fetched story line,National Treasure was indeed a joy to watch.The whole concept of a modern day treasure hunt laced with ""clues"" left nearly 250 years in the past was quite an intriguing idea to me,and going in,I was very hopeful not to be let down.I wasn't. It is discovered that a map leading to a wealth of treasure was placed on the back of our beloved Declaration of Independence.Bad guys are out to steal the document and find the treasure for themselves.Nicolas Cage must also set out to steal it in order to protect the treasure.What ensues is a great thrill ride from start to finish.Also,this is a great movie for an entire family to watch as violent content is at a minimum and there is virtually no profanity at all.When it becomes available for rental,I highly recommend it for family night.Pop some popcorn,sit back and enjoy the ride!"

","The true credit goes to the story writer of the film. It's a real great imagination that made this movie better than many other so called ""Treasure Hunts"". The way the story woven round the history is a real fabulous deal.<br/><br/>I am not a hard core fan of Nicolas Cage. Yet, he impressed me with his wit. All others did a fair job.<br/><br/>The only thing against this movie is that at times I felt like I was watching Ocean's Eleven( Of course, in the scene of the theft of ""Declaration of Independence"".) I know that is a lame excuse, but my personal opinion.<br/><br/>The settings for the movie are really worth a mention. Its very difficult to get that feel.<br/><br/>On the whole the movie is very good and is a good choice to spend some time. Definitely, not a masterpiece though."

","Sometimes it doesn't matter how much history, thought and plot clichés you add to a film, it can come out to be just a dumb movie great for watching just for fun. National Treasure is one of these. It really doesn't accomplish too much as far as a thinking thriller movie, but now that I have the bad stuff out of the way...<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates (LOL!), a treasure hunter out to find loads of goodies hidden by our very own founding fathers. Turns out the clues are held in the back of the Declaration of Independence, but not before the bad guy (the always mean-looking Sean Bean) can get there first. Now add some 007 action to this Raiders of the Lost Ark feel, perhaps a touch of The Goonies, blend in a little romance with lovely Diane Kruger, and *Poof*! You've got instant action/thriller comedy.<br/><br/>What surprises me the most of NT is that it's kid safe. No cursing, no graphic violence, no sex or nudity references, and yet, it FEELS like it should be that type of movie. Being a Disney film and all, it still had to get a PG rating, but they did a bang up job for a holiday film. Just don't go in expecting out of this world thriller and you'll be fine. And bring the kids. The movie just oozes a new ride at Disney. (I hope that doesn't happen :)<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, but we don't do halves here at IMDb, now, do we? A 7, then."

","""National Treasure"" combines American history with legend in this action thriller. Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Bates, a man from a long line of men who have searched for a legendary treasure. The story takes a look at the rumors that have swirled around American history, of the influence of the Freemasons and other secret societies on the Founding Fathers and the origins of the United States. Whether the stories are true are not are best left to the imagination. There is a lot of action and suspense in this movie. The locations are beautiful, using such well-known spots of Americana as Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the display room for the Declaration of Independence. This movie is worth seeing!"

","Jon Turtletaub's ""National Treasure"" is such a rarity in movies, in that you don't have to think about it, enjoy the ride, and make sure you have enough popcorn and soda. Though get the medium drink. After all the movie is 2 hours and change. The 'think' comment is not an intended slam, but rather a recommendation. The screenplay by the team of Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley has a very novel concept which is entirely envisioned as an action adventure. Turtletaub, as Director, executes the action and adventure with great skill, pacing, and a sheer sense of fun. The movie also looks great.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, who as a kid was enrolled by his Grandfather's (Christopher Plummer) stories of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. According to the legend, the treasure map leads to a vast fortune hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. As the movie opens we find grown up Ben, now a treasure hunter/ historian of some sort, along with his sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), and slippery business partner, Ian Howe, at the North Pole in pursuit of the legendary treasure. Predictably Ben and Ian become adversaries in search of the fortune. The FBI are thrown somewhere into the mix.<br/><br/>Ben becomes convinced that the only way to protect the treasure from falling into the wrong hands (that being Ian's), both he and Riley must steal the Declaration of Independence first. Enter Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), curator of the National Archives. She thinks that Ben and Riley are conspiracy crazed crack-heads. Well, not really, but she thinks they are nuts. However, due to a slew of events Abigail finds herself aligned with the boys. Along the way, we find out enough about the history surrounding the Declaration of Independence to stake out the category on ""Jeopardy"". The rest of ""National Treasure"" is a wild ride, and to it's credit, most of it is clever.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Nicolas Cage wonderfully plays the geek hero. He is perfect as the normal guy caught in a ridiculous situation. His Ben is not the coolest, but he is strong, smart, intense, and has a sense of humor. Justin Bartha offers expert comic relief as Riley. Diane Kruger is gorgeous, sharp, and funny as Abigail. She fairs much better here, than she did in ""Troy"". Sean Bean infuses an understated menace and danger as Ian. Credit the cast and Turtletaub for never taking themselves or the movie too seriously, and for providing a very good time at the movies."

","I'm not sure why the critics gave ""National Treasure"" such a bad time. It's not a very original movie, but it is very well made and it's not a sequel.<br/><br/>For me, the best thing was the script, which is well thought out and does not carry any excess baggage. The film follows a typical formula. There's the scruffy hero, the goofy sidekick, the pretty blonde, and the despicable bad guy. The visual style is similar to the TV show, CSI. It looks slick, and the pace never drags.<br/><br/>I typically don't care for Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger is not a very good actress. The filmmakers felt they had to explain her character's accent, which makes it stand out all that much more. Also, she wears more makeup than most 28 year olds. I guess there's a shortage of young, pretty blondes in Hollywood right now. The supporting cast is top-notch.<br/><br/>This is a silly, brainless movie, but it is a lot of fun. 7/10"
"Poopdeck90210","8","1","2","6 December 2004"," Solid Flick - Will Help Get My Kids Interested in American History
","This film was put out by Disney, with Jerry Bruckheimer. I think it would have been an equally good match if A&E's History Channel had picked it up. Plot is fairly straight forward. There is less violence and extreme action than the trailers and the Bruckheimer reputation suggest. Story is basically a combination of the 3rd Indiana Jones movie ""Holy Grail"", with a little of the Goonies and Tomb Raider mixed in for good measure. Jon Voight has some of the best lines and is a delight as the ""Senior Gates"". Gage turns in a solid performance as well, as does Harvey Keitel. I think Mr. Keitel better watch it -- he may get stereo typed as the FBI Head if he is not careful (he had a very similar role in ""The Red Dragon""). There were a few plot twists that were not exploited, but that is okay. It would have been funny, for instance, for the film to tie the family name ""Gates"" back to our Mr. Bill Gates of Microsoft. Great film to take the kids, especially school age children who are studying American History."
"movieguy1021","7","1","2","3 December 2004"," National Treasure: 7/10
","Dontcha just hate Jerry Bruckheimer? I mean, Pearl Harbor sucked (and I miss you), and all of his movies are basically the same. It's a bunch of explosions, some stock characters, and a cheesy romance thrown in. National Treasure is no different. Then what sets this apart from all of Bruckheimer's other movies? The movie knows its absurd, knows its implausible and ultimately stupid, meaning that it can throw any reason out the window and alloy for some silly fun to overrule the movie. I can't regard anyone who calls this movie great as someone serious, but I also can't really see how someone could wave off this movie as being too light-hearted and can't enjoy the film for being the silly stupidity that it is.<br/><br/>Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) descends from a long line of treasure hunters, looking for a treasure supposedly buried by the founding fathers. Generations before him have also looked, but to no avail. However, Ben, along with his wisecracking sidekicks/computer nerd Riley (Justin Bartha), find clues, while competing treasure hunter Ian (Sean Bean) follows close behind. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger of Troy and Wicker Park fame), as some sort of historical government official, comes along for the ride.<br/><br/>As this is a Bruckheimer movie, I was expecting many forays into deep, dark tunnels with magical effects that almost (but don't) kill the main characters. Thankfully, that's only at the end; the majority of the movie's about stealing a priceless historical document. What could be cooler, really? If you think about it, it's completely against what we're supposed to be feeling, yet this all-American person decides to steal what's the backbone of our society for his own personal good. I mean, that's cool. The movie introduces many things that have no explanation (Benjamin Franklin's glasses, perchance?), have no reason why they could work, much like many other action/adventure movies. But, really, why care? The movie's entertaining. The action's there, the suspension of disbelief is there, and the fun's there.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Nicolas Cage fan (but I don't really detest him like some do), but he's fine here. I mean, he's not a tremendous actor, but you could do worse. Bean and Kruger (both, actually, were in Troy-you could do six degrees of Troy easily) were as expected. Bean usually plays the ""conniving evil British dude"" in movies like these, and Kruger is at least making a mainstream name for herself. Bartha could quite possibly be the next guy who, when you see him in a movie, say ""I KNOW that guy, I just don't know what else I saw him in."" But, the acting's not important, what's important is that National Treasure is a fun movie. It has the stamp of Bruckheimer all over it, but don't let that fool you.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for action violence and some scary images."
"anhedonia","4","1","2","1 December 2004"," If only they tried a bit harder
","The frustrating thing about watching a film like ""National Treasure"" is knowing that had writers Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley, and director Jon Turteltaub tried just a bit harder, they might very well have made a fun, exciting adventure yarn.<br/><br/>Occasionally, they manage to squeeze out a moment that hints of fun, when they might have got the tone right. But such bits of pleasure are so sporadic. And they seemingly paid no attention to their story.<br/><br/>True, ""National Treasure"" is a popcorn film, a movie where you leave logic behind and expect to get caught up in the excitement, no matter how outlandish the story is. But even mindless entertainment still needs some magic and heart. This one is worse than watered-down Indiana Jones stuff.<br/><br/>Kouf and the Wibberleys make everything too easy. This is one of those films where the heroes uncover little clues as they go along. But the clues placed apparently by our Founding Fathers are so incredibly cryptic, they never could have expected anyone to solve them. Yet here's Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) reading a preposterously enigmatic riddle and within seconds figuring out the answer is the Declaration of Independence! Don't even ask how easily he finds a crucial secret in the vast, barren expanse of the Arctic. And for us to buy even a smidgen of this story, we have to believe that some of our more important buildings - the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and Independence Hall in Philadelphia - have some of the most lax security in the world.<br/><br/>The problem with ""National Treasure"" is its script. Which, I suppose, shouldn't surprise anyone. Kouf's more recent screenplays include ""Snow Dogs"" (2002) and ""Taxi"" (2004), while the Wibberleys' contributions to the world of cinema include ""The 6th Day"" (2000), ""I Spy"" (2002) and ""Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle"" (2003).<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is uninspired, lazy storytelling. The action scenes provide little excitement and are too infrequent. As good an actor as Cage is, he might be getting just a bit too old for these parts and really gets nothing to work with. No clever one-liners, no witty comebacks. Diane Kruger as National Archivist Abigail Chase has a better role here than she did earlier this year in ""Troy."" Then again, that isn't saying much. At least, she doesn't have ridiculous dialogue like, ""Last night was a mistake,"" this time around.<br/><br/>Justin Bartha gets to play the comic relief as Ben's sidekick, Riley Poole, but the jokes aren't all that good. Harvey Keitel's stuck in a winless role as an FBI agent, while Sean Bean gets to play the bad guy - again. However, unlike in the Indiana Jones films, the bad guy here isn't really all that villainous. He wants the treasure, but there isn't an evil or nasty streak in him. He's just a greedy rich guy.<br/><br/>And, of course, the big question no one in the film bothers to answer is why is this treasure so important that it had to be hidden away for so long? Its discovery certainly wouldn't change the course of the world in any way. And this lethargic story doesn't change adventure movies for the better, either."

He says that the word ""Heere"" only has 2 Es. I can distinctly count 3.<br/><br/>The plot has a lot of hole like when a search is done on Yahoo, the first hit was the right location to the clue.

","Well, I was disappointed by this movie, even if I didn't have high expectations. When I saw that it was released by Walt Disney Pictures, I was even more apprehensive (especially since they're lackeys to the actual political power, see last paragraph). Even though Walt Disney Pictures now release more edgier pictures.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, one of the worst and most full of wholes I've ever seen. You can see everything coming from miles away! I'm looking for something that stands up just a little storywise and this doesn't even cut it. Acting? It's OK, nothing really special. Action and special effects? Pretty good, it's the part that saves the movie from complete nonsense. And it's running way too long. Not enough tension in the film to keep us going. You can't just throw in the usual action theme music and think it's going to keep us going. There's even the traditional ""high speed car chase with the girl/guy hanging on the truck's open back door which must be saved by good guy while the bad guys shoot at them""! Come on, be a little more creative!<br/><br/>And, not to get into a political debate, this is a great American propaganda film, just right for these times as another reviewer said : influenceable Americans will go to this film and come out being so proud of their history and forefathers. It's so obvious. And the phrase read from the Constitution by Cage about doing the right thing even if it seems wrong in the eyes of others? What a great way to validate the Irak war! And you ask why there is resentment towards the USA. Oh please...<br/><br/>I give it 5,0/10"
"gregsrants","4","1","2","22 November 2004"," Too many clues, too few realistic outcomes
","I have the perfect idea for a film. Underneath my bed mattress, there is a stain that if you squint just right, it kinda looks like an arrow pointing to the bathroom the other side of the hall. In the bathroom there is a can of Gillette shaving cream that if you read the label, it is noted that their office is located in Boston. Go to Boston and you will quickly be reminded by everyone you bump into that the Red Sox won the World Series for the first time in almost a hundred years. They beat the St. Louis Cardinals, so our adventure would take us to the famous Gateway Arch in Missouri. Now if you consider that the Red Sox beat the Cardinals winning four straight games, it would suggest that if you stand at the Arch when the clock strikes four, then the shadow it casts will lead you to a buried treasure. Except, don't expect to find the treasure right away. While digging through underground power lines and water pipes, you will then find a chamber that hasn't been opened for hundreds of years. When you enter the chamber, you will use the Gillette shaving can and a World Series ticket to make a key that opens to another room that has a ladder that leads back to my bedroom. The final chapter will contain all the excitement as I find a five dollar bill under my bed that I obviously have no idea how it ever got there or how long it has lay in its darkened quarters.<br/><br/>Preposterous? Yeah. Insidious? Without question. But when compared to the new Nicolas Cage film, National Treasure, it isn't that far of a stretch. In fact, pull in an A-list star, and Disney might even give you a sizable blank check and find you a director to film this confusing enigma of a film.<br/><br/>Granted, I am well aware of the liberties I am taking but I wondered if the masterminds behind National Treasure thought the same. Their film follows the adventures of Ben Gates (Cage) whose family has been entrusted with solving an ancient riddle whose clues lead to a treasure trove of riches and artifacts. But these aren't your ordinary right-in-front-of-your-face type of clues. These are ingenious riddles that are so complicated only an incredibly intelligent history buff with remarkable problem solving and innovative skills could ever figure. Or Ben Gates. So complicated in fact, you wonder if those that had hidden the treasure had ever wanted it to be found again. Clues like the clocks time on the back of a one hundred dollar bill, a hidden pipe buried in a ships' frozen tomb and the shadow that a tower casts at an exact time on another building. Of course, as the trailers so nicely spell out for us common folk, the biggest clue remains at the back of the Declaration of Independence where an invisible map is locatednaturally. <br/><br/>The obtaining of the map is Ben's biggest obstacle. How can you steal the Declaration of Independence? Well, thanks to his incredible ingenuity and a computer geek sidekick named Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben undertakes an elaborate plan to secure the Declaration for the purpose of his family quest. The plan will consist of going to the National Library to look at blueprints of both the building and the security devices surrounding the document, fake ID's, tapping into the security monitoring cameras, tricking the heat sensors to thinking there is a temperature variance and working on getting the document extracted during a rather convenient gala going on in the building the same evening. <br/><br/>Of course, they could have saved themselves all the brain cramps in thinking of such complex plan and taken the approach of the other team in search of the same treasure and just taken an underground vent to the location and using a stun gun, demobilize the security and take the Declaration. But where is the fun in that?<br/><br/>Along the way, Ben Gates is able to retain the reluctant services of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who is in charge of keeping the Declaration safe and tags along for the wild ride to ensure the document does not in any way get damaged (except of course when she uses lemon juice to reveal the map hidden on its underside). Luckily for the crew, she is only a part time desk jockey and spends the rest of her days as some kind of stunt woman that can hang on to speeding truck doors with one hand or swing from a collapsed staircase to a safe landing platform while trying to escape from the evil Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who is also in search of the treasure if only for its monetary value. If this all sounds like it is more than the average mouthful, you are not alone. This is a movie that never tries to be smarter than it needs to be (it is Disney after all), but does throw a lot of things at you (I ducked once just having the kitchen sink miss my noggin'). It is definitely one of those movies that if you step out for more popcorn, you may not be able to piece together what has happened since you departure.<br/><br/>Giving credit where it is due, the movie does move at a nice clip towards an ending that may be ridiculous, but at least it is no less plausible than any of the events that lead to its climax. The acting is ample with Cage giving his usual steady performance in a paycheck role and Kruger who is proving that she can hold her own amongst the big boys. Harvey Keitel pops up in a wasted role as the police agent trying to track down the missing Declaration and although it was nice to see him in something mainstream, I wish he would have passed on this particular project. <br/><br/>National Treasure will probably open big and will no doubt be talked about for a sequel if the audiences show it any attention after its initial weekend. I was surprised that the trailer (which was one of the worst in recent memory) heralded the director Jon Turteltaub who's track record consists of just a handful of projects, but I can say that he did better with this script than say, Stephen Sommers did with any of The Mummy entries. <br/><br/>It's just that National Treasure tries to be too much. If it shortened the amount of clues that brought them around the country and focused more on the adventure, maybe they could have an Indiana Jones for the new millennium type of series. Instead, I left the theatre feeling as I had traveled with them from clue to clue and having jet lag is no way to leave a theatre.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

One thing they did not touch upon (for obvious reasons) was the Masons affiliation to the Illuminati. If this all sounds like conspiracy, that's because it is a conspiracy. Few who are focused upon current events would argue that we are rapidly moving towards the final commencement of a one world gov't which is commonly referred to as the NWO (New World Order). The ruling class elite of the ""33 degree"" freemasonry is called the ""Illuminati"", and they are the driving force behind this diabolical push toward a NWO. They will either implement the NWO or destroy the planet in their effort to achieve it. <br/><br/>The film is not based upon fantasy, I personally know many Freemasons and was shocked to find out many of our ex-presidents and founding fathers were Masons.

","Once upon a time, back when Nicolas Cage could actually 'sell' a big budget movie, some clever producer at Disney came up with a script for 'Indiana Jones' mixed with 'Ocean's Eleven.' Then someone else added a dash of 'True Lies' and then wrapped it up in 'The Da Vinci Code,' before the man in charge of the money mentioned that whatever this Frankenstein's monster of a film had to be fit for all the family... and promptly gave it a PG rating. What once might have been a good idea with a major star somehow became something that was less than the multitude of all its inspirations. And that's a shame, because I think - once upon a time - there was a good film in here trying to get out.<br/><br/>It opens with a young boy (later we discover is Nicolas Cage) being told by his grandfather about an artefact in US history that has been long forgotten and only accessible via certain clues left by their forefathers. And tell the boy he does. This opening scene goes on for about ten minutes (it felt like more) and is basically one long exposition dump setting up what the characters will later be looking for. When it finally ends, we join Cage and his team in the arctic (or a studio in California that has a freezer in it). They all find something and spend the next ten minutes adding more exposition as to how they will eventually use this new information to track it down.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that at this stage the producers realised that what they were making was a little 'talk heavy' and figured they better blow something up in order to wake the audience up (hopefully not literally). Cue an action scene and a reminder to all American adventurers never to include a Brit among your party as Sean Bean decides it's time to pull off an early double-cross and - guess what - the film's villain is revealed to us all.<br/><br/>National Treasure' is not a short film. It's close to two hours of more of the same. The characters are never really given any time to develop. Diane Kruger is the (tragically so) generic 'love interest' for Cage. There's a younger guy who I never got his on screen name and can't be bothered to look up the actor's name - he's the comic relief. As I mentioned, Sean Bean is the villain because... er, he's British. That appears to be his only real motivation for wanting to get ancient relics before Cage (or Indiana Jones, I guess). Expect more generic action, more generic characters and a hell of a lot more generic exposition.<br/><br/>Cage does his best with the script that he's given and, although he's never afforded the luxury of going 'the full Cage' (fans of his will know what that means), he does his best with what he's given. But he's not given much. There's no real chemistry between him and anyone else. And that's not their fault either. No matter how good any of the actors are, they just look bored - Sean Bean especially!<br/><br/>I know a film doesn't have to be completely be original to be good. In fact, pretty much everything's been done now in terms of story-telling, so we're used to things being repackaged and churned out, just in a slightly different way that now makes them - at least appear - watchable. However, 'National Treasure's' biggest problem is that it just doesn't know what it wants to be. The obvious genre would be 'adventure' (ala 'Indiana Jones'), but then it veers off to some sort of comic spy movie like 'True Lies,' before quickly trying to pull off a heist like 'Ocean's Eleven.' I know many good films that have combined genres and worked; in fact... most do! However, this is an example of a film exceeding its reach and trying to be too many things at once and not having a - true - target audience in mind and ending up appealing to very few.<br/><br/>I wonder how well it did in America, compared to the rest of the world. To quote (the far superior) 'Team America: World Police' it is pretty 'America! F*%k yeah!' all the way through. Perhaps this is a 'national treasure' to the good citizens of the US of A, whereas out here in that small part of the world known as 'everywhere else,' it all feels a little overblown and self-indulgent to be the classic it could have been."

","Nicholas Cage is a great actor, but he's been in a lot of awful movies - this being one of them.<br/><br/>National Treasure is boring, dull, and slow-paced especially being 2 hours and 11 minutes long, the performances are okay, it is just everything else that is wrong, watching this film is like watching paint dry, the movie plot lacks excitement - watching a bunch of people look for things...not very entertaining.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this flick is the film score composed by Trevor Rabin."

","I think most other reviewers here are looking for violent action or some sort of arty commentary. National Treasure is neither of course. Instead, it is a fun, smart, classy movie for folks (not just families) who understand this is a caper movie about fantasy, a celebration of smarts and passion for a cause, and, great camaraderie. <br/><br/>In this movie smart people get to, awkwardly, do cool things. Claim to the FBI and the Director of National Archives that there's an invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Try and steal a national document for supposedly justifiable reasons. This is fun stuff, and you want them to succeed, no matter how unrealistic. Perhaps it's a fun movie only for us awkward, bookish ones, not the tough, Rambo would-be's. Perhaps that's the source of the two types of reviews of this movie . .<br/><br/>That's what it is and for that it's a 10/10. <br/><br/>And the dozens of wry side comments are incredibly infectious and repeatable.

All of the acting in this is ridiculously affected. And Jon Voigt looks old enough to have been around when the treasure was buried. It seems like everything he does now is strictly destined to be b level cable fodder or worse in the case of his horrific remake of the Wicker Man.

","Adventurer and archaeologist Ben Gates is following his lifelong quest for a legendary treasure with his team and searching for a lost ship which contains the treasure. No treasure is found but they do locate a clue that suggests a map to the treasure's location is somehow hidden on the back on the Declaration of Independence. Ben gives it up there and then but his colleague, Ian Howe, decides to go after the Declaration himself  even if it means stealing it. Left for dead with geek Riley, Ben decides to stop Howe, but with the authorities sceptical to say the least, the only way he can do it is get to the map and treasure before Howe can.<br/><br/>After hating the sequel, it would be a fair question to ask as to why I bothered watching the first one. Well my reasoning was that I didn't believe that the first film could have been that bad if so many people went to see it. The first film clearly has a lot in common with the second film and in a way I disliked it in the same sort of way. Writing this now I realise one thing  if I review this against the sequel I will either end up moaning about it due to the things it has in common or praising it because ""at least it is still better than the sequel"", so instead I will just try and review it without a connection to the bad experience I had.<br/><br/>Watching it on its own terms it is hard to deny that the plot is a bit daft and I did struggle to get into it at times. Fortunately it minimises the daftness of the clues and, more importantly, the number of them that have to be followed and as a result it didn't tire me out that much. Of course what the silliness does mean is that the film cannot create a sense of tension, urgency or danger. This does keep it in kiddie territory although (sorry to do this) it is much less frequent that all the terrible ""wacky"" rubbish in the sequel. On the whole though, the film did just about enough to keep my interest and make me suspend my disbelief but not enough to really excite or engage me. It is hard to see it as anything other than a poor man's Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>The cast are roundly so-so, a reflection of the material perhaps but here we are. Cage is all a bit too smug and knowing to draw the audience into the story and I do think that he is a part of the failing in this regard. Kruger is so-so and I suppose at least Bartha is quite fun in his character. Bean is a poor villain with a division one footballer's haircut. Voight, Keitel and Plummer are all pretty much slumming it in small roles and offer nothing other than their faces to the film.<br/><br/>Even without comparing it to the sequel, National Treasure is only a so-so film. The lack of urgency and danger leaves the silliness of the film rather exposed. It does just about manage to minimise the wackiness and stupidity that the sequel suffered heavily from and it does distract but it is certainly no better than that."

","When you go and see a Jerry Bruckheimer film you expect a flashy and fast paced roller-coaster ride with the emphasis on fun rather than plot and character development. This film does not disappoint. The action focuses on idealist Ben Gates who has devoted his life to hunting for the treasure that has eluded his family for generation and who follows a series of clues culminating in him hatching a plan to steal the Declaration of Independence in order to protect it (and the invisible map on the reverse) from the bad guys! Unlikely I know. <br/><br/>This film bears great resemblance to the Indiana Jones series. Action filled with scenes of peril and a dash of romance. The events seem unlikely at best and this film does not pretend to take itself too seriously. See this and be prepared to suspend your disbelief and have a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours."

And I was giggling to myself that I'd been to many of the movie locations.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of good guys was excellent. The love interest scholar is skeptical, but oh so curious. The disappointed dad (Jon Voigt is it?) just oozes contempt for the treasure hunt. The comical sidekick was hilarious.<br/><br/>Even the bad guys were great. They weren't evil megalomaniacs. They were just greedy guys who wanted to make some cash. They weren't over the top cruel. In fact, they too were hilarious in some scenes. Sean Bean plays a bad guy at his best. He's even a bit lovable in this film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only actor under-utilized in this movie is Harvey Keitel. To be honest, there wasn't much role to be had. They shouldn't have cast him.

","'National Treasure' is an adventure film about a young man and son of a long lineage of masons who makes it his personal task to hunt down some treasure from the early days of the United States of America. In the process, several key symbols of American history are examined, including the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of Independence. The film is ultimately a history lesson with plenty of Indiana Jones-style adventure and a little bit of romance. There's also conflict between the characters as the villains who want to steal the treasure out of greed are hot on the tails of the heroes. It's action-packed, but it's really not a very deep film, and it does go quite quickly, but it has nothing completely wonderful about it. It's just a pretty good action film. Don't expect a wonderful film, but expect to be entertained for over an hour."
"tanman91","4","1","3","12 January 2006"," Disappointing...
","National Treasure is counterfeit treasure. Everything in this movie is all so coincidental. I mean, yeah of course the treasure is located 'secretly' down in some church cave hardly deep down enough. Then Nicholas Cage solves a secret passage on a door just behind where all it's hidden. That just shows that the treasure must be located near Benjamin's location, so that the film makers don't have to travel somewhere far away and unexpected to bury the treasure. And like, they call this an adventure?! I'd say that this was more of a drama and comedy than an adventure or action. It seems as if Cage had hardly any trouble finding the treasure in the end. He matches the secret riddles and ancient problems on the Declaration of Independence map so 'perfectly' and then finding some weird-looking relics in a brick building. There would've been plenty of mistakes that would last weeks and months finding the treasure if this situation was happening in real life. And yet Benjamin only finds it in only a few days? Do you possibly think that Benjamin Franklin Jr is a code-hacking genius? And in the very last scene where Diane Kruger tells Cage that there is a secret treasure hidden in their new house? Do you expect that that is going to turn out exciting? I'm not curious at all. And I don't care. I even didn't want to see this in the first place, but my school saw it free, so luckily I didn't waste $9 on this junk. I even wasted almost two hours watching this! My rating: 4/10"

","...But darn it, I did! Generally, if I see Jerry Bruckheimker or Nick Cage's name on a film, I know I won't like it because I have never been much of a fan of either men's work, but this was a really fun film. The tag line of ""the Indiana Jones of the new millennium"" might be a bit strong, though. Nick Cage is hardly Harrison Ford, but this was a great action/adventure/whodunit/heist/treasure hunt film. The only thing I had a bit of a problem with was some irritating camera work from time to time in the first 20 or so minutes of the film. Trevor Rabin (ex from The Buggles and Yes) did a great job on the film's music. An added positive element was the shooting on real historical locations in Washington DC, New York and Philly. For once, the CGI used in the film didn't LOOK like CGI and that in itself was very refreshing! All in all, I would recommend this film to just about anyone who enjoyed the Raiders series-but don't expect to see another Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is definitely a film with a feel and personality of its own. When my wife and kids come home this afternoon, I'm going to watch it again with them!"

"TxMike","Null","1","3","22 May 2005"," Not to be taken seriously, a moderately interesting discovery caper.
","""National Treasure"" is a fictional story of an enormously valuable treasure that Colonial Americans hid from the British for safe keeping. (Anyone who has been through the British Museum in London knows how the ancient Brits enjoyed plundering and bringing treasure back home, so the premise is plausible.) Problem is, no one person in the group of men back in the 1700s knew exactly where the treasure was hidden, but there existed a series of ""clues"". Ever since he was a small boy and he heard the story from his grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Gates, just called Ben (Nicolas Cage), was obsessed with finding the treasure. His dad (Jon Voight) had apparently spent lots of energy in his younger days searching for clues, and didn't believe the treasure existed. he considered it a ruse to distract the British. Besides, the Gates family now had a reputation for being a bit kookie! I enjoyed the movie, and I generally like Nic Cage, but when it was over there was nothing particularly lasting about the viewing experience. The veterans Voight and Sean Bean (as Ian, the bad guy, naturally) were good. The eventual love interest was played by German Diane Kruger who was there for her pretty face, but her acting is very ordinary. Good picture and sound on the DVD.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. The movie opens with a search party, led by Ben and including Ian, following a ""Charlotte"" clue, find the long lost ship ""Charlotte"" in the Arctic Circle under ice, which they hope have the treasure. It doesn't only gun powder and an elaborate carved smoking pipe. In it is a clue, which they deduct leads to the Declaration of Independence. Ian turns on them, and an explosion on the ship leads him to believe Ben has been killed. Ben knows Ian will steal the Declaration, so he must steal it first, to protect it. Ian uses brute force, Ben uses cunning, and Ben gets to it first. The chase begins, Ian eventually gets it, an invisible map and some codes lead them to Manhattan and Wall Street, then a church, then a burial vault, then a very deep underground cavern (impossible under Manhattan??) Meanwhile Ian is misdirected to Boston, while Ben finds the treasure behind yet another wall. Ian is arrested, the wealth is divided up among all the peoples, Ben and Abigail get a grand new home."

","'National Treasure' is too long, silly and very entertaining. It is no 'Indiana Jones' but it has as much fun with its adventures and characters; that makes it more than worth watching.<br/><br/>It stars Nicolas Cage as a treasure hunter named Ben Gates who believes a secret map on the back of the Declaration of Independence will lead him to the greatest treasure possible. Together with Riley (Justin Bartha) he will have to steal the thing to protect it from Ian Howe (Sean Bean), his former partner who is after the treasure as well, at any cost.<br/><br/>While stealing they encounter the National Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and of has to come along to provide Gates with a love interest. She does not believe them at first, but of course she slowly changes her mind. After stealing the Declaration not only Ian is after the three, also Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and the rest of the FBI. In the second part Gates' father (Jon Voight) pops up as well, becoming pretty important in this silly story.<br/><br/>Indeed the story is silly and could be even stupid, but Nicolas Cage is the kind of actor who can make things like this sort of believable. Together with fine actors like Keitel and Voight, a Kruger who is much better here than in 'Troy' and Bartha who is very funny, they create an entertaining and at times very funny adventure instead of just another film. That it is too long is hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>Do not take it the least serious, just try to enjoy. There is a very good chance you will."
"buildit31","7","1","3","29 December 2004"," A smart, fun film that may try a bit too hard at times to be something it surely isn't
","Have you ever been to one of those giant Chinese buffets where there's row after row of fried, mouthwatering foods that you know you could never cook up for yourself? When you walk into one of these restaurants, you can't help but feel a bit gluttonous as you try to stack as many different goodies as you can onto your plate. You take some fried shrimp, a bit of white rice, a dumpling or two; then you happily stuff it into your mouth without as much as one thought. However, when you finally get up to leave, you're always a bit overly full. This is exactly how John Turtletaub's National Treasure will make you feel as it borrows heavily from such cinematic superiors as Raiders of the Lost Arc, and Ocean's 11, all without offering much originality, or plausibility. The meal itself is tasty while it lasts, but afterwords, it just leaves you with a sour stomach.<br/><br/>The film begins as a cliché, continues as a cliché, and ends as a cliché, all to go by the basic cinematic formula, never even slightly treating its audience as intellectuals. It actually starts this right off the bat as the film feels the need to open in the 1970's only to introduce the movie's hero as a child, and set down the main layout of the promising, yet essentially absurd plot.<br/><br/>What is the plot, you may ask? Well, if you've read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, it should seem very familiar. The movie follows the character of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) as he struggles to uncover the secrets behind the treasure of the Knights Templar, which seemingly disappeared after the first Crusade. Like his past relatives, Ben believes that the treasure was brought to the United States by traveling Freemasons during the time of the revolutionary war. Ben also thinks that once in America, our forefathers, who believed that one man should not hold so much wealth, supposedly hid the treasure, leaving nothing but a string of riddles and clues to its whereabouts.<br/><br/>Now, in the present time, Ben's job is to (Gee, can you guess?) find these clues, solve the riddles of the Freemasons, and hunt down the treasure before it falls into the wrong hands. And just to ensure that there is a set of wrong hands for that treasure to fall into, one of Ben's teammates turns on him in the first act after they discover that the next clue leading to the treasure's whereabouts lies (Ok, here's where the plot becomes a bit more preposterous) on the back side of the declaration of independencewritten in invisible ink, of course.<br/><br/>From here on out, the film becomes an implausible, yet exciting romp through the mysteries of the masonry history, overstuffed with clichés and literally riddled with plot holes as Ben sets out to ""protect"" the declaration by stealing it, and finding the treasure before his backstabbing teammate. Joining him on his quest is Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben's quirky, show stealing sidekick, and Abigail (Diane Kruger), the beautiful token love interest.<br/><br/>As you'll eventually notice, the movie falls in between the two categories of absurdity and excitement. One moment you could be scratching your head at the movie's stupidity, and the next you could be cheering on Ben during a fun, yet still cliché, car chase. The two feelings don't usually mix well, but since the film doesn't take itself too seriously, plausibility and intelligence will begin to take a back seat to what is actually happening on screen.<br/><br/>One scene that serves as a perfect example to this would be when Ben steals the declaration of independence, which, sitting in a ""cleaning"" room, is only being guarded by a handful of security guards, and two cameras. While this situation (like many others in the movie) may seem completely asinine, it's played out in such a way that you'll be too immersed in Ben's actions to realize it. The director, John Turtletaub, should be patted on the back, if only for keeping the audience interested with such a great pace, and style for the 2+-hour adventure.<br/><br/>Another thing that truly benefits the film is the acting. The three main characters (Ben, Riley, and Abigail) have such wonderful chemistry together, that you'll soon forget how underdeveloped their characters actually are. At times, Justin Bartha's hilarious performance as Riley will even steal the show, just because of how he acts off of Cage and Kruger. Speaking of Cage and Kruger, their ""relationship"" in the film seems a bit too forced and unbelievable at times, but, again, you'll be too busy trying to keep up with the film to notice that.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that while the plot may be a bit ludicrous at times, the film still manages to give unsuspecting moviegoers a pretty good history lesson on both the Freemasons, and our forefathers; so don't be surprised if you learn a thing or two.<br/><br/>All in all, National Treasure is a fast paced, exciting, well-acted adventure, if not a bit too daffy in its plot and clichéd formula. If you happen to be in the mood for a fun, ""should have been summer"" movie, then see this in theaters; however, if you're in the mood to actually think a lot during the film, then wait for the DVD, or pass on the entire experience.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5"

And it is always nice to have such talents as Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel in a movie. National Treasure is gripping from start to finish. And as far as action films go, I think it really nailed it."

","Once again, the critics and I don't agree. I think they go into movies and don't go in to enjoy them, they go in to pick them apart.<br/><br/>This is a FUN movie with lots of NEAT things and some actual facts and so on (including symbolism, bits about the Knights Templar, etc.). While there were some inaccuracies--this is supposed to be an adventure and it and the clues and the traps are a ripping good time!<br/><br/>It's sort of like Shakespeare--he was writing to the common folk; while he might have had some sense of symbolism in mind, I don't think he intended people to pick apart his plays looking for layers and layers.

","This was an incredible movie. One where it can eventually show on TV without having to bleep out half of the dialogue and cut out scenes. This was terrific screen writing. The plot always kept you wondering what was coming next. <br/><br/>There was also a good blend of humor as well. At times I felt like I was watching a blend of Ocean's eleven, The Rock, and Indiana Jones. Nicholas Cage was on my list for a long time as one of the worst actors in Hollywood. But after ""The Rock"" and this one, I have to admit he's come a long way. Not the best but certainly a good performance again. <br/><br/>This movie didn't depend on special effects but instead relied on a great story. The movie drew the audience in to feeling like you were figuring out this mystery. The movie always has you thinking about what they found and what it means to the continuation of the film. You find yourself, trying to figure out the clues as Nicholas Cage (Ben Gates) is trying to. The movie had an edge to it too because you always felt the presence of the competition with Sean Bean (Ian Howe-bad guy again!). So whatever the next part of the puzzle was, it had to be figured out quickly because Ian Howe was right on your tail. Kept you in suspense the whole time.<br/><br/>This will be one of those ""don't miss"" movies."

","I always felt empty in my life like something was missing. I never knew it would be the warm embrace of our lord and saviour Nicolas Cage. In this Masterpiece he plays Ben Gates, An archaeologist/historian/badass. Throughout the film his glory carries the admittedly poor performances of all the other actors but how can someone be considered to be a good actor when in the same film as Nicolas Cage. After watching this classic I was reborn as a child of our one true god, our one true saviour, our one true overseer, our one true love, our one true hero, Nicolas Cage. I must say that is film deserves more than the excellent rating that I gave to it. Before watching this film one must prepare a live pig as a sacrifice or Nicolas Cage will come into your house at night and whisper the six most dreaded words imaginable ""National Treasure Three Has Been Cancelled"". This film will change your religion. This film will change your life. You must watch this film if you consider yourself a person with any sort of standards in great cinematic epics. This film was too good for lots of people who fail to see the glory of Nicolas Cage so they rate it low and create hundreds of multiple accounts so they can keep on giving it low ratings. IMDb needs to ban these people as not only are they pro HAX0RS but they are denying the lord of the rating that he deserves."

","National Treasure is a really good movie. I have nothing but positive things to say about it. What's good is the acting, plot, screenplay, action, weaving in comedy, music, and family entertainment. This is one of those Disney movies where you think that Disney did not distribute this.<br/><br/>Ben Gates is on a quest. He wants to find fabled treasure that most people think is fake. His associate just tried to kill him and another associate, Riley. Now, the associate, Ian wants to steal the Declaration of Independence to find the treasure. Ben ends up stealing it so it does not fall in the hands of Ian. Now he and Riley are joined up with a beautiful curator and Gate's father and they have the FBI and Ian coming after them.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Nicholas Cage has been a decent actor throughout his career. Jon Voight did a good job. I also was impressed with Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha.<br/><br/>This movie is great for history buffs. The movie takes place in cities of history such as Philadelphia, NYC, and the nation's capital.<br/><br/>I liked the music here. It is pleasant enough to listen to. The score was composed by Trevor Rabin.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie. I do not know why people are thrashing this movie. I rate this film 10/10."

We are so impressed by how clean they are! It is a movie we can watch with our children. It is sad, but we can't even watch most movies intended for children because of the indecent content. We mostly just have Christian movies. After watching this, I was totally amazed that my children could actually watch it with me!! It is also captivating, funny, and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next! I have to tell you the truth, this and National Treasure 2 are my favorite movies of all time!

","What Do Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Goonies have in common? They are great family adventure films. It is sad that in Hollywood the family is rarely considered. What makes these type of films great is that there is something for everyone. Comedy, Drama, Suspense, and even romance are found in great family adventure films. National Treasure is no exception. I don't think Nicholas Cage had any intention of winning a Oscar for this piece, but he handles the role as Ben Gates brilliantly with his own brand of humor and wit. I think the director has learn a lot from the great adventure movies of the past but has offered us something totally original. The history of our great country shines in this movie with the majesty and awe of being in a foreign country or exotic world. All the characters seem to be intrigue with our history. The film is not trying to preach the importance of history but makes it fresh and exciting. <br/><br/>The action is great and Sean Bean as the villain adds a real world since of threat that is edgy for the adult but true Disney for the kid. I am glad they are making sequels to this film because it will probably never score points with the artsy Oscar crowd but it is getting us all back in touch with what matters in movies most good storytelling. Good job Nicholas Cage. So get the family, some popcorn, and prepared to be taking on a exciting adventure."

","For a movie that's supposedly based on finding long lost treasure, this one got awfully boring really fast. What happened? By the way, what happened to Nicolas Cage? The man could act once and he was capable of creating exciting characters. But not lately, and certainly not in this film. In this film, his performance is mediocre at best. As his love interest, Diane Kruger gets to look good and has a few good lines, but that's it. His sidekick is really annoying. All this I could forgive, if there was a plot or any excitement in this film. But the number of exciting moments in this film were too far apart. The villain is not very threatening and gets duped way too easily. I thought this guy was supposed to be smart. Of course, I also thought this movie would be more exciting than it was. With the exception of a few chases, there really isn't much to this film. Bottom line: It's a watered down version of an Indiana Jones flick."

Until there is only two Gates family members left Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight)who believes that the treasure is load of nonsense, but Ben Gates still is determined to uncover the treasure that has been owed to there family for years. So years on Ben Gates is still looking for the treasure and to do so he must decode the clues that were left by the Four Founding Fathers of America, these clues lead you right to the treasure itself. And so the film opens with Ben Gates and his wright hand man Ian Howe (Sean Bean) and his trusty side kick and computer nurd friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha)searching in the Antartica for the first clue that was left to the Gates family. And after discovering the clue and decoding it which is and 18th century boat he believes read that there is a invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, this which i will not spoil anymore leads to Ian Howe betraying Ben and Riley and sets of to get the Declaration of Independence himself and in-turn getting the treasure, so this Ben Gates, Riley Poole and also a historian called Abiail Chase (Diane Kruger) to set off uncovering the rest of the clues in America to uncover the most important treasure in the history of mankind.

","This is an excellent movie. I'm a big fan of mystery movies and this one has had me waiting for what would happen in the next moment till the very end. The plot is, of course, most unrealistic, but IF one imagines that there could actually BE such a treasure, an undiscovered one, then it all becomes perfectly logical, and we can enjoy the romantic story within a hunt to protect a national treasure, a treasure beyond any man's dreams, from being stolen by a gang of ruthless prospectors. The cast is very good, Nicolas Cage is one of my favourite actors, but what I think I love the most about the movie, is the main theme. The music is absolutely perfect and I fell in love with it the first time I heard it.

A general opinion, considering the mixed reviews this movie is receiving - on sale or not - it is worth it but if you're not semi-appreciative of history and logic, don't bother. If that were the case, yes, some scenes would definitely seem like they drag along and the overall impression would simply be misleading. In my personal opinion, I loved the movie with all its logic and unique methods of presentation. It answered all the questions that arose except it made me wonder why there still is a gap in the prehistoric ages. (Joke  your cue to laugh!)"
"bcolquho","10","1","5","14 March 2006"," Is it true?
","There's a story, whether it's true or not, is open to interpretation. The story begins in 1820 when Samuel Chase, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, tried to see Andrew Jackson, the President of the United States at the time. That's the story----part of it anyway. There are people today who are hunting a treasure in the Virginia countryside. The person who transcribed the codes, had gone out west in 1820, and supposedly had stolen gold from Mexico and buried it in the Virginia countryside and left clues as to its whereabouts. The original transcriptionist died and left the code with a friend who did nothing with it from 1820 to 1885. However, there's been doubt cast on it. Then there's the legend of the Templar Treasure. According to this, the Knights Templar, was the richest order in Europe. The Templars, officially the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, were Europe's bankers. The Pope, who'd created the Knights Templar, was in debt to the Templars. So was Philip IV of France. According to the Legend of the Templars, the Templars had a fleet of ships that brought their treasure to the New World. The plot of National Treasure, like that of the soon-to-be released The Da Vinci Code, is riddled with symbolism. The Knights Templar are mentioned. According to National Treasure, the Knights Templar become the Freemasons. The Gates family is named after the Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Patrick Henry. Abigail Chase is named after Abigail Adams and Samuel Chase, and the villain, Ian Howe, is named after Sir William Howe, a British general during the Revolutionary War, and his brother, Sir Richard ""Black Dick"" Howe, an admiral in the Royal Navy. Is it true? Again, that's open to debate. The documents on which the story is based, are, as I said before, questionable at best."

It's not as memorable as Indiana Jones or the Mummy films, but it's good as an adventure yarn. I liked this better than the second one, which, apart from the Mount Rushmore part, was forgettable.

"filipemanuelneto","4","0","1","28 February 2017"," Entertaining, but the plot is based on lies and historical inventions.
","This film looks like the alternative and geek version of any Indiana Jones movie, combining an exciting adventure with an absurd story based on a false historical premise: the passage of the famous ""treasure of the Knights Templar"" to American soil, where it was hidden by Masons, allegedly heirs of the Templars traditions and secrets. It's true that the Templars were extinguished by the Papacy at the request of the French king Philip the Fair, who arrested and killed several former knights in order to confiscate the assets of that religious order. It's also a fact that it was a very rich order, with lands, castles and armies. But to believe that these knights ever set foot in America or had secrets to leave the Masons is insane. If their intention was to conceal something or to pass some knowledge, they would probably took the most viable option: Portugal, where King Denis asked the Pope to maintain the Templars, as it was convenient to the kingdom, thus arising the Order of Christ, which survived in Portugal until modern times. There was no reason to go to America, and Masons still didn't exist. Well, let's talk about the movie now...<br/><br/>The movie is good, it entertains the audience well, especially if we're not too attentive to the dozens of historical mistakes made by the plot, quite unrealistic. The special effects are very good and the film is visually pleasing. The characters, however, lack personality and the actors are never able to give that. Nicholas Cage is rather unconvincing in the role, never seeming to be truly an academic nor an adventurer. The romantic subplot between him and Diane Kruger is highly predictable, though it looks good in this kind of movie. In short, it's a good movie to entertain, but there's a danger that some people will think they have a true historical basis and that makes it dangerous."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","8 November 2016"," Indiana Jones for the new generation
","I've heard tales about archaeology professors who insist on opening their first lectures with the following words: ""Indiana Jones has nothing to do with real archaeology!"" And I like to imagine that at that point about half of their pupils get up and leave, with their little hearts broken. But can you really blame them. Indiana Jones made archaeology and history cool, as well as romantic. We traipsed along the pages of history with good old Indy, learning a nugget of information here and there. Keeping that in mind, I wasn't at all surprised that this film became such a success. We've yearned for another Indiana Jones movie for decades, even more so after the disappointment that was the fourth film.<br/><br/>And make no mistake, this is an Indiana Jones film at its heart. Sure, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is his own man, but there are a lot of similarities to a certain fedora-wearing globetrotter. Both men of history, highly-educated, with multiple distinctive talents under their belts. Both men of action, who have the wits to out-think all their opponents.<br/><br/>But, the films are also dissimilar enough. This film takes place in the modern day and chooses to focus on American history. More specifically the Founding Fathers and the supposed Knights Templar treasure hidden by them to keep it from being abused and stolen. The film also focuses more on the mystery and puzzle solving than any of the Indy films. The treasure is hidden well and it takes a truly knowledgeable man to solve all the clues. And I really like that. I was hooked from the very first riddle.<br/><br/>It's also surprisingly well-acted. This is very much my favourite Nicolas Cage film. He plays the character very straight, very serious, with almost none of his usual antics, and the man can really act when he wants to. The supporting actors aren't bad either, with special mention of course going to the esteemed Sean Bean, who manages not to die for once in a movie.<br/><br/>This is a must see film for all fans of adventure and especially Indiana Jones. It's the spiritual successor of one of the greatest adventure trilogies ever made and I hope they keep making them."
"Leofwine_draca","5","0","1","1 September 2016"," Polished Indiana Jones copy, sanitised for the kids
","This is a film very much in the spirit of THE DA VINCI CODE – except it came out before the film version of that bestseller, and it's also a lot better, although that isn't saying much. It's a straightforward mystery/detective/crime/adventure film, reminiscent on plenty of movies that have come before (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE spring particularly to mind here). It's fair to say that NATIONAL TREASURE doesn't add anything new to the genre, and it doesn't have a lot to say about anything, ever. It's a Walt Disney-produced film, so is geared squarely at children, and it's inoffensive, light, and not too head-scratching.<br/><br/>The cast is something of a mixed bag. There are former luminaries like a slightly embarrassed Jon Voight and a barely-in-it Harvey Keitel hanging around the edges and reminding us of who they are, while total idiots like Justin Bartha are given the limelight. Bartha plays the youthful ally, the teenage 'hook' who's supposed to humanise the story, adding humour and comment all the while. He just comes across as a jerk, and his punchlines are cringe worthy. Still, it's not saying much when an overacting Nicolas Cage is your lead, engaging in supposed romantic scenes with cold fish Diane Kruger. Was this really the face that launched a thousand ships? I don't think so, somehow. The only cast members of note are the Brits. Christopher Plummer delights as a Gandalf-type character in the opening sequence, and Sean Bean handles the villain duties as the absurdly monikered 'Ian' – hmm, the name doesn't exactly fill one with terror, does it? We're used to seeing Bean as a crumpled rogue, but he's dapper here and delivers a straight-on-the-money turn as the avaricious villain. He's the best thing in the film, even if he is the bad guy again.<br/><br/>The story zips along at a fair pace, and I enjoyed the various historical elements that showed up along the way (the tinted glasses were particularly interesting). The stealing-the-Declaration set-piece is a little too close to a certain Tom Cruise film, but the subsequent car chase is all right and the various machinations aren't too laborious to sit through. Things end up in one of those clichéd, CGI'ed places, a massive vault with an endless pit below, with characters jumping around on rickety platforms and the like. It's all pretty predictable and what happens at the end won't surprise anyone. Still, something kept me watching this film, and I suspect that director Jon Turteltaub is the culprit; he adds a level of finesse and polish that the film doesn't strictly deserve."

","Entry-level suspense/action that's careful to paint exclusively by the numbers. Which is to say it's thoroughly safe and predictable from the very beginning, fair play for a Disney-branded family flick. It does let itself get washed away in a late flood of post-9/11 patriotism, but the constant flag-waving and revolution-era set pieces - absurd though they may be - at least give the picture something of a unique identity. It's not the next Tomb Raider though, try as it might, and the actual riddle-cracking/crypt plundering often comes so easily that it all feels redundant and boring. Nic Cage's lead performance varies from intensely awkward to, actually, pretty cool, but he can't completely fight away the urge to overact his heart out in a few late scenes. A strange hybrid of genres and essences, with an even stranger knack for casting decisions, I found it light entertainment at best."

","Adventure. Fantasy. Imagination. Too bad ""National Treasure,"" a film with Hollywood scum written all over it, decides to fool audiences in a making a ridiculous action film with perhaps a blend of all the terms I started off with in my review. Whats wrong wit those three words you might ask? Absolutely nothing. The trouble arises when you have an untalented director throwing every action movie cliché at you that you can see from China. Nicholas Cage stars as (for many, the four previous words outside of parentheses might have already scared you from seeing the film) Benjamin Franklin Gates. Despite one of the stupidest movie character names in history, Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt. The conflict in this film is so unexplored and uneventful that I felt bored throughout. We never end up knowing anything important about the key elements the multiple writers may or may not have intended us to know. And yes, we have to sit through numerous history lessons about this sought after piece of treasure. This story is like something you'd find at a library full of appreciated stories for pre-teens. Jon Turteltaub (speaking of stupid names) directs the film with an glittering sign of stupidity. Instead of allowing this ridiculous story to be fun, he makes every actor pitch their brainless dialogue in scenes revolving around soap-opera like scenarios. At times, I forgot what the plot was about due to the dull chemistry between this poor cast. To see Boromir from ""The Lord of the Rings"" play the bad guy is very disappointing. Cage, on the other hand, rallies up another title on his list of ""the worst movies of all time that happened to be staring me."""

The movie actually says a lot about what Americans like. They want to believe that the founding fathers had secrets but they did not. The entire thing about freemasons, shows that the writers had no idea what they were talking about. There is no history to substantiate anything in this movie. I feel sorry for those who think that someone knew what they were saying. This is a bad take off of Raiders of the Ark.

Somebody has to watch them  Maybe I'm too harsh for ""National treasure "" . Compared to ""Transformers"" series , this is actually a decent popcorn flick for one night. I guess people missed a good adventure movie since ""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"". ""NT"" is better than Spielberg ""Indiana Jones and the kingdom of crystal skull"" , so let's start with the good things about this movie.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger is cute in this movie . Justin Barthe is great as a comic relief . The humor is probably the biggest strength of this movie . It's really funny and well placed . Jon Voight and Sean Bean give nice performances . Also , the art – direction is good.<br/><br/>The bad things ? Nicolas Cage . A hero of adventure movie should be charismatic and likable. Harrison Ford in ""Indiana Jones "" movies ? Yes . Michael Douglas in ""Romancing the stone"" ? Yes. Nicolas Cage here ? No. Just NO. He is boring and lifeless . He seems stiff and nervous through all the movie . A big miscast . I was also disappointed with Harvey Keitel who seems like ""I just came for few minutes and when I'm done just give me the money as quick as it's possible"".<br/><br/>The action scenes are TERRIBLY LAME . The music is uninspired . I was able to guess some of the riddles before our heroes and I'm not even American . The plot is kinda predictable in few places and there aren't too many surprises here. Not to mention that the riddles seem to throw our heroes from one place to another just to keep the movie going. The characters also act illogical – The FBI should be at Voight house almost immediately after they identified Cage . It's a standard procedure , people ! Also , the villains at one point allow our heroes to escape , despite the fact that they need them . Near the end of the movie they also fall for an obvious lie. The movie also should end 15 minutes sooner. It was annoying in the end.<br/><br/>Overall , you could skip this movie and watch something else , but if you want to watch it , it's not that bad.

","The story is weak, there is a lot of potential, but the delivery is disappointing. Most of the story is highly predictable. I am not American but I would be interested to know if the American accent in the acting at the beginning of the film, when President Lincoln is killed, is accurate to that time.. it sounds too modern. These are details that make a story credible or a fake. Furthermore Nicholas Cage's acting does not do justice to the character. Overall the story could have been interesting, but unfortunately it does not keep you glued to the screen. Very predictable ending. Finally (which for any non-American is a 'put off') there is too much cliché about American 'feel good' where, for example, the French and British are made to look like idiots. Just another family action movie, not one to remember."

","I had heard about this film from Disney a number of times, knowing the leading actor and some of the premise, but I had missed it a few times, so I finally got my hands on it and watched it with interest, from director Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, While You Were Sleeping, Phenomenon). Basically historian and amateur cryptologist Benjamin 'Ben' Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is part of a long running family of treasure hunters, he was inspired at a young age by his grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer), and he is now on the hunt for the treasure still not recovered. He and Ian Howe (Sean Bean) found the legendary ship called the Charlotte in the Arctic, and it is there that they find a vital clue, after many others as well, that is a direction as to where to find the next one. They conclude from the riddle that the clue they need next is located somewhere on the Declaration of Independence, and Ian tries to kill Ben and his computer expert friend Riley Poole (The Hangover's Justin Bartha) after they refuse to touch the historical document. Ben does try to warn the National Archives about the high possibility of a robbery of the document, but they do not believe him, so the only way to stop Ian stealing and damaging it is to steal it themselves. So with the help of some high tech tools Ben and Riley do manage to steal the Declaration of Independence, narrowly missing Ian and his team trying to get it at the same time, and fooling them with a souvenir copy. National Archives worker Dr. Abigail Chase (Unknown's Diane Kruger) is adamant that they must return the valuable document, but the insist that they must at least try and find a hidden clue to the missing treasure they are searching for. Ben's father Patrick (Jon Voight) is disappointed that he is still trying to find this treasure after many years, but he agrees to help him find the secret message that may be on the Declaration, and they are overjoyed to be right. The clue is a bunch of numbers, and Ben remembers the Silence Dogood letters of Benjamin Franklin, and they decode the message to go to Independence Hall, where the next clue is located. After finding another clue behind a brick of the building on the roof, and splitting up to get away from Ian again, the villain manages to catch them, and forces them to tell him the location of the next path to follow. They are led to Trinity Church, New York, and it is below that they find hidden underground chambers that may in fact be the location of the treasure they have been seeking. Ben is forced into telling them the location of the next place to go, while Ian and his team leave him, Riley, Abigial and Patrick behind, but in fact the villains were tricked. The location they are is indeed where the treasure was hidden by the founding fathers, and even though the police catch up to them, led by Agent Peter Sadusky (Harvey Keitel), because of the robbery, they decide to hand over the treasure to go into museums and stuff, taking a cut of some of the fortune, Ian and his gang are arrested, and Ben, Abigail and Riley do good with their cuts. Also starring David Dayan Fisher as Shaw, Stewart Finlay-McLennan as Powell and Oleg Taktarov as Shippen. Cage gives a pretty good performance as the knowledgeable treasure hunter wanting to prove himself, Bean as usual makes an alright villain, Kruger is a feisty female joining in, Bartha gets some of the best moments with the one-liners, and supporting stars Keitel, Voight and Plummer do fine as well. These are the kind of films I like, where you are gripped as the characters follow the cryptic clues, and you hope that they are getting closer to what they are looking for, and you are satisfied when they do, there are exciting chases and tricky situations along the way, I guess I can see that it is not all original, but I found it intelligent enough, and I do not agree with the two out of five star rating, I found it a great fun action adventure.

The real significance of the Declaration of Independence was totally overshadowed by its representation as a secret hiding place for clues leading to a historical treasure which led to clues which led to clues ad nauseum, reminiscent of the Demons and Angels movie that was the prequel to the Da Vinci Code . Without being a spoiler I can say that many of the scenes stretched credibiity to its limit, and can only be labeled a farce . Great perhaps for the pre-high school mentality but a shame that so much money was spent on a sham of a story about our true national treasure, the Declaration of Independence."

","As with ""Ghost rider"" (also with Cage), this is a movie i watched partly with the kid and now i take the time to see it all. I loved the fast-paced beginning and the historic background: in about 40 minutes, Cage and his buddy manage to steal the most heavily guarded national treasure: Then, if the story allows us to visit some great places in Philadelphia and NY, the enigma becomes too long and complicated to be riveting. Also, the party runs after a treasure and this isn't the same emotional involvement than with ""Da Vinci"", the real inspiration for this movie. It's a Disney's feature so it's a family entertainment, thus non-religious or spiritual. Linking Templars and Freemasons is a bit loose and as the big secret, treasure, kept hidden for centuries is only material and gold, the disappointment is huge."

","I don't know how much I actually believe the whole propaganda angle for the bad reviews, I'll certainly believe the patriotic angle. I'll justify it by looking towards Indiana Jones, anyone that is around my age, a generation older or younger, got into the History/Archaeology fields because of Indiana Jones. Later you find out that it's no where near as fun as Indiana Jones would have been, but some of the mind set stays, along with ""it belongs in a museum."" Gates (Cage) and his ramblings about the D of I, no using it as a bargaining chip, that's historian at work there. Furthermore, I have a hard time believing the right wing would support a propaganda movie based on the people having more power than the government.<br/><br/>With that rant finished, when you cut out the absolutely horrible clues--the first clues meant the Founding Fathers would have had an improbable belief in improbability to use a wooden ship as a clue when the world was at war with Muslim Pirates--the history is solid both in footnote & theme. The character names relate back to American Revolution, the factoids as a whole can be used to pass a High School history test. It's only the conspiracy that gets in the way & turns it into a ridiculous film.<br/><br/>If you're into history you can sit through it for the actual factoids, if not it will be a bit painful to watch. But in any case, it wasn't made for adults. I can admit, without a single thread of guilt, that if I was eight, this movie, like so many other horrible movies I've grown out of, would have made my top ten list."

","National Treasure is a lot of things. Fun entertainment is not one of them.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage and I have a peculiar relationship. I have seen him do great work (Kick-Ass, Adaptation) and I have seen him in less than admirable roles (this movie, its sequel). He doesn't really give a *bad* performance, but he doesn't really put in a lot of effort. He rolls over the historical information sounding like a guy who's trying to sound smart but has no idea what he's talking about. And for much of the movie, he acts lazily and with low energy. His friend in this movie, played by Justin Bartha, had a far more interesting personality. He was funny and entertaining. He was easily the most charming and fun to watch actor on the screen. That almost seems like a sad commentary when one considers the other actors he's sharing the screen with, like Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, and Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>Basically, National Treasure is stupid, a poor man's Indiana Jones. The difference is that it has none of the intense action, excitement, or intelligence of an Indiana Jones movie. It has its moments, and at times is pretty fun to find out the mysteries with the lead characters. But at nearly every turn, I am going ""Oh, come on! Are we really expected to believe that our forefathers were busy with all these intricate hiding plans instead of fighting the revolution??"" Yeah, that part doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, does it? The forefathers had this *huge* treasure at their disposal and they hid it for over three hundred years instead of passing it along later?<br/><br/>The villains are generic and uninteresting, the love interest is just token, and Nicholas Cage seems bored through most of the movie. The only two actors who put forth any effort are Jon Voight and Justin Bartha. They at least acted like they were trying and that they cared. I didn't get that from anyone else. And the action scenes in this movie were borderline pathetic. What passes off as action in this movie comes off lazy, incompetent running around and chasing.<br/><br/>What made this movie worth watching once was the screenplay. Was it great? No. Was it interesting? Fairly. It did have some creativity put into it, but it would be ridiculous if it didn't. It was written by three people, which doesn't really show in the final product. But the screenplay was at least competent. Final verdict: this is not a movie I recommend. It can be fun at times, but most of the time it's just rather silly.<br/><br/>5/10"

","""Why can't they just say, 'go to this place, and here is the treasure; spend it wisely'?""<br/><br/>Let's start with the most important thing: that Riley character was extremely annoying. He's officially in my annoying character hall of fame. I don't know if be was supposed to be funny, or what, but the parts of the movie where he kept his mouth closed were my very favorites. Just had to put that out there. <br/><br/>As for the actual review, it's hardly a secret that I'm not much of a Nicholas Cage fan. His method of acting seems to be just playing the same character in nearly every movie of his that I've seen, from Gone in 60 Seconds to Ghost Rider. Needless to say, I didn't see National Treasure because of him. I did want to see more of Diane Kruger's movies, however, and the trailer made it seem like a more fun version of The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd give it a try. And that's basically what it turned out to be. It didn't change my opinion of Mr. Cage's acting skills, but I liked it. <br/><br/>National Treasure is a combination of a heist film, an adventure film, and a historical mystery, wrapped in a friendly, summer blockbuster wrapper. It moves along quite quickly, and stays fairly interesting (as well as slightly predictable) from beginning to end. Lots of conspiracy threads about the nation's founders and the Freemasons are drawn together in a way that would make Dan Brown proud, but it never suffers from the forced grasps at importance that the two Robert Langdon movies have unfortunately buckled under. If you're looking for a family-friendly adventure movie that gives history a fantastical spin, you could do a lot worse than National Treasure."

","Film critics are good because they let us know which movies are good (like ""Saving Private Ryan"") and which are bad (like ""Norbit""). However, sometimes they take the term ""criticism"" a little too much to heart. That's why many claim that critics only like weird art-house movies and trash everything Hollywood puts out. Granted, many of the former are good films that are worth seeing (and some Hollywood movies really are complete crap), but critics sometimes forget who their audience is. Most people who go to the movies just want to sit back, relax and be entertained.<br/><br/>No one understands this better than producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer is one of the must successful movie producers alive and whose films have raked in billions. None of his movies have had deep drama, but they all have what the average moviegoer wants: great action and an engaging story. ""National Treasure"" is no different.<br/><br/>Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) is a man on a mission. He has been handed a clue that has been passed down through generations of his family, and is said to lead to treasure of untold value. But no one has been able to find it, and his family name has been met with ridicule because of it. Now, with the help of his friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and a pretty historian named Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), he's determined to get it. Trouble is, his former partner (and financier), Ian (Sean Bean) is on his trail, and unlike Ben, he's willing to kill to get the the treasure. Oh yeah, the FBI is after him too.<br/><br/>Yes, this is all completely silly and ridiculous, and the plot resembles a wall after a gunfight. But the plot holes are so well-camouflaged that you won't find them unless you're actively looking for them, and since the film is so fun and engaging, you won't want to.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor. He plays Ben in his usual off-the-wall manner, but he imbues the character with such earnestness that it's impossible not to root for him. Justin Bartha provides solid comic relief as Ben's sidekick, Riley, and Diane Kruger is not only beautiful, but also a talented actress; two welcome characteristics for the part of the historian who gets drawn into this treasure hunt. Sean Bean makes for a good villain, and Harvey Keitel is good as the FBI agent on their trail. Brief appearances by Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer are also on hand.<br/><br/>Jon Turtletaub keeps things moving at a relentless pace, and that increases the fun and the suspense. Things never slow down for long, and certainly not long enough to really catch your breath. What's surprising is that a movie with this much excitement is entirely suitable for the whole family; few movies can make that claim.<br/><br/>It's not great art, but it's not meant to be.

","The story - about a secret treasure whose location is revealed in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence - is kind of silly, the concept of actually being able to steal the Declaration of Independence stretches credibility, and the basic plot outlining the finding of clue after clue (Ben's father is convinced that there is no treasure - just one clue after another to confuse the British at the time of the Revolution) gets confusing at times. With the Knights Templar and the Freemasons somehow woven into the storyline there's also a hint of a conspiracy theory - although Ben insists that there is no conspiracy theory. Having said all that, this movie is fast paced, a lot of fun and - if one can suspend the disbelief that some of the above points encourage - actually quite suspenseful at times. In other words, it's a pretty good ride! <br/><br/>For whatever reason, I sat down to watch this with low expectations and I emerged as a fan - enough of a fan that I'll probably pick up the sequel. Nicholas Cage was very good as Ben Gates, obsessed with finding this treasure ever since his grandfather told him the story many years before. The rest of the cast was, in all honesty, less convincing (and Abigail, played by Diane Kruger, wasn't an entirely credible character, fell in far too quickly with Gates and was obviously there only to provide the requisite romance.) Still, if you like a good family-friendly action/suspense movie with a bit of humour thrown in, you'll probably see this as a winner. 8/10"

","Some may think Nicholas Cage is an untalented actor. And i must say if you think he's a bad actor after seeing this movie you don't know talented acting when you see it. I Didn't understand the plot, but this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made nevertheless. Why did he have too steal the paper, i may never know. I must say this is Nicholas best film since Ghostrider. Even though this movie is clearly a ripoff of the Da Vinci code it was still mildly entertaining. I think its a big plus that there were no women in the big roles for this movie, as women has no place in movies. And i didn't like that Nicholas Cages character died in the end. I think they could have given Tom Cruise a bigger role in the movie then he had. The glasses he had to wear too read the paper made no sense. And for the record light years measures time and not speed. But the movie was very good for its target audience (black people)."
"tomimt","6","0","3","18 February 2008"," Not original, but decent way to spent a couple of hours
","National Treasure tries its best in two different fields: firstly it tries to be modern Indiana Jones type of an action/adventure film and secondly it tries to cash in with the conspiracy theories about free masons once again popularized by Da Vinci Code. On those both fields the film succeeds better than most combatants.<br/><br/>Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) is a treasure hunter after, just like his father and grand father and so on, the biggest treasure of all time: the famed booty of the templars. Ian Howe (Sean Bean) is after the same thing, but he's more savage about his mission, so he's the bad treasure hunter. After Ben and Ian learn, that the map to the treasure is behind one certain piece of paper, that lies heavily guarded in one heavily guarded museum, starts the race of a man, who want's to keep that paper in tact and one who's willing to destroy the paper to get the map.<br/><br/>Even tough the movie isn't spoiled with too much originality, a lot is saved by good direction and a great cast, including Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight just to name few. Cage is his usual self, a bit wooden, but out of the treasure hunters Bean, just like he often does, steal all the screen time they share together.<br/><br/>So if you are willing to forgive some astonishing leaps of logic and relatively cheesy plot, I see no reason why this wouldn't pass for a decent way top spend a couple of hours. I certainly was a bit surprised of how well this worked in the end."

","As a boy, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage) hears the story of a mysterious treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers from his grandpa (Christopher Plummer), and devotes his life to finding it. There are clues all over the world, which seem to lead to nothing but more clues, and his dad, Patrick (Jon Voight), urges him to give up. Benjamin and his techie sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) realize that the next clue is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and end up stealing it. Enlisting the very reluctant help of Patrick and lovely scientist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Ben seeks to find the treasure while being pursued by treacherous partner Ian (Sean Bean) and a cynical FBI Agent (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" is a film which is enjoyable for reasons that can't be fully explained. On the face of it, I should find it an inescapably stupid film, which uses the fig leaf of history to cover up a shallow, crass, sub-Indiana Jones adventure film. And yet, I find myself amused by this movie, and it's definitely worth a look if you're not expecting anything profound.<br/><br/>Part of the appeal of these films is their very ridiculousness. The Freemasons and Illuminati have been the target of conspiracy-mongering and pop culture for years, but in this film we are treated to conspiracies and profundities undreamed of by even L. Fletcher Prouty. That the Founding Fathers would go to such immense trouble to hide such a HUGE treasure and then leave clues behind, scattered all over the world in extremely remote and unconnected places, only findable by Nicholas Cage is about as incredible as you can get. And yet, who cares? As second-rate pastiches of Indiana Jones, they could be a lot worse (especially considering that, as enjoyable as they are, the Indy films aren't particularly deep or plausible either). These movies aren't designed as anything deep, but rather, as something that will keep you entertained and then disappear from your mind until your next viewing.<br/><br/>The direction by Jon Turtletaub is thoroughly competent, a back-handed complement if there ever was one. The use of locations is something short of ingenious. The screenplay provides some good dialogue even if the story is literally all over the place. The action scenes are very curious; they're G-rated scenes actually, and even with guns going off and punches being exchanged, no one actually gets killed by violence throughout the whole film. As such they lack any real power, and yet manage to be compelling in a strange way.<br/><br/>The acting in these films is besides the point. Everyone is having a fun time and create passably likable ciphers. Nicholas Cage is well-cast in the lead, while Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha contribute pleasant if slight characters in support. Sean Bean seems to be the only one giving a performance, while Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, and Harvey Keitel are clearly along for the ride. But in a film like this, no one's expecting the Royal Shakespeare Company.<br/><br/>So, in short, ""National Treasure"" is a watchable, reasonably entertaining action/adventure film if you can put your brain on hold for its run time. Just sit back and enjoy the fun.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Well, after seeing the trailer of the second movie National Treasure: The book of Secrets, I watched this one at home. I really like to watch movies about conspiracies and treasure hunting with clues and things (like Da Vinci Code). While watching it I could really feel the tension of how they are chased by the ""bad guys"". The story kept me glued to the TV until the end, and the pace was good enough. The characters are worked out quite well, but you won't see any background info of them (except Ben Gates). In the end, they ""bad guys"" were quite stupid to believe them with the last clue.

","National Treasure is both smart and action packed. Yes it may be used to teach kids History but it actually works. You feel almost as if you are participating in the puzzles with the characters. The Masons and Templar treasure was nice treasure choice. Ben Gates is pretty cool and Riley makes you laugh while you go on the roller coaster ride. Overall, it's very enjoyable though it has flaws such as sometimes being far fetched but I like some of that in an adventure. Oh, and the bad guy is pretty evil. National Treasure is a heist, adventure/action movie that should keep you guessing and involved with the story until the end. I love movies that can make you see something extraordinary out of something ordinary and that's what National Treasure does and does it well. Jon Turtletaub I give you kudos for making a movie though fast and kinetic felt very down to earth and easy to follow. 8/10! Great good fun!"

I figured I wouldn't like the movie much because it's not what I usually watch. I was so wrong. I was on the edge of my seat during this awesome, action-packed movie. I enjoyed the big explosion at the beginning when they were looking for the treasure on The Charlotte. I loved how Riley was really funny and how amazingly huge that treasure room was. This movie is an awesome movie you can take the whole family to see and it won't be too boring or stupid. I recommend this movie to people who like humor, action, historical fiction, and slight romance.

It's boyish adventure movie, feeling influenced by both Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code. It's action-packed, filled with good jokes and the sets are absolutely stunning. It does feel a bit too political correct at times, how different than the grumpy bastard that my all-time hero Indiana Jones was.

However, several of my friends have told me that they don't like the movie because the plot confuses them. This is not true. Yes, you have to follow the movie (i.e. you can't get up and come back 20 minutes later and expect to know what's going on), but you don't have to actually concentrate on the concept of the movie. The plot is very well defined. In short, this movie has great action, a good plot, it's historical (although slightly fictionalized), and it has excellent music! A general thumbs-up for all ages."
"erin1504","7","0","2","31 October 2007"," National Treasure
","Fasten your seat belt, the film National Treasure, is a real ride through time and history! Produced and directed by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub, this film takes many twists and turns in trying to unravel the mystery of the a hidden secret kept through a family that dates back to the Knights of Templar. Partially ripped off from the best selling book, The Davinci Code, this movie takes an ordinary man, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), who finds out that his family has an extraordinary secret. Being the only one in his family besides his grandfather to believe in the fact that there is a secret to be revealed, Gates pursues the answer for most of his adult life. It was believed that the Knights of Templar were hiding a vast treasure which was passed on to be hidden by the Masons or in this case, the founding fathers of America. Benjamin is first introduced to this secret, when his grandfather, Patrick Henry Gates (Christopher Plummer), handed down to him a piece of the puzzle which is believed to be a clue in finding the treasure. This piece was handed down through the Gates family from Charles Carroll who was the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. The first clue states that the ""secret lies with Charlotte"". This greatly puzzles Gates, but he remembers through history an event of an expedition with a ship named Charlotte. After many years of searching, he discovers the Charlotte, and clues aboard the ship lead him to believe that clues are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence. After thought, Gates decides to steal the Declaration of Independence in order to continue his quest for the treasure. While stealing the document, he meets a National Archivist (Diane Kruger) who insists they team up to keep it away from the villain figure (Sean Bean), and so she can insure the safety of the document. They become close through out the film creating a romantic side story. Many chases and close calls occur throughout the film, but somehow, Gates always manages to get away and find a new clue that all have to do with something historically within United States History. Being close to discovering the secret his father who did not believe is now convinced to join in. Eventually, they find themselves in a mine shaft beneath a church tomb and the clues do lead to a treasure, but there are still some questions unanswered. The heroes in this film are put through many tests. All of the elements to a great film are in this movie plot: action, adventure, speculation and a love story, but I it is not played out as well as I would have hoped. Having seen The Davinci Code, it is too much alike and not as believable. The search for the Holy Grail is one thing that is more realistic than finding invisible writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence that was stolen and then discovering a massive treasure. Overall the movie is well thought out and all of the elements help to create flow to the plot line. The actors/actresses were adequate and, I thought, well cast for the roles. Nicolas Cage, I would not have pictured in this film, but he did a great job fulfilling the role. This film is one that I would recommend for younger children and young adults who like the mystery sort of film. There is a sequel that will be coming out in December of this year and hopefully it will be just as good, but a little bit more believable."

","Research. Plot. Understand. Decipher. Listen. FULL SPEED AHEAD! That is the style of this movie, which is truly one of the greatest caper movies of all time. For all of you out there who have not yet seen this movie, it is about Ben Gates, played by Nicolas Cage in a winning performance as a treasure hunter who is seeking a treasure beyond all of his dreams, imaginations, and thoughts, a treasure that has been hidden for centuries. But there is one problem: the clue to finding the treasure is on the back of the Declaration of Independence- but in invisible ink! The plot carries its own weight from there on. Nicolas Cage is the hero, Justin Bartha is the weird geek along for comedic relief, Diane Kruger is the very attractive female counterpart to Gates, Voight is the never believing father, Mr. Gates, Keitel is the detective who is determined to make sure that somebody goes to jail for this whole mess, Bean is Ian who was once Gates friend, but, because of greed, he becomes the badguy not long after the movie has started. The viewer, when first watching this movie, may think that Bean is at a disadvantage, since he has ditched Gates and Riley. But not so. Bean is very smart in his own inventive and original way. However, he is not as smart as Gates. That is why Gates is always one step ahead of him. Sure, this movie does have clichés, but who cares? I do not think it is a copy off of the Da Vinci Code or Indiana Jones. Something cannot be called a copy off of something else just because they have some things in common with each other. Those things are similarities, not copies. Besides, even if the similarities are too good to be true, I do not mind. The reason for this is that as long as a movie is good and can hold my attention, I will suspend my disbelief and act like the similarities are not even there. After a while, I forget all about the similarities and clichés, and just sit down and watch a good action/adventure movie."

I had seen the movie promoted on Disney Channel (my little brother's favorite channel, it's almost always on at home) and racked it up to be just another cheesy kid flick that was hardly worth my time.<br/><br/>When the movie finished, I was a bit dazed, because I wondered how it ended so fast. Hadn't I just started it? This rarely happens to me, when watching a movie. What can I say? I'm a hyperactive, distracted kind of girl and even if a movie is well done, I usually find myself checking the clock at some point during the film's run, but not with National Treasure. This little ""Disney kid flick"", what I had assumed it to be, had taken my entire focus and attention, and I wasn't even aware it had.<br/><br/>National Treasure has a strong cast that click, and a plot threaded with history without feeling, even remotely, like some afternoon educational PBS program. The movie takes on action, partnered with suspense, and even a little romance, for a ride that will keep the viewer guessing until the end. (At least it did for me; and this is coming from someone who usually spots predictable plots from the movie's trailer).<br/><br/>Rare is the action/suspense film that doesn't have at least a PG-13 rating, if not an R rating.

Is it a ridiculous idea for a HUGE treasure to be hidden by some of America's greatest historical figures? You bet. But, that's the concept of treasure-hunting films. The prizes are supposed to be massive, unbelievable amounts of wealth. That's the point of being a ""treasure"".<br/><br/>What makes this film so much fun, is how they've taken commonly seen US historical items and places, and turned them into pieces to the big puzzle.

","""National Treasure"" is the kind of movie that made movie-goers (at least this one) think of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and it presaged ""The Da Vinci Code"" by a year. If you haven't seen this before, here's the story; it's not easy, and it's convoluted (with a potential for spoilers, so be prepared). The last living signer of the Declaration of Independence is dying, and he tries to get to Washington to see the President, but it's raining, it's late, Andrew Jackson is out somewhere, and Thomas Carroll tells his coach-tiger, a boy named Thomas Gates, a secret about the Templars' treasure that the Masons hid in the New World. For nearly 200 years, descendants of Gates have tried to find the mythical, disbelieved treasure, and failed in their attempts.<br/><br/>Fast forward to now, and Benjamin Franklin Gates (played by Nicolas Cage, who looks *much* better than Bill Gates) is on the trail of the ship Charlotte, in the frozen wastes of the Arctic somewhere, with a shifty 'philanthropist' named Ian Howe (played by Sean Bean). They find the Charlotte frozen in the ice, then Ian double-crosses Ben and his geek assistant, Riley.<br/><br/>After that, it's a roller-coaster ride to Washington, D.C., in a futile attempt to convince authorities that the Declaration of Independence is at risk. Ben decides to steal the Declaration to keep Ian from stealing and destroying it in his desire for treasure. It highlights the differences between ""hunters"" (Ian and his thugs) and ""gatherers"" (Ben and Riley, later with Abigail): Ian goes in with chains, explosives, drills, saws, tasers, guns--he has no respect for property, life, or history and context. Ben and Riley use their brains: plans, fake i.d., wireless communications, an understanding of the historic value of the Declaration, sleight of hand (a copy of the Declaration), heroic values (Ben rescues Abigail from Ian and thugs after they kidnap her).<br/><br/>From Washington, after Ben and Abigail discover a significant clue on the back of the Declaration (and bring Ben's father into this mess), the action moves to Philadelphia; our heroes are chased by the FBI, Ben is caught, Abigail and Riley make a deal with Ian; we end with all the major players in New York City. Ian doesn't play fair and drags Ben's dad into the mix--and now for something completely different!--we fall into an 'Indiana Jones' movie, which is not a bad thing in this case, actually. And to learn if they find anything, and what they find if they do, you'll just have to rent this little gem and find out.<br/><br/>Did the Templars and FreeMasons have an ancient treasure they hid in the New World? Probably not, but dang, you'll want it to be true after watching this movie! Diane Kruger is feisty and elegant as Abigail Chase, the director of the National Archives. I'd be happy if Nicolas Cage cranked out a goofily romantic comedy every year, because he does it (goofy and romantic) so well (even in ""Ghost Rider""). Diane and Nick reminded me a bit of Kate Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart in ""The Philadelphia Story"" (hmmm...); but she doesn't have the forcefulness or dramatic 'weight' Katherine Hepburn had, so maybe they're channeling Grace Kelly and Cary Grant from ""To Catch a Thief"" (that's good, Cary Grant was in ""Philadelphia Story"" too).<br/><br/>Everyone complains about sequels, but this is the kind of movie I'd like to see a sequel to--adventure with no gratuitous violence, a hint of romance with no obvious sex, and 'positive' values (respect for history--heck, just plain respect). Throw in historic locations and stirring 'national monument' theme music (think John Williams when he was at the Boston Pops), and you get a fun, surprising, and thoughtful adventure movie."

Yes, we learn a lot of this in school during history class, but at that age, are we really truly interested in it? Probably not."

","I was actually pleasantly surprised with this movie. After just one viewing, I'm forced to admit that you'd really be hard pressed to have a real problem with National Treasure. I really cannot stand Nicolas Cage generally speaking, and the same goes for producer Jerry Bruckheimer. But in this case, they managed to come up with an entertaining, yet informative film, that actually managed to be rife with American history lessons & pro-American sentiment, without being intensely sappy and cloying. Perhaps even more surprising was the fact that they kept the violence and death in the film to a minimum. As a result, families could actually watch this movie without the kids getting inundated with killing and gore. Of course, those same kids will get their daily dosage of that when they go home that night and watch CSI, but that's not the point. At least this film isn't part of that problem. <br/><br/>I guess for me, another appealing aspect of this movie was the fact that it gave me a good feeling regarding my country for a change. In my opinion, our country's leadership today is a cruel joke. So to have a film that takes us on a look back at the great & unique achievements of leaders like Franklyn, Washington, Jefferson, & Madison, that was kinda cool. <br/><br/>Even though National Treasure was only intended to be an entertaining summer popcorn flick, I feel that it was still impressive in its ability to teach us about our country's past & wrap that into a vibrant action movie that could be equally good as a family outing or a date movie. Check it out."

","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) shows up at his father's doorstep in the middle of the night with a nondescript blonde (Diane Kruger) by his side. Gates (Jon Voight) hasn't seen his son in ages, so naturally he thinks junior is in trouble. More specifically, he assumes Ben has knocked up nondescript blondie and isn't ready for the whole family thing. Old man Gates readily offers to help out with abortion funding. Says nondescript blondie, checking her silhouette with a troubled look on her face: ""Do I look pregnant?"" It is this moment, and this line, courtesy of Jim Kouf, that Diane Kruger will be remembered for. That being said, she is about as believable as a scientist as Dr. Christmas Jones in ""T.W.I.N.E."", but at least Denise Richards looked hot in her desert boots. The rest of the movie is a surprisingly engaging blend of conspiracy thriller, action flic, and road movie. Cage comes across as a nerdy Indiana Jones type, fun to watch on his quest for the Mayflower's lost cargo."

","Despite the many critics, I personally enjoyed this film. It is a packed with action, a full-of-wits kind of race. It's the perfect break from a stressful week at work for me. Unlike what I expected, it was not so much of the serious I-must-find-the-treasure sort of film, partly thanks to Riley Poole who always manages to lighten up the atmosphere with his clever lines. Also, it was fascinating how the whole plot seems to click together, from the Charlotte to the Trinity Church. Many had thought that it was rather far-fetched. I agree. Well, who could get the answer to the Charlotte's riddle in a matter of minutes? You can't expect the Declaration of Independence to be stolen that easily. However, we can't expect a thriller about treasure hunting to be 100% credible either, can we? Basically, I guess the good guys are witty enough and the bad guys are crafty enough to make this whole treasure-hunting race exciting. Well, if you overlook those unbelievable details of the film, it makes a really exciting adventure."

","Fans of the ""historical treasure hunt"" genre will undoubtedly note similarities to Indiana Jones, however, the way National Treasure refers to its venerable ancestor feels like a tribute, rather than a poor attempt at credibility or plot borrowing. The best part of this film are the characters. Aside from the bad guys, the characters feel quite natural - each with his/her idiosyncrasies, but not so much stereotyped that the character didn't seem real. The dialogue is a bit hammy every now and then, but not bad; the hamminess is tolerable given how clever the dialogue is otherwise. The characters' lines, in fact, their actions, not only do the job of moving the script along, but also implicitly help to make clear their intentions, and how they perceive the intentions of the others.<br/><br/>All in all, very well done!"

","I heard big things about this movie from the get-go, and I must say that most of those things are right. When Jerry Brickheimer started producing films for Disney, I began to wonder why. But in the end, it looks like a good marriage. To date, the Bruckheimer/Disney team seems to fare pretty well, and ""National Treasure"" is a testament to that union.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, with Jon Voight playing his father, Patrick Henry Gates. And Christopher Plummer makes a brief appearance as Ben's grandfather, John Adams Gates (do you see a pattern here?). Okay, enough about the Gates family. I thought it was an interesting way to present the Gates family and their ties to American history.<br/><br/>The whole movie centers around the Declaration of Independence, on the back of which lays the final clue for the secret location of the legendary Treasure of the Knights Templar. Early in the film, Gates leads a party to a clue that points to the Declaration, and some of that party, lead by the ""questionably legal"" Ian Howe (Sean Bean), split off. From this moment, the chase is on.<br/><br/>Gates and his assistant, the eager Rigley Poole (Justin Bartha) try to warn authorities, but all of them, including archivist Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), laugh them off. At this point, any further plot points may be considered spoilers for those who haven't seen this movie yet, so I will stop here.<br/><br/>For the most part, the performances were pretty good, though I did have a hard time believing Jon Voight as 30 years younger in the opening scene, which takes place in 1974. The wig and make-up he wore didn't help much, either (It's almost as bad as that awful get-up he wore as Howard Cosell in ""Ali"").<br/><br/>I did enjoy the action scenes for the most part. There were a couple of chase-scene clichés thrown in, but they still worked. And for those of you who wonder if your child can watch this movie, it's okay, trust me. The creepiness factor is at most moderate (a few brief glimpses of long-dead bodies), there is some gun-play (but only from the bad guys, and no one gets hurt), only one person dies (off-camera), and I can recall maybe one or two (very) mild profanities. Besides, it's a PG-rated Disney film.<br/><br/>One thing I can say about this movie is that it is somewhat reminiscent of action films of the late-1940s and early-1950s. This is an enjoyable family-friendly movie, and it will entertain you and make you think (but not too much)."

The rest of the cast was also excellent, although I would like to have seen a bit more of Christopher Plummer in the film.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>When I was going to see this movie I was expecting it to be really cheesy and stupid. When I went into the theater there were not a lot of people there, but I was impressed with this movie. The acting was good, it had very well-done action scenes, and it had good music. The only thing is that the plot may be too complicated for younger children, not to mention older children.<br/><br/>I'm going to give the plot as best as I can. A man named Ben Gates wants to find a treasure hidden by the Freemasons. He finds out there is a map leading to the treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence. His friend Ian wants to steal it, but Ben doesn't. Then Ian tries to steal it. Ben says that the only way to protect the Declaration is to steal it. Ben then takes it. He and his friend Riley take Abigail Chase with them to Ben's dad's house for they need the Silence Dogood letters because his dad owns them. He gave them away. Ben gets clues to the treasure, including Ben Franklin's glasses to see the map on the back of the Declaration. Then Ian gets the Declaration away from Ben. They go to underground to the treasure. When Ben says he isn't sure if it is their Ian leaves him and Riley and Chase. Then they find the treasure but Ben is arrested for stealing it. He says that Ian was stealing it and Ian is arrested and Ben doesn't go to jail. Confusing, isn't it?<br/><br/>Overall, I was very impressed by this film. It was a great film that a lot of people can enjoy. I was really excited when I found out that Jerry Bruckheimer produced it, because he produced Pirates of the Caribbean. Anyway, the is a great film. Some of the scenes are a little too much like Raiders of the Lost Ark, though.

","Very similar in its subject to ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006), ""National Treasure"" solved all the clues and did it with humor, great pace, and style. Its genre is defined as Action / Adventure / Drama / Mystery / Thriller but it is also one of the best comedies of 2004 and loads of fun. I liked it from the beginning but when Harvey Keitel showed up in the middle of the movie and stayed, I knew it would be even better. Comparing to DVC, NT did not try hard not to offend anyone and got away with the ridiculous holes in the plot and a bit overlong final part. It is funny, thrilling, and does exactly what is supposed to - entertains. I only hope that they will not make any sequels to it - sequels don't work as a rule."
"gus120970","7","0","3","28 November 2006"," Da Vinci in da U.S.A
","National Treasure is so obviously inspired by the puzzle caper thriller phenomenon that was The Da Vinci Code, but without the main problems that would (and did) affect its reception in the Mid West: setting most of the story in cheese-eating surrender monkey land (France) and aggravating the god-botherers with various heresies about the Christian Church. But you know what, it's a much better movie because it knows its purpose is to entertain, not necessarily to reveal the supposed greatest cover up in human history. Nicholas Cage once again plays his reluctant, slightly unattractive but surprisingly adept action hero as he aims to convince the authorities that someone will be able to steal the 1776 American Declaration of Independence by, well, stealing the Declaration of Independence.<br/><br/>It's after this heist that the pace takes off. Cage has to stay one step ahead of the British, neatly echoing the root of the story, deliciously played as a bunch of working class English thugs led by Sean Bean, and also the law.<br/><br/>The chase leads the characters through a Da Vinci esquire series of codes, cyphers, secret passages and famous (to Americans at least) locations, with a smattering of real and imagined history. Curious to see the freemasons for once depicted as chivalrous heroes rather than a shifty bunch of overweight glad-handing businessmen.<br/><br/>Of course the delicious irony in this is that the treasure is not hidden on the back of the Declaration, it IS the declaration - the jewel of the 18th century Enlightenment, the spark that ignited the lamps of rationality, democracy, the division of powers and a secular state. The Declaration is America's great gift to humanity, and the story that the country 'without history' could also be hoarding a great stash of antiquity too is a delightful and enjoyable fantasy."

","Every decade or so they get one of these hunt & chase movies right. Cage, Kruger and Bartha track down stupendous treasure based on clues laid out by founding fathers. Keitel threatens to arrest Cage while Bean and his cronies are on Nick's trail with more evil intentions. Most of the clues are contained in or on national landmarks which means some good action scenes in the vicinity of famous places. I'm not saying this is foolproof stuff but it's plausible enough that if I want to pretend it's real I can live with myself. And if you like American history it's a blast. I've never been much of a Cage guy but his style finds a very comfortable home in this one. The interaction between our heroes is fun to watch, including Voight as Cage's skeptical old man, and Bean does well on the dark side. A more cerebral, US-based Raiders of the Lost Ark, certainly no less believable. Highly recommended."

","It has to be said - NATIONAL TREASURE is not the fastest, cleverest or most high concept action/mystery you will ever see. The actual quest for the treasure is propelled by clues that alternate between being so simple a ten year old could figure them out, and being so obscure, the characters only solve them because the scriptwriters already knew the answer.<br/><br/>But that doesn't really matter as the film is immensely entertaining. Cage, Kruger and Bartha are likable leads, though Sean Bean is a rather bland and ineffectual villain. Which is odd, because I think Bean is a terrific actor. True, his Hollywood efforts have been less than spectacular (as someone has already observed here), but you only have to watch one of his SHARPE TV movies to realise what an effective screen actor he can be given the right material.<br/><br/>However, I would like to take some of the reviewers to task over their assertion that NATIONAL TREASURE mines the same story veins as hackmeister Dan Brown's books. Because I have read more types of books than cheesy supermarket paperbacks, I know that Dan Brown has cynically plundered the work of others in constructing his ""novels"". So if you really want to know more about the role of the Templars and the Masons in the setting up of the New World Order (Google it, folks and see that Dan Brown didn't invent this stuff!) then you should take a look at the works of others who explore this alternative version of history.<br/><br/>Particularly recommended are the books of Lomas and Knight, ""The Hiram Key"" and ""The Second Messiah"" and 1975's raucously enjoyable ""Illuminatus Trilogy"" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.<br/><br/>One slight niggle I have with NT is that I found it hard to accept that the Templar Treasure was so bulky, and that it was still in its hiding place. My own belief is that the treasure of the Templars was more along the lines of knowledge than of gold (there's a nod to this in the movie when Abigail discovers some scrolls from the Library of Alexandria in the treasure room) and it was this knowledge that led to the Templars being rounded up and burnt as heretics in 1314.<br/><br/>So, while NATIONAL TREASURE is an entertaining action adventure which scratches the surface of the true history of the US and utilises fragments to construct its workman-like plot, there is a good deal more to all this than the movie would have you believe.<br/><br/>Go! Read! Discover the background for yourself. You'll be amazed."

","Don't expect anything outstanding about this film though. While it may seem a bit high end at first glance, by no means is it as face paced and action filled as it looks. NT is mostly an adventure film with some good ideas, a standard break-in, some puzzle solving, the standard villain and a good performance by Nicholas Cage and some other characters. The weakest part is probably the writing and performance concerning the bad guys who completely fail to make you fear them or hate them, yet at the same time, do not make you like them either. They came out as quite impotent. The FBI are also portrayed as a bit cruel and incompetent but they suddenly get super generous when the treasure is found. I was actually not expecting an actual treasure and this movie did surprise me in that regard. While this is not Nicholas Cage's better movies, his performance is still top notch."

","I'm not a big fan of history, but this movie caught my eye. As I watched it, I thought, ""Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen."" It would take you places, like a really good book that you can't put down. It's sort of like an Indiana Jones movie; it's full of action, suspense, and excitement, and it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, eager to see what will happen next. Also, Nicolas Cage did an absolutely fantastic job being Ben Gates. He did so well, that I'm looking forward to seeing some other movies that he starred in. This movie was definitely a thrilling adventure for me, and I ended up making it my favorite movie ever. But I would not recommend it for young children (8 years or under) to watch, because some action violence occurs in a few scenes. However, for anyone else, I'm sure it will be the treasure hunt of a lifetime."
"kitchen-9","8","0","1","14 July 2006"," While You Were Falsely Accusing Me, I Found A National Treasure
","My name is Collin and I enjoyed the movie National Treasure. It had action, romance, comedy, history, and puzzles all rolled into one. You may think this is a review of National Treasure, but really I want John Turteltaub to know that because I enjoyed both While You Were Sleeping (best Sandra Bullock film ever) and National Treasure, I have an idea for his film after his next film (since NT2 is in pre-production). This is a true story about a woman who used to love me, but I was in love with her friend and roommate at the time. By the time I fell out of love with her friend and roommate and then fell in love with her, she believed I was stalking her. Of course, I was in San Diego and she was in Rohnert Park (near Santa Rosa). That alone is not stalking. Needless to say, she took me to court in 1996, tried to take me to court in 2001 (but failed), and took me to court in 2004 (again). I had to take a restraining order I didn't deserve because I had wanted to invite her to my wedding (which happened a week and a half after that 04 court date). Well, this story would be about my innocence of course and trying to make the woman who falsely accused me feel better and not as afraid. It would also be about how I met the woman who became my wife (who I just happened to meet on the birthday of the woman who falsely accused me - Nov. 28, 1995). Did I mention they were in the same chorus class and worked at the same exact Montessori school at separate times? There are plenty of other coincidences and there is romance and intrigue as well. Think of this idea as a mystery where romance is the payoff. Sadness is unfortunately a side effect because my rights were not given and the woman who falsely accused me is still out there, afraid of someone who was never out to get her in the first place. They say there is what she said and what he said, but if he has hard evidence to prove everything he is saying, then he said would obviously win over. The problem is I do have a conscience and wanted mediation with the woman. The idea is not to win over her, but to allow her to see that she has been thinking about me a certain way that is false. This allows me to move on with my life and not have the law involved. It also allows her to move on with her life and be less afraid of me. The fact that the woman who I was to marry did so a week and a half after this case alone proves I am innocent. I really don't think a woman would marry me if she thought I was stalking somebody else. I wish the legal system could see that, but they are not always doing their job the way they should be. They are sometimes adding to the problem. This movie would be for all those who have been falsely accused and were given the chance to prove otherwise. The National Treasure here is not gold or a painting, but it is the woman I married, and of course it is the soul. Pertaining to the Sandra Bullock film, I feel like I too have been in a coma for the last two years. This coma is having to live a life where there are perceptions about me that are false versus who I really am (and trying to prove that to others). I may be awake, but I can't get a good night's sleep without the chance to make things right. Hopefully you will read this John and realize you could have an action packed thriller with heart on your hands. Did I mention I have also been a very active person in life (Martial Arts, Mountain Climbing, Snowboarding, Skateboarding, Volleyball, Boy Scouts, Writing, etc.)?<br/><br/>Sincerely, Collin"

","Okay guys here is a point that seems to be missed in every other post....<br/><br/>Ben and the others were in that massive treasure room for what, like a few minutes at most. Even if an hour or two or three or four Ben would never be able to come up with a true est. There was a lot of stuff down there. And oh my god, what about those scrolls!!!! You all know that just that piece of the full treasure would go for millions upon millions. Let's look at it this way. Here is a simple way to put it, Ben's 10 billion dollar bribe was tongue in cheek, an attempt at humor, playing off the whole finders keepers (even though Ben stole one of the most prized pieces of US History) idea. At the end when Riley is angered about the 1 percent we are led to assume it was of the 10 billion jokey dollar amount Ben gave. After a true evaluation of all the History was done the real amount would be given and I would say that they were getting 1 percent of double that 10 billion.<br/><br/>But hey, that is just my opinion.<br/><br/>PS. Ian would keep 10 Percent if offered (maybe figure a way to keep it all even, but think about it, he would have never been able to keep the extraction or the sale or the massive increase in Ian expenditures a secret) That is the sort of person Ian was Ben was a PhD. in what History and something from MIT. But most important he obviously loved US history and felt the founding fathers were onto something with the whole let the people choose thing. So if his main goal was to find the History the finders fee is relatively unimportant to Ben.<br/><br/>So look, read, and comment on this post. Especially the 10 billion part."
"dy158","8","0","1","2 July 2006"," Endless adventure indeed!
","I realised that this movie was released two years back. The freaky thing is that, Dan Brown's Angels & Demons came out on in 2001. I have to admit only after reading that book recently, I then only know about the Illuminanti and the Masons. Those two groups were mentioned in that book.<br/><br/>So imagine I was gasping away when those various references to the Masons showed up as I saw this movie on the cable. I am do aware of the Mason's probable role which led to the independence of the USA, because that mention first came out on Angels & Demons. I knew it was somewhere in there. The Knights Templar mention in this movie also almost got me gasping because to admit again, I am only aware of that after reading - The Da Vinci Code. Yes.<br/><br/>So, this movie first started in the year of 1974 and a young Benjamin Franklin Gates accidentally found something which led to his grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer) to tell him not to look at those documents. John Gates then tell the story of their ancestors' role in the founding of the independent America. But the thing is, John's grandfather's life was counted and so he only left behind a code. Clearly when Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) saw that his father is telling that to his son, he was not pleased. But that does not stop the young Ben from really finding out what was the treasure is.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present day. The now adult Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is travelling with his friends to the Arctic in hoping of searching the clue which his grandfather had told him when he was young. And when they did, Benjamin realised one of his friends Ian is also wanting to steal one of the most important documents in the history of America - The Declaration of Independence. It's what Benjamin, who is part of the famous Gates family, who wanted it first.<br/><br/>But there is a catch. The Declaration Of Independence is highly guarded. So this led to endless chases from the police and even the friend who turned against Benjamin - Ian. With the help of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Benjamin and everyone else included (even the father Patrick eventually) started to search from one clue to another, bringing them to various places throughout the country.<br/><br/>The endless adventure and non-stop fun and history (I am a little history buff at times) were what left me enthralled and speechless. Almost something like out of The Da Vinci Code (that book came out in 2003) but not really the case, it almost left me breathless. Maybe given I did read Angels & Demons and it's where I only began to know about the real existence of the Masons, whatever this movie might had mentioned, it always brought me back to the time when I read that book.<br/><br/>Adventure is the key to this movie and if anyone likes it, it's a good recommendation."

","I saw this movie in theaters more than once. I have to say it kind of seemed a combination of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the The Black Peril. I wish their was more action with Nicolas Cage beating up the bad guys. But he seems to use his wits to outsmart the bad guys then take them on in a fight. Nicolas Cage plays the hero very well. Sean Bean continues to prove that he can play the villain great. I remember him as the main villain in GoldenEye. So if you like Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean you should see this movie. The music near is one best with what finally happens. It is one of the movies that I never I get tired of watching."

","In nowadays movies, movie producers focus too much into the action, rather than actually making the ""MOVIE."" People read books, watch TV, and read newspaper, are all do for one simple purpose, which is to know the STORY. And shouldn't the Movie be placed in the same category as well? There are so many movies out there that have big name, and very exciting trailer, but when you actually watch it, you can forget it in less than a day. And to be honest with you, I think those movies are made base on the actions, then they just tried to scramble out some story lines, which would make it an officially called, movie, rather than a SHOW. My personal favorite movies that have good stories plot would be like: The Beautiful Mind and Forrest Gump. But even for action movies, I think there should be some elements of drama, story telling, and ""Common Sense."" Not just crash some bulk expansive Cadillac, BMW, or helicopters. And I do understand that when making the movie, we cannot expect everything to be 'making sense,' (like it's impossible for a guy to turn into a spider man in a day). But at lease, some details in the film have to be Understandable. (how could a new employed ordinary young girl, who drives a poor, broken car, and happen to have a laptop that has some kind of satellite wireless internet connection, to track down animals,,, can you figure it out?) Well,, often beside the story, 2nd thing that I would look for ,, is the sound tracks. Because I believe the sound track is almost everything that sometime is more powerful than any elements in the movie, it's like the sugar in the dessert. And those are the guide line for me to judge a movie. So if you agree what I said, I strongly recommend you to watch this movie, it is a movie that is actually be WORTH watching. Really !!!!

","I didn't expect much from a movie that finds loads of treasure hidden in the heart of NYC. I knew it would be foolish to try to find witty script with believable and logical storyline. The film is for pure family entertainment, a target which it reached quite fruitfully. This is a film to watch in a relaxed mood, not to be bothered by the lack of silly detailing and realism.<br/><br/>The theme, a secret code running in a family/cult to protect a treasure, is now a very popular one. The story finds its way through the formula of 'clue leading to another clue'. And for the mixture of these two elements, the viewer never loses his interest. The clues are not too complicated, well-carried out and most of all, fun. I was beginning to suspect there's actually no treasure, but that was only my complicated paranoia.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is always fun to watch. And this role of a treasure-hunter suits fine to him. Diane Kruger looks nice as Abigail Chase. Justin Bartha is quite good as Cage's sidekick. The film also has Jon Voight and Sean Bean.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, it is one of the few decent treasure movies I've seen lately... more realistic than 'Tomb Raider' and with a touch of Indiana Jones, all in New York.

","There apparently isn't much room for coming up with adventure stories that don't, in some form or another, resemble good old Indiana Jones's series. Apparently the bar was set so high one might actually argue it actually reached the peak of adventure movies, and that's almost 25 years ago. ""National Treasure"" isn't a bad movie at all, in fact it's pretty funny and at times even a tad unpredictable, but it lacks inovativity, something as I've mentioned before, hasn't been achieved in almost a quarter of a century-damn, it sounds even longer when I say it like this. How can this be, has Indie done absolutely every possible crazy stunt, been to the craziest places and discovered the most amazing things or is Hollywood just in some deadly serious hibernation state. Or have we just seen one too many similar movies and are just fed up. <br/><br/>Well this one is luckily one of the better ones, due to a funny script and good acting by the three main protagonists, Nicholas Cage-with more hair than usual I think, Justin Bartha-a very funny actor whom I know nothing about, and a sexy Diane Kruger. Somehow Jon Voight winds up in every second movie about hidden treasures so he's quite the familiar face-nowadays you can't get a motion picture like this started if he's not in it. Harvey Keitel seems rather misplaced-not really much reason to place such a strong actor in a small role that doesn't add any crucial meaning to the whole plot. Sean Bean plays his villain the way he's played him(self) in ooh, just about every movie so far so it's pretty much a standard routine here-I'd be so bold as to say the most standard routine from a known actor. He does add some new looks and smiles here and there for a change, he actually has a different hairstyle which I think helped get him into the character of ""Sean Bean playing anyone-take 18sth"", but if the saying that the movie is only as good as it's villain is true, then Sean Bean is one of the biggest mistakes in movies in the last 10 years. The more I think about it, the more I want to bash the guy right now-he genuinely sucks. ""Goldeneye"", ""The Island"", ""Equilibrium"", even the ""Fellowship Of The Ring""-he just can't not act the same way he usually does-ergo he doesn't act at all, he just thinks he is. Apparently, so do some people in Hollywood. Me, I just know exactly what to expect and what not to-the latter being diversity.<br/><br/>Everything else is pretty much standard here, the score is rather unnoticeable, which is always a shame in these types of movies-you should hear some familiar theme to cheer for the good guy. I think I should write a manual for adventure movies, don't you-meaning, I'm going to stop with the bickering and just end this comment.<br/><br/>6/10-lacks inovativity and has Sean Bean and Jon Voight cast<br/><br/>Recommendations: kids, anyone who hasn't been ""spoiled"" by the Indiana Jones trilogy yet, fans of Sean Bean...man, they're never disappointed are they;)"

There's also A Wacky Sidekick and A Girl and Jon Voigt as an Alienated Father. No sense of pacing, which is half the battle in these kind of movies.

","For a change, here is an action movie without any comics character, no super-hero, nobody flies or moves buildings with his bare arms, on the contrary, the main character does from time to time something very different ... he thinks! 'National Treasure' is someplace between where 'Indiana Jones' was and where 'Da Vinci Code' will be - treasure hunting mixed with historic riddles, with a considerable dose of free masons and US revolution history. It succeeds to catch us and makes us spend a pleasant two hours because it is well done, nicely acted, brings to screen some of the well known locations in the US North East without destroying them completely, and enough credible things happen in the screen at a good pace to keep our interest alive.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage exchanges his typical anxiety for the obsession of a treasure hunter, and has fun carrying his Donald Trump hairdo for the length of the movie. Diane Kruger is OK as Cage's emotional interest, now that she does not have to carry the responsibility of the Troy war on her shoulders. Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight show up in supporting roles - none of them will run for a Oscar for this, but they certainly have fun and help us having fun.<br/><br/>I read that 'National Treasure 2' is in the making - I hope that it will keep the level up and I am pretty sure that I will go to see it."

","For those who simply can't wait until ""The DaVinci Code"" makes its way to the big screen, there's ""National Treasure"" to serve as a sort of second hand substitute in the meantime. Like the Dan Brown bestseller, this is a wildly improbable caper tale set in the context of historical fiction.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a man who has spent his whole adult life in pursuit of a treasure that he believes the Founding Fathers hid in the late 18th Century, a search that has obsessed and ruined the lives of his own forebears for generations. He is teamed with Ian (Sean Bean), a less savory fortune hunter who has no qualms about breaking the law or eliminating anyone who stands in the way of getting what he wants. When these two men become convinced that there is an invisible map leading to the treasure hidden on the back of the original Declaration of Independence, the highly-principled Ben opts to forego the treasure, while Ian decides to steal the priceless document. It is only when Ben realizes that he must steal the document in order to save it from Ian's diabolical clutches that he springs into action. From then on, it becomes a race against time, as Ben and his cohorts try to unearth the clues and crack the codes that lead to the treasure before Ian and his henchmen can do the same - all while being chased by FBI agents who are hot on his tail. Frankly, one would have thought that the Founding Fathers - what with a war to fight and a nation to found - would have had more important things to do with their time than devise all the elaborate plotting necessary to set up this search. But, apparently, one would have been wrong.<br/><br/>The movie may be fine fun for 12-year-old boys of all ages, but the rest of us will find much of it cheesy and unconvincing. There's always a certain satisfaction that comes with watching stories like these - that of following the clues and then piecing together all the fragments to achieve the full picture - but ""National Treasure"" is really only mildly diverting even in its best moments. Those generally come when we find ourselves at great historic sites such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Old North Church etc. Unfortunately, the dialogue is generally inane, and the acting - well, let's just say that's it's performances like this one that make it increasingly difficult to remember that Cage once walked off the stage clutching an Academy statuette for best actor in his hands. Too often the film feels juvenile and slapdash, especially in the romantic pairing of Cage and Diane Kruger, as a curator of the National Archives who reluctantly comes along for the ride.<br/><br/>The Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves."

","I give this movie a 4.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good comedy, this is the movie for you. The comedy from this movie stems from the fact that it is so bad, it is actually sort of amusing.<br/><br/>This entire movie is basically a pathetic version of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The only real difference (besides the poorly written script) is that the treasure hunting takes place in the United States instead of Europe. Notice that the Last Crusade has a rating of above 8 on here and is currently ranked in the Top 150 movies on IMDb of all time, whereas National Treasure has a weak 6.6 rating (at the time of this post). In reality the gap between the quality of these two movies is massive... it's the difference between winning the SuperBowl and your high school league championship.<br/><br/>There are a few funny parts to the movie and overall the acting was above average. However, the mistakes and inaccuracies throughout the movie were laughable at best. Based on the movie, it might be easier to steal the Declaration of Independence than it would be to steal an article of clothing from your local department store. LOL All of the main items in the National Archives can immediately be dropped down into vaults that can withstand a nuclear holocaust, so the lack of security shown in the movie was simply hilarious. Many websites need you to include at least one number in your password for security purposes, but not the National Archives. I used to work at a bank and everything involving the vault involved at least two people for security reasons... but at the National Archives in this movie, Cage can just waltz right in by himself since double authorization apparently doesn't happen in the institution that houses our most precious documents. (roll eyes) Omissions like these occur throughout the movie and make much of it totally implausible.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you really like treasure hunting and can look past the terrible writing along with the wanna-be James Bond/Indiana Jones character, then rent it. But there are many better options out there to watch in my opinion.<br/><br/>Good luck and happy viewing!"

","This is a must see and highlights on a lot of history, especially American. Benjamin Gates is fascinated with the legend behind a very valuable treasure hidden by our Founding Fathers. His grandfather tells him the story. It was very valuable growing among ancient Egyptian and Roman cultures. It disappears for a 1,000 years. When the Knights Templar, from the crusade era travel to Jerusalem, Israel, they find the treasure. They believe the treasure is too great for any one man to have, so they bring it back to Europe. They formed the Knights Templar. They transported it out of Europe and formed the Masons, a secret society. Eventually, the Founding Fathers, in which some were masons, hide it from the British during the Revolutionary war. They devised clues to its location. Ben gates is older, looking for clues to the treasure. One is aboard a shipwreck in the arctic. It leads them to the Declaration of Independence, which they steal from the National Archives in Washington D.C. Along the treasure hunt, Nicholas and his sidekick, Riley, must outwit Nick's friend turned enemy Ian Howe, and his gang, who want to steal it and misuse the Declaration. Nick also falls in love with the very attractive Abigal chase, who work at the Archives and tags along. The clues lead to a church in New York, which contains secret hidden caves under the church. The treasure is here. Ian gets arrested by the FBI and Nick ends up with the good looking girl mentioned earlier. As for the treasure, it ends up in museums."

","I have often said there are some movies where you turn the brain off and just sit back and enjoy the movie. And by the slimmest of margins, National Treasure fits into this category. It was close, but National Treasure is full of enough entertainment value to recommend seeing it. Nicholas Cage is Benjamin Franklin Gates, one in a long line of family members who believe that the founding members of the United States, with help from the masons, hid a vast treasure somewhere, and left just enough clues for someone, someday, to find it. The clues take a lot of interpretation (this is where you turn your brain ""off"") and neatly take our heroes to the next clue, and so on and so on. Gates is helped by his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), who's job is to assist Gates in formulating the interpretation of the clues and to supply the needed joke at the perfect time. He does his job well. Gates also get the reluctant help from Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who works at the National Archives and knows everything there we need to know to keep the plot moving forward. There is competition from a rival group of explorers looking for the treasure, led by Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who keeps the energy of the moving going. The one person who actually keeps his feet on the ground throughout the movie is Gates' father, played by Jon Voight, who is the one person in the Gates family who does not think the treasure exists. For Voight, this is a rare character who is not a nut-job, and he plays it very well. National Treasure is entertaining, there are some good chase sequences and the movie looks good too. And for once, not a single scene was filmed in Vancouver or Toronto. When we see Philadelphia, we see Philadelphia. Likewise with Washington and New York. If for nothing else, you will learn one or two things about American History (NOT about the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill however, that was made up) and you will be entertained, and there is nothing in this movie any family to object to. The PG rating is more than earned with National Treasure. This movie is clean, mindless entertainment that will keep people interested in what comes next."

","The movie was fun but the facts were not. 56 men signed the Declaration of Independence (not 55) and suffered greatly for it. Over half lost their families and their lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have Hollywood tell their story and their courage, their faith, and their will to fight the greatest power on Earth at the time, the British Empire. Imagine General Washington at Valley Forge watching the British Army take comfort in their homes while they looked on from their unsheltered woods. The Revolutionary War lasted for eight long years to the day which started with the shot heard around the world at Lexington. Eighteen patriots lost their lives that day. After the war, the new country was Broke (if they had a secret national treasure they didn't know about it). For four years the new country struggled and couldn't agree on much and chaos was taking hold. It was Ben Franklin who spoke on the floor in that room in Philadelphia that spurred everyone to work to make this country great. Thomas Paine was the first to say the words ""The United States of America."" A young red haired lawyer named Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. It is filled with faith and hope. Where did all these great men come from all at one time? It is truly one of the greatest adventures ever."

Another thing, Benjamin would NEVER have been able to steal the declaration. Way too much technology protecting it. The highlight of this movie is Benjamin's dim-witted sidekick, Riley. And he's not even that funny. I laughed only once or twice during the whole movie, and that was when Riley said something stupid. Seroiuslsy.

","In fact, in this movie the last place they go looks more like something you would find in a tomb raider game than anything in the tomb raider movies. This was a nice little film, not overly great, but it was entertaining. The movie focuses on Cage's character Ben Gates as he tries to follow clues to one of the largest treasures ever. The main one being on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Of course, Cage's character is not the only one after the treasure so is a former ally who will stop at nothing to receive the riches himself. This character is played by Sean Bean. As usual he plays the villain very well. Also, look for Jon Voight as Cage's dad and Harvey Keitel as a FBI agent I think after Cage. The movie has some action, some comedy...it never gets really violent are anything, but you could probably tell that from the fact it is rated pg. Could have used maybe some more action, it could have also been a bit less talky in parts, but overall it is enjoyable and everyone in it plays their part well."
"Leon_Chang_2000","5","0","1","5 May 2005"," This movie had great potential, but didn't use half of it
","Do you know why books like Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code were so successful? The main characters in these adventure novels were much like the main characters of National Treasure: they were geniuses. However, even for the main character of Dan Brown's famous novel, it still took numerous pages to put together even one clue. See, the point is that Brown's book was realistic and life-like. National Treasure, however, seems to lack that quality while trying to do so many things in a short amount of time. For example, the movie tries to build on the characters and their histories, then the current issues, and then suddenly I was taken by surprise by the almost trivial love story that the director tried to stick in there. I mean, it's understandable that the movie has a time limit, but that just means that the story has to be made to fit the limit (or vice versa, if possible). For example, if Titanic had been made to be only half its length, the length of a normal film, none of the connections would've been made and the movie would definitely not have been so popular.<br/><br/>Away from the bad, however, the story was enticing and well thought out. The acting was also nice, though that's to be expected from top-notch actors like Nicholas Cage. The potential could have allowed this movie to be at least in IMDb's top 250, but I as the audience just didn't feel that bond to the movie as I felt in masterpieces like The Shawshank Redemption or Gladiator.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie may or may not be what you expect, and though it's definitely not on the same par as movies such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's worth seeing. I give it a 6/10 because it's still better than the average movie in today's culture."

","A vast treasure of infinite wealth that originates from several continents and spans several centuries --- is it or is it not a reality? It is sought after by two groups of people, each headed by a man with a deeply embedded passion to gain the treasure (two men and each has his own reason). The clues have been in plain view for centuries, but unless they are sought in order, they are easily passed over.<br/><br/>The clues are not arrows on a map, but historical items such as the Declaration of Independence, a carefully carved pipe, and a poem. The honored and respected founding fathers of America wrote the Declaration of Independence, worshiped God, and gave of their valuable time and lives to separate our country from the persecution of their country/s origin. I give this movie a thumbs up. It is well thought out, fun, beautifully photographed, historically informative, with great actors.<br/><br/>Jon Turtletaub (1964), Director, made this a fast paced film with several locations. He introduces the locations to be filmed with aerial views, some being famous national monuments, like the Washington Monument, the White House, and the Artic tundra. He shot the exterior of the Independence Hall on location in Pennsylvania, and then took his cameras to Buena Park, California to use the replica at Knott's Berry Farm. Turtletaub did some of the actual filming.<br/><br/>The movie suggests that there are clues on the back of the original copy of the Declaration of Independence that will lead to a treasure. It is a myth. Yet, the movie makes it so believable, that I was wondering if something couldn't really have been hidden. I'm sure there are some of us who would like to believe that a real treasure, such as the one they are suggesting, really exists.<br/><br/>Protagonist Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), is a very smart, soft spoken, gentleman, who looks athletic and fit. When he makes up his mind to steal the document, you can see that he is decisive and determined. He is handsome and likes Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). We can tell, because when he tells Chase he is going to steal the document, he isn't offended when she automatically laughs and tries to hide it when she realizes he is serious.<br/><br/>Antagonist Ian Howe (Sean Bean) is a millionaire who seeks the treasure to add to his collection. He is ruthless in his goal to obtain what he wants. It didn't take much --- Ben thought it was a bad, unethical move to steal the Declaration of Independence to get the clue off the back --- and Ian had one of his hired thugs {Powell (Stewart Finlay-Mc Lennan), Shippen (Oleg Taktarov), and Phil (Stephen A. Pope)}, try to shoot him. His tactics on how to get through to the document after hours, was to shoot their way in and use an electric gun to stun him, which was better than killing him.<br/><br/>A fun movie, clean language, light romance and humor, and good family values. There is nothing boring about it either. It reinforces the bonding between fathers and sons for generations. It also says that families can disagree and still get along. Patrick Gates (Jon Voight( helped his son even though he didn't have any faith in there being a treasure."

","** Here be a treasure of Spoilers **<br/><br/>Recap: In ancient times, the Knight Templar, collected a great treasure that they thought was too great to being owned by just one man. It didn't matter if that man were king or pope. So the treasure were smuggled out and hidden away by the Templars, who turned into the Free Masons, who among their ranks held some of the Founding Fathers of the independent America. History turned to legend, legend turned into myth, and the treasure is all but forgotten. A young boy however is told the story by his grandfather, who claims to have a little clue. The boy never forgets the treasure and now Ben Gates (Cage) is on the hunt for the treasure that his family has sought for many generations. Packed in ice Gates find an old ship with another clue that point towards the Declaration of Independence. However, the Gates family has a less than stellar reputation, and to examine the Declaration for hidden clues about a hidden treasure is out of the question. An associate and sponsor to Gates, Ian Howe (Bean), suggest that they ""borrow"" the Declaration. Gates opposes this and Howe then considers Gates an obstacle and tries to blow him up. Gates and his friend Riley (Bartha) survive and travels to USA to warn the authorities. But when no one believes them that the DoI is about to be stolen, they decide that the only way to protect it is to steal it before Howe does. But Gates and Howe attempt the theft almost simultaneously and it turns violent. Gates finally walk away with the DoI, but also get conservator Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) as a ""bonus"". Now the three must find the new clues but they are sought after, both by Howe and the FBI...<br/><br/>Comment: A very nice modern version of a Indian Jones type movie. The story is very nice, with a lot of historic connections to give an plausible (and somewhat exotic) story. The focus is on adventure but there are some moments of action and comedy as well. Especially the character Riley contributes with some funny parts and lines. It is the story that is the main attraction here with nice effects to augment it. The actors are mostly there just to tell the story and they do it well. Bean is very good as the bad guy (again), Cage is good as the adventurer, Kruger as the conservator (and guess what, love interest), Voight as the disbelieving father and Bartha was a very interesting new acquaintance for me. Mostly very entertaining, some little slower parts and unfortunately somewhat predictable, but as mentioned still good.<br/><br/>A weak 8/10"

Yeah so what if there are cheesy one liners in the middle of a deadly fight, and endless clips of British guys chasing Americans all over the place. WE ARE HUMAN, THIS IS WHAT WE LIKE!!! Nicholas Cage plays the character which i think he is born to play in this film. The nerdy but quite cool guy which reminds you of his part in the Rock. Shaun Bean is the architypal bad guy opposite him and, together (with Gates's sidekick Riley (played surprisingly well by Justin Bartha)) they rip it up Indiana Jones style, in a film that you can watch again and again (I have already seen it 3 times) More seriously, there is fantastic camera work in there (watch out for the shots of the declaration of independence) and a very sound plot.<br/><br/>So basically, to watch this film you need to forget any opinions u have on what is needed to bring film forward.

It was so un-interesting after an hour and a half of dumb clues that made no sense, I was just wanting the film to end!

"Avoura","8","0","1","18 January 2005"," Good film, but far-fetched. Enjoyable.
","This was an enjoyable film about a man in search of lost treasure, who eventually discovers it and allows the rest of mankind to benefit from it, probably in part because he did not want to go to prison. I though the idea of following the clues to get more clues and find the treasure worked really well. The relationship between Gates and Dr Chase grew throughout the film and was worked out well. Sean Bean as bad guy Ian acted his part well and was believable. <br/><br/>Near the end of the film: When Ian and the bad guys left the good guys down in the pit, after being given a false clue to the whereabouts of the treasure, Ben and his dad start talking about the treasure not being there in the empty-ish room they found, and wanting to keep seeking it. I suddenly thought, oh no, they are not going to find it, the film will end, and then we have to watch the sequel and maybe more sequels while he tries to find the lost treasure. But, they then found the other room and that was okay, otherwise I would have felt let down if they had not found the treasure.<br/><br/>I think there is a message in this: Ian was greedy for rewards he would get from the treasure, thinking perhaps it was just gold he could sell, but ended up being caught by the FBI and no doubt spending a long time in prison. Ben was a good guy who wanted to do the right thing, even when no one believed him and it appeared wrong to steal the Declaration of Independence, and yet it was the right thing to do as he ended up finding the treasure. He did not keep it, it would have been too much for one man anyway, and the right thing to do was to give it to mankind to view in museums, and for historians to study. Finding scrolls from ancient Alexandria would be a great treasure worth more than gold, if they could be read and deciphered and were intact.<br/><br/>The other thing that struck me about this film was some of the clever dialog and intellectual remarks, which were not too much nor self-righteous, but which gave the film an intelligent feel, rather than it being a dumb film about good guys being chased by bad guys. Not your average adventure film! The whole idea of the treasure though is very far fetched, but it works OK for this movie, but I doubt if it would be true. But who knows what treasures might be hidden away somewhere from our ancient past?"

Eventually the knights became the Freemasons and their hidden treasure was brought overseas by pilgrims and ended up in the hands of America's Founding Fathers. Once in their possession, the Founding Fathers decided the same thing that the Knights did some 450 years earlier: the treasure was too great for one man alone or even one government. While the American Revolution was taking place, the Founding Fathers hid the treasure from the invading British while leaving clues to the treasures whereabouts on the dollar bill, the back of The Declaration of Independence, and by telling one of Ben Gates's ancestors that he could find keys to the treasures whereabouts on the ship that it was brought to America on.<br/><br/>In present day, Ben has found the ship named The Charlotte and a hint leading to a map that is supposedly on the back of The Declaration of Independence. However, to Ben's misfortune his colleague treasure hunter, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) betrays him once the clue is found. Suspecting Ian of plotting to steal The Declaration, Ben decides to do it first in order to secure the treasure. Even if Ben accomplishes this task, he still has to deal with Ian, his men, and the FBI who are already suspicious of his motives. Ben is accompanied by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) on the hunt for the treasure. Abigail is at first reluctant because of her responsibility for The Declaration's security. She and Ben's father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), soon realize the necessity of the mission.<br/><br/>""National Treasure"" has a handful of uninspired action scenes and few great actors like Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel in the supporting roles. Voight and Keitel do the best any actor can possibly do with such formulaic and bland material. Diane Kruger (Troy) gives a mediocre performance. Sean Bean does his very best as the tempted villain, a role he truly has talent for and should perform more often (though not so much as to typecast himself). Nicolas Cage gives an unmemorable performance and seems out of place in this cheap, fast paced action-thriller. At his age he should retire to dramas and psychological thrillers, which despite being very demanding on an actor would suit him better. However, the main hindrance to everyone's performance was shabby dialogue and a summer flick plot.<br/><br/>Director John Turteltaub (""Phenomenon"", ""The Kid"") encounters some basic problems with ""National Treasure"" that many movies of its genre do these days. The one-liners (important ingredients in an action movie) were sparse and dull. The comic relief is just too dependent on the annoying sidekick Riley. Another troubling aspect of the film is the far-fetched plot that is all too common in Jerry Bruckheimer productions (""Armageddon"", ""The Rock""). Even worse was that two-dimensional feel surrounding these cardboard characters.<br/><br/>This film has a plot that is hard to follow but if you watch closely you'll realize the confusion is not from an intelligent script beyond our grasp, but instead the filmmakers' fast paced editing.<br/><br/>Seems to be living in the hype of ""The Da Vinci Code"".<br/><br/>5/10"

","If ever a movie from Walt Disney Pictures looked as if it should have come from Touchstone but turned out to be a Disney movie in the worst sense, ""National Treasure"" is that movie. Yes, it has the Jerry Bruckheimer stamp; yes, there are few if any children in it; yes, it has Harvey Keitel; and yes, it has some inviting shots of Diane Kruger's cleavage; but this is ultimately a pretty soft and toothless adventure tale, dressed up with major names and slick production values.<br/><br/>The first movie from Nicolas Cage's production company Saturn Films to star the man since ""The Family Man"" (he wasn't in ""The Life Of David Gale""), the movie suffers from <br/><br/>a) Cage not seeming to take this seriously for a moment, <br/><br/>b) Diane Kruger confirming that her chronic blandness in ""Troy"" was no fluke, <br/><br/>c) Jon Turteltaub being just as good with action here as he was with ""3 Ninjas"" (i.e. not very) and additionally forgetting that he's dealing with adults this time around, <br/><br/>d) an unforgivably sluggish pace for what's supposed to be an exciting race around the Northeast US to find the treasure of the Knights Templar, <br/><br/>e) a script by Jim Kouf (woo-hoo!) and the team of Marianne Wibberley and Cormac Wibberley (d'oh!) that lets the absurdities pile up unceasingly, a drawback made even more glaring by d), <br/><br/>f) a lot of absolutely dreadful dialogue (alternately ridiculously expository and trying to be witty and failing), <br/><br/>and g) a generally neutered feel to the whole enterprise; it sometimes plays like a history lesson in lieu of a proper movie.

","There are two ways to see this movie. You can see this as a true or possible story (and I'm sure that many people do) and believe everything that is said in this movie. There are people who believe in UFO's as well, so why not believing that there is an unsee-able treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, leading to a hidden treasure that was gathered by the Romans and the order of the Templers and that has been taken to America by the Free Macons and the founding fathers of the USA.The other option is to see it as an adventure movie like Indiana Jones. Than this movie isn't all that bad, even quite entertaining. <br/><br/>However, from time to time it annoyed me enormously that Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) always seemed to be able to solve the most difficult riddles without too much problems (It was like if he was some computer who just needed to scan all the information and than could give the outcome without too much hesitation), that he always seemed to be able to survive the most life threatening situations without too much problems,... that he was some kind of superman. Too often I thought: YEAH RIGHT, what's next: aliens have written it all down and it isn't just a treasure map, but also a star map which may be helpful to find their planet??? <br/><br/>Yes it is true, perhaps I'm a bit too critical.

","Normally a movie from blockbuster giant Jerry Bruckheimer is fun to watch, great excitement and spectacular. Unfortunaly this one is not. It's just too much in too little time. If it had been a 13 episodes t.v. series it could have been good. But now it looks if the director put Indiana Jones 1, 2 and 3 altogether in just two hours. And thats the problem, its all going too fast and too easy. The 'hidden' clues are just simple to discover. Finding things that are missing for hundreds of years, is no problem at all. Even stealing the declaration of independence looks too simple. In mission impossible 1 the burglary was excitement, and Tom Cruise had a hard time in a well secured room. But in N.T. Gage just walks in. Because of the speed of the clues being discovered there is just not enough time for the movie to get a real thrill of excitement. You just know it will turned out good, and the clue will be solved. There are also a lot of question marks left. The good guys using all the clues trying to get the national treasure, and the bad guys don't have those clues, but as a wonder the are keeping up and appear at the same places as the good guys. And because of the speed and time of the movie, its just at the edge of how many clues you can handle. At the and you thinking one more clue and i've had it. Only the kids who have never seen anything of Indiana Jones, will be really excited and thrilled. The rest will think that Nicolas Gage is just working on a playground...."

It is hard to think of a big scene in the whole movie, and even the end was a bit of an anti climax for me. I thought Sean Bean's bad guy was too amicable by far and didn't seem dangerous enough ,in fact it must have been very difficult for him to be evil, with Cage constantly referring to him as Ian.When you are walking out of the theatre you are thinking ,the charges they were levelling against the bad guy would probably see him put away for five years ,and only if he had any previous convictions at that."
"dan_s_song","4","0","1","1 January 2005"," Disney movie, of course...........
","I was shocked and quite disappointed after watching this movie. Having read other reviews that called it an action movie, I came to the conclusion that it would be an action movie. This movie is neither an action movie nor does it contain an ounce of suspense. The plot overly simplistic, characters undeveloped, and historically inaccurate. I understand it is a movie, but to introduce certain facets of American folklore (partly) and only mention that Benjamin Franklin was a Mason, nothing more, is quite pathetic. Honestly, the rumors surround the Masons (Freemasons) are more interesting than the story of a treasure map. My problem with the movie was the fact that Disney was evident from the start of the movie. The completely unnecessary love story which was not explored within the movie, only with a impulsive kiss and a scene with Gates and the Doctor together at the end. Certainly my main gripe is with the characters. The idea definitely has substance, although I kept thinking of Brown's ""Angels and Demons"" and ""Da Vinvi Code"", the latter almost in production (Hanks will be playing Langdon).<br/><br/>I will say it is a good movie for the PG audience, although it has been a while since a PG movie has gotten my attention. It is great for children to enjoy and a parent wrote that it was great not to be forced to cover their children's ears and eyes during the movie. I will only say (as a student in college and not a parent) that parents shouldn't be taking children to movies where that chance could occur. Of course that delves into other topics that is not appropriate here. But over all this movie ranks very VERY low on my long list of movies that I have watched. The only reason why I am even spending any time in writing this is because I was VERY disappointed by many critics citing this as a good movie because of the action (and I am a firm believer that action transcend blood and gore) and suspense. I understand there is subjectivity involved, but please, if you consider this movie ""suspenseful"" or ""action packed"" should as one of my professors have told me ""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" and others."

It becomes funny. I think the film is for maybe 10+. My 8 year old sister saw it and didn't understand the story. I thought it was a little too over a younger child's head.

","The !SPOILERS! in this review are located below and clearly<br/><br/>marked. <br/><br/>Let's get the critique out of the way first. <br/><br/>1. Character development: non-existent. <br/><br/>2. Set pieces: boring, but of historical interest. <br/><br/>3. Dialogue: Sub-par. <br/><br/>4. Believability: Zero. <br/><br/>And yet despite these weaknesses, I liked the movie! Let's face it, Nicholas Cage is a likable actor and that's why it works. His sidekick is perilously close to being the most annoying sidekick since Jar... (He who must not be spoken of)<br/><br/>The female lead is very attractive but has a noticeable accent which makes me wonder which director/producer she is dating to get this role. Otherwise, she is pretty good at running around and zinging one-liners.<br/><br/>The typical Bruckheimer formula of non-stop action is deftly executed by director Turteltaub and the historical significance of various major national landmarks is interspersed between chases and scenes in which clues are discovered.<br/><br/>!SPOILERS!<br/><br/>The screenplay was dumbed-down enough for me to get the ""valley forge"" and the ""daylight savings time"" references before the characters on screen blurted them out. Thanks for making me feel smart! I liked the dedication to American history (and faux-history) showed by Nicholas Cage's character. Our country would do well with more true patriots and knowledgeable individuals.<br/><br/>!SPOILERS!"

","Cage is a renaissance actor, he can play just about anything which is something to be said in the modern world of film. Sean Bean is one of the most underrated actors of the present day, he is wicked as the supporting role in this movie, as is Keitel and Voight. The movie is fast paced all the way through. There are plenty of twists and turns that keep the viewer interested through the films 2 hour running time. I'll admit I am a bit bias, seeing as how i major in history. This movie also a bit bias to the American view of history, but by living in Canada, I am used to it.<br/><br/>The movie borrows elements from Raiders of the Lost Ark, however it is more human oriented, and their is no diabolical plot, which is all too common in treasure movies of the last twenty years. The cast and crew was very well suited for the jobs they were assigned. I applaud the director and production team for their effort to display just how important history is. Aside from the academics, there is allot of Hollywood technique within the plot and action sequences which are unrealistic, but who goes to the movies to watch the real world anyways? great appetizer for history and great entertainment for those who wanna view it."

Nick has never really appealed to me as an action movie star, but on this occasion I think he pulled it off. I still think Sean was the star of the show though, of course! Now on a more serious note, the film was filled with action, adventure and a few good laughs. it reminds me of a modern Indiana Jones movie but not in a bad way. The story line was well thought and clever. This movie should go to no1 in the United Kingdom as well, I will be shocked if it doesn't.

","As usual, my suspicions of ""official"" movie critics have proved correct. Before seeing this movie I heard several unfavorable reviews by so-called official critics and commentators. However, I heard even more extremely favorable personal reviews from friends, family and acquaintances. All of them said it was a good, if not great, film. And I have to agree.<br/><br/>This was another blockbuster (as proved by the box-office numbers) with a great cast, excellent special effects, a good believable storyline, and non-stop realistic action. The fast pace moved the film along without letting it flounder on insignificant details, as alluded to by certain reviewers.<br/><br/>One of the greatest negative points by the critics was the poor, or lack of, comedy relief by the quirky sidekick. Wow, I guess they just don't understand what a dry humor is. Or else it's an acquired taste and they have no palate for it, as opposed to the rest of the nation.<br/><br/>Nation Treasure IS a national treasure and will definitely become a treasure in our DVD collection as soon as it becomes available.<br/><br/>My advice to the average Joe consumer: stop giving any credence whatsoever (as I have) to the alleged notable critics and reviewers and go see this movie. Listen to people like yourselves who have seen the movie and not to the liberal-minded, foreign-film-watching, like-to-see-sex-and-drugs-and-immorality-promoted-as-""art"" ""critics"" and make your own decisions about what you choose to see.<br/><br/>Sincerely, -average Joe critic"
"nagyovafan","Null","0","1","4 December 2004"," This Is My Neighbors' Review
","This movie was much better than The Grudge, but that's not saying much. It's a historical kind of movie, starring Nicholas Cage. In the story, the guy has to follow the clues because his family is trying to protect the Treasure of the Knight's Templar, but nobody's been able to find it. You have to watch closely to get all of the clues and plot lines. I think Ben Gates, played by Nicholas Cage is too smart to be true. I mean, if you're smart enough to figure out how to steal the Declaration of Independence, you should be smart enough to get rich on some computer thing like Bill Gates and not have to worry about this treasure. Back to the movie. Riley, played by Justin Bartha, was my favorite character because he added comic relief. Of course, evry movie has to have a bad guy, and this movie's no exception. The bad guy in this movie is evil, and he used to be Ben's partner. The movie has good acting and superb special effects. The script was good, but little kids might not get it. Overall, it was a good action movie, and I enjoyed it. I give it 8 out of 10."

National Treasure is unique ,and is full of suspense!! The storyline to this story is incredible! The actors bring the characters to life that you'll find yourself holding your breath! When we went on opening night, the first show was sold out, we waited for the next show. As the movie goers from the show prior to ours was coming out, everyone was giving it thumbs up!! Needless to say, you really won't be disappointed with your movie ticket stub at the end of the show. Hollywood has really brought back the excitement in the theater, and balanced with some light humor it can be enjoyed by many viewers."

","The worst thing about this movie was how the links between various areas of the plot were incomplete. The movie made a weak effort to bring the viewer along its path. There were too many ""a-ha!"" moments that came without much effort...as in, character looks puzzled at the historic tangle of clues before him. Then, 1.3 seconds later, it all makes sense (to the character, not to us). The acting was not amazing either, but with this material, it's understandable. The exception was the guy who played Riley, who I thought was pretty good. However, this could not save the rest of the film."

","Spoiler! National Treasure is an adult movie which kids can watch. Not overly violent or scary, but grown up enough that, Mr adult me, never though this was Disney. Casted perfectly, with the old UK USA rivalry for the treasure that each groups seeks. Sean Bean plays the perfect bad guy, and Cage play the humble, and non imposing role excellently. A bit of gen y and xers making fun of each other. The director keep a fast pace for a action movie. The script wonderfully mixes legend, history, and the Masons all together nicely. Watch for part 2, and I hope they do make a sequel. The best part of the film is when Cage plans to steal a item in this film. 8 out of 10. Worth seeing in the theater"

"scltspider","4","0","1","29 November 2004"," Thinly disguised propaganda
","National Treasure was the kind of movie that didn't make me feel ashamed to have watched, but I certainly would have rather waited for this to make it to the cheep seats or cable.<br/><br/>So, what sucked? 1) The entire movie revolves around the Masons as an organization of infinite wisdom formed from the Knights Templar, who then go on to be heroes fighting against ignorance and injustice. While I find this fictitious backstory to be better movie material than the truth, I still would have had a better time if this urban legend hadn't received yet another retelling (I also wouldn't want to see the Illuminati either). 2) All of the clues and most of the action scenes were either a thinly disguised history lesson of the American revolution, with enough non-wounding gunshots thrown in to keep the attention of those with the patience of an 8 year old. 3) The dopey sidekick routine was overdone, and was created so the audience didn't feel so bad about not knowing all the tidbits of knowledge about the founding of their own country and culture.<br/><br/>What was OK? 1) There were enough moments when I thought the movie was going to go one way, and it decided to go in another logical route. One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is when a scene's outcome is going to be painfully obvious. 2) There were a few clever jokes and lines that I was able to laugh and relax. 3) Neither the villains nor the government agents were overly stupid, dopey, or stereotypical. 4) The sidekick was not annoyingly dopey, just obviously put in mostly as a plot device.<br/><br/>This is a family friendly action movie that I will never recommend to friends, but I will not condemn it as a travesty against cinema just because it wasn't what I look for in a movie. If you have kids between 10 and 13, this might be a movie to go to as a family. If your idea of a good action flick is James Bond, you are better off spending your money on a rental or waiting for Oceans 12."
"Nozze-Musica","Null","0","1","29 November 2004"," Somehow I Expected Nicholas Cage to Have a Whip and a Fedora
","National Treasure is a good film, highly enjoyable, maybe even occasionally thrilling, but this movie wants so bad to be Indiana Jones but it is not. Overall this movie is a valiant effort, but it falls short of the brilliant adventure film it tries so hard to be. Nicholas Cage plays adventurer Ben Gates, a man who has been searching for a missing treasure that has been transported all around the world, most of his life. This treasure is supposedly something that has been amassed for part of the millennium. Now as Ben and his silly assistant Riley are about to find out their partners in treasure hunting are about to turn on them. The bad treasure hunters have a leg up now because they have some of the clues to the riddle, and they wish to steal the Declaration of Independence to see if they can find the treasure, as the map to the treasure is supposedly on the back of the Declaration. Ben Gates must steal the Declaration himself in order to keep the bad treasure hunters from doing wrong type things with it. Sound complicated it probably is, but it is much simpler to understand when you watch the movie. There are also a number of clichés, like the goofy sidekick, the numerous chase scenes, none of which really thrilled me all that much, but were well-done technically, didn't take away anything or add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be a mystical retelling of American history, as we find out the long story of the treasure and how it ended up where it did, or if it is still around at all, which no one really knows. There are plenty of riddles and puzzles in this film which are interesting, but not the kinds that really make one perplexed or just dying to see what happens next. The film sports a nice supporting cast, including a small appearance by Christopher Plummer as the grandfather of Ben Gates, and Jon Voight in the role of Ben Gates' father. Sean Bean plays Ian Howe, the bad treasure hunter, but he falls into the cliché category and really does not show any good acting skills in this part. Then there is the love interest, played by Diane Kruger, who is not nearly as revolting as love interests in other similar films, she actually can manage to stand on her own two feet against Nicholas Cage. <br/><br/>Another problem with this movie is that Nicholas Cage is miscast. He does not fit the mold of a grand adventurer in the mold of let's say Harrison Ford. Cage just doesn't appear to fit into the part easily although he does what he can to act well in this movie. His miscasting does not take away anything from the movie just doesn't do too much for it. Let's face it that is what this movie is trying to be, another Indiana Jones. First it is important to say there will not be another Indiana Jones, so this movie was silly to try to be so grand in it's scale, it's not as good as Indiana Jones, but what is? Not much. Another problem compared with Indiana Jones is that when you watch the Indiana Jones films they never get old. You could watch them over and over again, and I know a lot of people that do. This is not a movie I am dying to see again. Indiana Jones was magical, this was a good movie far from one of the best of all time. And some of the scenes that are in caverns that are in mysterious places and things like that you expect Nicholas Cage to take out his bullwhip and jump across large crevasses and then the Indiana Jones theme to play. The movie does not try to be it's own film, or if it did it did not do a very good job of it.<br/><br/>And a final comparison to Indiana Jones Steven Spielberg said that when he was making Indiana Jones he was just trying to make a B-Movie. He wasn't trying to make a great film, just a great fantasy movie no one was expected to take seriously. This movie takes itself to seriously, doesn't want to be a fantasy despite the fact it is. The movies plot lines and developing action are rooted too much into American history to try and be a good fantasy movie, so it doesn't work on the level it is supposed to. Don't get me wrong some of the plot lines and the story are interesting but it is nothing spectacular. It was worth it but will it become one of the highest grossing films of all time like Indiana Jones? I highly doubt it."
"jonann2","10","0","1","28 November 2004"," This was an AWESOME FILM!!!
","I just went to see this film tonight, and it was fantastic. A great action-adventure film with an intelligently written script and excellent plot twists. This is a great film on so many levels, but I think one of the great things about it is the fact that it is a nice, PG rated adventure film that the whole family can get into. Too often today we see films that adults would want to see but are not appropriate for kids, or we see films for kids that adults are bored stiff watching. This film is a rare kind nowadays because it is a great film for both adults and children to be entertained with. I also love the way they integrated elements of American history into the films plot, which is a great way to get movie watchers into history. As a historian myself, I very much enjoyed that element of the film, and the fact that Nicholas Cage's character reacted in the same way I might have in his place in many situations in the film. Now, is some of the stuff a little far fetched, like treasure maps on the back of the Declaration of Independence? Sure. But this only puts National Treasure in the tradition of other great action-adventure yarns like Indiana Jones. So, go see this film with the whole family, and have a great time."
"eschetic","8","0","1","28 November 2004"," The real treasure is rattling good satire
","The uninitiate must be scratching their heads at the great business this film did after reviews that didn't ""get"" it dismissed it as non-credible.<br/><br/>OF COURSE it is non-credible; but it is also beautifully filmed, nicely paced, brilliantly scripted as to character banter and mystery clues just clever enough to let the audience guess them before the characters do AND (as almost no one bothered to mention in print) it is dazzling SATIRE on the ""DaVinci Code"" genre of mysteries.<br/><br/>If you loved Dan Brown's smash novel ""The DaVinci Code,"" and can't wait for the movie, you'll adore this film.<br/><br/>Packing legitimate historical nuggets around a silly but *barely* plausible mystery (the initial gimmick of invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence is less plausible than the central gimmick in the Brown book - satire), the film follows the Bond (and Brown) template of giving us a gorgeous travelogue of famous sites, a none too taxing love interest with a mystery we can actually guess along with - and even tosses in a well scripted and acted comic side-kick for good measure. It's a near perfect recipe for a diverting entertainment.<br/><br/>In the travelogue leading to the final (admittedly silly) Indiana Jones-like caverns, only Manhattan's Trinity Church rings slightly false (the real Trinity sanctuary is slightly airier and much lighter).<br/><br/>As stated, the end of the chase is silly - especially the tacked on ""finders' fee"" finale - and yields far too many continuity gaffs (250 year old nails that are still rust free when pulled out of 250 year old boards?! Boards rotting when rope doesn't?!), but getting there is a glorious ride that most viewers will love for the ride itself . . . and as a great appetizer for the DaVinci Code movie.<br/><br/>It's the most fun I've had at an ""adventure"" film since Sean Connery made his last Bond film. Rate it fun fluff."

","National Treasure reminded me of the days when Indiana Jones staring Harrison Ford graced our theaters in the 80's. Kids and adults both could watch this show and enjoy it. There were no explicit sexual inuedos and no extreme explicit language, yet there was a sense of excitement and mystery through out the movie. So what if there are a few misleading aspects. National Treasure was a movie not a full scale documentary. <br/><br/>In my opinion, I believe we need more movies written and directed in this way.

However, I thought the movie was great. I loved seeing NYC, Philadelphia and DC. Nic Cage was great in this movie. I cannot honestly say that I was a fan before, now I am.

"jay_penguin150","Null","0","1","20 November 2004"," Not so far fetched
","As the movie opens, we learn of the legend of the Free Masons, and the connection to the Gates family. It is a good beginning, but it leaves out some detail that could give more of a background. Cage, somewhat trying to act like Indiana Jones but with a receding hair-line, is the main character, Benjamin Franklin Gates (please not the corny names of the characters). He has believed in the treasure for his entire life, and now at approximately 35 years old, he sets out to find it. Although solving the clues is a little hard to see how it was possible, we understand that Cage has been studying American Revolution era trivia and history his entire life.<br/><br/>This movie does not contain excessive violence, profanity, or romance, which i believe helps it to contain a fairly good plot. This movie seems, like i mentioned before, a modern transposition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The plot of going from location to location seems very similar.<br/><br/>The movie, although highly unlikely to be true or even plausible, somehow makes everything make sense. It is not so much of a treasure hunt, but more of a solve the puzzle. The sets look very realistic, and the acting too. I would put this movie in a category with the 007 BOND movies, and adventure mystery. Everything falls together, and the camera shots are wonderful. They, for example, might show some symbol in the beginning that continues throughout the movie. It is very audience friendly, even though at some points there are ""scary"" scenes. All in all, I'd recommend this movie to any BOND or JONES lover, or for a history teacher to assign this movie as an extra credit opportunity, as many facts stay true to history. 10/10 :)"

","this movie is so bad I decided to log on to IMDb just so i can vote on it and write a review, which involved retrieving my password - THAT's how strongly i feel about this movie. The jokes were lame, poorly written and poorly executed; the clues were not smart; the plot was slow and dull; Nick Cage looked like a plastic man the entire time. Does he really think that goofy-half-raised-eyebrow look on his face looks cool? It made him look like a aging Ken doll. And his side-kick/comedy relief guy... all i can say is WTF. It was a bad movie all around - bad ending, bad beginning, bad lead-in. bad bad bad. But I gave it a 4 cuz Diane Kruger wasn't THAT bad. Kinda surprised to find out she was Helen of Troy, she didn't look as good as she did in this movie. Definitely someone to look out for in the future."

","After Don Simpson died I felt Jerry Bruckheimer lost the golden touch because of his ability to produce only near good (Gone in 60 Seconds) or positively atrocious (Pearl Harbor) films. While Pirates of the Caribbean showed glimpses of the magic that Bruckheimer hadn't shown since the 1980's, he definitely casts a spell in National Treasure. The action is plentiful, but not over-absorbing. Whereas some movies are driven only by the intriguing plot (Ocean's Eleven), National Treasure delivers some solid character interaction. The humor never seemed force, and ""big"" lines came out fluid. The pace fluctuated at times, but nothing seemed too hurried or too drawn out and despite a few glaring logical inconsistencies, everything fit together. Even the arbitrary romantic interlude seemed to go with the flow. All aspects of this film had their proper place and albeit some loose ends not being tied up on screen, the ending was very satisfying.<br/><br/>I think Nicolas Cage is a good actor despite some flaky performances (Raising Arizona, The Family Man). His performance in National Treasure was very genuine. Although I have always felt action movies bring out Bruckheimer's best, he does an admirable job adding in a little suspense and intrigue. Action, romance, and comedy, National Treasure truly has all the makings of a Bruckheimer classic. I'll admit that at times it felt like I was back in '86. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, suitable for all ages, although I'd leave the kids at home if you don't want to play ""20 questions"" in the theater. This movie was fantastic, other than the sound track - I'm not going to lie, it was subpar, or maybe I just think that a Bruckheimer movie isn't complete without a Harold Faltermeyer end tune... either way this is a terrific movie and although I didn't quite get the same feeling walking out of National Treasure as I did walking out of Top Gun, I think it's safe to say that Jerry Bruckheimer is still the master and definitely has a few more solid flicks in him."

","Go see the movie. It's captivating, educational, and manages to entertain without obscenities, sexual content, and gratuitous blood shed. It something the entire family will enjoy. While some of the story and action event require the suspension of dis-belief, you will undoubtedly overlook them in favor of this strong plot line and undercurrent of American history. This movie made me want to take my family to Washington DC and see the National Archives building then go down to Philadelphia to Independence Hall. Overall I give this movie **** starts (my top score) Enjoy!!!<br/><br/>*************************************************************"
"kevgust","10","0","1","19 November 2004"," A good movie using an old movie standard with an original idea
","I really enjoyed this film. I can't remember the last time we even went to a PG movie. It was wonderful to see good ideas, characters and plot development all without buckets of fake blood and the F word used a hundered times. <br/><br/>If you want a fun film to take the family to, this is it. I vaguely recall hearing one insignificant swear word. And there was just something refreshing about people not having to die ever other scene.<br/><br/>Now I do love American History so that may have influenced my review a bit, but I genuinely want to go back and see this movie again. That's not something I could say about Spiderman 2 or Return of the King.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was worth the ticket price. To me it took some of the best parts from the Thomas Crown Affair and Indiana Jones to make a really enjoyable movie."
"ryan3443","10","0","1","19 November 2004"," It was great!
","This movie was great from beginning to end! I had read some other reviews where it said this movie was too long. Too long--are you crazy! I never was bored for a second. The acting and the story line were just wonderful! I loved the riddles for finding the treasure and how they figured them out. I also loved the scenery of the cities (Washington, D.C., New York City, Philadelphia). There was humor, adventure and suspense. It was very well-done. I honestly had no idea how the story would end. I know how I wanted it to end, but wasn't sure how it was going to end because it wasn't obvious (which made it exciting)! I left the movie with a good feeling, which is so important to me. It was wonderful!!"
"twigboy4lf","10","0","1","19 November 2004"," AWESOME!
","Not only was this the funniest movie I have seen all year (sorry Will Ferrell), it was the best. The previews did not give this movie its due. This had action, comedy, Nick Cage, and a hot blonde chick too. The plot was cool. The twists were cool. Hell, it was filmed in my home city, whats not to like. It started off a little (tiny) cheesy, but after the whole grandfather/kid scene, it was great. I don't want to give anything away, but trust me, you won't be disappointed. Its an 11 out of 10, 5 stars kind of awesome. I don't know if I can wait to buy it on DVD, I may have to go see this again. BEST ACTION MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"
"kolb49","10","0","1","18 November 2004"," keep telling the truth till it becomes fiction
","Our Founding Fathers were Right when drawing a map to the Treasure, But it was not on the back of the Declaration of Independence or even invisible unless you want it to be. You see the treasure I am speaking of is U.S. (us) The Freedom we delivered ourselves. I am a Senior DeMolay and as was he a Grand Marshal for the Knights Templar's which had its origins in Masonry. As to the Symbols I can't get into too much as time is limited here, But I find the timing of this Movie as the World we live in now as our Freedom dwindling, i.e. Prayer, abortion, marriage, taxes and even corporations takeover as well as gas price hikes it certainly isn't a pretty picture, but My head is high as declaring Independence in oneself and helping others is the key thanks for reading.<br/><br/>R.S.K."
"bethieb","3","0","1","18 November 2004"," what a waste of Nicolas Cage
","I've been a fan of his work for literally decades. He's obviously a very fine actor. He often makes good, challenging film choices. This was not a great choice of a film. The acting (not just Mr. Cage's) was quite good, definitely a couple of interesting casting choices; and the travelogue aspect was interesting, but where was the action/adventure? <br/><br/>We've come to expect so much more in film-making. This felt like a real step backward. The music did not add anything useful to the movie-going experience. <br/><br/>I'm glad that I saw it on a free pass. I'd have been upset if I'd paid to see this."
"dmasursky","Null","0","1","17 November 2004"," Ignore the lousy marketing campaign and go see this movie
","I saw this movie at a preview showing in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. We're all psyched because for once Philly looks good in a movie. Anyway, I wouldn't have bothered to see this movie because the previews make it look like a dumb Indiana Jones ripoff, but it turns out to be a watchable popcorn flick with some good acting, some funny lines, and a pretty involving plot. Yes, of course, it's utterly contrived and unbelievable. But it's a fun way to spend two hours of your time and movies can still be good just for that, right? Plus my friend and I agreed that Nic is still The Man and so easy on the eyes. And for the guys, you get a nice shot of Diane Kruger's cleavage, so it's not a total waste. And if you're not careful, you might learn a couple things about U.S. history that you've forgotten since high school, which is almost as subversive as something Kubrick could cook up. It won't be featured much during award season, but you should still check it out."
"blu-dude","5","0","1","17 November 2004"," Holiday Cheese from Jerry Bruckheimer
","Like most Jerry Bruckheimer productions, National Treasure is an exciting movie with a really bad script. The majority of the film's attempts at humor fall flat, and the plot doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. For every two good moments, there is one really awful one. See it at a bargain matinÃ©e, and you may be entertained.<br/><br/>One interesting note: there is not one single obscenity uttered in the entire film. Combine that with the lack of graphic violence, and you have an action/adventure film the whole family can see and enjoy. Just imagine how good this could have been if Pixar had produced it.<br/><br/>**1/2 (on a scale of zero to five)."
"acoschigano","10","0","1","16 November 2004"," An Excellent Movie for the Entire Family
","It was so refreshing to see a movie full of action yet missing all of the filth that most producers think is necessary. There was no cussing and no sex and the movie was incredible! The movie keeps your interest through excitement and suspense. I'm taking my children and my parents to see this when it is released to the public. I want to thank Director Jon Turteltaub and the writers Jim Kouf and Cormac Wibberley for believing in the family again. Thanks to Walt Disney Pictures for releasing a movie that a family can attend together. It's nice to be able to see a movie that introduces history to our children with enthusiasm and passion that isn't portrayed through nudity. Thanks to all for a great movie! This is one to see at the theater and to purchase."
"BamBam11","10","0","1","10 November 2004"," I liked it
","Saw it last night and I really liked it. There is a good amount of action and things going on through out the movie to keep me interested the whole time. No spots where I wanted to fall asleep like most movies I have seen lately. Everybody cheered at the end of the movie (though that might not give you much of an idea if they really liked it or not because most of the people in the crowd worked on it). My friend's dad wrote some of the movie and he writes mostly comedies so there is a little bit of comedy through out the movie too. The acting was pretty well done. Don't know what else to say about it right now except I highly recommend it. I think that people of all ages will like this movie."
